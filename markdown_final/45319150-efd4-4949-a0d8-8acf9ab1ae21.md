## Question

Treatment of sustained vt in 78 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia in a 78-year-old patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and immediate cardioversion thresholds. Then, I should verify diagnostic confirmation with a wide-complex tachycardia algorithm and a 12-lead ECG during VT. Next, I will consider reversible causes and substrate, followed by acute pharmacologic versus electrical strategies for stable VT, including when to escalate. After that, I need to address electrical storm management, long-term secondary prevention with ICD decision-making and life expectancy, antiarrhythmic suppression, ICD programming principles, and the role and timing of catheter ablation in older adults. Finally, I should ensure dosing, drug–drug interactions, and age-specific risks are accounted for while cross-checking each step against high-credibility guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the hemodynamic status and immediate actions because this determines everything downstream; if the patient is hypotensive, in shock, has chest pain, altered mental status, or pulmonary edema, synchronized direct-current cardioversion (DCCV) is first-line and should not be delayed by drugs, and I should document a 12‑lead ECG during tachycardia when feasible to confirm VT versus SVT with aberrancy while preparing for DCCV, recognizing that DCCV remains the priority in the unstable patient [^112Qt4pK] [^116vj1hT].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach in a tolerated wide-QRS tachycardia before jumping into drugs; I should obtain a 12‑lead ECG during the arrhythmia, consider adenosine or vagal maneuvers only if SVT with aberrancy is suspected and the rhythm is regular, and explicitly avoid IV verapamil in undifferentiated broad-complex tachycardia to prevent hemodynamic collapse, which is particularly risky in older adults with possible structural heart disease [^112aMQQY] [^112Bu33B] [^116hbBz6].

> Next, I should review reversible triggers and the substrate; I need to check for acute ischemia and correct electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium, evaluate for structural heart disease by echocardiography, and note that torsades or polymorphic VT mandates IV magnesium and potassium repletion with heart rate support using isoproterenol or overdrive pacing for acquired long QT, whereas monomorphic VT often reflects scar-related reentry in ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy in this age group [^114X6utR] [^115FpE1U] [^112aMQQY].

> For hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic VT, I need to choose the most effective and safe pharmacologic termination strategy while preparing for potential deterioration; I almost said amiodarone should be first-line here, but hold on, I should double-check the comparative evidence — AHA/ACC/HRS gives IV procainamide a stronger recommendation than amiodarone for stable VT, and systematic reviews suggest procainamide (and sotalol or ajmaline in older data) outperform lidocaine, with amiodarone showing relatively modest acute termination rates, so procainamide 20–50 mg/min up to 17 mg/kg with BP and QT monitoring is reasonable if available and not contraindicated, while amiodarone or IV sotalol are alternatives with careful hemodynamic and QT surveillance in older adults [^111Kr3u6] [^116uQGc7] [^117QNhyh] [^1156c25q].

> Hmm, wait a minute, even in hemodynamically tolerated sustained monomorphic VT, direct cardioversion may be preferred if sedation risk is low; the ESC 2022 guideline explicitly recommends DCCV as first-line for tolerated SMVT when feasible, and emergency literature reinforces that DCCV is the most efficacious acute strategy, so I should not let a drug trial delay prompt cardioversion if there is any instability or high risk of decompensation in this 78‑year‑old with likely limited cardiac reserve [^113BP66J] [^113mkpVo].

> Let me consider the risk of pharmacologic deterioration and ensure readiness to escalate; amiodarone bolus has a lower-than-expected early termination rate and a nontrivial risk of hypotension necessitating emergent DCCV, so continuous monitoring with pads on, immediate DCCV availability, and planning for sedation or anesthesia are critical steps while attempting drug therapy in a frail older patient [^113CRgbA].

> I will now examine management of electrical storm or recurrent recalcitrant VT; I should administer nonselective beta-blockade combined with IV amiodarone in structural heart disease unless contraindicated, consider IV propranolol 1–3 mg as needed for sympathetic surge, escalate to deep sedation or even intubation for refractory adrenergic drive, and evaluate mechanical circulatory support and autonomic modulation, including cardiac sympathetic denervation, when storms are refractory to drugs and ablation is ineffective or not immediately possible [^116qJHxU] [^115zaCWF] [^114yYxpp] [^113p8scf] [^112T5xDR] [^115zEw3P].

> Next, I should review secondary prevention with ICDs; any patient with sustained VT and structural heart disease generally has a Class I indication for an ICD if expected meaningful survival exceeds one year, and age 78 alone is not a contraindication; I need to weigh comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences carefully, and I should note that ESC 2022 advises assessing ICD need even when a potentially correctable cause is present rather than assuming risk is eliminated [^113S7gf1] [^113qTkJJ] [^1173zBL7] [^114TGdxx].

> But wait, what if the patient is temporarily ineligible for an ICD due to infection or early post-MI timing; I should consider a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator as a bridge in secondary prevention scenarios where the definitive device is deferred, with re-evaluation once the contraindication resolves [^11287gEP] [^116VK1uA] [^114TgqnN].

> For long-term suppression of recurrent VT or shocks after ICD implantation, I need to ensure a maximally tolerated beta-blocker baseline and then consider amiodarone or sotalol when recurrences persist despite optimal device programming; I should confirm amiodarone loading and maintenance per labeling, monitor for thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary, ocular, and neurologic toxicity, and adjust interacting drugs like warfarin and digoxin, while in renal impairment and prolonged QT I must be cautious with sotalol in a 78‑year‑old [^115gncmd] [^115dG9eE] [^11196jec].

> Hold on, I should verify ICD programming principles because they affect shocks and quality of life; at least one ATP therapy should be programmed in all tachyarrhythmia zones in structural heart disease, the ESC primary prevention threshold of setting the slowest therapy zone at or above 188 bpm does not automatically apply to secondary prevention where zones should capture the patient's documented VT rate, and I need to avoid overly long detection intervals that risk therapy exhaustion in the setting of SVT overlap and recurrent VT within a single prolonged episode [^116ujzP5] [^112X2Ctf] [^114JjEnk].

> Let me now consider catheter ablation; in electrical storm due to sustained monomorphic VT refractory to drugs, ablation is recommended, and in recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmic therapy, ablation reduces the composite of death, VT storm, or appropriate ICD shock versus drug escalation in patients on amiodarone as shown in VANISH, with contemporary randomized data also suggesting that ablation as first-line in ischemic cardiomyopathy modestly reduces clinically significant VT outcomes compared with antiarrhythmic drugs over long-term follow-up [^115zescT] [^112waZ1R] [^115ChAtE].

> I should double-check timing in this older patient; the PARTITA trial suggests that early ablation after the first ICD shock in dilated cardiomyopathy reduces death or heart failure hospitalization substantially, and although age increases long-term mortality after VT ablation, procedural risk in experienced centers is acceptable, so earlier referral rather than waiting for multiple shocks is reasonable if functional status is preserved [^117CBEqq] [^116ud3a1].

> For procedural planning, I need to ensure a high-quality 12‑lead VT ECG to guide mapping, anticipate an epicardial approach when the substrate suggests nonendocardial circuits, and use adjunctive imaging such as CMR to define scar when feasible; multidisciplinary discussion is prudent in complex substrates or when anesthesia risk is nontrivial in a 78‑year‑old [^112aMQQY] [^112waZ1R] [^113hQcHi].

> Bringing this together for a 78‑year‑old with sustained monomorphic VT, my sequence is to cardiovert immediately if unstable, confirm VT with a 12‑lead and exclude reversible triggers, and in a stable episode either proceed directly to DCCV if sedation risk is low or use IV procainamide preferentially while preparing for DCCV, escalating promptly if deterioration occurs; for storms, combine nonselective beta-blockade with IV amiodarone plus sedation, and consider MCS and autonomic options if refractory; for secondary prevention, place an ICD if expected survival exceeds one year, use a wearable defibrillator if temporarily ineligible, optimize beta-blocker therapy and add amiodarone or sotalol as needed with careful monitoring, program ATP thoughtfully to the patient's VT rate, and refer early for catheter ablation after recurrent VT or shocks, balancing benefits and age-related risks in shared decision-making [^112Qt4pK] [^111Kr3u6] [^113BP66J] [^116qJHxU] [^113S7gf1] [^115gncmd] [^116ujzP5] [^112waZ1R] [^117CBEqq].

---

For a 78-year-old with sustained VT, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is first-line if unstable; if stable, use **IV procainamide or amiodarone** with close monitoring [^112Qt4pK] [^113nXzXR] [^1115ojJn]. After correcting reversible causes, **risk-stratify for ICD** if life expectancy exceeds one year [^113S7gf1] [^113qTkJJ]. Consider **catheter ablation** for recurrent or drug-refractory VT, and tailor therapy to comorbidities and frailty [^112waZ1R] [^1173zBL7].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Immediately assess stability (BP, consciousness, perfusion).
- **ECG monitoring**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia to confirm VT and guide therapy [^112aMQQY].
- **Reversible causes**: Identify and correct ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, and drug toxicity.

---

## Acute management

### Hemodynamically unstable VT

For hemodynamically unstable VT, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is first-line [^112Qt4pK], and use **mild-to-moderate sedation** to reduce sympathetic tone and distress [^116gKLtc].

---

### Hemodynamically stable VT

- **IV procainamide**: Preferred for tolerated sustained monomorphic VT, especially with structural heart disease [^113nXzXR].
- **IV amiodarone**: Alternative when diagnosis is uncertain or procainamide is contraindicated [^1115ojJn].
- **IV lidocaine**: Consider for ischemic heart disease or polymorphic VT.
- **IV beta-blockers**: Use for polymorphic VT due to ischemia or recurrent VT/VF after MI [^116phQV5] [^113suZCE].

---

## Long-term management and secondary prevention

### Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)

For implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, **secondary prevention** is indicated for sustained VT not due to reversible causes when expected survival is > 1 year [^113S7gf1] [^113qTkJJ]; in the **elderly**, decisions should be individualized based on comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences [^1173zBL7].

---

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy

Amiodarone or sotalol can be used to suppress **recurrent VT or ICD shocks** despite optimal programming and beta-blockers [^115dG9eE] [^115gncmd]. Monitoring should include vigilance for **proarrhythmia, bradycardia, and organ toxicity**, especially in the elderly.

---

### Catheter ablation

For catheter ablation, **indications** include recurrent VT despite drugs, electrical storm, or drug intolerance [^1148CuLJ]. Outcomes include reducing **VT burden and ICD shocks**, with consideration for earlier referral in elderly patients with comorbidities.

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Therapy should be tailored to **comorbidities, frailty, cognitive function, and patient preferences** [^1173zBL7]. With medications, **start low and go slow**, monitoring closely for adverse effects. Engage in shared decision-making to discuss risks, benefits, and goals of care with patients and families.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor for recurrence, drug side effects, and device function.
- **ICD programming**: Optimize with multiple detection zones and anti-tachycardia pacing [^116vZtMs] [^116ujzP5].
- **Patient education**: Teach symptom recognition and when to seek care.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamically unstable VT | Immediate synchronized cardioversion |
| Hemodynamically stable VT | IV procainamide or amiodarone |
| Recurrent VT or ICD shocks | Amiodarone or sotalol |
| Drug-refractory or recurrent VT | Catheter ablation |
| Secondary prevention | ICD implantation if survival > 1 year |

---

Management of sustained VT in a 78-year-old requires **rapid stabilization**, correction of reversible causes, and individualized long-term therapy that balances efficacy with comorbidities and patient preferences.

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^112waZ1R]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

For patients presenting with VT despite AAD therapy, which often results in ICD therapies such as shocks or ATP, therapeutic options include escalating AAD therapy by increasing the dose, changing the drug, adding a new drug, and catheter ablation. The VANISH trial compared the strategies of escalating AAD therapy according to a predefined protocol versus catheter ablation in 259 patients and followed them for a mean (± standard deviation [SD]) of 27.9 ± 17.1 months.

The composite primary endpoint of death, VT storm, or appropriate ICD shock was reduced by catheter ablation. Benefit was observed in the subgroup on amiodarone at baseline, for whom escalated drug therapy was an increase in amiodarone or an addition of mexiletine (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38–0.80; p = 0.001), but not in the subgroup of patients who were on sotalol at baseline, for whom escalation of drug therapy was initiation of amiodarone (HR 1.14; 95% CI 0.65–2.02; p = 0.64). Further analysis found that catheter ablation was markedly superior to the addition of mexiletine in a small subgroup of patients with VT refractory to high dose (≥ 300 mg daily) amiodarone. There were no procedure-related deaths.

In addition to the VANISH trial described above, three large, prospective, multicenter cohort studies have examined the role of catheter ablation in reducing reVT in patients with IHD, most of whom had reVT despite AAD therapy. In these trials, the patient served as his/her own control, and VT episodes were reported for the six months before and the six months after ablation.

### Best clinical practice: Emergency medicine management of stable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia [^113mkpVo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation are the causes of approximately 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. VT is classified based on hemodynamic status and appearance. The treatment of stable, monomorphic VT is controversial.

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an evidence-based review of the medical management of stable, monomorphic VT. Stable, monomorphic VT is part of a larger class of ventricular dysrhythmias defined by a rate of at least 120 beats/min with QRS > 120 ms without regularly occurring P:QRS association. Little controversy exists for the treatment of hemodynamically unstable VT, while the medical management of hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT remains controversial.

Direct cardioversion is the most efficacious. Guidelines for the treatment of stable VT from the American Heart Association provide a IIa recommendation for procainamide, compared with a IIb recommendation for both amiodarone and sotalol. Studies evaluating procainamide, lidocaine, amiodarone, and sotalol suffer from poor design, differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, small sample sizes, and outcome determination. Procainamide demonstrates the greatest efficacy. If procainamide is selected, a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg at 50–100 mg/min intravenously over 10–20 minutes should be provided, with monitoring of blood pressure and electrocardiogram. Monomorphic VT with acute myocardial ischemia requires further study.

Optimal management of stable, monomorphic VT includes direct cardioversion.

### Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in structurally normal hearts: Indications, strategies, and outcomes — part I [^1145EHRy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is being increasingly performed; yet, there is often confusion regarding indications, outcomes, and how to identify those patient populations most likely to benefit. The management strategy differs between those with structural heart disease and those without. For the former, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is typically required due to an elevated risk for sudden cardiac death, and catheter ablation can be used as adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent repetitive ICD therapies. In contrast, VT or premature ventricular contractions in the setting of a structurally normal heart carry a low risk for sudden cardiac death; accordingly, there is typically no indication for an ICD. In these patients, catheter ablation is considered for symptom management or to treat tachycardiomyopathy and is potentially curative. Here, the authors discuss the pathophysiology, mechanism, and management of VT that occurs in the setting of a structurally normal heart and the role of catheter ablation.

### V-a-a-v activation sequence at the onset of a long RP tachycardia: what is the mechanism [^112mxWvx]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old woman with a history of multiple episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia underwent electrophysiologic studies and a catheter ablation procedure. The 12-lead electrocardiogram during tachycardia showed a long RP tachycardia with negative P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. At baseline, dual atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoatrial (VA) nodal conduction was elicited by atrial and ventricular premature stimulation.

During intravenous administration of isoproterenol, the earliest site of atrial activation during ventricular pacing was observed near the His bundle, and a previously recorded narrow QRS tachycardia was reproducibly induced by premature or rapid ventricular apical pacing, with an initial V-A-A-V activation sequence. During the tachycardia, the HA and AH intervals measured 71 and 342 milliseconds, respectively, and the earliest atrial activation was recorded at the ostium of the coronary sinus (CS).

The earliest first "A" of the initial "V-A-A-V" activation sequence was recorded in the His bundle region, reflecting conduction over a fast pathway (FP), as was observed during ventricular pacing, while the second "A" was recorded near the CS ostium, as was observed during the tachycardia. The interval between the first and second "A" was often shorter than the subsequent tachycardia cycle length. Premature ventricular stimuli delivered during tachycardia while the His bundle was refractory did not reset the atrial cycle. From these observations, what is the mechanism of tachycardia?

### Implantable defibrillators in primary prevention of genetic arrhythmias: A shocking choice [^116XbHyU]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Many previously unexplained life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young individuals are now recognized to be genetic in nature. They are ascribed to a growing number of distinct inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and short QT syndrome.

Because of their lower frequency compared to coronary disease, risk factors for SCD are not very precise in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. As randomized studies are generally non-feasible and may even be ethically unjustifiable, especially in the presence of effective therapies, the risk assessment of malignant arrhythmic events — such as SCD, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions, or ICD therapy on fast VT/VF to guide ICD implantation — is based on observational data and expert consensus.

This document reviews risk factors for SCD and indications for ICD implantation and additional therapies. A concerning trend has emerged, which involves creating and using semi-automated systems such as risk scores, risk calculators, and, to some extent, even guidelines to dictate therapeutic choices. The common denominator of these systems is a tendency to favor ICD implantation, sometimes with justification and sometimes without it. This contrasts with the traditional approach…

### An unusual cause of sustained ventricular tachycardia in a 27-year-old man [^116XtVGX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

We present an interesting, unusual, and complex case of a young man who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis and later developed malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was made only after histological evidence was paired with his presentation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. In this case, we highlight the challenges faced in the choice of investigations and diagnostic criteria. Additionally, we have identified the difficulties in treatment and long-term management of such a multisystem disorder. Ultimately, by doing so, we hope to encourage clinicians to be aware of making a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.

### A case of late-onset sustained ventricular tachycardia following deployment of Amplatzer-type perimembranous VSD occluder [^114zoyz5]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD) has been widely used worldwide. Despite the high success rate and minimal operative mortality, arrhythmia during and post-operation has been frequently observed. However, sustained ventricular tachycardia following the deployment of an occluder has not been reported. In this present case, we present one rare instance of late-onset sustained ventricular tachycardia, which developed 71 hours after the deployment of an Amplatzer-type occluder for perimembranous VSD (PmVSD) in a 3-year and 5-month-old boy. The sustained ventricular tachycardia was successfully corrected with the administration of lidocaine, amiodarone, and dexamethasone. The recurrence of ventricular tachycardia was not observed in the most recent follow-up at 6 months. In summary, the case indicated that sustained ventricular tachycardia could occur following deployment of an Amplatzer-type occluder for PmVSD, which could be corrected with antiarrhythmic drugs.

### Ventricular tachycardia after initiation of fingolimod [^115dUBoB]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It is well known to cause bradyarrhythmias. We present a 63-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia two weeks after fingolimod initiation. Further evaluation showed that the patient's ventricular tachycardia was most likely secondary to her medication. Medical practitioners need to be aware of such possible life-threatening side effects while using fingolimod.

### Is it safe to program a long tachycardia detection interval [^114JjEnk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is frequently used in patients with "slow" ventricular tachycardia (VT). Hence, the tachycardia detection interval is programmed within the range of the physiologic heart rate, but this may cause serious problems. If a fast VT is converted to sinus tachycardia with a cycle length shorter than the tachycardia detection interval, the episode is not terminated, and the success counter is not reset. If this happens repeatedly, therapies will be exhausted without termination of the episode. If VT recurs within such an episode, it will not be treated.

This report describes a patient who died suddenly in a scenario similar to the one described. Although all documented VT/ventricular fibrillation episodes were terminated by the device, the episode was not terminated because of the ongoing supraventricular tachycardia. Therefore, no further therapies were available, and the patient probably died of fast untreated VT. Programming a long tachycardia detection interval is dangerous in currently available ICDs.

- **Diagnosis**: Sustained ventricular tachycardia possibly owing to thalidomide treatment.

- **Management**: Thalidomide withdrawal, dexamethasone maintenance therapy, monthly oral courses of combined melphalan and prednisone, salvage therapy with bortezomib.

### Intravenous amiodarone for the pharmacological termination of haemodynamically-tolerated sustained ventricular tachycardia: Is bolus dose amiodarone an appropriate first-line treatment [^113CRgbA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the efficacy of bolus dose intravenous amiodarone for the pharmacological termination of haemodynamically-tolerated sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), a retrospective case series was conducted. This series included consecutive emergency admissions with haemodynamically-tolerated sustained monomorphic VT administered bolus dose intravenous amiodarone 300 mg, following UK advanced life support practice guidelines.

- **Main outcome measures**: Pharmacological termination rates within 20 minutes and 1 hour, and the incidence of hypotension requiring emergency direct cardioversion (DCCV) during this period.

41 patients (35 men) with a mean (SD) age of 68 (10) years, 85% of whom had ischaemic heart disease and impaired left ventricular function (mean (SD) ejection fraction 0.31 (0.11)), were enrolled in the study. The median VT duration was 70 minutes (range 15–6000), the mean heart rate was 174 (34) bpm, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 112 (22) and 73 (19) mm Hg, respectively. Pharmacological VT termination occurred within 20 minutes in 6 of 41 patients (15%; 95% CI 7% to 29%), and within 1 hour in 12 of 41 patients (29%; 95% CI 18% to 45%). Haemodynamic deterioration requiring emergency DCCV occurred in 7 of 41 patients (17%; 95% CI 8% to 32%).

Although advocated by advanced life support guidelines, bolus dose intravenous amiodarone was relatively ineffective for acutely terminating haemodynamically-tolerated sustained monomorphic VT, with a significant incidence of haemodynamic destabilization requiring emergency DCCV.

### A 52-year-old woman with ventricular tachycardia [^1158nTa1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old woman with shortness of breath and palpitations was referred to a cardiologist. A 24-hour Holter monitor demonstrated a high density (37%) of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and long runs of non-sustained (eventually sustained) monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), which had the same morphology as several VPBs detected in a 12-lead ECG. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, and the patient's evaluation was completed with a functional and gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular MR (CMR) study to assess structural heart disease. During a follow-up visit, an electrophysiological study (EPS) was conducted to identify the origin of VPBs and VT.

### Slow ventricular tachycardia in a 91-year-old man with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and acute respiratory failure [^111gytTh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Slow ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with devices such as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is more common than in the rest of the population. The incidence in elderly patients with an ICD remains largely unknown. In younger patients, slow VT is generally asymptomatic or associated with limited clinical relevance. It may be efficiently and safely terminated by anti-tachycardia pacing.

We present a case of slow VT in a 91-year-old man with ICD with type 1 acute respiratory failure and drowsiness. Very elderly patients who have poor cardiac reserve and minor deterioration in cardiac function can face serious consequences such as ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. The persistent ventricular rhythm may have a deleterious effect on their haemodynamic status, with potential aggravation of symptoms of heart failure and further impairment of ventricular function.

### Initial clinical experience with the new irrigated tip magnetic catheter for ablation of scar-related sustained ventricular tachycardia: a small case series [^114SHAEJ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

A remote magnetic navigation system (MNS) has been used with a nonirrigated magnetic catheter for ablation of some supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, the irrigated tip catheter has not been evaluated.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the newly available irrigated tip magnetic catheter for radiofrequency ablation (RF) of electrical storm due to scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with ischemic heart disease.

- **Methods**: Between January and March 2008, a total of 4 consecutive patients (4 men, mean age 67.7 years) with electrical storm who had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator underwent radiofrequency ablation using a remote MNS and the new magnetic irrigated catheter.

- **Results**: Five ablation procedures were performed in study patients. Acute success, defined as noninducibility of any monomorphic VT, was obtained in 3 patients. In 1 patient, a nonclinical VT remained inducible. A monomorphic VT corresponding to clinical VT with the median (range) cycle length of 485 (440–580) ms was induced in all patients. The duration of ablation was 2,273 (985–3087) seconds, with median total procedure and fluoroscopy times of 135 (100–150) minutes and 6.5 (5–9) minutes, respectively. One recurrence occurred 1 week after ablation, which was ablated successfully in the second session. No complication was observed after ablation. During mean follow-up of 4.2 months, all patients were in sinus rhythm, received no ICD therapy, and no mortality occurred.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: What's new [^115ktvuH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years, leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use.

In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Clinical presentation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia without cardiac arrest [^114K9noS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The study cohort included 168 patients: 59 with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 109 with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Patients with VT were older (68.8 ± 13.6 versus 52.6 ± 16.8 years; P < 0.001) and more often male (94.9% versus 37.6%; P < 0.001) compared with patients with SVT. Additionally, those in the VT group had impaired left ventricular function (37 ± 11% versus 59 ± 2%; P < 0.001) and more commonly experienced comorbidities. Overall, considering both VT and SVT together, a statistically significant symptomatology difference was noted between sexes. Specifically, 90% of women versus 42.1% of men reported palpitations as their presenting symptom. In a logistic regression analysis, there was no interaction between the presence of VT and sex (P = 0.471).

### Treatment of persistent ventricular tachycardia: Drugs or ablation [^111jPUVm]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce the mortality risk associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can frequently terminate VT episodes painlessly, but do not prevent recurrences. For patients with symptomatic recurrences, frequent asymptomatic recurrences, ICD shocks, or VT storm, most clinicians recommend strategies to suppress VT. The proarrhythmic mortality risk of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) may be mitigated by the presence of an ICD, but these medications are limited by high recurrence rates and unfavorable side effect profiles. Catheter ablation is an alternative or adjunctive option, but it is also limited by incomplete efficacy and procedural risk.

### A 54-year-old woman with premature ventricular complexes and a rapidly changing ECG [^113VZ8wM]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common findings in asymptomatic participants during ECG recordings. While most PVCs are treated conservatively, some patients may develop adverse cardiac events needing further investigations and definitive ablation by radiofrequency. Spectral strain ultrasonography has demonstrated ventricular dysfunction as a sequel to high burden PVCs, but the exact underlying pathophysiology is still uncertain. Cohort studies have associated PVCs with increased risks for overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet consensus is still lacking for threshold in treating PVCs. Our case is that of a 54-year-old woman with an unusual bradycardiac presentation of PVCs and an ECG that changed rapidly within minutes.

### Ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a 78-year-old woman with essential thrombocythaemia [^111m3UBe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor used in the treatment of essential thrombocythaemia. Cardiovascular side effects, such as ventricular tachycardia and cardiomyopathy, are rare but potentially fatal, and should be communicated to patients before starting the medication. These side effects usually arise within the first six months after the initiation of therapy and may be dose-related. The elderly population is particularly susceptible.

These cardiotoxic effects result from an increase in cyclic AMP, which induces positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, and are often reversible with the cessation of use. We report a case of a 78-year-old woman with essential thrombocythaemia, recently started on anagrelide, who presented with syncope, multiple bruises, and facial trauma, and was found to have developed ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### Catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs for ventricular tachycardia [^115ChAtE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia and ischemic cardiomyopathy are at high risk for adverse outcomes. Catheter ablation is commonly used when antiarrhythmic drugs do not suppress ventricular tachycardia. Whether catheter ablation is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs as a first-line therapy in patients with ventricular tachycardia is uncertain.

- **Methods**: In an international trial, we randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio patients with previous myocardial infarction and clinically significant ventricular tachycardia (defined as ventricular tachycardia storm, receipt of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD] shock or antitachycardia pacing, or sustained ventricular tachycardia terminated by emergency treatment) to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy or to undergo catheter ablation. All the patients had an ICD. Catheter ablation was performed within 14 days after randomization; sotalol or amiodarone was administered as antiarrhythmic drug therapy according to prespecified criteria. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from any cause during follow-up or, more than 14 days after randomization, ventricular tachycardia storm, appropriate ICD shock, or sustained ventricular tachycardia treated by medical intervention.

- **Results**: A total of 416 patients were followed for a median of 4.3 years. A primary endpoint event occurred in 103 of 203 patients (50.7%) assigned to catheter ablation and in 129 of 213 (60.6%) assigned to drug therapy (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P = 0.03).

### Direct clinical effects of cardiac radioablation in the treatment of a patient with therapy-refractory ventricular tachycardia storm [^1153iizC]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The patient was admitted 10 days later to a secondary hospital with a subsequent VT storm and was eventually transferred to our academic hospital for further treatment via a tertiary referral hospital. During VT, the patient was hypotensive, necessitating external electrical cardioversions. A repeat diagnostic work-up did not reveal new triggers.

Over the course of hospitalization, the patient received several combinations of high-dose antiarrhythmic drugs, including high-dose intravenous amiodarone, multiple beta-blockers, mexiletine, and quinidine, all of which proved ineffective in preventing VT. Antibiotic therapy was initiated because the patient became septic, potentially due to a peripherally inserted central catheter. Blood cultures soon revealed a Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and antibiotics were adjusted accordingly.

Although physical examination, echocardiography, and a positron emission tomography using 18Ffluoro-deoxyglucose/x-ray computed tomography scan ([18 F]FDG-PET/CT) with an endocarditis protocol (including preparation with a carbohydrate-free diet for 24 hours, fasting for 12 hours, and an intravenous infusion of heparin 15 minutes before [18 F]FDG-administration) showed no signs of endocarditis, antibiotics were continued in a high enough dose to treat endocarditis because of the recent CRT-D implantation and lower diagnostic yield of the FDG-PET scan during antibiotic therapy while the patient was critically ill. An urgent catheter ablation was considered; however, the apical thrombus was still present despite adequate anticoagulation.

### Electroanatomical mapping-guided endocardial and epicardial ablation of sustained ventricular tachycardia originating from alcohol septal ablation-induced scar in a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^113hQcHi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old female developed two different ventricular tachycardias (VTs) five years after undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

- **Ventricular tachycardia 1**: This was a small macroreentry at the anterior border of the low-voltage zone, suggesting the ASA-scar. It was eliminated by endocardial ablation at a site recording fractionated potentials covering the mid-diastolic and presystolic periods.

- **Ventricular tachycardia 2**: This was a focal VT, eliminated by epicardial cryoablation at the basal posterior left ventricle, suggesting the posterior border of the ASA-scar.

Using electroanatomical mapping, we demonstrated that the mechanism of the VTs was reentry at the edge of the ASA-scar.

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^11552yQB]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), recurrent ventricular tachycardia (reVT) or frequent appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions for ventricular tachycardia (VT) can occur despite the use of multiple anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapies, including amiodarone and sotalol. Catheter ablation has demonstrated an acceptable acute success rate, and over time, with the development of different techniques such as substrate vs. conventional mapping, and approaches like endocardial, epicardial, or combined endo-epicardial, it has reduced recurrence rates and appropriate ICD interventions. The writing committee suggested that earlier consideration could be given to ablation, as opposed to further AAD therapy, in centers with specific expertise in ventricular arrhythmia ablation in ARVC, including epicardial access. Reference should also be made to the 2019 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Evaluation, Risk Stratification, and Management of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy.

In patients with ARVC, scar location is heterogeneous based on the chamber, primarily right ventricular dominant but can involve the left ventricle, the number of foci, and depth (epicardial and/or endocardial). Over time, the need for repeat catheter ablation is common due to the scar location, and an epicardial approach is often necessary. Long-term freedom from ventricular arrhythmia is achieved in approximately one-third of patients with an endocardial approach. An endocardial approach followed by an epicardial ablation, if the patient remains inducible for VT, may avoid unnecessary epicardial access and associated procedural risks. However, strong consideration should be given to performing the procedure in a setting where it is possible to proceed to epicardial access if necessary.

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^113Q82mt]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

- **Ventricular tachycardia in Chagas cardiomyopathy**: Sustained ventricular tachycardia is usually due to reentry, associated with an inferolateral left ventricular scar in over 70% of patients. Occasionally, endocardial radiofrequency ablation can result in transmural injury, effectively treating all portions of the myocardium involved in the arrhythmia circuit. However, scars commonly exist intramyocardially and/or subepicardially in an area with an associated thick layer of subendocardial myocardium. Mapping and ablation from the epicardial surface is performed in up to 40% of patients. A myocardial isthmus of surviving tissue between the inferolateral left ventricular scar and the mitral valve annulus can be involved in a macroreentrant submitral circuit, as has been described for postinfarction ventricular tachycardias. Bundle branch reentry can occur but is unusual. In Chagas cardiomyopathy that presents with ventricular tachycardia storms, cardiac sympathetic denervation can reduce ventricular tachycardia episodes and is a potentially valuable treatment option.

- **Epicardial ablation of sustained ventricular tachycardia in Chagas heart disease**: The prevalence of epicardial ventricular tachycardia origins in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy is high (approximately 37%). Electrograms obtained during epicardial mapping from the areas giving rise to ventricular tachycardia are similar to those observed for other scar-related ventricular tachycardias, including delayed potentials, mid-diastolic potentials, and continuous electrical activity during ventricular tachycardia. The critical isthmus of the reentrant circuit can be confirmed by entrainment maneuvers or interruption of ventricular tachycardia with radiofrequency ablation. With the progressive nature of the disease, ventricular tachycardia recurrences are common.

### Clinical presentation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia without cardiac arrest [^115ey4xK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This prospective study was conducted between January 2012 and September 2019 at the Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. Patients presenting with a first event of sustained tachycardia of regular rhythm were studied. The study group consisted of consecutive patients presenting with a first event of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) without cardiac arrest. They were compared with consecutive patients presenting with a sustained, regular, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), including atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentry, and atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. We studied only "naïve" patients — i.e. patients with a first event of sustained regular tachyarrhythmia — to avoid potential "indoctrination" of specific terminology for our patients' description of their symptoms during previous encounters with physicians at our center or elsewhere.

To be included, the index tachycardia had to last at least 5 minutes. Patients with implanted defibrillators were included only if the arrhythmia was not treated by their device because it was slower than the programmed VT detection rate. Patients in whom a defibrillator was implanted as a "secondary prevention" (i.e. following cardiac arrest) were excluded from the study.

Participating patients were asked to fill in a short anonymous questionnaire describing their symptoms at the time of the event. Data collection included 12‐lead ECG recordings from the time of the event and baseline clinical information.

### Direct clinical effects of cardiac radioablation in the treatment of a patient with therapy-refractory ventricular tachycardia storm [^116uC9mz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

We present the case of a patient with VT storm and incessant VT who experienced direct clinical effects of cardiac radioablation. Therefore, even in patients with therapy-refractory VT storm and incessant VT, cardiac radioablation could be considered as a therapeutic option. The timing of the antiarrhythmic effect further supports the preclinical findings that not only induction of fibrosis but also direct electrophysiological reprogramming may play a key mechanistic role in cardiac radioablation.

### Ten-year outcomes and predictors of mortality following catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia [^116ud3a1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Catheter ablation is the primary treatment option for idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT). It plays a key role in acute therapy of electrical storm, treatment of VTs in patients with structural heart disease (SHD), and can reduce VT burden. Here we report on 10-year clinical outcomes following VT ablation from patients enrolled in the prospective German Ablation Registry.

- **Methods and results**: Long-term follow-up was conducted on 334 patients undergoing VT ablation (118/334, 35%) with structurally normal hearts and 216 out of 334 (65%) with SHD, including 161 out of 216 (75%) with ischemic heart disease at 38 centers. Follow-up was completed in 94.8% of patients. The median observation time was 10.8 (4.3–12.3) years, with a 10-year all-cause mortality rate of 39.4%. VT ablation in patients with SHD was associated with worse outcomes when compared with patients with structurally normal hearts (estimated 10-year mortality for SHD 54.8% versus structurally normal hearts 12.1%). Estimated 10-year mortality following VT ablation was highest in patients with ischemic heart disease (62.4%). Significant predictors of mortality following VT ablation included age (hazard ratio [HR], 2.35 [1.90–2.92] per decade), left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 30% (HR, 2.11 [1.44–3.10]), diabetes (HR, 1.73 [1.14–2.61]), incessant VT (HR, 2.96 [1.74–5.03]), linear lesion (HR, 1.46 [0.99–2.16]), and acute procedural failure (HR, 2.57 [1.39–4.77]). Procedural failure was the only statistically significant predictor for VT recurrence during follow-up (HR, 3.76 [1.59–8.91]).

### Does timing of ventricular tachycardia ablation affect prognosis in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator? Results from the multicenter randomized PARTITA trial [^117CBEqq]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

The PARTITA study, published in 2022 in the journal Circulation, examined the impact of ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation on patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. It addressed diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias. The study posed the question: What is the role of VT ablation in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator?

Conducted as a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT), the study included 47 patients (7 female, 40 male). Inclusion criteria specified patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who received a cardioverter defibrillator shock for VT. Key exclusion criteria included contraindications to transcatheter ablation or antithrombotic therapy and chronic treatment with class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs.

- **Interventions**:
	- VT ablation within 2 months of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock (n = 23)
	- Continuation of standard therapy (n = 24)

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant decrease in the composite outcome of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure (4% vs. 42%; HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.85)

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in death from all causes (0% vs. 33%; ARD -33, 95% CI -55.44 to -10.56)
	- Significant decrease in recurrent VT with shocks (9% vs. 42%; ARD -33, 95% CI -64.39 to -1.61)
	- No significant difference in worsening heart failure hospitalization (4% vs. 17%; ARD -13, 95% CI -31.07 to 5.07)

The study concluded that in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy receiving VT ablation, there was a significant benefit in terms of the composite outcome measures, underscoring the potential importance of VT ablation in this patient population.

### Ventricular tachycardia ablation remains treatment of last resort in structural heart disease: Argument for earlier intervention [^115nyFb9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Despite advances in ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT), recognized toxicity of amiodarone, and potential harm of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks, there appears to be reluctance to pursue catheter ablation.

- **Methods and results**: We tested the hypothesis that patients with structural heart disease and VT are referred late for ablation and may have worse outcomes as a result. Consecutive patients with VT and structural heart disease referred to a single center between January 2008 and April 2009 were studied. Patients with prior VT ablations were excluded. Late referrals were defined as those with two or more episodes of VT, separated by at least one month. Ninety-eight consecutive patients were analyzed. Ninety-six percent of patients had an ICD implanted prior to ablation, 58% were in VT storm, and 67% were either taking ≥ 400 mg daily of amiodarone or were intolerant (10%). Thirty-six patients fit the definition of early referral and 62 of late referral. Overall acute procedural success was achieved in 89%. Amiodarone dose decreased from a mean and median of 559 and 400 mg daily pre-ablation to 98 and 0 post-ablation (P < 0.01). Mean and median VT episodes decreased from 17 and 6 in the month preceding ablation to 1 and 0 in the six months following ablation (P < 0.01). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the early referral group had superior one-year VT free survival (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: VT ablation is frequently reserved for patients receiving recurrent ICD shocks despite high dose amiodarone. Stronger consideration should be given to earlier referral for VT ablation.

### Current treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: State of the art [^115jhNtZ]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias may be benign, requiring only evaluation for associated risks and then reassurance, or they may be associated with a risk of sudden death or significant morbidity. Therapies for these arrhythmias have evolved considerably over the past 20 years. For some, a definitive, curative therapy is available in the form of catheter ablation. Others are best managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator that provides effective arrhythmia termination and protection from sudden death, with antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation to control arrhythmias. Although progress has been substantial, many challenges remain.

### Antidysrhythmic drug therapy for the termination of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: A systematic review [^1156c25q]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to compare the efficacy of different drug therapies for the termination of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

- **Methods**: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases for trials from 1965 through July 2013 using a search strategy based on the following clinical question in PICO format.
	- **Patients**: Adults (≥ 18 years) with stable monomorphic VT.
	- **Intervention**: Intravenous antidysrhythmic drug.
	- **Comparator**: Intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone.
	- **Outcome**: Termination of VT. For all drug comparisons, we calculated relative risks (RR; 95% CI) and number needed to treat (NNT, 95% CI) between drugs. We also evaluated the methodological quality of the studies.

- **Results**: Our search yielded 219 articles from PubMed and 390 articles from EMBASE. Three prospective studies (n = 93 patients) and two retrospective studies (n = 173 patients) met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. From the prospective studies, we found the following relative risks (RR) for VT termination:
	- **Procainamide versus lidocaine**: RR = 3.7 (1.3–10.5)
	- **Ajmaline versus lidocaine**: RR = 5.3 (1.4–20.5)
	- **Sotalol versus lidocaine**: RR = 3.9 (1.3–11.5)

	- **For the retrospective studies**:
	- **Procainamide versus lidocaine**: RR = 2.2 (1.2–4.0)
	- **Procainamide versus amiodarone**: RR = 4.3 (0.8–23.6)

	- All five reviewed studies had quality issues, including potential bias in randomisation and concealment.

- **Conclusions**: Limited available evidence from small heterogeneous human studies suggests that for the treatment of stable, monomorphic VT, procainamide, ajmaline, and sotalol were all superior to lidocaine; amiodarone was not shown to be more effective.

### Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: Terminology, mechanism, diagnosis, and emergency therapy [^115D6cnv]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are contraindicated for another. Yet confusion about terminology — and thus diagnosis and therapy — continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.
