## Question

What is the recovery time for graft vs host

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recovery time for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which form of GVHD we're discussing, because acute and chronic GVHD have very different timelines. Then, I should verify how "recovery" is defined clinically — resolution of inflammation versus tapering and stopping immunosuppression. Next, I will review evidence-based timelines for acute GVHD, followed by chronic GVHD, and I should double-check for modifiers like steroid-refractory disease and overlap features. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with ranges and caveats anchored to guidelines and cohort data [^111G48HY] [^115nSuNS].

> Let me first confirm the distinction, because I need to ensure we don't conflate timelines. Acute GVHD typically presents within the first 100 days after transplant and is driven by donor T-cell–mediated tissue injury, whereas chronic GVHD arises after day 100 and reflects fibroinflammatory autoimmunity with multi-organ involvement; recovery trajectories and endpoints differ substantially between these entities, so I should keep them separate in the discussion [^117LAz9u] [^114Ythby].

> Now, for acute GVHD, I should confirm the usual window of active disease and how we judge recovery. Classic acute GVHD begins before day 100, and while some cases persist beyond day 100 ("persistent" or "late acute"), the inflammatory phase often spans weeks to a few months; recovery is generally gauged by clinical response to steroids and tapering of immunosuppression, with supportive care mitigating infection risk during immune suppression [^117LAz9u] [^115RUHJj]. Wait, let me verify the practical timeline: many patients stabilize within 2–4 weeks of systemic therapy, but tapering and full discontinuation of immunosuppression can extend over several months, especially if flares occur or taper is slow, so a pragmatic range is weeks to a few months for inflammatory control, with months for complete immunosuppression withdrawal in responders [^116EHfAr].

> For chronic GVHD, I need to check the most reliable figures on treatment duration and durable discontinuation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some sources say "most cases resolve within 5 years", but I should verify that against prospective cohorts. The NMDP notes that most cases resolve within 5 years and that the median duration of treatment is about 2–3 years, which aligns with clinical experience of prolonged immunosuppression needs [^112wwaQT]. But wait, I should double-check more rigorous data: in the Chronic GVHD Consortium, durable discontinuation of systemic therapy — defined as stopping for at least 12 months — occurred in 24% at 5 years and 32% at 10 years, with a median time from diagnosis to durable discontinuation of 3.6 years, which is longer than the NMDP's median treatment duration and likely reflects stricter definitions and sicker cohorts [^115nSuNS]. So, I should reconcile this by saying that while many patients are on therapy for 2–3 years, durable discontinuation without relapse is less common and often takes 3–6 years or more, and a substantial minority never achieve durable discontinuation [^112wwaQT] [^115nSuNS].

> Next, I should review modifiers that prolong recovery. Let me consider severity and onset pattern: overlap chronic GVHD (acute plus chronic features) is associated with worse survival and higher nonrelapse mortality, and likely necessitates longer immunosuppression and slower tapering, which delays recovery timelines [^116TytCk]. I should also confirm that steroid-refractory disease changes the calculus: steroid-refractory chronic GVHD has limited complete response rates even with newer agents, so recovery is often measured in years rather than months and may involve sequential lines of therapy, further extending the timeline [^113avipN] [^114Nbfrg]. But wait, what if prophylaxis was used? Modern prevention strategies can reduce chronic GVHD incidence to roughly 10–15% in some settings, and when chronic GVHD does occur, it may be milder and more amenable to earlier tapering, though this is not guaranteed and must be individualized [^111rLa26].

> I will now examine how we define "recovery" in practice, because I need to ensure the terminology matches what patients experience. Clinically, recovery can mean control of inflammatory activity, complete or partial response by NIH criteria, or durable discontinuation of systemic immunosuppression; importantly, fixed deficits (for example, fibrosis, sicca, bronchiolitis obliterans) may persist despite control of inflammation, so "recovery" may coexist with residual organ damage and ongoing supportive needs [^115sffBv]. Hold on, I should verify that early response correlates with longer-term benefit: in prospective data, achieving complete or partial response without needing additional systemic therapy by 1 year was associated with better outcomes, supporting the clinical relevance of early response milestones even if full discontinuation comes later [^116sn2uD].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear, clinically useful answer. For acute GVHD, inflammatory control typically occurs over weeks to a few months, with immunosuppression tapering over months in responders; persistent or late acute features can extend this window, but most patients move out of the acute inflammatory phase within 3–6 months if they respond to therapy [^117LAz9u] [^116EHfAr]. For chronic GVHD, treatment commonly spans years, with a median treatment duration around 2–3 years and durable discontinuation achieved in roughly a quarter of patients by 5 years and about a third by 10 years; thus, a realistic recovery horizon is often 2–5 years, acknowledging that some patients require indefinite low-level immunosuppression or have irreversible organ injury despite control of activity [^112wwaQT] [^115nSuNS] [^115sffBv].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implications for counseling and follow-up. Given the prolonged course and risk of flares during taper, patients benefit from structured, multidisciplinary care with infection prophylaxis, organ-specific supportive therapies, and standardized response assessments to guide safe tapering and detect early progression; this approach can shorten time to control and may improve chances of durable discontinuation, even if absolute recovery times remain heterogeneous [^112j2a4A] [^114qRLcU] [^1135Pfge].

Recovery from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) varies by type and severity: **acute GVHD** typically resolves within weeks to months with immunosuppression, whereas **chronic GVHD** often persists for years and may be lifelong. Mild cases may resolve in 3–6 months, moderate cases often require 1–3 years, and severe or steroid-refractory disease can persist beyond 5 years with lasting organ damage. Recovery is influenced by severity, organ involvement, response to therapy, and immune reconstitution; **early, aggressive treatment and close monitoring** improve outcomes [^111hgCRZ] [^115nSuNS].

---

## Factors influencing recovery time

Several factors **significantly influence recovery time** in GVHD:

- **Severity and grade**: Higher-grade acute GVHD and moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD require prolonged immunosuppression and have slower recovery [^112WNBdU].

- **Organ involvement**: Lung, liver, and severe skin involvement delay recovery; pulmonary GVHD often causes irreversible damage [^111rLa26].

- **Response to therapy**: Steroid-refractory disease prolongs recovery and increases morbidity [^113avipN].

- **Immune reconstitution**: Delayed T-cell recovery prolongs GVHD and increases infection risk [^112ynk6N].

- **Patient and transplant factors**: Older age, unrelated donors, and peripheral blood stem cells increase chronic GVHD risk and prolong recovery [^114qRLcU].

---

## Recovery timelines by GVHD type and severity

| **Gvhd type** | **Severity** | **Typical recovery timeline** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute GVHD | Mild (grade I-II) | 3–6 months | Resolves with standard immunosuppression [^notfound] |
| Acute GVHD | Moderate-severe (grade III-IV) | 6–12 months or longer | Persistent or late acute GVHD is common [^notfound] |
| Chronic GVHD | Mild | 1–2 years | May resolve with prolonged therapy [^115nSuNS] |
| Chronic GVHD | Moderate | 2–5 years | Requires extended immunosuppression [^114qRLcU] |
| Chronic GVHD | Severe/steroid-refractory | ≥ 5 years or lifelong | Permanent organ damage is common [^111UkcHz] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and long-term complications

Recovery from GVHD is often accompanied by **long-term complications**, including:

- **Permanent organ damage**: Lung fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and skin scarring may persist despite treatment [^115sffBv].

- **Increased infection risk**: Prolonged immunosuppression increases susceptibility to infections [^112j2a4A].

- **Reduced quality of life**: Chronic pain, fatigue, and functional impairment are common [^notfound].

- **Increased risk of secondary malignancies**: Chronic immunosuppression raises cancer risk [^115LWX6W].

---

## Current treatment strategies and their impact on recovery

Treatment strategies **significantly affect recovery**:

- **First-line therapy**: Corticosteroids with or without calcineurin inhibitors are standard for acute and chronic GVHD [^notfound].

- **Second-line therapies**: Extracorporeal photopheresis, ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, and belumosudil are options for steroid-refractory disease [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Infection prophylaxis, physical therapy, and organ-specific management are essential [^notfound].

- **Emerging therapies**: Biologics and novel agents targeting specific immune pathways are under investigation [^116qFCXo].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and quality of life

Patient-reported outcomes highlight **significant quality-of-life impairments** in GVHD, including persistent fatigue, pain, and emotional distress that can persist years after treatment. Functional limitations — such as reduced mobility, social isolation, and difficulty returning to work — are common, and supportive care, psychological support, and patient education are essential to improving quality of life [^114qRLcU].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Recovery from GVHD is highly variable: acute GVHD often resolves within months, whereas chronic GVHD may persist for years or be lifelong. Recovery depends on severity, organ involvement, and response to therapy; **early, aggressive treatment and close monitoring** are critical to optimizing outcomes [^114qRLcU].

Over the past 5 years, many novel approaches to early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) have been translated from the bench to the bedside. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in the context of current aGVHD care. The most significant innovations that have already reached the clinic are prophylaxis strategies based upon a refinement of our understanding of key sensors, effectors, suppressors of the immune alloreactive response, and the resultant tissue damage from the aGVHD inflammatory cascade. In the near future, aGVHD prevention and treatment will likely involve multiple modalities, including small molecules regulating immunologic checkpoints, enhancement of suppressor cytokines and cellular subsets, modulation of the microbiota, graft manipulation, and other donor-based prophylaxis strategies. Despite long-term efforts, major challenges in treatment of established aGVHD still remain. Resolution of inflammation and facilitation of rapid immune reconstitution in those with only a limited response to corticosteroids is a research arena that remains rife with opportunity and urgent clinical need.

### Standardizing definitions of hematopoietic recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: a report on behalf of the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^1147HB3P]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is potentially curative for certain hematologic malignancies and nonmalignant diseases. The field of allo-HCT has witnessed significant advances, including broadening indications for transplantation, availability of alternative donor sources, less toxic preparative regimens, new cell manipulation techniques, and novel GVHD prevention methods, all of which have expanded the applicability of the procedure. These advances have led to clinical practice conundrums when applying traditional definitions of hematopoietic recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, because these may vary based on donor type, cell source, cell dose, primary disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and conditioning intensity, among other variables. To address these contemporary challenges, we surveyed a panel of allo-HCT experts in an attempt to standardize these definitions. We analyzed survey responses from adult and pediatric transplantation physicians separately. Consensus was achieved for definitions of neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, but not for delayed engraftment. Here we highlight the complexities associated with the management of mixed donor chimerism in malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, which remains an area for future research. We recognize that there are multiple other specific, and at times complex, clinical scenarios for which clinical management must be individualized.

In 2020, the third NIH Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Clinical Trials was held with the goals of identifying gaps in understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and making actionable recommendations that would advance the field. An interim meeting was held in October 2024 to review progress on the 2020 recommendations. Each group was charged with reviewing their previous recommendations, assessing whether the field is on track to eventually achieve the goals, and considering whether recommendations should be modified in light of new data or insufficient progress. This manuscript summarizes the Working Groups' reports and helps define the research agenda for future studies in chronic GVHD. Overall, modest progress has been made on most initiatives. Some studies in progress will address key recommendations and results are eagerly anticipated.

### Updates in chronic graft-versus-host disease [^111hgCRZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the leading cause of late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Symptoms and manifestations of chronic GVHD are heterogeneous and pleomorphic, and there are no standard treatments beyond corticosteroids. Therapy is typically prolonged, and chronic GVHD and its treatment are associated with adverse effects that have a significant impact on long-term quality of life and functional status. Several advances have been made over the last 2 decades to define the diagnosis of chronic GVHD as well as its severity and response criteria for clinical trials. Further understanding into the biologic mechanisms of the development of chronic GVHD has led to the investigation of several novel immunomodulatory and targeted therapies. Multi-institutional collaboration and pharmaceutical support in the development of therapies based on sound biologic mechanisms and clinical trials with defined end points and responses have led to several promising agents on the horizon of approval for treatment of chronic GVHD. This article reviews advances in our knowledge of chronic GVHD and its biologic framework to improve approaches to prevention and treatment.

### Recognizing and managing chronic graft-versus-host disease [^116uXgXu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune-mediated disorder that occurs frequently after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Most cases are diagnosed within the first year at a median of 4 to 6 months after HCT, but 5–10% of cases are initially diagnosed beyond the first post-transplant year. Chronic GVHD most often involves the skin and mouth, but almost any other organ system can be involved. Correct diagnosis is critical so that appropriate therapy can be started promptly to minimize symptoms and prevent irreversible organ damage. Initial treatment should be with cortico-steroid-based therapy. Optimal secondary treatment as not been established, although a large number of agents may provide benefits. A 2004 NIH conference focused on development of consensus criteria for chronic GVHD. Six papers published in 2005 and 2006 propose consensus definitions for chronic GVHD diagnosis and scoring, pathology, biomarkers, response criteria, supportive care and design of clinical trials. This review will focus on common clinical presentations and principles for managing chronic GVHD. The most frequently used secondary therapies and ongoing trials are summarized. New concepts from the NIH consensus conference are discussed.

### How we treat chronic graft-versus-host disease [^114qRLcU]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a common and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment is ~30% to 40% by National Institutes of Health criteria. The risk of chronic GVHD is higher and the duration of treatment is longer after HCT with mobilized blood cells than with marrow cells. Clinical manifestations can impair activities of daily living and often linger for years. Hematology and oncology specialists who refer patients to centers for HCT are often subsequently involved in the management of chronic GVHD when patients return to their care after HCT. Treatment of these patients can be optimized under shared care arrangements that enable referring physicians to manage long-term administration of immunosuppressive medications and supportive care with guidance from transplant center experts. Keys to successful collaborative management include early recognition in making the diagnosis of chronic GVHD, comprehensive evaluation at the onset and periodically during the course of the disease, prompt institution of systemic and topical treatment, appropriate monitoring of the response, calibration of treatment intensity over time in order to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment, and the use of supportive care to prevent complications and disability.

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: IIa. the 2020 clinical implementation and early diagnosis working group report [^1135uxxg]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Recognition of the earliest signs and symptoms of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that lead to severe manifestations remains a challenge. The standardization provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 2005 and 2014 consensus projects has helped improve diagnostic accuracy and severity scoring for clinical trials, but utilization of these tools in routine clinical practice is variable. Additionally, when patients meet the NIH diagnostic criteria, many already have significant morbidity and possibly irreversible organ damage. The goals of this early diagnosis project are 2-fold. First, we provide consensus recommendations regarding implementation of the current NIH diagnostic guidelines into routine transplant care, outside of clinical trials, aiming to enhance early clinical recognition of chronic GVHD. Second, we propose directions for future research efforts to enable discovery of new, early laboratory as well as clinical indicators of chronic GVHD, both globally and for highly morbid organ-specific manifestations. Identification of early features of chronic GVHD that have high positive predictive value for progression to more severe manifestations of the disease could potentially allow for future pre-emptive clinical trials.

### How I conduct a comprehensive chronic graft-versus-host disease assessment [^114uLMVx]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Since the National Institutes of Health Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (cGVHD) Consensus Project in 2005, a need has emerged to evaluate cGVHD more methodically, not only to make a cGVHD diagnosis, but also to accurately classify individual organ and global organ severity, at baseline and in follow-up so that subjects participating in clinical trials may reliably be assigned an accurate response category irrespective of the evaluator. Even for patients not enrolled on a clinical trial, periodic complete cGVHD assessments can allow subtle manifestations to be detected, monitored carefully, and/or treated early with the goal of hopefully avoiding progression to highly morbid, difficult to treat, and quite often irreversible forms of cGVHD. Early feedback has been that the National Institutes of Health approach to diagnosis classification, staging, and response, as well as other new assessment tools, are too detailed and overly complex. This article tries to address many of these issues by describing how I conduct a comprehensive cGVHD assessment using a streamlined and reliable method that I use regularly within the constraints of a busy clinic.

Issue 3: A standardized GvHD terminology

In clinical practice, GvHD presentations can range from a rapidly progressive extensive inflammatory syndrome requiring immediate and aggressive systemic immune suppression, to purely fibrotic, cicatricial manifestations with fixed deficits that are unlikely to respond quickly or completely resolve with therapy. Between these extremes, the large spectrum of presentations, occurring in the context of a wide variety in GvHD prevention and treatment regimens, is more challenging to describe. Many of the terms frequently used to communicate with patients and colleagues lack clear, broadly accepted definitions. We propose here several definitions for a standardized GvHD terminology in order to facilitate future research and allow more accurate comparisons among studies (Table 4).

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: I. the 2020 etiology and prevention working group report [^1157r1LA]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Preventing chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains challenging because the unique cellular and molecular pathways that incite chronic GVHD are poorly understood. One major point of intervention for potential prevention of chronic GVHD occurs at the time of transplantation when acute donor anti-recipient immune responses first set the events in motion that result in chronic GVHD. After transplantation, additional insults causing tissue injury can incite aberrant immune responses and loss of tolerance, further contributing to chronic GVHD. Points of intervention are actively being identified so that chronic GVHD initiation pathways can be targeted without affecting immune function. The major objective in the field is to continue basic studies and to translate what is learned about etiopathology to develop targeted prevention strategies that decrease the risk of morbid chronic GVHD without increasing the risks of cancer relapse or infection. Development of strategies to predict the risk of developing debilitating or deadly chronic GVHD is a high research priority. This working group recommends further interrogation into the mechanisms underpinning chronic GVHD development, and we highlight considerations for future trial design in prevention trials.

### Chronic graft-versus-host disease: where do we go from here? [^111e7zjq]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a significant cause of late morbidity and mortality following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, patients with chronic GvHD are very heterogeneous, making evaluation and treatment difficult. Corticosteroids remain the most effective primary treatment of this condition. Randomized trials have not confirmed the beneficial effect of additional cyclosporine, even in patients with higher risk features. For patients failing initial therapy, no standard therapy is available. A plethora of drugs have been reported to have activity and promise in this disease. However, the majority of reports are small retrospective studies, with few prospective trials. The marked variability in the reported response rates for many of these novel agents highlights a number of problems in the evaluation and management of chronic GvHD. In addition to the heterogeneity of patients, there are no uniform definitions for treatment failure, prognostic criteria to stratify patients according to risk, or to evaluate response to treatment, which in many cases is largely subjective. The challenge ahead is to develop more uniform criteria for defining many of these important variables, which is likely to lead to the design of better prospective clinical trials to improve the outcome of patients with this condition.

### The clinical landscape of chronic graft-versus-host disease management in 2021 [^1135Pfge]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is an important systemic complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with heterogeneous, multi-organ involvement that can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite significant advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology driving the disease, curative treatment options remain suboptimal. The past decade, however, has seen much growth in collaborative research efforts and standardization of criteria for clinical trials that have led to discovery of several new second-line therapies in cGVHD. The key to successful cGVHD control and management includes a comprehensive and sustained multidisciplinary effort with emphasis on ancillary and supportive care for these patients. The focus of this review is to summarize the new developments in systemic, organ-specific, and topical treatments in the management of cGVHD that emerged since the 2014 NIH consensus conference.

### GVHD the nuts and bolts [^116htJ3g]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most frequent, morbid complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Its clinical toxicity, requirement for intensive immunosup-pressive management, and associated infections lead to the greatest risks of nonrelapse mortality in HSCT recipients. In acute GVHD, donor-derived T lymphocyte-mediated alloreactivity is complicated by inflammatory responses, cytokine release, direct tissue injury through target cell apoptosis, and secondary tissue injury. The therapeutic management includes effective GVHD prophylaxis to limit the incidence and severity of acute GVHD, prompt and effective therapy if it develops-modified if possible to protect against chronic GVHD-and intensive supportive care relevant to its association with delayed immune reconstitution. As the major ongoing morbid complication following allografting, chronic GVHD is another barrier to patients' recovery and long-term survival. Recognition of the critical elements in the pathogenesis of GVHD has prompted new approaches to its management and its role in controlling the risks of malignant relapse after allotransplantation. Important elements in the practical management of GVHD will be reviewed.

### Classification systems for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^111UkcHz]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Clinically, chronic GVHD is a pleiotropic, multiorgan syndrome involving tissue inflammation and fibrosis that often results in permanent organ dysfunction. Chronic GVHD is fundamentally caused by replacement of the host's immune system with donor cells, although the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations suggests that patient, donor, and transplant factors modulate the phenotype. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD and determination of treatment response largely rely on clinical examination and patient interview. The 2005 and 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Projects on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD standardized the terminology around chronic GVHD classification systems to ensure that a common language and procedures are being used in clinical research. This review provides a summary of these recommendations and illustrates how they are being used in clinical research and the potential for their use in clinical care.

GvHD onset

GvHD onset refers to the presentation of the first episode of clinically evident alloreactivity of the donor against the recipient host (Fig. 1b, c).

"Classic acute GvHD" refers to the initial diagnosis of acute GvHD within the first 100 days following transplantation or DLI infusion (whichever happened last). "Late acute GvHD" occurs beyond day 100 and can be: "late onset" (new onset of aGvHD with no prior history of classic aGvHD), "recurrent onset" (recurrence of aGvHD in a patient with prior history of classic aGvHD whose symptoms became controlled, inactive or resolved); or "persistent" if active aGvHD signs persist beyond day 100 in the absence of cGvHD manifestations.

Chronic GvHD is referred to as having "de novo onset" if cGvHD is diagnosed for the first time in a patient who did not previously experience acute GvHD. "Quiescent onset" is defined as cGvHD that appears for the first time after all acute GvHD manifestations have become controlled, inactive or resolved. "Progressive onset" refers exclusively to the initial presentation of cGvHD manifestations while acute GvHD symptoms are still active. It is therefore always a form of overlap cGvHD (Fig. 1a), although not all overlap cGvHD syndromes present with a progressive onset. "Progressive onset" is also distinct from "progression", which is a response criterion that refers to an increase in severity of acute or chronic GvHD symptoms over time. "Progressive onset" cGvHD has been associated for over 30 years with inferior prognosis and poor response to treatment. Yet, it should be noted that because these studies used a variety of definitions, some patients, who did not present with new cGvHD manifestations, would now be reclassified as "persistent late acute GvHD". Interestingly, Stewart et al. showed that after the dose of prednisone was taken into account, "progressive onset" no longer predicted long-term survival, suggesting that the level of chronic immunosuppression at diagnosis influences the prognosis for cGvHD with this type of onset.

There is currently no formal nomenclature to refer to the pattern of GvHD recurrence after an initial diagnosis. The term "flare" is sometimes used to define the reappearance or worsening of any signs of GvHD. Although this might reflect the natural course of the disease, this term currently lacks a validated definition. For written scientific communications, we recommend instead the precise terminology that refers to disease onset or the classical clinical trial response criteria, as appropriate.

### Current issues in chronic graft-versus-host disease [^112gWmSb]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Increased transplantation of older patients and the more frequent use of unrelated donors has led to increased numbers of patients with this painful complication. Recent advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD and in establishing precise criteria for diagnosis and classification of disease manifestations. These advances will hopefully pave the way for improving both the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic GVHD.

PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

Chronic GVHD is a pleomorphic disease with an often insidious beginning and disease course. While the current diagnostic and severity criteria are well established, transplant providers struggle with their implementation, and providers with less experience with chronic GVHD, such as primary oncologists or other clinicians who sometimes resume the care of patients after HCT, may be even less adept at recognizing the earliest symptoms and signs. The first objective of this project was to improve recognition of chronic GVHD using the current NIH guidelines. Accordingly, we make several recommendations based on input from disease experts regarding the timing of routine clinical care and surveillance, which can be used at transplant centers as well as by referring oncologists and primary care providers. Additionally, patient education regarding early signs and symptoms, increased education of primary health care providers, and utilization of better communication practices from patient and local clinicians to the transplant center could enhance timely diagnosis of chronic GVHD according to current NIH criteria. The second goal of this working group was to review approaches allowing earlier diagnosis of chronic GVHD before meeting NIH criteria when irreversible changes in organ function have occurred. As examples, we discuss 3 organs associated with a high incidence of irreversibility and morbidity: skin/fascia, eyes, and lungs. We outline future research efforts to identify new early diagnostic criteria or reproducible early markers of severe disease, to allow for the development of earlier interventions or even pre-emptive treatments. Future clinical trials could use these early diagnostic tools as eligibility criteria testing feasibility and efficacy of pre-emptive treatment strategies.

GvHD activity

In the setting of clinical trials, response to treatment compares disease burden at specific points in time, usually with regards to a particular treatment. It is based on a number of clinical findings, sometimes including fixed deficits. Classical categories of response are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and lack of response (which includes no change, mixed response and progression), as established by the NIH consortium for chronic GvHD. For acute GvHD, similar criteria have been described by the MAGIC consortium.

However, GvHD activity may be distinct from response if the disease burden includes fixed deficits that are no longer responsive to treatment. Identification of such deficits can be difficult but is essential to the accurate description of complex clinical phenotypes, particularly in cGvHD. Determination of GvHD activity is often the principal driver in therapeutic decisions (e.g. intensification, reduction (taper) or discontinuation of immunosuppression) and is likely to be critical for biomarker validation. We therefore propose a classification of GvHD activity that incorporates both the presence of disease manifestations and the use of immunosuppression, consistent with the NIH Consensus task force model of GvHD physio-pathology.

GvHD is considered "clinically active" if the patient has inflammatory or worsening manifestations (either acute or chronic) regardless of the use of immunosuppressive therapy. After the inflammation resolves, GvHD manifestations can either disappear without residua or fixed deficits may remain. Such fixed or irreversible deficits represent scars in the affected organ due to either permanent damage or aberrant tissue repair (e.g. skin color change, stable fibrotic features, sicca syndrome) that persist regardless of immunosuppressive treatment.

Once all signs of clinical activity have disappeared, GvHD activity can be described in three different ways. If immunosuppression is still ongoing or has been discontinued for less than 12 weeks or 24 weeks for acute and chronic GvHD respectively, GvHD activity can be considered "controlled" regardless of the presence of fixed sequelae. If immunosuppression has been discontinued for more than the above mentionned periods of time without recurrence of inflammatory signs, GvHD is termed "resolved" if there are no fixed deficits and "inactive" if such fixed deficits persist.

### Mechanistic approaches for the prevention and treatment of chronic GVHD [^116qFCXo]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical outcomes for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation continue to improve, but chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a common toxicity and major cause of nonrelapse morbidity and mortality. Treatment of chronic GVHD has previously relied primarily on corticosteroids and other broadly immune suppressive agents. However, conventional immune suppressive agents have limited clinical efficacy in chronic GVHD, and prolonged immune suppressive treatments result in additional toxicities that further limit clinical recovery from transplant and return to normal daily function. Recent advances in our understanding of the immune pathology of chronic GVHD offer the possibility that new therapeutic approaches can be directed in more precise ways to target specific immunologic mechanisms and pathways. In this review, we briefly summarize current standard treatment options and present new therapeutic approaches that are supported by preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials suggesting that these approaches may have clinical utility for treatment or prevention of chronic GVHD. Further evaluation of these new therapeutic options in well-designed prospective multicenter trials are needed to identify the most effective new agents and improve outcomes for patients with chronic GVHD.

### Homeostatic cytokines in immune reconstitution and graft-versus-host disease [^117Rhae7]. Cytokine (2016). Low credibility.

For numerous patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only therapeutic option that could potentially cure their disease. Despite significant progress made in clinical management of allogeneic SCT, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains the second cause of death after disease recurrence. aGVHD is highly immunosuppressive and the adverse effect of allogeneic SCT on T cell regeneration is typically more important than the levels of immunosuppression normally seen after autologous SCT. In these patients, immune reconstitution often takes several years to occur and restoring immunocompetence after allogeneic SCT represents an important challenge, principally because clinical options are limited and current methods used to accelerate immune reconstitution are associated with increased GVHD. Interleukin-7 and IL-15 are both under clinical investigation and demonstrate the greatest potential on peripheral T cells regeneration in mice and humans. However, awareness has been raised about the use of IL-7 and IL-15 after allogeneic SCT with regards to potential adverse effects on aGVHD. In this review, we will discuss about recent progress made in lymphocyte regeneration, the critical role played by IL-7 and IL-15 in T cell homeostasis and how these cytokines could be used to improve immune reconstitution after allogeneic SCT.

IMPROVING CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2014 NIH CONSENSUS CRITERIA

Timely recognition of chronic GVHD could potentially be improved by (1) better education of health care providers about the diagnostic criteria or early indicators for chronic GVHD, potentially supported by the use of eHealth tools; (2) delineation of essential chronic GVHD documentation needed in clinical practice; and (3) empowering patients to participate actively in symptom monitoring.

### EBMT-NIH-CIBMTR task force position statement on standardized terminology&guidance for graft-versus-host disease assessment [^111G48HY]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Several international recommendations address the assessment of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This position statement by GvHD experts from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) reviews the existing guidelines for both acute and chronic GvHD, addresses potential confusions that arise in daily practice and proposes consensus definitions for many key terms. We provide a historical perspective on the currently available guidelines and recommend the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) criteria for acute GvHD and the NIH 2014 criteria for chronic GvHD as the most comprehensive and detailed criteria available. This statement also offers practical guidance for the implementation of these recommendations and a set of consensus definitions for commonly used GvHD terms in order to facilitate future clinical and translational research. To assist the dissemination of these recommendations, a web-application based on this position statement is available. We believe that adherence to a common set of GvHD assessment criteria is vitally important to improve the quality of data, compare results of retrospective studies and prospective clinical trials, and make therapeutic recommendations based on quality evidence.

Abstract Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has compromised and continues to compromise the benefits associated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant to cure malignant and non-malignant diseases. Pharmacologic interventions to prevent GVHD have emerged as a major objective of research in the immunology and transplant fields. A better understanding of the pathobiology behind the GVHD process has led the way to novel approaches and medications. Here we review the present arsenal of medications used to prevent GVHD, focusing on past experience and the current evidence, and discuss future potential targets.

CONCLUSIONS

Redefining how we recognize chronic GVHD earlier in its clinical evolution will be a major undertaking but has the potential to improve outcomes for patients given the limitations of our current diagnostic criteria, particularly the concern of irreversible organ damage prior to meeting the current criteria. Validation of earlier prediagnostic signs and symptoms should enable the development of pre-emptive intervention strategies with the goal of preventing much of the morbidity and mortality that patients with moderate to severe chronic GVHD currently face. Discovery and validation of early features of chronic GVHD will involve patients and caregivers, transplant providers, and our subspecialty colleagues. Longitudinal studies should enroll patients before chronic GVHD has developed. These observational studies should include serial sample collections, including blood and tissue, for biomarker assessments, patient involvement to assess symptom burden, the use of handheld spirometry, and standardized documentation of physical exam findings, recognizing that screening tests may have variable performance in different populations. These studies should begin during the next 3 years because they will take years to yield definitive data. Diagnosis of ocular and genital involvement is a particular challenge because current diagnostic criteria require assessment by a subspecialist. Engagement with these subspecialists will be essential to help develop early assessment tools and patient symptom measures that could be used to prompt early referral for specialty evaluation. In the next 3 to 7 years, the ability to recognize subclinical chronic GVHD will allow studies of interventions targeted to underlying pathophysiology and delivered preemptively to test whether this approach leads to better transplant outcomes with less chronic GVHD morbidity and no increase in underlying risks of disease relapse or infectious complications. These approaches would be greatly facilitated by development of validated biomarker-based risk assignment strategies.

### EBMT-NIH-CIBMTR task force position statement on standardized terminology&guidance for graft-versus-host disease assessment [^116Fxo2Y]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

The use of electronic tools to streamline and increase the reliability of the GvHD evaluation process has been advocated by several groups, but such tools require a clear and broad consensus regarding reference guidelines to guarantee their internal validity. GvHD experts from the EBMT, NIH, and CIBMTR have therefore joined forces to: (1) review the existing guidelines for both acute and chronic GvHD and recommend those best supported by clinical evidence; (2) address confusions that arise in real-life scenarios encountered in clinical practice; and (3) develop consensus definitions for key terms frequently used in the evaluation and monitoring of GvHD. All three issues were addressed during a series of conference calls and manuscript draft reviews between May and October 2017. The mission of this effort is to advance GvHD research through a transparent and unbiased standardization of common elements in GvHD terminology, thereby increasing the quality and precision of the data collected in HCT clinical research and practice.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Earlier clinical recognition of chronic GVHD is needed and requires greater involvement of all HCT stakeholders, including nontransplant providers as well as patients and caregivers, and could be facilitated by eHealth technology such as telehealth (remote physician and patient assessment), teleconferences (remote multidisciplinary conferences), and electronic applications and reporting tools.
Early signs, symptoms, or other diagnostic determinants of chronic GVHD that are reliably associated with later progression to highly morbid forms of chronic GVHD need to be identified. Early detection of chronic GVHD requires careful and repetitive assessments, including physical examinations by providers with expertise in transplantation, starting before transplantation and continuing through post-transplant follow-up to allow formal diagnosis and assessment of disease trajectory.
Research into prognostic markers in blood, tissue, fluid, imaging, and functional testing is needed to identify actionable early indicators for potential pre-emptive therapy.

Methods

Four working groups were created to encourage global engagement in the topic. Groups worked individually beginning in February 2020 to review the relevant literature and create the initial draft of the paper. The Steering Committee reviewed and discussed the initial draft and offered recommendations for revisions. Two iterative rounds of comments and revisions were collected before the November 18 to 20, 2020, Consensus Conference. The manuscript was further revised for submission after additional suggestions from external reviewers, the Steering Committee, and virtual conference participants, which included patient and caregiver representatives, and a 30-day public comment period.

### Late effects of severe acute graft-versus-host disease on quality of life, medical comorbidities, and survival [^111CGV3o]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is associated with high short-term morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The long-term effects after recovery from grade III-IV aGVHD are unknown. This study aimed to analyze late medical comorbidities, quality of life, nonrelapse mortality, and survival in patients treated for grade III-IV aGVHD. Chart review identified late effects, and patients were asked to complete annual surveys to collect patient-reported outcomes. Outcomes were compared between patients with grade 0-I aGVHD and grade III-IV aGVHD who underwent HCT between 2001 and 2019 and survived for at least 1 year post-transplantation. Patients with a history of grade III-IV aGVHD (n = 192) had significantly higher rates of late medical comorbidities (P < .001) and worse physical (P = 0.01) and mental (P = 0.04) functioning compared with patients with grade 0-I aGVHD (n = 615). Patients who survived for > 1 year post-transplantation and had prior grade III-IV aGVHD also had worse 5-year overall survival (77.5% versus 83.6%; p = 0.006) and higher nonrelapse mortality (19.2% versus 10.6%; P < .001) compared with those with a history of grade 0-I aGVHD. No between-group difference was found in cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Patients who recover from severe aGVHD remain vulnerable to developing late comorbidities. These patients would likely benefit from continued monitoring and supportive care in an attempt to prevent late effects and improve survival.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Not only is it the major cause of late mortality in HSCT patients, but it also accounts for significant morbidity. Much of the literature on chronic GVHD has focused on adults. Chronic GVHD is of major importance in children, especially since they have years to live following the complications of chronic GVHD and its therapy. The goal is to review incidence, manifestations, and therapies, especially when applicable to the paediatric population.

### Novel targets in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^114Nbfrg]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Despite advances that have improved survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a leading cause of late morbidity and mortality after transplant. Current treatment options show limited efficacy in steroid-refractory disease, and there exists a paucity of robust data to guide management decisions. Lack of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- or European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved agents in GVHD underscore the importance of developing novel therapies. Better understanding of the biology of chronic GVHD has provided novel targets for treatment, and structured guidelines in diagnosis and in clinical trial design have provided a common language and pathways for research in this area. These, combined with the surge of drug development in Oncology and Immunology, are factors that have contributed to the accelerating field of drug development and clinical research in chronic GVHD. In these exciting times, it is possible to foresee long awaited advances in the treatment of this devastating complication of HCT. This review will summarize the ongoing clinical development for novel therapies in chronic GVHD.

Positive results from recent clinical trials have significantly expanded current therapeutic options for patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, new insights into the associations between clinical characteristics of chronic GVHD, pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, and the clinical and biological effects of novel therapeutic agents are required to allow for a more individualized approach to treatment. The current report is focused on setting research priorities and direction in the treatment of chronic GVHD. Detailed correlative scientific studies should be conducted in the context of clinical trials to evaluate associations between clinical outcomes and the biological effect of systemic therapeutics. For patients who require systemic therapy but not urgent initiation of glucocorticoids, clinical trials for initial systemic treatment of chronic GVHD should investigate novel agents as monotherapy without concurrently starting glucocorticoids, to avoid confounding biological, pathological, and clinical assessments. Clinical trials for treatment-refractory disease should specifically target patients with incomplete or suboptimal responses to most recent therapy who are early in their disease course. Close collaboration between academic medical centers, medical societies, and industry is needed to support an individualized, biology-based strategic approach to chronic GVHD therapy.

### New approaches for preventing and treating chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1123yqcD]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in the practice of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) over the last 25 years, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a substantial problem with little change in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this complication. In fact, with increased use of peripheral blood, transplantation of older patients, and less immediate transplantation-related mortality, the prevalence of chronic GVHD may increase. One of the difficulties in combating chronic GVHD is a lack of understanding about the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Inherent difficulties in conducting human clinical trials also contribute to the lack of meaningful progress. This review covers potential new approaches to the prevention and treatment of chronic GVHD.

### Improved survival after acute graft – host disease diagnosis in the modern era [^1138NEFX]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) remains one of the most significant barriers to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Current pharmacological approaches fail to prevent acute GvHD completely. – Furthermore, durable resolution of acute GvHD following primary steroid-based therapy is infrequent, – and long-term success of systemic immunosuppressive therapies given after steroid therapy is elusive. Consequently, acute GvHD and its allied infectious complications and organ failure contribute greatly to early mortality after HCT. However, advances in supportive care over time, in particular improvements in the coverage and potency of antimicrobial agents (e.g. antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal drugs), hold promise to improve survival for those patients affected by acute GvHD.

Previous large analyses have demonstrated improvement in survival outcome over time for HCT recipients, despite evolution in overall practices including increasing HCT recipient age, use of unrelated donors, and peripheral blood stem cells as the predominant graft type. More recent transplants have been shown to have improved overall mortality, as well as reducing grade III-IV acute GvHD, major organ injury, and life-threatening infections through the early post-HCT period. Further insight is needed, however, as studies have not examined change in survival outcome over time exclusively in an acute GvHD-affected population, survival outcome according to maximal acute GvHD grade, or effects according to specific GvHD prophylaxis. Additionally, the studies have not examined outcomes of HCT procedures conducted after 2007.

Accordingly, we conducted a large registry analysis to determine whether survival outcome after a diagnosis of acute GvHD has improved significantly over time.

### Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in children [^115yLdu1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Five-year survival rates for childhood cancer now exceed 80% and with the significant progress made by the transplant community in developing less toxic conditioning regimens and in the treatment of posttransplant complications, allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) contributes significantly to that population of long-term survivors. In this context, the acute and long-term toxicities of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) have an ever-increasing effect on organ function, quality of life, and survival; patients and families who initially felt great relief to be cured from the primary disease, now face the challenge of a chronic debilitating illness for which preventative and treatment strategies are suboptimal. Hence, the development of novel strategies that reduce and or control cGVHD, preserve graft-versus-tumor effects, facilitate engraftment and immune reconstitution, and enhance survival after allo-HSCT represents one of the most significant challenges facing physician-scientists and patients.

Essential Chronic GVHD Evaluations Needed in Clinical Practice

Early recognition of chronic GVHD may offer an opportunity to prevent evolution to more severe disease with irreversible damage, although this hypothesis should be formally tested. The 2014 NIH recommendations for clinical trials advocate use of a form that captures diagnostic signs and organ severity scoring. Such evaluations were developed for use in clinical trials and likely lack the granularity required to adjust treatments for individual patients. However, completion of the form does ensure that the main organs involved with chronic GVHD are assessed at each visit. The form is brief and available online at, appendix 1. One recommended modification to the 2014 form is the addition of a checkbox for "Abnormality thought to represent chronic GVHD plus other causes (specify)", since organ dysfunction can have multiple contributing causes, thereby allowing capture of both chronic GVHD and known non-GVHD causes.

Members of this working group unanimously agreed that it is crucial to properly document the pretransplant baseline status of multiple organ systems in patients in order to correctly identify new abnormalities developing after HCT. With the input of disease and organ experts, we propose the use of a checklist to be completed before HCT to document the presence of signs and symptoms (e.g. dry eyes, restrictions to joint range of motion, lung function tests) that could be subsequently confused with chronic GVHD if not documented before HCT (Table 1). Post-transplant evaluation for possible chronic GVHD is standard of care in many centers starting around 100 days after HCT, recognizing that chronic GVHD is diagnosed earlier in 5% to 10% of patients. Thereafter, clinical evaluation is required every 1 to 3 months to screen for signs and symptoms of active chronic GVHD until the patient has discontinued immunosuppressive therapy for at least 6 months. If abnormalities are detected, prompt referral to a specialized transplantation team for a detailed evaluation and therapy should be considered if the primary provider lacks expertise in diagnosing and managing chronic GVHD (Table 2).

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^112wwaQT]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Screening for chronic graft–versus–host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic transplant recipients — chronic GVHD occurs in approximately 30–70% of patients receiving an allogeneic transplant and is a serious, potentially life-threatening post–transplant complication associated with increased non–relapse mortality, significant morbidity and lower health–related quality of life; with ongoing surveillance, judicious management and multidisciplinary care, most cases resolve within 5 years and the median duration of treatment is 2–3 years. Acute GVHD, characterized by red rash, diarrhea and elevated liver tests, usually starts before day 100, whereas chronic GVHD is when people develop GVHD symptoms in their mouth, eyes, skin or other organs. When symptoms appear, the treatment recommendation is: Collaborate with the transplant center to confirm the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. Early detection of chronic graft–versus–host disease (GVHD) can help prevent irreversible organ damage and increase the quality of life of your transplant recipient.

### Immunological reconstitution after hematopoietic cell transplantation-its relation to the contents of the graft [^113pLHSv]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

After hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), there is a prolonged period of immune deficiency.

Objective

To review the recovery of immunity after HCT, including how it is influenced by the cellular contents of the graft, and therapeutic implications.

Methods

Literature review using Medline.

Results/Conclusion

Whereas innate immunity (e.g., epithelial barriers, phagocytes, natural killer cells) typically recovers within weeks post-transplant, the recovery of adaptive immunity takes longer, months for B cells and years for T cells. The recovery is influenced by the graft contents. For example the number of CD34 cells given with the graft affects the tempo of neutrophil recovery, and the number of CD4 T cells given with the graft affects CD4 T cell counts post-transplant. Improved understanding of the relationship between graft contents and immune reconstitution could lead to graft engineering improving transplant outcomes.

### Overlap subtype of chronic graft-versus-host disease is associated with an adverse prognosis, functional impairment, and inferior patient-reported outcomes: a chronic graft-versus-host disease consortium study [^116TytCk]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference proposed the term "overlap" graft-versus-host disease to describe the situation when both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease are present.

Design and Methods

We examined whether the overlap subtype of graft-versus-host disease was associated with a different prognosis, functional limitations, or patient-reported outcomes compared to "classic" chronic graft-versus-host disease without any acute features.

Results

Prospective data were collected from 427 patients from nine centers. Patients were classified as having overlap (n = 352) or classic chronic (n = 75) graft-versus-host disease based on reported organ involvement. Overlap cases had a significantly shorter median time from transplantation to cohort enrollment (P = 0.01), were more likely to be incident cases (P < 0.001), and had a lower platelet count at onset of the graft-versus-host disease (P < 0.001). Patients with overlap graft-versus-host disease had significantly greater functional impairment measured by a 2-minute walk test, higher symptom burden and lower Human Activity Profile scores. Quality of life was similar, except patients with overlap graft-versus-host disease had worse social functioning, assessed by the Short Form-36. Multivariable analysis utilizing time-varying covariates demonstrated that the overlap subtype of graft-versus-host disease was associated with worse overall survival (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1–4.7; P = 0.03) and higher non-relapse mortality (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–8.3; P = 0.02) than classic chronic graft-versus-host disease.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the presence of acute features in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease is a marker of adverse prognosis, greater functional impairment, and higher symptom burden.

### Patient-reported treatment response in chronic graft – host disease [^116ZrVZT]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) is the most common cause of late morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Prior to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conferences, there was limited standardization of chronic GvHD severity scoring and treatment response assessment. In 2005, the NIH Consensus Conference on Clinical Trials for Treatment of Chronic GVHD provided standardized criteria to assess organs involved in chronic GvHD and to determine response to therapies for use in clinical trials; consensus criteria were updated in 2014 based on data that had accumulated since the original guide-lines. These criteria have elevated the scientific rigor of current clinical trials in chronic GvHD therapy. However, substantial improvements in affected organs may be required to achieve response by these criteria, and clinician- or patient-reported response metrics may capture lesser but still important degrees of clinical benefit. For example, while NIH response criteria have been correlated with outcomes, other studies reported limited correlation between NIH response and clinician-reported response, and certain quality of life measures.

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: IIb. the 2020 preemptive therapy working group report [^117H5WQp]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) commonly occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) despite standard prophylactic immune suppression. Intensified universal prophylaxis approaches are effective but risk possible overtreatment and may interfere with the graft-versus-malignancy immune response. Here we summarize conceptual and practical considerations regarding preemptive therapy of chronic GVHD, namely interventions applied after HCT based on evidence that the risk of developing chronic GVHD is higher than previously appreciated. This risk may be anticipated by clinical factors or risk assignment biomarkers or may be indicated by early signs and symptoms of chronic GVHD that do not fully meet National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria. However, truly preemptive, individualized, and targeted chronic GVHD therapies currently do not exist. In this report, we (1) review current knowledge regarding clinical risk factors for chronic GVHD, (2) review what is known about chronic GVHD risk assignment biomarkers, (3) examine how chronic GVHD pathogenesis intersects with available targeted therapeutic agents, and (4) summarize considerations for preemptive therapy for chronic GVHD, emphasizing trial development, including trial design and statistical considerations. We conclude that robust risk assignment models that accurately predict chronic GVHD after HCT and early-phase preemptive therapy trials represent the most urgent priorities for advancing this novel area of research.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and a leading cause of long-term morbidity, nonrelapse mortality, and impaired health-related quality of life. The skin is commonly affected and presents heterogeneously, making the role of dermatologists critical in both diagnosis and treatment. In addition, new clinical classification and grading schemes inform treatment algorithms, which now include 3 Federal Drug Administration-approved therapies, and evolving transplant techniques are changing disease epidemiology. Part I reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cGVHD. Part II discusses disease grading and therapeutic management.

### Towards better and more effective clinical trials for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^113FR3T1]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

While the incidence of chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (chronic GVHD) is declining due to advances in prophylaxis and survival is improving due to better supportive care, first-line treatment of chronic GVHD continues to be based on corticosteroids. Numerous attempts to establish more effective or less toxic treatment alternatives have largely failed, likely due to the biological heterogeneity of chronic GVHD and uncontrolled use of systemic corticosteroids, indicating the need for new approaches. The 2020 NIH consensus conference proposed the systematic evaluation of steroid-free initial treatment combining clinical and biological assessment to establish personalized approaches. While the first generation of trials evaluating steroid-free single agent first-line therapy approaches are recruiting, they are still not able to consider the biological heterogeneity of chronic GVHD in deciding therapeutic approaches. To advance the field, we propose a two-stage adaptive trial design starting with an intervention under consideration followed by a replication phase after the first phase has identified candidate clinical features and or biomarker predicting success. For second and subsequent lines of treatment, current treatment decisions regarding the use of the four FDA approved agents are based on the product label or a trial-and-error approach, sometimes in combination regimens despite the lack of prospective data. Future trials and prospective observational studies should focus on the development of predictive markers to provide a biological rationale for sequencing treatment options and to identify synergistic combination treatments. The recently released FDA draft guidance document for developing drugs and treatments in GVHD serves as the starting point for clinical trials planning that should yield results during the next several years.

### Chronic graft versus host disease [^112NjEpc]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

The ability to cure increasing numbers of individuals for malignant and non-malignant diseases with the use of stem cell transplantation has resulted in a growing number of long-term survivors with unique medical issues. Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) continues to be a significant problem in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting and, as we continue to use alternative stem cell sources and attempt to modulate the immune system to increase an anti-tumour effect, we will probably see rising numbers of patients with this complication. The capacity to treat this problem and improve both the immediate quality of life as well as long-term effects is imperative and requires the ability of haematologists/oncologists to identify chronic GvHD and its multi-organ system presentations. We describe the risk factors for developing chronic GvHD, its presentation and the current treatment options for both initial therapy and secondary treatment.

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: IIa. the 2020 clinical implementation and early diagnosis working group report [^111rLa26]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The field of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has dramatically changed over the past decade due to practice changes, and the number of transplant procedures continues to increase. Despite prevention strategies such as T cell depletion and post-transplant cyclophosphamide, which are associated with reduced rates of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as low as 10% to 15% in some studies, most allogeneic HCT recipients still receive peripheral blood stem cell grafts with other forms of GVHD prophylaxis and experience a 30% to 50% incidence of chronic GVHD. This results in substantial long-term morbidity and mortality and has been shown to significantly impact the health status, health-related quality of life, and return to social roles of affected HCT survivors.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chronic GVHD Consensus projects in 2005 and 2014 provided the standardization of chronic GVHD diagnosis and severity for clinical trials. Multiple publications have supported the validity of the NIH diagnostic criteria and the prognostic importance of disease severity, and their use has allowed the development of better structured clinical trials, leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of ibrutinib for chronic GVHD in 2017, the first agent approved for this indication. However, many patients do not meet NIH diagnostic criteria until irreversible manifestations of the disease such as sicca symptoms and lung GVHD have already developed. Therefore, the field must develop tools to recognize or predict the imminent onset of chronic GVHD at an earlier stage before NIH diagnostic criteria are met to allow investigation of pre-emptive interventions that prevent progression to irreversible organ damage and avoid the need for systemic therapy.

### Pediatric transplant and cellular therapy consortium RESILIENT conference on pediatric chronic graft-versus-host disease survivorship after hematopoietic cell transplantation: part I. phases of chronic GVHD, supportive care, and systemic therapy discontinuation [^112KafXN]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Current literature lacks details on the impact of pediatric chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) on long-term survivorship after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Nonetheless, cGVHD remains a leading cause of post-transplant morbidity and mortality in children and adolescents, which is particularly relevant given the longer life-expectancy after HCT (measured in decades) compared to older adults. To address this knowledge gap, leaders of the Pediatric Transplant and Cellular Therapy Consortium convened a multidisciplinary taskforce of experts in pediatric cGVHD and HCT late effects known as RESILIENT after Chronic GVHD (Research and Education towards Solutions for Late effects to Innovate, Excel, and Nurture after cGVHD). Our goals were to define: (1) the current state of understanding about how cGVHD impacts long-term survivorship in children transplanted < 18 yr of age; (2) practical aspects of care to help clinicians managing long-term pediatric cGVHD survivors; and (3) develop a research framework for the next decade to further our knowledge. Four working groups were formed, each tasked with addressing a unique theme: (1) cGVHD natural history (phases of cGVHD) and its impact on clinicians' ability to taper and durably discontinue systemic therapy; (2) organ dysfunction and immune reconstitution in relation to survivorship; (3) how cGVHD and its treatment impact growth, metabolism, and development in children; and (4) psychosocial health and patient reported outcomes. The 4 groups met before the 2024 BMT Tandem Meeting in San Antonio, Texas, and then convened a larger in-person RESILIENT conference held on February 20, 2024, at the Tandem meeting to put forth recommendations from their respective working groups and garner feedback. These recommendations are now presented in a series of 4 manuscripts. This current manuscript focuses on the first theme and discusses the phases of cGVHD, challenges in differentiating clinically active from quiescent cGVHD in clinical practice, and the resultant difficulties in determining when and if to taper systemic therapy. To overcome these challenges, we propose revised categorization of long-term cGVHD outcomes and practical recommendations for clinicians and researchers around the long-term follow-up for these patients, including determining when and if to taper systemic therapy, along with the integration of non-immunosuppressive supportive care interventions.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^114Ythby]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

GVHD Overview

Acute and chronic GVHD have unique pathophysiologies, clinical presentations, and risk factors, which are highlighted in Table 2.

Table 2.
Pathophysiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of acute and chronic GVHD.

Generally, the pathophysiology of acute GVHD is thought to be initial injury to the recipient tissue, either from the conditioning regimen or infection, which ultimately leads to activation of alloreactive donor T cells which mediate tissue damage via direct attack or through propagation of inflammation. Acute GVHD is driven by recognition of mismatched major and minor histocompatibility antigens, altered mechanisms of tissue repair and protection, and loss of protective microbial-derived metabolites. While some aspects of the acute GVHD immune response overlap with chronic GVHD, the pathophysiology of chronic GVHD is distinct and can be summarized as having 3 phases: (1) host tissue injury which leads to early inflammation, (2) chronic inflammation and dysregulation of T-cell and B-cell immunity, and (3) tissue repair with fibrosis. Chronic GVHD biology is characterized by B-cell signaling and prolonged immune activation of T-cell subsets, regulatory T-cell deficiencies, and tissue fibrosis. Differences in the pathophysiological mechanism of acute and chronic GVHD form the basis for the development of unique prophylactic and therapeutic approaches to the disease.

EARLIER RECOGNITION OF CHRONIC GVHD BEFORE MEETING NIH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Better integration of the 2014 NIH diagnostic criteria into routine clinical practice at transplant centers as described above may allow for earlier recognition of chronic GVHD and implementation of effective interventions. However, our current diagnostic strategies have limitations, and even with early diagnosis per the 2014 criteria, outcomes might not be improved. Patients meeting current NIH diagnostic criteria have low rates of responding to current best available initial therapies, as demonstrated in a prospective observational study that enrolled patients within 3 months of chronic GVHD diagnosis. In this study, 91% of patients had moderate to severe chronic GVHD, and less than 20% had a complete or partial response without additional systemic therapy at 1 year. Therefore, identification of early systemic or organ-specific features that are highly correlated with later development of moderate to severe disease should be a goal for the next 5 years. Successful identification of these features may offer an opportunity to explore the efficacy of very early or even preemptive therapy. If new technology proves useful for early diagnosis, it will have to be highly portable, not cost-prohibitive unless high value is demonstrated, and easily standardized across multiple centers; have high test-retest and intra- and interobserver reliability; require minimal training for operation; and provide easily interpretable data.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^116Qu9jP]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common and morbid complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). After many years without effective therapies, there have been 4 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for GVHD treatment since 2017. In this review, we detail the efficacy and toxicity data from the clinical trials which support these approvals. As these newly approved agents are likely to be increasingly used in the clinical setting, this review has significant relevance for practicing oncologists treating patients after allogeneic HCT.

### Durable discontinuation of systemic therapy for chronic graft – host disease: myth or reality? [^115nSuNS]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Progress in research into chronic graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) over last two decades has been impressive. Disease manifestations and clinical course are now well characterized, the complex pathophysiology is much better understood, many investigational agents are available for treatment, and a regulatory approval pathway has been established. The goals of the first National Institutes of Health consensus conference, held in 2005, have been achieved and we now have three Food and Drug Administration-approved novel agents for the treatment of chronic GvHD. These new drugs hold promise of less toxicity, improved symptom control, and better patient function in steroid-refractory disease. Effective chronic GvHD prevention is now well established and the incidence of chronic GvHD can range as low as 10–12% with novel prophylactic regimens. However, much work remains to be done. Initial treatment is still prednisone with or without a calcineurin inhibitor, which fails in about 50% of patients. Best choices of subsequent treatments are still being debated and even with novel drugs complete responses in these patients are still in the range of only 10%. Furthermore, highly morbid and disabling forms of chronic GvHD still exist. We are still waiting to see published data on improved survival in patients with chronic GvHD and infections remain the leading cause of death in these patients. The financial burden of the cost of therapy for chronic GvHD surpasses an average of $300,000/year per patient in the United States. Taking all this together, it is no wonder that achieving sustained discontinuation of systemic therapy remains a highly desirable and still elusive goal in chronic GvHD. One of the major barriers is our current inability to reliably choose the timing and rate of tapering off systemic therapy, which results in endless cycles of trial-and-error treatments intertwined with disease flares and cumulative drug toxicities. In this issue of Haematologica, Chen et al. evaluate the factors associated with durable discontinuation of systemic therapy, defined rigorously as cessation of systemic therapy for at least 12 months, using data from two prospectively followed cohorts from the chronic GvHD consortium. The cumulative incidence estimate of durable discontinuation of systemic therapy was 24% and 32% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, after enrollment. Among patients who discontinued systemic therapy, the median time from chronic GvHD diagnosis to durable discontinuation of systemic therapy was 3.6 years. In multivariate analysis, several factors were identified as being associated with a lower likelihood of discontinuation of systemic therapy (Table 1). The authors also found that many factors known to be associated with the development of chronic GvHD were not associated with the likelihood of discontinuation of systemic therapy, suggesting that the pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic GvHD treatment and control may differ from those driving its initial development. These results suggest that a mandatory 6- to 12-month observation period is required to support the conclusion that systemic therapy has been discontinued permanently.

### Early posttransplantation donor-derived invariant natural killer T-cell recovery predicts the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease and overall survival [^115Zpid6]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can experimentally dissociate GVL from graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Their role in human conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is unknown. Here, we analyzed the post-HSCT recovery of iNKT cells in 71 adult allografted patients. Results were compared with conventional T- and NK-cell recovery and correlated to the occurrence of GVHD, relapse, and survival. We observed that posttransplantation iNKT cells, likely of donor origin, recovered independently of T and NK cells in the first 90 days after HSCT and reached greater levels in recipient younger than 45 years (P = 0.003) and after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (P = 0.03). Low posttransplantation iNKT/T ratios (ie, < 10(-3)) were an independent factor associated with the occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD; p = 0.001). Inversely, reaching iNKT/T ratios > 10(-3) before day 90 was associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality (P = 0.009) without increased risk of relapse and appeared as an independent predictive factor of an improved overall survival (P = 0.028). Furthermore, an iNKT/T ratio on day 15 > 0.58 × 10(-3) was associated with a 94% risk reduction of aGVHD. These findings provide a proof of concept that early postallogeneic HSCT iNKT cell recovery can predict the occurrence of aGVHD and an improved overall survival.

### Toward a better understanding of the atypical features of chronic graft-versus-host disease: a report from the 2020 National Institutes of Health consensus project task force [^116PXGyT]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Alloreactive and autoimmune responses after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can occur in nonclassical chronic graft-versus-host disease (chronic GVHD) tissues and organ systems or manifest in atypical ways in classical organs commonly affected by chronic GVHD. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus projects were developed to improve understanding and classification of the clinical features and diagnostic criteria for chronic GVHD. Although still speculative whether atypical manifestations are entirely due to chronic GVHD, these manifestations remain poorly captured by the current NIH consensus project criteria. Examples include chronic GVHD impacting the hematopoietic system as immune mediated cytopenias, endothelial dysfunction, or as atypical features in the musculoskeletal system, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and serous membranes. These purported chronic GVHD features may contribute significantly to patient morbidity and mortality. Most of the atypical chronic GVHD features have received little study, particularly within multi-institutional and prospective studies, limiting our understanding of their frequency, pathogenesis, and relation to chronic GVHD. This NIH consensus project task force report provides an update on what is known and not known about the atypical manifestations of chronic GVHD while outlining a research framework for future studies to be undertaken within the next 3 to 7 years. We also provide provisional diagnostic criteria for each atypical manifestation, along with practical investigation strategies for clinicians managing patients with atypical chronic GVHD features.

### An endpoint associated with clinical benefit after initial treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^116sn2uD]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

No gold standard has been established as a primary endpoint in trials of initial treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and evidence showing the association of any proposed primary endpoint with clinical benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated. To address this gap, we analyzed outcomes in a cohort of 328 patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, observational study within 3 months after diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Complete and partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were defined according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease. Success was defined as complete or partial response with no secondary systemic treatment or recurrent malignancy at 1 year after enrollment. Success was observed in fewer than 20% of the patients. The burden of disease manifestations at 1 year was lower for patients in this category than for those with stable or progressive disease. Systemic treatment ended earlier, and subsequent mortality was lower among patients with complete or partial response than among those with stable or progressive disease and those who had received secondary systemic treatment. We conclude that survival with a complete or partial response and no previous secondary systemic treatment or recurrent malignancy at 1 year after initial systemic therapy is associated with clinical benefit, a critical characteristic for consideration as a primary endpoint in a pivotal clinical trial. This prospective observational study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00637689.

### Long-term physiological side effects after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation [^112ynk6N]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) or stem cell transplantation has the potential to cure a significant proportion of patients with otherwise fatal diseases. At present, immediate survival is no longer the sole concern after allo-BMT, because many patients can survive the acute complications of the procedure and remain free of their original disease for several years. Although long-term allo-BMT survivors generally enjoy good health, for many others cure or control of the underlying disease is not accompanied by full restoration of health. The long-term physiologic effects after allo-BMT include nonmalignant organ or tissue dysfunction; changes in quality of life; infections related to delayed, or abnormal, immune reconstitution; and secondary cancers. These long-term complications and the features of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) symptoms are heterogeneous in nature, time of onset, duration, and severity. The underlying origin of these complications is often multifactorial, with chronic GVHD being the most challenging risk factor. The main aims of this review are to present transplant physicians and health care providers with an overview of these malignant and nonmalignant late complications, with a special focus on chronic GVHD. A close partnership between the transplant center, organ-specific specialties, and local primary care providers is a key component of preventive medicine. The patient can play a major role through engagement in health maintenance behaviors.

Infection control is prioritized: "Infection prophylaxis and prompt and effective management of infections are crucial; infection is a leading cause of death in chronic GVHD". For activation and coordination, clinicians are advised to "Identify clinical manifestations that are potential early indicators of chronic GVHD", "Trigger prompt clinical action if GVHD is suspected", and, if GVHD is suspected, "it is recommended that you collaborate with the patient's transplant center to confirm the diagnosis and to develop a treatment plan". Ongoing surveillance is highlighted: "Long-term follow-up is required to monitor for late sequelae", and the text adds that "Your early detection and actions to manage chronic GVHD can help minimize permanent damage and improve the quality of life of your transplant patient".

### Steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease: treatment options and patient management [^113avipN]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is one of the major causes of late mortality after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Moderate-to-severe cGVHD is associated with poor health-related quality of life and substantial disease burden. While corticosteroids with or without calcineurin inhibitors comprise the first-line treatment option, the prognosis for patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD (SR-cGVHD) remains poor. The mechanisms underlying steroid resistance are unclear, and there are no standard second-line treatment guidelines for patients with SR-cGVHD. In this review, we provide an overview on current treatment options of cGVHD and use a series of theoretical case studies to elucidate the rationale of choices of second- and third-line treatment options for patients with SR-cGVHD based on individual patient profiles.

### Performance of treatment response assessment at day 7 by baseline acute graft-versus-host disease severity [^116EHfAr]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Response to first-line treatment in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is typically assessed at day 28 (D28) in clinical trials, but this convention was established without accounting for onset severity and thus was optimized for mild-moderate GVHD that comprises the majority of cases. Furthermore, the initiation of second-line therapy, which is considered primary treatment failure, is not based on standardized criteria and thus remains subjective and inconsistent for patients regardless of clinical trial participation.

Objective

In this study we hypothesized that an early assessment of treatment response at D7 would accurately predict long-term outcomes for patients with severe GVHD and support the initiation of second line therapy in non-responders.

Study Design

We analyzed six-month outcomes by D7 and D28 response for 1561 patients receiving systemic therapy for acute GVHD in two large trial cohorts - one observational (n = 1008) and one interventional (n = 553) after stratification for onset severity using Minnesota risk criteria.

Results

Patients with Minnesota standard risk GVHD comprised approximately 80% of each cohort. D7 responses predicted much smaller differences in 6-month NRM (observational: responders: 9% vs non-responders: 23%; interventional: 12% vs 24%) than D28 responses (observational: 7% vs 35%; interventional: 9% vs 36%) and second line therapy was deferred in ∼85% of patients who had not responded by D7. More than half of this "wait and see" group proved to be slow responders with low 6-month NRM of < 10% and as a result the D28 response more accurately predicted 6-month NRM than D7 response (AUC: observational; 0.73 vs 0.63, p < 0.001; interventional: 0.70 vs 0.60, p = 0.002). Subset analyses confirmed the superiority of D28 over D7 in children with Minnesota standard risk GVHD and in patients with little or no lower gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD (stage 0 or 1) but not patients with stage 2 GI GVHD. In contrast, among Minnesota high risk patients, D7 (observational: 26% vs 54%; interventional: 20% vs 56%) and D28 (observational: 20% vs 57%; interventional: 22% vs 62%) responses both predicted large differences in 6-month NRM with similar AUCs (observational; 0.65 vs 0.69, p = 0.171; interventional: 0.68 vs 0.71, p = 0.581). Subset analyses demonstrated similar AUCs for both D7 and D28 in children with Minnesota high risk GVHD and in patients with severe GI GVHD (stage 2–4). Notably, second line therapy was deferred for 70% of high risk patients without a response at D7. The "wait and see" approach was common even after the approval of ruxolitinib for steroid-resistant GVHD, and their 6-month NRM was ∼50%.

Conclusion

These findings support the use of D7 response as an actionable assessment timepoint in high risk acute GVHD and highlight the need for severity-adapted response criteria in both clinical practice and trial design.

### Advances in predicting acute GVHD [^115uQTwp]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a leading cause of non-relapse mortality following allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation. Attempts to improve treatment response in clinically-established GVHD have not improved overall survival, often due to the increased risk of infectious complications. Alternative approaches to decrease GVHD-related morbidity and mortality have focused on the ability to predict GVHD prior to clinical manifestation in an effort to provide an opportunity to abort GVHD development, and to gain new insights into GVHD pathophysiology. This review outlines the research efforts to date that have identified clinical and laboratory-based factors that are predictive of acute GVHD and describes future directions in developing algorithms that will improve the ability to predict the development of clinically relevant GVHD.

### Chronic GvHD NIH consensus project biology task force: evolving path to personalized treatment of chronic GvHD [^114nqSco]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) remains the leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality after allo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Significant progress has been made in understanding cGvHD pathophysiology, leading to preclinical testing and clinical translation of agents that are now Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for steroid-resistant disease, as well as the potential development of new approaches for prophylaxis and first-line treatment. As a result of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported cGvHD consensus development project, disease definition, clinical features and severity, and criteria for treatment response have been established. The 2020 NIH consensus development project refined various aspects of cGvHD biology, clinical spectra, current status, and mapped future advancements in therapy. The goal of the present article is to summarize how recent understandings of cGvHD mechanisms may facilitate personalized treatment and prevention strategies.

cGvHD can affect many organs and systems, typically involving barrier sites that are entry points for pathogens and home to cellular populations within the adaptive as well as innate immune systems. Human and animal studies have implicated inflammatory mediators, cytokines, danger-associated molecular patterns, and metabolites as contributors to cGvHD pathogenesis. The immune system dysregulation that leads to cGvHD can be mediated by T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and can be ameliorated by regulatory populations of T cells, B cells, myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, myeloid derived suppressor cells) and NK cells, (Figure 1). Whether the affected organ systems share pathogenic mechanisms that initiate and sustain cGvHD is not yet fully elucidated, albeit certain immune populations have been shown in animal models to mediate cGvHD in multiple target organs. Whether clinical symptoms in patients represent protean manifestations of a limited set of pathophysiological processes or diverse mechanisms that invoke specific cGvHD manifestations is unclear. Clinically, variability in organ involvement is compounded by a spectrum of clinical subtypes and variable posttransplant timing, which adds to the complexity of discerning underlying mechanisms and devising strategies to overcome cGvHD. Taken together, these studies support the conclusion that the biology of cGvHD is complex and likely to be heterogenous. New treatment approaches for cGvHD focused around the concept of personalized therapy are greatly needed.

Alloreactivity forms the basis of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), with donor-derived T cell response to recipient antigens mediating clinical responses either in part or entirely. These encompass the different manifestations of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection risk, and disease response. While the latter is contingent on disease biology and thus may be less predictable, the former 2 manifestations are more likely to be directly proportional to the magnitude of donor-derived T cell recovery. Herein we explore the quantitative aspects of immune cell recovery following allogeneic HCT and clinical outcomes in 2 cohorts of HLA-matched allograft recipients who received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) on different schedules (days -9 to -7 versus days -3 to -1). Monocyte as well as donor-derived T cell (ddCD3) recovery was superior in those given ATG early in the course of disease (days -9/-7). This difference was related to a more rapid rate of ddCD3 recovery, driven largely by CD3 + /CD8 + cells in the first month post-transplantation. Early monocyte recovery was associated with later T cell recovery and improved survival. In contrast, rapid and early ddCD3 expansion out of proportion to monocyte recovery was associated with a high likelihood of acute GVHD and poor survival. This analytic methodology demonstrates that modeling "early-term immune reconstitution" following HCT yields insights that may be useful in the management of post-transplantation immunosuppression and adaptive cellular therapy to optimize clinical outcomes. © 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

Cytomegalovirus serostatus as a predictor of recovery

CMV monitoring by polymerase chain reaction was performed twice a week for the first 3 months and surveillance continued in a subset of patients at risk of late reactivation (e.g. patients with GvHD, prior multiple reactivations). Twenty-three recipients shared a CMV seronegative status with the donor and did not have CMV reactivation. Of the remaining 39 patients, 35 (92%) had CMV re-activation before the CD34 + -selected infusion. No patients had CMV re-activation following infusion. The relationship between complete or partial recovery and CMV serostatus correlated with CMV re-activation, with 23/35 (66%) of patients who had CMV re-activation showing a response versus 24/27 (89%) of those who did not have CMV re-activation (P = 0.04). However, other variables related to the severity of CMV infection including earlier re-activation, higher peak CMV viremia, longer duration of antiviral drug treatment, higher number of CMV re-activations, active CMV infection at the time of infusion and CMV disease did not correlate with worse recovery (Online Supplementary Table S4).

Graft- versus -host disease

Acute GvHD following CD34 + - selected infusion occurred in a total of seven patients (11%) at a median of 15 days (range, 7–26 days; 3 patients had acute GvHD grade I-II and 4 patients had grade III-IV).

Chronic GvHD was seen in five patients (8%) who survived for more than 100 days following CD34 + -selected infusion (1 patient had mild, 1 had moderate and 3 had severe chronic GvHD). Of the six patients who received co-transfer of donor T cells, two developed acute GvHD grade III-IV and two developed mild and severe chronic GvHD.

Introduction

Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) refers to a clinical syndrome caused by the response of transplanted donor allogeneic cells to histocompatibility antigens expressed on tissues of the transplantation recipient. It is the most serious complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Its recognition and control are key elements of a successful outcome. In fact, the World Health Organization stipulates that data collection and data analysis are integral parts of therapy.

In practice, however, the application of basic concepts pertaining to the diagnosis and staging of this condition differs widely among HCT clinicians. The use of the templated data collection forms (such as those used by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), and the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI)) improves standardization by collecting data elements as proposed by published consensus documents but demands significant time from healthcare professionals and researchers.

Several studies have shown a lack of adherence to recommendations and inconsistencies in GvHD evaluation. Weisdorf et al. showed in one multi-center study that acute GvHD (aGvHD) grading at HCT centers significantly underestimated disease severity compared to a central, expert review board, with inaccurate evaluation of grade III GvHD in 18% of cases. In a recent chronic GvHD (cGvHD) intervention trial, up to 10% of patients entered by GvHD Consortium centers were excluded from study analysis post hoc due to failure to meet diagnostic criteria at the time of inclusion.

Such discrepancies are concerning because they can significantly affect the interpretation of GvHD data in clinical trials. Misclassifications have been observed even among experienced HCT and GvHD professionals, and inaccuracies are therefore likely to be even more prominent among less experienced centers. In fact, a recent survey of practice patterns completed by transplant professionals during the annual 2017 EBMT conference showed wide variations in the types of reference guidelines used for GvHD assessments, and up to one third of the survey participants reported a lack of confidence in their ability to apply these guidelines. Of interest, the GvHD assessments of two clinical vignettes became much more consistent and compliant with recent international guidelines when the same cases were evaluated using an electronic tool, the eGvHD App (available at).

The treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) has become more nuanced in recent years with the development of improved risk classification systems and a better understanding of its complex, multisystem pathophysiology. We review contemporary approaches to the risk stratification and initial treatment of aGVHD, including ongoing clinical trials. We summarize the findings that led to the first US Food and Drug Administration approval for steroid-refractory aGVHD (SR-aGVHD), ruxolitinib, as well as some of the challenges clinicians still face in treating SR-aGVHD. Finally, we discuss the evaluation and management of steroid-dependent aGVHD, which affects approximately one-third of patients who have long-term, waxing and waning symptoms distinct from chronic GVHD. Future clinical trials for aGVHD treatment may identify steroid-sparing approaches for patients who have a high likelihood of response and approaches to improve tissue repair and dysbiosis for those unlikely to respond to immunosuppression alone.

Abstract

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) remains a prominent barrier to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantion as the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality and significant morbidity. Tremendous progress has been achieved in both the understanding of pathophysiology and the development of new therapies for cGvHD. Although our field has historically approached treatment from an empiric position, research performed at the bedside and bench has elucidated some of the complex pathophysiology of cGvHD. From the clinical perspective, there is significant variability of disease manifestations between individual patients, pointing to diverse biological underpinnings. Capitalizing on progress made to date, the field is now focused on establishing personalized approaches to treatment. The intent of this article is to concisely review recent knowledge gained and formulate a path toward patient-specific cGvHD therapy.

### FDA D. I.S.C.O. burst edition: FDA approval of omisirge (omidubicel… [^114qYCpR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Welcome back to the D. I. S. C. O. FDA's Drug Information Soundcast in Clinical Oncology, Burst Edition, brought to you by FDA's Division of Drug Information in partnership with FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence. Today we'll provide a quick update on a recent FDA cancer therapeutic approval. On April 17, 2023, the FDA approved omidubicel-onlv, brand name Omisirge, for use in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with hematologic malignancies who are planned for umbilical cord blood transplantation following myeloablative conditioning to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the incidence of infection. Fifty-two patients were transplanted with omidubicel-onlv. Fifty-six patients were transplanted in the unmanipulated cord blood arm with one or two cord units. Multiple conditioning regimens were used, including Total Body Irradiation-based or chemotherapy-based options.

The main efficacy outcome measures were time to neutrophil recovery following transplantation and the incidence of Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Grade 2/3 bacterial or Grade 3 fungal infections through Day 100 post transplantation. The median time to neutrophil recovery was 12 days for those receiving omidubicel-onlv and 22 days in the unmanipulated cord blood arm. Eighty-seven percent in the omidubicel-onlv arm and 83% in the unmanipulated cord blood arm achieved neutrophil recovery. The incidence of Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Grade 2/3 bacterial or Grade 3 fungal infections through Day 100 post transplantation was 39% and 60%, respectively, in the two groups. Similar to approved unmanipulated cord blood products, the prescribing information contains a Boxed Warning for fatal or life-threatening infusion reactions, graft versus host disease, engraftment syndrome and graft failure.

Among 117 patients who received omidubicel-onlv for any disease, infusion reactions occurred in 47% of patients, acute graft versus host disease in 58%, chronic graft versus host disease in 35%, and graft failure in 3%. In patients with hematologic malignancies in Study P0501, the most common Grade 3–5 adverse reactions were pain, mucosal inflammation, hypertension, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Full prescribing information for these approvals can be found on the web at www. fda. gov/, key word search Approved Cellular and Gene Therapy Products.
