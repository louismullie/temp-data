## Question

Can leuprolide cure Cushing disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether leuprolide can cure Cushing disease, and I need to provide an answer plan with clear verification steps and references, step by step, like I would at the bedside or in tumor board discussions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cure" means in Cushing's disease and what the accepted first-line curative therapy is, then I should verify where medical therapy fits and which drug classes are supported by guidelines, next I will check whether leuprolide appears anywhere in authoritative recommendations or trials, and finally I will consider the biological plausibility based on axis physiology and synthesize a clear conclusion with practical caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition of "cure" here: in Cushing's disease, cure generally refers to durable biochemical remission after addressing the source of ACTH excess, and the only accepted potentially curative approach is selective transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary corticotroph adenoma by an experienced surgeon, with typical remission rates around 70–90% for microadenomas and lower for macroadenomas, acknowledging risk of late recurrence and the need for long-term surveillance [^1119fkhW] [^1132qgAU]. I should double-check that guidelines continue to place surgery as first-line for CD and reserve other modalities as second line or adjunctive, which they do, including consideration of radiotherapy and bilateral adrenalectomy in select scenarios when surgery fails or is not feasible [^1174CXFh] [^112gMZKb].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology and mechanism alignment before leaping to conclusions: Cushing's disease is ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism from a pituitary corticotroph adenoma driving the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, whereas leuprolide is a GnRH agonist that suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis and sex steroid production after an initial flare, so on first principles leuprolide does not target ACTH secretion or adrenal cortisol synthesis and thus lacks a mechanism to normalize cortisol in CD. Hold on, I should verify whether any cross-axis effect is recognized in guidelines or reviews; none of the standard references describe GnRH analogs as effective or indicated for ACTH suppression or cortisol normalization in CD, reinforcing that the HPG and HPA axes are distinct for this purpose [^1119fkhW] [^112EzLrW].

> Next, I should review which medical therapies are actually recommended when surgery fails or is not an option, and I need to check carefully whether leuprolide appears anywhere in those recommendations: pituitary-directed agents such as pasireotide and cabergoline, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, levoketoconazole, osilodrostat, and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone are the recognized categories, and leuprolide is not listed among these agents in Endocrine Society guidelines or major reviews [^1119fkhW] [^115kQRvk]. Let me double-check the pivotal pituitary-directed trial data and labeling for pasireotide in CD — again, no mention of GnRH analogs as therapeutic options for CD, which supports that leuprolide has no established role here [^114zdGzv] [^116k6MmB].

> I will now examine the role and intent of medical therapy to ensure I'm not missing a nuance: guidelines and reviews consistently frame medical therapy in CD as adjunctive or second-line to control hypercortisolism when surgery is contraindicated, incomplete, or while awaiting radiation effects, with efficacy demonstrated across classes but typically requiring ongoing therapy; this is disease control, not cure, and no source suggests that medical therapy per se eradicates the causative pituitary tumor or provides definitive cure in most cases [^111a3729] [^116TdReV]. Hmm, wait a minute, could meta-analytic outcomes imply "cure" with medicines alone; no — the meta-analyses show meaningful cortisol normalization rates but continued need for treatment and monitoring, which is consistent with control rather than surgical cure and again do not include leuprolide among effective agents for CD [^1122NkDV] [^112EzLrW].

> Hold on, I should verify if there is any scenario in which leuprolide would be reasonable even off-label; scanning guideline algorithms and therapeutic pathways, there is no place for GnRH agonists in CD management, whereas in severe hypercortisolism, recommended rapid-control options are adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, sometimes with block-and-replace strategies, and evolving agents like osilodrostat — not leuprolide — which aligns with both mechanism and evidence [^111KoyX6] [^113HwKEL]. Let me reconsider whether radiotherapy and bilateral adrenalectomy change this answer; they are second/third-line definitive modalities for the HPA axis but still do not create an indication for GnRH agonists in CD, further underscoring that leuprolide is outside the evidence-based treatment paradigm for this disease [^112gMZKb] [^1132qgAU].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I need to ensure the bottom line is crisp and reference-anchored — no, leuprolide cannot cure Cushing's disease, because it neither addresses the corticotroph adenoma nor reduces ACTH/cortisol through a validated mechanism, it is not included in any CD guideline or therapeutic class for hypercortisolism control, and the only potentially curative approach remains transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, with medical therapy reserved for control when surgery fails or is not feasible [^1119fkhW] [^111vmR86]. If the clinical question reflects a need for non-surgical options, evidence-based alternatives include pituitary-directed agents like pasireotide, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, levoketoconazole, or osilodrostat, and the glucocorticoid receptor blocker mifepristone, chosen and monitored according to comorbidity profile and treatment goals, none of which involve leuprolide [^116k6MmB] [^115kQRvk].

---

Leuprolide is **not effective for curing Cushing disease** because it does not suppress ACTH or cortisol in corticotroph adenomas. The **standard of care is transsphenoidal surgery** [^1152pcUj], with medical therapy (pasireotide [^114zdGzv], cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat [^113HwKEL], or mifepristone) [^111HCyxg] reserved for persistent or recurrent disease [^1119fkhW]. Leuprolide is not recommended by guidelines and should not be used for Cushing disease.

---

## Mechanism of action of leuprolide

Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist that initially increases LH and FSH, then suppresses them with continued use, reducing sex steroids. It is used for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and precocious puberty, but **does not target ACTH or cortisol**.

---

## Pathophysiology of cushing disease

Cushing disease is caused by a **pituitary corticotroph adenoma secreting excess ACTH**, driving adrenal cortisol overproduction [^115ZbEmF]. Management aims to normalize cortisol, control the tumor, and reduce morbidity and mortality [^1167kzoe].

---

## Standard treatment options for cushing disease

The **standard treatment options** for Cushing disease include:

- **Transsphenoidal surgery**: First-line therapy with remission rates of 65–90% for microadenomas and lower for macroadenomas [^1152pcUj].

- **Radiation therapy**: Considered for persistent or recurrent disease after surgery [^1132qgAU].

- **Medical therapy**: Used when surgery is contraindicated, unsuccessful, or as a bridge to radiation [^112jwJFW]; options include pasireotide [^114zdGzv], cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat [^113HwKEL], and mifepristone [^1122NkDV].

---

## Evidence regarding leuprolide in cushing disease

There is **no evidence supporting leuprolide for Cushing disease**. It does not suppress ACTH or cortisol in corticotroph adenomas, and no clinical trials or case reports support its use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **do not recommend leuprolide for Cushing disease**. The Endocrine Society [^1119fkhW] and other expert groups endorse surgery first [^1152pcUj], with medical therapy (pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mifepristone) for persistent or recurrent disease [^112jwJFW].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of leuprolide

Leuprolide has significant side effects, including:

- **Hot flashes and night sweats**: Common with sex steroid suppression.

- **Decreased libido and sexual dysfunction**: Due to reduced sex hormones.

- **Bone density loss**: Increased osteoporosis risk with long-term use.

- **Mood changes and depression**: Reported with chronic therapy.

- **Injection site reactions**: Local irritation and discomfort.

These risks are unacceptable given the **lack of efficacy in Cushing disease**.

---

## Comparison with other medical therapies

Compared to approved therapies, leuprolide is **ineffective for ACTH/cortisol control**. Pasireotide [^114zdGzv], cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat [^113HwKEL], and mifepristone have demonstrated efficacy and are guideline-supported [^1119fkhW] [^112jwJFW].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Leuprolide is **not effective for Cushing disease** and is not recommended by guidelines. Management should follow established pathways: surgery first [^1152pcUj], with medical therapy (pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mifepristone) for persistent or recurrent disease [^1119fkhW] [^112jwJFW].

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, particularly in terms of indications for treatment, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the avoidance of treatment to reduce cortisol levels or block the action of cortisol in patients who do not exhibit specific signs of Cushing's Syndrome, yet have only borderline biochemical abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The benefit of treatment to normalize cortisol levels is not established in this context.

### Osilodrostat: A review of recent clinical studies and practical recommendations for its use in the treatment of Cushing disease [^113HwKEL]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Cushing disease (CD) is characterized by chronic hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Surgery remains the first-line treatment option; however, medical therapy is essential if surgery is contraindicated, fails to achieve remission, or when recurrence occurs after surgical remission. Osilodrostat (Isturisa), a novel steroidogenic inhibitor, is now approved for the treatment of CD in the United States and Cushing syndrome in Europe. We review pharmacology and data on the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of osilodrostat and provide guidance on its use in treating patients with CD.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature and published clinical trial data of osilodrostat use in patients with Cushing syndrome. Detailed information related to the clinical assessment of osilodrostat use, potential drug-to-drug interactions, drug initiation, dose titration, and the monitoring of drug tolerability were discussed.

- **Results**: Clinical trial data demonstrated that osilodrostat, by virtue of inhibiting 11-β hydroxylase, potently and rapidly decreased the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and sustained these reductions, with improved glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and quality of life, as well as lessened depression. Osilodrostat may interact with certain drugs, resulting in QT prolongation, which requires careful assessment of concomitant medications and periodic monitoring using electrocardiogram, respectively. The common adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency, hypokalemia, edema, and hyperandrogenic symptoms.

### Clinical consequences of Cushing's syndrome [^111ZH7iT]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that correction of hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome (CS) may not lead to complete remission of the clinical abnormalities associated with this condition. In particular, elevated cardiovascular risk may persist in "cured" CS patients long-term after eucortisolism has been reached. This is believed to be related to the maintenance of visceral obesity and altered adipokine secretory pattern, which perpetuate features of metabolic syndrome, including impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and hypercoagulability. Nephrolithiasis and incomplete recovery of bone mineral density have also been described in "cured" CS patients. Moreover, previous exposure to excess cortisol may have irreversible effects on the structures of the central nervous system controlling cognitive function and mood. Thus, sustained deterioration of the cardiovascular system, bone remodeling, and cognitive function may be associated with high morbidity and poor quality of life in CS patients in remission for many years.

Although mortality in "cured" CS patients may not differ from that in the general population, data beyond 20 years of follow-up are very scarce; therefore, further studies evaluating larger cohorts for longer follow-up periods are needed to draw definitive conclusions on longevity. Life-long monitoring is mandatory in CS patients in order to control long-term complications of previous cortisol excess and possibly normalize life expectancy.

### What is the best approach to suspected cyclical Cushing syndrome? Strategies for managing Cushing's syndrome with variable laboratory data [^115UwS2F]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cyclical Cushing's syndrome is a pattern of hypercortisolism in which the biochemistry of cortisol production fluctuates rhythmically. This syndrome is often associated with fluctuating symptoms and signs and is now being increasingly recognized. The phenomenon is important because, if not recognized, it can lead to errors in diagnosis, differential diagnosis of the syndrome, and assessment of therapeutic outcomes. The techniques, criteria, protocols, and dynamic biochemical tools to detect cycling in patients with hypercortisolism are discussed, as are the strategies for diagnosing and managing this important subgroup of patients with hypercortisolism.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease [^111a3729]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), caused by excess adrenocorticotropin secretion from tumorous pituitary corticotrophs, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The primary, definitive therapy for patients with CD is selective pituitary adenomectomy, generally performed via a transsphenoidal approach. Medical therapy has an important adjunctive role in the management of patients with CD, including preoperative preparation in patients with severe disease and temporizing management of hypercortisolism while awaiting the effects of radiation therapy in patients who are not in remission postoperatively. Medical therapy can also be used in patients with hypercortisolism of unclear origin or in the few patients who decline or are unfit for surgery.

Available medical options for patients with CD include centrally acting agents such as cabergoline and pasireotide, steroidogenesis inhibitors like ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, and etomidate, and a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone. Pasireotide and mifepristone have recently been granted regulatory approval in some countries for use in patients with CD, whereas other medications are used "off label" in this patient population. Since clinical trials using comparator agents have not been reported, the choice between different medications is based on patient characteristics and preference.

Despite impressive advances in pharmacotherapy for patients with CD, much remains to be done. The long-term efficacy and safety of medical therapies for hypercortisolism need to be evaluated, and the role of combination therapy requires further exploration.

### Diagnostic workup of Cushing's syndrome [^111pVGyT]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare but detrimental endocrine disorder. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential since the duration of hypercortisolism has an adverse impact on the extent of comorbidities and overall survival. The diagnostic approach involves a stepwise process that includes screening and confirming the diagnosis, and establishing the aetiology of CS. The tests currently used to confirm the diagnosis of CS include urinary free cortisol measurements, the dexamethasone suppression test, and late-night salivary cortisol or midnight serum cortisol measurements. None of these tests are ideal; all have pitfalls and require careful interpretation.

Following confirmation of CS, measurement of ACTH discriminates between ACTH-dependent and non-ACTH-dependent causes of CS. Adrenal imaging provides clues for the aetiology of non-ACTH-dependent forms. Differentiation between the ACTH-dependent forms that involve pituitary corticotroph adenomas and ectopic ACTH sources is more complex and includes pituitary MRI imaging, the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, and the CRH test. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling may also be utilized, and when required, imaging modalities are used to detect ectopic ACTH-secreting lesions. This review, which is part of a special issue on "Update of Cushing's syndrome: 100 years after Minnie G", provides an update on our diagnostic workup for the confirmation and differential diagnosis of CS.

### Cushing disease: Highlighting the importance of early diagnosis for both de novo and recurrent disease in light of evolving treatment patterns [^1161CLV2]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to highlight and summarize literature on Cushing disease (CD)-related morbidity and mortality, focusing on residual complications after "cure" and the changing role of pharmacologic therapy in CD.

- **Methods**: Journal articles on the consequences of untreated or undertreated CD, CD recurrence, and recent trends in CD treatment were collected from PubMed searches. These were analyzed in combination with the authors' clinical experience.

- **Results**: Timely recognition and treatment of de novo and recurrent CD remain a singular clinical challenge. Chronic excess cortisol exposure leads to potentially irreversible sequelae and death, stressing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Disease relapse after primary pituitary adenomectomy is prevalent, and recurrence may manifest decades after initial surgery. An increased risk for mortality and hypercortisolism-related complications in postsurgical CD patients may indicate persistent subclinical disease and further underscores the need for cautious, ongoing observation and testing. Potential long-term pharmacologic treatment options, such as pasireotide and mifepristone, have recently emerged. These options may provide biochemical and symptomatic remission for those with refractory CD or those for whom surgery is contraindicated.

- **Conclusion**: Delays in CD diagnosis, management, and follow-up are common and lead to increased adverse metabolic complications and mortality. Rapid recognition and treatment, as well as vigilant monitoring, are therefore essential. Following surgical treatment, some patients may suffer from persistent complications.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome with osilodrostat: Practical applications of recent studies with case examples [^112Vxt6H]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

- **Increased testosterone with osilodrostat and drug-drug interactions**: A 26-year-old female patient with Cushing's disease (CD) had hirsutism at diagnosis. Because of persistent disease post-surgery, she initiated osilodrostat 2 mg BID. Six months after treatment initiation, the patient reported mild worsening of hirsutism. She did not want to take an additional medication and was comfortable using local hair removal methods. Testosterone levels were monitored, initially increased, but subsequently returned to baseline one year after treatment initiation, with no further intervention beyond local hair removal. Hirsutism gradually improved and was milder than at baseline.

	- After a year, she developed cluster headaches and was recommended to start verapamil. She remembered being advised to discuss all newly prescribed medications with her endocrinologist before therapy start. After the potential interactions between osilodrostat and verapamil were explained, including that her osilodrostat dose would likely be reduced, she decided to ask her neurologist for an alternative treatment for headache in order to not decrease the osilodrostat dose, which was controlling her CD very well.

### Cushing's disease: Current medical therapies and molecular insights guiding future therapies [^116NNAXv]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) can lead to significant morbidity due to hormonal sequelae or mass effect from the pituitary tumor. A transsphenoidal approach to resection of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma is the first-line treatment. However, when patients are unable to undergo surgery, experience acute hypercortisolism, or have refractory disease, medical therapy becomes crucial. The authors performed a systematic review to highlight the efficacy of medical treatment of CD and discuss novel molecular insights that could guide the development of future medical treatments for CD.

A search on medical therapies for CD was conducted. Once individual medical therapeutic agents for CD were identified, each agent underwent a formal systematic search. The phrase "(name of agent) and Cushing's" was used as a search term in PubMed for all years up to 2014. The abstract of each article was reviewed for studies evaluating the efficacy of medical treatment of CD. Only studies enrolling at least 20 patients were included in the review.

A total of 11 articles on six individual agents were included in this review. Specific medical therapies were categorized based on their level of action:

- **Pituitary directed**: cabergoline and pasireotide
- **Adrenal/steroidogenesis directed**: ketoconazole, metyrapone, and mitotane
- **End-tissue directed/cortisol receptors**: mifepristone

The studies identified consisted of a mix of retrospective reviews and small clinical trials. Only pasireotide and mifepristone have shown significant efficacy.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1138Pz6h]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Cushing's syndrome, and more specifically with respect to general principles, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend monitoring patients for comorbidities that are associated with cortisol excess. These comorbidities include psychiatric disorders, diabetes, hypertension, hypokalemia, infections, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and poor physical fitness. The guidelines emphasize managing these conditions appropriately to improve patient outcomes.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uGron]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome in clinical practice, concerning cortisol secretion, improvement of clinical symptoms, and quality of life. Additionally, the study assesses the occurrence of side effects associated with these medical therapies.

A comprehensive search was conducted across eight electronic databases in March 2017 to identify potentially relevant articles. The eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated the effectiveness of medical treatment in patients with Cushing's syndrome. The results were presented as pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals.

In this meta-analysis, 35 articles encompassing a total of 1520 patients were included. The majority of patients had Cushing's disease. The pooled percentage of patients achieving normalization of cortisol levels ranged from 35.7% for cabergoline to 81.8% for mitotane in Cushing's disease. Patients on medication monotherapy experienced a lower percentage of cortisol normalization compared to those using multiple medical agents (49.4% vs. 65.7%), with even higher rates observed in patients with concurrent or previous radiotherapy (83.6%). Mild side effects were reported in 39.9% of patients, while severe side effects occurred in 15.2% of patients following medical treatment. Due to insufficient data, no meta-analyses were conducted on clinical symptom improvement or quality of life.

This meta-analysis demonstrates that medication effectively induces cortisol normalization in a significant proportion of patients. Therefore, medical treatment is a viable option for Cushing's disease patients, particularly when surgery is contraindicated.

### Ketoconazole [^111eHC8R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings, and its use for these indications is not approved by the FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, have also been reported.

### Signifor [^114zdGzv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A Phase III, multicenter, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of Signifor over a 6-month treatment period in patients with Cushing's disease. These patients had either persistent or recurrent disease despite pituitary surgery or were de novo patients for whom surgery was not indicated or who had refused surgery.

Patients with a baseline 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized to receive a Signifor dosage of either 0.6 mg subcutaneously twice a day or 0.9 mg subcutaneously twice a day. After three months of treatment, patients with a mean 24-hour UFC of less than or equal to 2.0 times the ULN and below or equal to their baseline values continued blinded treatment at the randomized dose until month six. Patients who did not meet these criteria were unblinded, and the dose was increased by 0.3 mg twice a day. After the initial six months in the study, patients entered an additional six-month open-label treatment period. The dosage could be reduced by 0.3 mg twice a day at any time during the study for intolerability.

A total of 162 patients were enrolled in this study. The majority of patients were female (78%) and had persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease despite pituitary surgery (83%) with a mean age of 40 years. A few patients (4%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median value of the baseline 24-hour UFC for all patients was 565 nmol/24 hours (normal range 30 to 145 nmol/24 hours). About two-thirds of all randomized patients completed 6 months of treatment.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1174CXFh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for treating Cushing's syndrome.

Participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The European Society for Endocrinology co-sponsored the guideline.

The Task Force used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

The Task Force achieved consensus through one group meeting, several conference calls, and numerous email communications. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

Treatment of Cushing's syndrome is essential to reduce mortality and associated comorbidities. Effective treatment includes the normalization of cortisol levels or action. It also includes the normalization of comorbidities via directly treating the cause of Cushing's syndrome and by adjunctive treatments (e.g. antihypertensives). Surgical resection of the causal lesion(s) is generally the first-line approach. The choice of second-line treatments, including medication, bilateral adrenalectomy, and radiation therapy (for corticotrope tumors), must be individualized to each patient.

### The treatment of Cushing's disease [^112EzLrW]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), or pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, is a severe endocrine disease caused by a corticotroph pituitary tumor and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery, which results in disease remission in approximately 78% of patients and relapse in about 13% during the 10-year period after surgery. Therefore, nearly one-third of patients experience long-term surgical failure and require additional second-line treatment.

Patients with persistent or recurrent CD require additional treatments, including pituitary radiotherapy, adrenal surgery, and/or medical therapy. Pituitary radiotherapy is effective in controlling cortisol excess in a large percentage of patients, but it poses a considerable risk of hypopituitarism. Adrenal surgery rapidly and definitively controls cortisol excess in nearly all patients but induces adrenal insufficiency.

Medical therapy has gained importance due to the recent development of novel compounds able to control cortisol secretion or action. Currently, medical therapy is used in several contexts:

- **As a presurgical treatment**: Particularly for severe disease.
- **As a postsurgical treatment**: In cases of surgical failure or incomplete tumor resection.
- **As bridging therapy**: Before, during, and after radiotherapy while waiting for disease control.
- **As primary therapy**: In selected cases, mainly when surgery is not an option.

The adrenal-directed drug ketoconazole is the most commonly used drug due to its effectiveness.

### Medical combination therapies in Cushing's disease [^113fWYJo]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

There has been growing interest in medical therapy for the management of Cushing's disease (CD), particularly in cases of persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of adrenal steroidogenesis, is the most widely used drug, while cabergoline and pasireotide are the most promising centrally acting agents. This review article aims to highlight the options for medical treatment of CD, with special emphasis on combination therapies — a topic only addressed by a limited number of studies.

- **Conclusions**: According to these studies, combination therapies involving medications with additive or synergistic effects on ACTH and cortisol secretion are quite attractive. They offer a higher probability of long-term control of hypercortisolism at lower doses and a lower incidence of side effects, possibly leading to a reduced rate of treatment escapes. Currently, ketoconazole, cabergoline, and pasireotide are considered the best drugs to prescribe in combination.

### Management of Cushing disease [^1132qgAU]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cushing disease is caused by a corticotroph tumor of the pituitary gland. Patients with Cushing disease are usually treated with transsphenoidal surgery, as this approach leads to remission in 70–90% of cases and is associated with low morbidity when performed by experienced pituitary gland surgeons. Nonetheless, among patients in postoperative remission, the risk of recurrence of Cushing disease could reach 20–25% at 10 years after surgery. Patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing disease might, therefore, benefit from a second pituitary operation — which leads to remission in 50–70% of cases — radiation therapy to the pituitary gland, or bilateral adrenalectomy. Remission after radiation therapy occurs in approximately 85% of patients with Cushing disease following a considerable latency period. Interim medical therapy is generally advisable after patients receive radiation therapy because of the long latency period.

Bilateral adrenalectomy might be considered in patients who do not improve following transsphenoidal surgery, particularly those who are very ill and require rapid control of hypercortisolism, or those wishing to avoid the risk of hypopituitarism associated with radiation therapy. Adrenalectomized patients require lifelong adrenal hormone replacement and are at risk of Nelson syndrome. The development of medical therapies with improved efficacy might influence the management of this challenging condition.

### Low immediate postoperative serum-cortisol nadir predicts the short-term, but not long-term, remission after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease [^116qVGdS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The lack of international consensus on the definition of cure after transphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease complicates the interpretation of reported outcomes. Most authors consider the clinical resolution of symptoms and one or more biochemical parameters, including the normalization of 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, low late-night saliva cortisol, normal midnight serum cortisol, or suppression of cortisol following a low-dose dexamethasone test. Due to this lack of consensus and the heterogeneity of patient populations, there is considerable variation in the reported immediate postoperative remission rate, ranging from 55% to 95%. The best outcomes are observed in patients with non-invasive microadenomas, achieving cure rates as high as 93%, with a marked reduction in remission rates correlating with increasing tumor diameter and extrasellar extension. Our findings, showing 84% in remission at three months and 95% in remission at one year, align with existing literature. Notably, all of our patients completed follow-up, whereas in other studies, up to 30% of patients were lost to follow-up, potentially biasing the results.

In this study, with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (68 months), five out of 19 patients experienced a late recurrence. This high recurrence rate (26%) may represent the "natural, but underreported, history of the disease" or reflect the consequences of our surgical practice. Few complications were recorded, with no surgical complications and only three patients developing new hormonal deficits, indicative of a cautious approach.

### Updates on the role of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors in Cushing's syndrome: a focus on novel therapies [^117E2JHH]. Pituitary (2016). Low credibility.

Subclinical adrenal Cushing's syndrome

Though controversial, subclinical Cushing's syndrome (CS) or mild adrenal hypercortisolism is defined as a subtle hypersecretion of cortisol that does not fully manifest in a clinical phenotype. However, subclinical CS may be associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, or coronary heart disease due to chronic cortisol elevation; this association has not been conclusively demonstrated.

Due to the sparse data around the treatment of subclinical CS, treatment guidelines vary. Some guidelines recommend adrenalectomy, particularly for patients with worsening comorbidities, while others advocate for careful monitoring of the patient. While the optimal treatment for these patients is not clear, steroidogenic inhibitors are not currently recommended for the treatment of subclinical CS. There is a clear need for more studies evaluating the best course of treatment for these patients. For instance, administering steroidogenesis inhibitors as a first-line treatment might obviate the need for adrenalectomy in patients who have bilateral adrenal disease, have contraindications, or refuse surgery, if their comorbidities improve with medical treatment.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116k6MmB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, specifically concerning pituitary-directed therapy, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering pituitary-directed medical treatments, such as cabergoline and pasireotide, in patients with Cushing's disease who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery.

### Evaluation and treatment of Cushing's syndrome [^113szUmV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome results from sustained pathologic hypercortisolism caused by excessive corticotropin (ACTH) secretion by tumors in the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease, 70%) or elsewhere (15%), or by ACTH-independent cortisol secretion from adrenal tumors (15%). The clinical features are variable, and no single pattern is seen in all patients. Features most specific for Cushing's syndrome include abnormal fat distribution, particularly in the supraclavicular and temporal fossae, proximal muscle weakness, wide purple striae, and decreased linear growth with continued weight gain in a child. Patients with characteristics of glucocorticoid excess should be screened with measurements of saliva or urine cortisol or dexamethasone suppression testing. The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome should be followed by the measurement of plasma ACTH concentration to determine whether the hypercortisolism is ACTH-independent.

In ACTH-dependent patients, bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling with measurement of ACTH before and after administration of ACTH-releasing hormone most accurately distinguishes pituitary from ectopic ACTH secretion. Surgical resection of the tumor is the optimal treatment for all forms of Cushing's syndrome. Bilateral adrenalectomy, medical treatment, or radiotherapy are considered in inoperable cases. The medical treatment of choice is ketoconazole. The prognosis is better for Cushing's disease and benign adrenal causes of Cushing's syndrome than for adrenocortical cancer and malignant ACTH-producing tumors.

### New avenues in the medical treatment of Cushing's disease: Corticotroph tumor targeted therapy [^114MxQYx]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Medical therapies targeting the corticotroph adenoma represent a relatively new avenue in the long-term treatment of patients with Cushing's disease who are unsuitable for surgery or who fail to achieve long-term disease control post-surgery. Drugs targeting adrenal steroid synthesis have been in use for many years but have not been prospectively studied and do not target the underlying pituitary tumor. A glucocorticoid receptor blocker could be a valuable asset in selected patients, but it is relatively complicated to use due to the absence of a biochemical marker, and there are potential adverse reactions inherent to the mechanism of action.

Pasireotide, a multiligand somatostatin analog, is the first pituitary-directed agent shown to effectively reduce cortisol levels and improve disease symptoms in a large, prospective phase 3 clinical trial. Further investigation is needed, however, to clarify optimal management approaches for pasireotide-associated hyperglycemia. The dopamine agonist cabergoline has shown some promise in a small, open-label trial (and one retrospective trial), but randomized, controlled trials with this agent have not been conducted. A combination of lower doses of pasireotide with dopamine agonists or adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors (e.g. a combination of low-dose pasireotide/cabergoline/ketoconazole) may increase the proportion of patients whose disease can be controlled while minimizing adverse effects.

Finally, further research into patterns of receptor expression in corticotroph adenomas may lead to an increased understanding of the disease.

### Consensus on diagnosis and management of Cushing's disease: a guideline update [^114JBNRw]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease requires accurate diagnosis, careful treatment selection, and long-term management to optimize patient outcomes. The Pituitary Society convened a consensus workshop comprising more than 50 academic researchers and clinical experts to discuss the application of recent evidence to clinical practice.

In advance of the virtual meeting, data from 2015 to the present about screening and diagnosis; surgery, medical, and radiation therapy; and disease-related and treatment-related complications of Cushing's disease summarized in recorded lectures were reviewed by all participants. During the meeting, concise summaries of the recorded lectures were presented, followed by small group breakout discussions. Consensus opinions from each group were collated into a draft document, which was reviewed and approved by all participants.

Recommendations regarding the use of laboratory tests, imaging, and treatment options are presented, along with algorithms for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and management of Cushing's disease. Topics considered most important to address in future research are also identified.

### New developments in the medical treatment of Cushing's syndrome [^115hFZkk]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a severe endocrine disorder characterized by chronic cortisol excess due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, ectopic ACTH production, or a cortisol-producing adrenal neoplasia. Regardless of the underlying cause, untreated CS is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Surgery is the primary therapy for all causes of CS, but surgical failure and ineligibility of the patient to undergo surgery necessitate alternative treatment modalities.

The role of medical therapy in CS has been limited because of lack of efficacy or intolerability. In recent years, however, new targets for medical therapy have been identified both at the level of the pituitary gland (e.g. somatostatin, dopamine, and epidermal growth factor receptors) and the adrenal gland (ectopically expressed receptors in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia). In this review, results of preclinical and clinical studies with drugs that exert their action through these molecular targets, as well as already established medical treatment options, will be discussed.

### Cushing's disease: Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors [^1147Ed4P]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest changing treatment if cortisol concentrations are persistently elevated after 2–3 months on maximum tolerated doses. If the treatment response is only partially achieved, with cortisol reduction without normalization, or in cases of severe disease, a combination therapy approach may be considered. Considering the potential pituitary tumor growth concern, careful monitoring of ACTH levels and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging every 6–12 months after initiating treatment, and thereafter every few years, are suggested.

All steroidogenesis inhibitors may be associated with the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency due to transient overtreatment, especially with potent drugs and particularly during the dose-titration period performed to achieve cortisol normalization. Although a clinical condition suggestive of adrenal insufficiency may be induced by a rapid decrease of cortisol levels, this is often caused by the most potent and rapid drugs, representing, however, a cortisol withdrawal syndrome more than a real adrenal insufficiency. In patients with severe disease, requiring starting treatment with high doses, and in patients not eligible for surgery, a block-and-replace regimen, consisting of treating patients with a combined medical approach with adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and exogenous glucocorticoids, may be considered. This approach, particularly useful in cases of infrequent routine assessments, may reduce the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency. However, caution is required to avoid iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome.

In conclusion, the landscape of medical therapy for Cushing's disease continues to evolve, emphasizing the critical role of personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patient needs.

### Prolactinomas, Cushing's disease and acromegaly: Debating the role of medical therapy for secretory pituitary adenomas [^117Jnn3c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment goals in Cushing's disease include the reversal of clinical features, the normalization of cortisol levels with minimal morbidity while preserving pituitary function and long-term disease control without recurrence. In the small number of patients with macroadenomas, removal of the tumor mass is another treatment goal.

The initial treatment of choice for Cushing's disease is generally selective pituitary adenomectomy by an experienced, dedicated pituitary surgeon. Second-line therapy includes more radical surgery, radiation therapy, including stereotactic radiosurgery, medical therapy, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Cure rates in patients with Cushing's disease 10 years after pituitary surgery or radiotherapy are approximately 77% and 55%, respectively. Although bilateral adrenalectomy is a definitive treatment providing immediate control of hypercortisolism, patients require lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy, and up to 25% of patients develop Nelson's syndrome or at least regrowth of the underlying pituitary adenoma.

Nelson's syndrome is the aggressive growth of a pituitary corticotroph adenoma after bilateral adrenalectomy and is associated with symptoms such as skin hyperpigmentation, headache, and visual impairment, which arise due to the mass effect of the tumor and increased ACTH secretion. Close monitoring by regular MRI scans and measurement of plasma ACTH levels should be undertaken to detect the occurrence of corticotroph tumor progression. Early detection offers the possibility of cure by surgery (microadenoma) or radiotherapy.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^116TdReV]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a corticotroph, adrenocorticotropic-hormone (ACTH) — secreting pituitary adenoma resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Transsphenoidal surgery is the initial treatment of choice in almost all cases. Remission rates for microadenomas are good at 65–90% (with an experienced neurosurgeon), but remission rates are much lower for macroadenomas. However, even after postoperative remission, recurrence rates are high and can be observed up to decades after an initial diagnosis. Repeat surgery or radiation can be useful in these cases, although both have clear limitations with respect to efficacy and/or side effects. Hence, there is a clear unmet need for an effective medical treatment.

Currently, most drugs act by inhibiting steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. Most is known about the effects of ketoconazole and metyrapone. While effective, access to ketoconazole and metyrapone is limited in many countries, experience with long-term use is limited, and side effects can be significant. Recent studies have suggested a role for a pituitary-directed therapy with new multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs (e.g. pasireotide, recently approved in Europe for treatment of CD), second-generation dopamine agonists, or a combination of both. Mifepristone (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) is another promising drug, recently approved by the FDA for treatment of hyperglycemia associated with Cushing's syndrome.

We review available medical treatments for CD with a focus on the two most recent compounds referenced above.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VSDbE]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Based on the study, medication can be regarded as a valuable alternative to pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease patients with contraindications to surgery, patients with a recurrence considering repeat surgery, and patients who choose not to undergo surgery. For all other Cushing's disease patients, pituitary surgery remains the first-choice treatment.

For other etiologies of Cushing's syndrome, at present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend when to use medical treatment to lower cortisol levels. However, from the total group of patients, it suggests that medical agents have similar effectiveness in normalizing cortisol levels for all etiologies of Cushing's syndrome. For a higher chance of treatment success, a different medical agent could be tried if there is no treatment effect or if the patient experiences side effects. There is no evidence for which drug should be used first. Based on the study, mitotane or metyrapone seems to be most effective in normalizing cortisol levels, but they also cause the highest percentage of patients with side effects.

In conclusion, we consider medical treatment for Cushing's disease a reasonable option in patients with contraindications to surgery, with a recurrence, or who choose not to have surgery. Patients who experience side effects or no treatment effect should be advised to start treatment with a different medical agent to increase the chance of treatment success.

### Cushing's syndrome: Epidemiology and developments in disease management [^115ZbEmF]. Clinical Epidemiology (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Cushing's syndrome:

- **Definition**: Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from chronic exposure to excess corticosteroids, characterized by obesity, moon face, facial plethora, and hypertension.

- **Pathophysiology**: CS is caused by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production from a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease; 75–80%), ACTH production from nonpituitary tumors (ectopic ACTH syndrome; 15–20%), and corticotropin-releasing hormone-producing tumors (< 1%).

- **Disease course**: Corticosteroid excess results in CS, which causes clinical manifestations such as:
	- **Appearance and skin changes**: obesity, moon face, supraclavicular/dorsocervical fat pads, hirsutism, alopecia, facial plethora, violaceous striae, acne, easy bruising.
	- **Reproductive and sexual effects**: menstrual irregularity, decreased libido.
	- **Psychiatric and cognitive effects**: emotional lability, depression, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction.
	- **Musculoskeletal effects**: muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, osteopenia, fractures.
	- **Growth in children**: decreased linear growth.
	- **Metabolic and cardiovascular effects**: hypertension, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis.
	- **Renal effects**: nephrolithiasis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CS is associated with a standard mortality ratio of 3.7 (95% CI 2.3–5.3).

### Management of recurrent and refractory Cushing disease [^112J98fx]. Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Cushing disease is most frequently caused by pituitary adenomas that secrete adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice in patients with these tumors because of reported remission rates of 69–93%. More challenging for neurosurgeons and endocrinologists, however, is the management of the remaining patients whose Cushing disease is refractory to initial transsphenoidal surgery or recurs after initial remission. Here, we review the treatment options and the latest surgical, medical, and radiosurgical advances for patients who have persistent or recurrent Cushing disease after transsphenoidal surgery.

### Efficacy of medical treatment in Cushing's disease: A systematic review [^112HL8Ec]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to systematically analyze the efficacy of medical therapies for Cushing's disease (CD) and to assess the strength of the supporting evidence, as reported rates of response to medical therapies used in CD vary widely.

- **Methods**: Systematic PubMed searches were conducted to identify studies of medical treatment in CD. The GRADE criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence supporting each medication.

- **Results**: Fifteen studies were included in the review. Ten of these studies specifically reported response rates for patients with CD. Pasireotide was the only treatment assessed in a randomized trial and was supported by a 'moderate' level of evidence. Response rates with pasireotide from three prospective studies ranged from 17–29%. The remaining medications were supported by a 'low' or 'very low' level of evidence. The highest response rates were reported in small retrospective studies of metyrapone (75%, one study) and mitotane (72%, one study). Response rates were 25–50% for cabergoline (four studies) and 45% for ketoconazole (one study). Among studies that included patients with other forms of Cushing's syndrome, response rates were 53–88% for ketoconazole (three studies), 70% for mitotane (one study), 57% for metyrapone (one study), and 38–60% for mifepristone. Again, all of these medications are supported by a 'low' level of evidence.

- **Conclusions**: There is a paucity of high-quality studies on medical therapy in CD, with only one medication achieving a 'moderate' level of evidence. Caution should be employed when comparing efficacy rates due to the variability in studies.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t4nnD]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Study selection**: The initial search identified 960 potentially relevant articles. An additional article was found through references of included articles, yielding a total of 961 articles. By screening these articles by title and abstract, 874 articles were excluded. The remaining 87 articles were reviewed in detail, with reasons for exclusion summarized in Fig. 1. In total, 35 articles were included, reporting on six different drugs.

- **Study characteristics**: We included five studies on mitotane, two on pasireotide, three on cabergoline, eight on ketoconazole, five on metyrapone, two on mifepristone, and ten on multiple medical agents. Studies were published between 1971 and 2017. There were eleven single-arm trials, two randomized trials with two treatment arms (pasireotide 600 µg vs. pasireotide 900 µg; first cabergoline, then add ketoconazole vs. first ketoconazole, then add cabergoline), and 22 cohort studies. We included eighteen studies on pituitary Cushing's disease only, two on ectopic Cushing's syndrome only, and fifteen on Cushing's syndrome patients due to various underlying etiologies. In total, 1520 patients were included.

There were 28 articles measuring normalization of cortisol by at least urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or a low dose dexamethasone test (88% of 32 articles reporting normalization of cortisol as an outcome). Twenty-five studies reported on clinical improvement, and three studies reported on quality of life outcomes.

### Innovative approaches to improve the success of pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: A cost-effectiveness perspective [^111Xu4WS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Costs of all therapies were calculated with a bottom-up cost analysis, including operating time, hospital stay, and treatment-specific actions and equipment. Operating time and hospital stay were derived from internal reports of our hospital (Radboud University Medical Center). Costs corresponding to operating time were derived from a cost analysis of a conventional operating room. Costs of follow-up consults, hospital days, and medical imaging were based on the Dutch guidelines for health economic modeling. The number of follow-up consults that a patient received was based on expert opinion (A.V.).

Costs for pathology and diagnostic tests were derived from administrative registers from the Department of Neurosurgery at our hospital. We assumed that 33.5% of patients were hydrocortisone dependent after pituitary surgery, of which 58% were only temporarily dependent. The proportion of patients requiring hormone substitution for any type of hypopituitarism was based on a study from Wagenmakers et al. The proportion of patients requiring ketoconazole after irradiation, as well as the proportion of hypopituitarism before and after (stereotactic) irradiation, was derived from a large international multicenter study. Costs for Nelson syndrome, which occurs in around 28% of patients after bilateral adrenalectomy, are very patient-dependent. Therefore, we assumed that these patients received an extra pituitary surgery, the primary choice of treatment for patients with Nelson syndrome.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: When and how [^111KoyX6]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for Cushing's disease; however, medical treatment can be administered to a significant proportion of patients with this rare condition. This is particularly applicable in cases of severe hypercortisolism, where medical treatment is provided either for a short period to prepare the patient for surgery or on a long-term basis following unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery, or while awaiting the maximal beneficial effect of radiation techniques. These various circumstances necessitate the precise control of hypercortisolism.

Severe hypercortisolism is often managed using a block and replace strategy, in which substitutive treatment is administered following the induction of adrenal insufficiency. Mild hypercortisolism, the more common scenario, is typically treated through a titration approach involving a progressive increase in dosage. This method requires assurance of eucortisolism, as patients may undergo treatment for an extended duration.

This review outlines the primary situations warranting medical treatment, along with strategies for monitoring to prevent the long-term consequences of mild hypo- or hypercortisolism.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122NkDV]. Pituitary (2018). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Eligibility criteria for this systematic review included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that assessed the effectiveness of FDA/EMA approved medical treatments for Cushing's syndrome. This included cases both de novo and with persistent or recurring disease. Cabergoline, used in multiple investigator-initiated clinical trials for Cushing's syndrome, was also considered. The medical agents evaluated were ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone. Articles were excluded if they reported broad inclusion categories without distinguishing the subgroup of Cushing's patients or if the study included only children (age < 18 years). To minimize the risk of selection bias, each treatment group needed to include at least ten patients. In cases where multiple articles described (partially) overlapping populations, the article with the largest study population was included. Articles not available online were requested by contacting their authors. Only articles published in English were considered.

- **Search strategy**: To identify potentially relevant articles, searches were conducted systematically in March 2017, in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, COCHRANE Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, LWW, and ScienceDirect, in cooperation with a specialized librarian (refer to Online Resource 1 for the complete search strategy). The search was repeated in PubMed in May 2017. Additionally, references of the included articles were reviewed to increase the number of potentially eligible articles.

### Medical management pathways for Cushing's disease in pituitary tumors centers of excellence (PTCOEs) [^1177VUB5]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenoma and is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The annual incidence of CD is 1.5 per million, and the prevalence is 57 cases per million, with a female predominance. Despite its rare occurrence, the disorder is associated with commonly encountered comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypercoagulability, osteoporosis and fractures, impaired glucose metabolism, and immune and growth suppression.

Higher mortality rates reported in CD, mainly due to cardiovascular causes, were associated with persistent disease. However, long-term sequelae of hypercortisolism may persist even years after successful CD treatment. Hence, prompt diagnosis and management of the disease are essential to optimize patient outcomes. The treatment goal is to achieve disease remission and long-term control ideally without occurrence of hypopituitarism.

The recommended first-line therapy is selective transsphenoidal surgical resection of the ACTH-secreting adenoma. Remission rates after surgery are dependent on surgeon expertise and may reach 83% for microadenomas and 68% for macroadenomas in PTCOEs. A significant subset of adenomas is so small that they are not visible on high-quality imaging. Although surgical exploration after confirmation by bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling or corticotropin-releasing hormone/high-dose (8 mg) dexamethasone suppression test is the first line, medical treatment is an alternative option.

### Current management of Cushing's disease [^115nYFv1]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a pituitary tumor that autonomously secretes adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), leading to excess cortisol secretion from the adrenal glands. The condition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, which can be mitigated by treatments that result in sustained endocrine remission. Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery (TSS) remains the mainstay of treatment for CD but requires considerable neurosurgical expertise and experience to optimize patient outcomes. Up to 90% of patients with microadenomas (tumor below 1 cm in largest diameter) and 65% of patients with macroadenomas (tumor at or above 1 cm in greatest diameter) achieve endocrine remission after TSS by an experienced surgeon.

Patients who are not in remission postoperatively, or those who relapse, may benefit from undergoing a second pituitary operation. Alternatively, radiation therapy to the sella with interim medical therapy, or bilateral adrenalectomy, can be effective as definitive treatments of CD. Medical therapy is currently adjunctive in most patients with CD and is generally prescribed to patients who are about to receive radiation therapy and will be awaiting its salutary effects. Available treatment options include steroidogenesis inhibitors, centrally acting agents, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. Several novel agents are in clinical trials and may eventually constitute additional treatment options for this serious condition.

### Medical management pathways for Cushing's disease in pituitary tumors centers of excellence (PTCOEs) [^114VXgEZ]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

A recent update of consensus guidelines for the management of Cushing's disease (CD) included indications for medical therapy. However, there is limited evidence regarding their implementation in clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate medical therapy approaches by expert pituitary centers through an audit conducted to validate the criteria of Pituitary Tumors Centers of Excellence (PTCOEs) and provide an initial standard of medical care for CD.

Based on the activities of nine international PTCOEs between 2018 and 2020, we evaluated patients under medical treatment and their biochemical control rates.

The median number of active patients with CD per center was 117 (range 35–279), with a median of 10 new patients with CD managed annually in the endocrinology units of PTCOEs (range 4–42). The median percentage of patients with CD receiving medical treatment was 13.3% (range 4.8–82.9). Ketoconazole was the most frequently used drug, with a median rate of usage of 26.5% (range 5–66.7) of those receiving medical therapy. The median rates of metyrapone and pasireotide use were 17.2% (range 0–50) and 9.3% (range 0–51.7), respectively. For cabergoline and osilodrostat therapy, the median rates of use were 2.8% (range 0–33.3) and 1.7% (range 0–25), respectively. Combination therapy was reported to be utilized in 13.6% (range 0–45.5) of medically treated patients. Mifepristone was used in a single center, representing 1.1% of its medically treated patients. Overall, the median control rate in patients with CD receiving medical treatment was 75% (range 10–100).

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VLXtt]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of this study was the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome. It is represented by the pooled percentage of patients reaching normalization of cortisol secretion, defined according to the authors, after medical treatment, patients showing symptom improvement, improved well-being, and improved quality of life. Main analyses were performed in studies reporting on pituitary Cushing patients. Separate analyses were conducted for publications reporting on (1) mixed etiologies other than adrenocortical carcinomas, (2) mixed etiologies including adrenocortical carcinomas, and (3) ectopic Cushing only, if sufficient data were available. Studies were categorized according to the type of medical agent: ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone. Studies using more than one of the aforementioned medical agents at the same time or consecutively were assessed separately.

For the normalization of cortisol, all measurements of cortisol were considered. However, measurements of urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or morning cortisol following a low-dose dexamethasone test were considered low risk of bias. Data on the reduction of cortisol as a percentage of baseline were not considered for analysis.

Secondary outcomes were the pooled percentages of patients with mild or severe side effects, stratified by medical agent. Severe side effects were those that required therapy adjustment or withdrawal, as well as all side effects categorized as severe by the authors.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ppzwt]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

We used a component approach to assess the risk of bias for all included studies. The following components were included, which could potentially bias a reported association between medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome and outcomes:

- **Inclusion of patients**: Consecutive inclusion from all patients eligible or a random sample is considered low risk of bias.
- **Loss to follow-up**: Less than 5% is considered low risk of bias.
- **Criteria for diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome adequately reported**: As outlined below.
- **Outcome measurement for cortisol normalization**: Urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or a low dose dexamethasone test is considered low risk of bias.
- **Reporting of outcome definition**: Detailed below.
- **Description of protocol for laboratory measurements**: Detailed below.
- **Description of dose and duration of intervention**: See below.

As criteria for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome vary widely over time, by study center, and by underlying etiology, adequately reporting the criteria used for diagnosis is considered a low risk of bias. Reporting of outcome definition is considered adequate if the article at least mentioned which outcome was studied, which test was used to determine the outcome, and if applicable, which cortisol level had to be measured. Description of protocol for laboratory measurements is considered adequate if the assay used for measuring cortisol is reported, or the assay for the main outcome if this was not cortisol. Description of dose and duration of intervention is considered adequate if dose (per day or per week) and duration of medical treatment are detailed.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114EtEfs]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

No difference was shown in the normalization of cortisol between patients using medical agents as primary treatment versus secondary treatment, suggesting that the effectiveness of medical agents is independent of other treatment modalities. A higher percentage of patients reaches normalization of cortisol in studies where a small portion of included patients received medication preoperatively (including patients with contraindications to surgery and patients after previous surgery) than in studies where a large portion of included patients received medication before elective surgery. The most likely explanation is that in patients with planned surgery, medication is given to control cortisol excess, and surgery is performed before complete normalization of cortisol occurs. Unfortunately, we don't know the average time until cortisol normalization, as this was not reported by most articles.

Total follow-up time was not different for studies with a high percentage of medical pre-treatment before surgery (average 0.1–11.5 years) compared to all included studies. It would be interesting to know if the effectiveness of surgery is dependent upon the normalization of cortisol with medical treatment before surgery compared to presurgical medical treatment without cortisol normalization and compared to no presurgical medical treatment at all. Especially in pituitary Cushing's disease, the percentage of patients with preoperative medical treatment that reaches cortisol normalization is low. This might be due to the higher expectations of surgery in pituitary Cushing's disease compared to other etiologies.

### Cushing's disease: Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors [^115kQRvk]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor, is the most common form of Cushing's syndrome (CS), accounting for approximately 70% of cases. CD requires prompt diagnosis, adequate treatment selection, and long-term management to limit the duration of hypercortisolism and long-term complications and to improve patient outcomes. Pituitary surgery is the first-line option; however, it is non-curative in one-third of patients, necessitating additional treatments.

Medical therapy has recently acquired an emerging role with the availability of several drugs with different therapeutic targets, efficacy, and safety profiles. The review focuses on the efficacy and safety of steroidogenesis inhibitors, specifically the historical drugs ketoconazole and metyrapone, and the novel drugs levoketoconazole and osilodrostat, which seem to offer rapid, sustained, and effective disease control.

- **Ketoconazole and its uses**: Ketoconazole should be preferred in females and in patients without severe liver disease. Levoketoconazole may offer an alternative to classical ketoconazole, characterized by higher potency and potentially lower hepatotoxicity compared to ketoconazole.
- **Metyrapone considerations**: Metyrapone should be preferred in males and in patients without severe or uncontrolled hypokalemia. Both ketoconazole and metyrapone might be better suited for short-term rather than long-term treatment.
- **Osilodrostat's role**: Osilodrostat may represent the best choice for long-term treatment, especially in patients with poor compliance to the multiple daily administration schedule and in patients without severe liver disease.

Overall, the emergence of these drugs marks significant progress in the medical management of Cushing's disease.

### Approach to the Cushing's disease patient with persistent/recurrent hypercortisolism after pituitary surgery [^1134J4sG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Although it is the ideal treatment, pituitary surgery is not always successful, and success is not always lasting. Close surveillance, both clinical and biological, is necessary to detect immediate failure or late recurrence. The underlying reasons must be thoroughly explored, adhering to the rule that the patient should be offered the best surgery by expert hands, and a repeat surgical attempt must be systematically considered.

When repeat pituitary surgery is not indicated or has failed, the task becomes selecting from a variety of options that target different aspects of the condition:

- **Suppress tumor ACTH**:
	- Through pituitary radiotherapy (conventional or stereotaxic).
	- With medications such as somatostatin analogs (pasireotide) or dopaminergic drugs (cabergoline).
- **Suppress adrenocortical activity**:
	- With medications including inhibitors of adrenal steroidogenesis (ketoconazole or metyrapone) or the adrenolytic Lysodren.
	- By surgical intervention, such as bilateral adrenalectomy.
- **Oppose peripheral cortisol action**:
	- Using the antiglucocorticoid mifepristone.

No single treatment option is ideal, capable of simultaneously providing a high success rate, prompt onset of action, restoration of a normal pituitary-adrenal axis, and good tolerability. Close follow-up and comprehensive evaluation of the cortisolic status are crucial, as they may eventually necessitate a change in treatment options or combined strategies over time. Several major parameters, including tumor status and potential oncogenic threat, the severity of hypercortisolism, and the patient's perspectives, such as wishing for fertility, can aid in guiding a multidisciplinary approach.

### Pituitary-directed medical therapy in Cushing's disease [^1122LZLS]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery remains the first-line therapy in Cushing's disease, but a large number of patients will not be cured, or the disease will recur over time. Repeat pituitary surgery, bilateral adrenalectomy, and radiation have limitations with respect to efficacy and/or side effects. Therefore, there is a clear need for an effective medical treatment.

The studies reviewed here suggest a role for pituitary-directed therapies, applying multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs like pasireotide or second-generation dopamine agonists. Retinoic acid has also been studied in a small prospective study. These compounds target ACTH secretion at the pituitary level and possibly inhibit corticotrope proliferation. Specific side effects of these compounds need to be considered, especially when used as long-term therapy.

These novel approaches could provide options for the treatment of patients in whom surgery has failed or is not possible, and while awaiting the effects of radiation therapy. The preoperative use of these compounds to decrease cortisol excess, potentially reducing perioperative complications, needs to be further studied.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111HCyxg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, and specifically in relation to corticosteroid antagonists, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a corticosteroid antagonist, such as mifepristone, in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease following transsphenoidal selective adenomectomy.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^114cP9tt]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

In a recent case report, a dramatic drop in elevated UFC levels in a patient treated with pasireotide 600 μg bid was observed, leading to symptomatic and biochemical hypocortisolism. Prior to pasireotide, the patient had UFC levels approximately 1.5–2-fold above normal, despite three surgical attempts and radiotherapy. After 10 months of reduced pasireotide therapy (300 μg bid), the patient continued to demonstrate improved mood, stable weight, and normal UFC levels. Bode et al. reported a female patient with a giant adenoma initially treated by transcranial resection. Due to a symptomatic relapse and tumor recurrence, the patient received stereotactic radiosurgery followed by bilateral adrenalectomy. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with a pituitary carcinoma, as several intracranial and spinal metastases developed. She started on temozolomide, with another dramatic rise in ACTH levels (from 88 μg/dL).

### Cushing's syndrome: Important issues in diagnosis and management [^113qDmdP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of Cushing's syndrome are challenging problems in clinical endocrinology. We focus on critical questions addressing screening for Cushing's syndrome, differentiation of Cushing's subtypes, and treatment options.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid's MEDLINE (1996 through April 2006) was used to search the general literature. We also relied on previously published reviews and a recent monograph and cite a mix of primary articles and recent reviews.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although this article represents our opinion, it draws heavily on a recent consensus statement from experts in the field and a recent monograph on Cushing's syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: We concluded that:
	1) Measurement of late-night or bedtime salivary cortisol is a useful approach to screen for Cushing's syndrome.
	2) Measurement of suppressed plasma ACTH by immunometric assay is useful to differentiate ACTH-dependent and -independent Cushing's syndrome.
	3) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH should be performed in patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in whom a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging is normal or equivocal (in the absence of a pituitary ACTH gradient, prolactin levels should be measured to confirm the integrity of venous sampling).
	4) Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy should be performed in patients with the occult ectopic ACTH syndrome.
	5) Patients with Cushing's disease should be referred to a neurosurgeon with extensive experience operating on corticotroph microadenomas.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112T4RUk]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatment in routine clinical practice for Cushing's syndrome. Medical treatment was effective in normalizing cortisol levels in Cushing's syndrome in 35.7% (cabergoline) to 81.8% (mitotane) of patients. Furthermore, the combined use of medical agents at the same time or consecutively increased the percentage of patients with normalized cortisol secretion to 65.7%. Importantly, medical agents for hypercortisolism can cause severe side effects, leading to therapy adjustment or withdrawal in 4.8% (cabergoline) to 28.4% (mitotane) of patients. These results suggest that medical therapy can be considered a reasonable treatment alternative to the first-choice surgical treatment when considering treatment effectiveness and side effects.

This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of all medical agents currently used in clinical practice for Cushing's syndrome. Only one previous study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of two medical agents in Cushing's syndrome. Daniel et al. studied the normalization of cortisol after monotherapy with ketoconazole or metyrapone and found that urinary free cortisol normalized in 60% (ketoconazole) and that normalization of hypercortisolism, as defined by the authors, occurred in 75% of patients using metyrapone. This aligns with the results obtained in this study (49.0–71.1% for ketoconazole and 60.0–75.9% for metyrapone, depending on patient categories). Since our last search in May 2017, one more research article on…

### Discontinuation of drug treatment in Cushing's disease not cured by pituitary surgery [^113DxyC8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

When transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) does not cure Cushing's disease (CD), four treatments are available: drug treatment (DT), second TSS (2nd TSS), bilateral adrenalectomy (BA), and pituitary radiotherapy (PR). DT is attractive but requires long-term continuation, which we aimed to evaluate.

- **Design and methods**: This retrospective study was conducted in a center prioritizing the 2nd TSS. It included 36 patients, 19 with TSS failure and 17 with recurrence, out of 119 patients with CD treated by a first TSS. The average follow-up was 6.1 years (95% confidence interval: 5.27–6.91). Control was defined as the normalization of urinary free cortisol (UFC), and final treatment (FT) was the treatment allowing control at the last follow-up. Discontinuation rates of DT in published CD prospective clinical trials were also analyzed.

- **Results**: Control was achieved in 33 out of 36 patients (92%). DT was initiated in 29 out of 36 patients (81%), allowing at least one normal UFC in 23 out of 29 patients (79%), but was discontinued before the last follow-up in 18 out of 29 patients (62%). DT was FT in 11 out of 29 patients (38%), all treated with cortisol synthesis inhibitors. Second TSS was FT in 8 out of 16 (50%), BA in 14 out of 14 (100%), and PR in 0 out of 5. In published trials, the discontinuation rate of DT ranged from 11% to 51% at one year and 32% to 74% before five years.

- **Conclusion**: DT allowed at least one normal UFC in 23 out of 29 patients (79%) but achieved long-term control in only 11 out of 29 (38%), as the discontinuation rate was high, although similar to published data. Interestingly, a successful 2nd TSS was the cause for discontinuing efficient and well-tolerated DT in five patients. Further studies will be necessary to investigate this issue further.

### Levoketoconazole in the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study (LOGICS) [^115N25gb]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare endocrine disease caused by chronic overproduction of cortisol, most commonly due to a benign pituitary corticotroph tumor, known as Cushing's disease (CD). Patients with endogenous CS have multiple associated comorbidities and increased mortality risk, primarily as a result of cardiovascular complications and infections. Surgery to remove the inciting tumor is usually the first-line treatment for CS of pituitary (CD), adrenal, or ectopic etiologies. However, persistent or recurrent disease after initial pituitary surgery is common, requiring second-line treatments in patients with CD.

Medical therapy may be used prior to surgery, while awaiting the effects of radiation therapy, when surgery is contraindicated, when a tumor cannot be found, and when biochemical remission is not achieved with surgery and/or radiation. Available medical therapies for CS vary by mechanism of action and include:

- **Pituitary-directed drugs (for CD)**: pasireotide, cabergoline.
- **Cortisol synthesis inhibitors**: levoketoconazole, osilodrostat, ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane (adrenolytic).
- **Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist**: mifepristone.

It is generally agreed that medical needs in CS remain high despite the availability of approved drug treatments.

### Ppar-gamma in Cushing's disease [^115935hX]. Pituitary (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of pituitary tumors that cause Cushing's disease are small (< 1 cm diameter), and most of the disease morbidity is due to the effects of elevated, non-suppressible, ACTH levels that these tumors secrete. Tumor-derived ACTH leads to adrenal-derived steroid hypersecretion and results in many disabling and sometimes life-threatening symptoms, including abnormal fat deposition, skin thinning, psychological disturbances, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness. Cushing's disease is associated with high morbidity and ultimately mortality.

In experienced specialized centers, 70% of corticotroph microadenomas can be successfully resected by transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. However, surgical "cure" rates for larger ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are achieved in only 30% of cases, and recent reports highlight a significant recurrence rate after longer-term follow-up even in smaller tumors. Post-surgical persistence of ACTH hypersecretion may require pituitary-directed radiation. However, this treatment may take some time to be effective and, like extensive surgical pituitary tumor resection, ultimately leads to partial or total hypopituitarism in approximately 80% of cases.

Although hypercortisolism may be completely resolved by adrenalectomy, this procedure does not suppress and may act as a stimulus to pituitary tumor growth, and is associated with other comorbidity. Although some currently available drug-based treatments for Cushing's disease effectively control hypercortisolism, their drawback is that they do not impact pituitary tumor growth.

### Cushing's disease: Role of preoperative and primary medical therapy [^111DDTsB]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment for Cushing's disease. However, some situations may require the use of a primary medical treatment, such as in patients with severe life-threatening hypercortisolism. This situation can be managed by using fast-acting steroidogenesis inhibitors instead of classical bilateral adrenalectomy. Primary medical treatment could also be considered in patients with non-severe hypercortisolism, but the evidence is far less convincing for its systematic use.

The aim of this short review is to briefly explain the different circumstances in which primary medical therapy could be considered, the limits of this approach, and the way in which to initiate and monitor the treatment.
