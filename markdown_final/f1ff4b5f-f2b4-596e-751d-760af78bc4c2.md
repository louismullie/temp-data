## Question

impetigo treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about impetigo treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its usual pathogens. Then, I should classify disease severity and define when to use topical versus oral therapy. Next, I will select first-line topical options and dosing, followed by oral regimens for extensive disease and MRSA coverage. After that, I should consider special populations and public health strategies in endemic settings. Finally, I will integrate antimicrobial stewardship, prevention, and follow-up, and close with a concise algorithm summary anchored to guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and microbiology. Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial bacterial skin infection with two forms, nonbullous and bullous, most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and less often Streptococcus pyogenes, with etiology varying by geography and season, and bullous disease typically reflects staphylococcal exfoliative toxins disrupting the dermal–epidermal junction [^112X4A5b] [^111UwMAV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I classify severity. I need to ensure I distinguish limited disease, where topical therapy is appropriate, from widespread disease, where oral therapy is indicated to reduce transmission and improve practicality. IDSA defines "numerous lesions" as an indication for oral therapy, and many pediatric algorithms consider more than about 10 lesions or involvement beyond a small area as widespread, though exact thresholds vary and should be individualized to lesion burden and feasibility of topical application [^114PmY5J] [^11699DEX].

> Next, I should review first-line topical options and dosing. Mupirocin 2% applied two to three times daily for 5 to 7 days is a standard choice with robust evidence and FDA labeling, and retapamulin 1% twice daily for 5 days is an equally effective alternative endorsed by IDSA. Ozenoxacin 1% twice daily for 5 days is a newer topical with strong RCT data and activity against MRSA, which can be valuable where mupirocin resistance is a concern, though cost and access may limit use in some settings [^113icsrx] [^114qSjpk] [^116kxG6g] [^114iNUF3].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy claims. Cochrane analyses show topical antibiotics are superior to placebo and that mupirocin and fusidic acid have similar cure rates, with mupirocin sometimes outperforming oral erythromycin. Retapamulin RCTs demonstrate superiority to vehicle and noninferiority to fusidic acid, and ozenoxacin trials show faster microbiologic clearance and clinical success versus vehicle, supporting its role when resistance or tolerability are priorities [^115zLZM6] [^115E1uKR] [^116kxG6g].

> I will now examine oral therapy for extensive disease. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, dicloxacillin or cephalexin for 7 days is first-line, with amoxicillin–clavulanate as an alternative when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected. If MRSA is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 7 days are recommended, with clindamycin also providing antitoxin effects and TMP-SMX offering streptococcal coverage though it is less reliable for S. pyogenes. I should double-check that penicillin monotherapy is not recommended unless cultures show streptococci alone, given frequent S. aureus involvement [^115Bo85M] [^114PmY5J] [^115SYZbY].

> But wait, what if the patient is a young child or pregnant. I need to ensure age-appropriate choices: ozenoxacin is labeled down to 2 months, retapamulin is approved from 9 months, and mupirocin is widely used in infants. For pregnancy, topical therapy is preferred to avoid systemic exposure, and if oral therapy is unavoidable, beta-lactams such as cephalexin are generally considered safe. I should confirm that macrolides are avoided in infants when possible due to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis risk, and that local resistance patterns guide selection [^116kxG6g] [^114qSjpk].

> Next, I should review special settings, particularly endemic regions where scabies coinfection is common. In highly endemic Pacific settings, short-course oral co-trimoxazole has proven noninferior to intramuscular benzathine penicillin for impetigo, and ivermectin-based mass drug administration for scabies reduces impetigo prevalence by roughly 60–90% at 12 months, with azithromycin add-on not clearly improving outcomes and transiently increasing macrolide resistance. I need to emphasize that these systemic strategies are population-level and not substitutes for individualized care in nonendemic settings [^1144JPKm] [^115EXVY8] [^114XJ2kJ].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship principles. Topical therapy minimizes systemic adverse effects and resistance pressure, and many guidelines still under-specify topical options despite comparable or superior efficacy to oral agents in limited disease. I should confirm that antiseptics alone are not recommended due to insufficient benefit, and that clinicians avoid low-efficacy topicals like bacitracin or neomycin when better options exist, reserving antiseptics for adjunctive hygiene rather than monotherapy [^111FX78s] [^1165hdmc] [^115zLZM6].

> I need to ensure prevention and follow-up are addressed. Patients are generally noninfectious after about 12 hours of appropriate therapy and should cover lesions to limit spread. Hand hygiene, daily laundering of linens, and trimming nails reduce autoinoculation. In outbreaks of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic therapy is recommended to eradicate nephritogenic streptococci. I should also counsel that impetigo can heal spontaneously but treatment accelerates resolution and reduces complications and transmission [^11373vYG] [^113A99Y3].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic workup. Routine cultures are not required for typical presentations, but I should obtain cultures in atypical, severe, recurrent, or outbreak settings, or when treatment fails, to guide therapy and detect resistance. If cultures yield streptococci alone, penicillin becomes appropriate, whereas mixed or S. aureus–predominant infections warrant antistaphylococcal coverage [^115sBtfH] [^1168FRtF] [^115SYZbY].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the algorithm: for limited disease, use a topical antibiotic such as mupirocin, retapamulin, or ozenoxacin for 5–7 days. For widespread disease, use an oral agent active against S. aureus and streptococci for 7 days, choosing dicloxacillin or cephalexin if MSSA is likely, and doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP-SMX if MRSA risk is present. In endemic scabies-prevalent communities, consider co-trimoxazole or population-level ivermectin-based MDA to reduce impetigo burden. Throughout, align choices with local resistance patterns, minimize systemic therapy when topical will suffice, and reinforce hygiene and return-to-school precautions [^114PmY5J] [^1144JPKm] [^115EXVY8] [^11373vYG].

---

Impetigo is treated with **topical antibiotics for limited disease** (mupirocin 2% or retapamulin 1% twice daily for 5 days) [^113icsrx] [^114qSjpk] and **oral antibiotics for extensive or bullous disease** (cephalexin or dicloxacillin for 7 days; use clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX if MRSA is suspected) [^115Bo85M] [^114PmY5J]. Ozenoxacin 1% is a newer topical option with low resistance and short 5-day course [^116kxG6g] [^113HfApa]. Hygiene measures (gentle cleansing, avoiding sharing towels, trimming nails) and lesion coverage reduce spread [^11373vYG]; most cases resolve in 7–10 days, but recurrence is common without adherence [^notfound].

---

## Topical antibiotic therapy

Topical antibiotics are **first-line for limited, non-bullous impetigo** because they are effective, well tolerated, and minimize systemic exposure [^11715gzp] [^115zLZM6].

| **Medication** | **Dosage and administration** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Mupirocin 2% ointment/cream | Apply to affected areas twice daily for 5 days [^113icsrx] | - Effective against S. aureus and S. pyogenes [^114mS8a4] <br/> - Superior to placebo and comparable to oral erythromycin [^117T1puF] [^115zLZM6] |
| Retapamulin 1% ointment | Apply to affected areas twice daily for 5 days [^113icsrx] | - Noninferior to fusidic acid [^115E1uKR] <br/> - Superior to placebo [^116e4xcC] |
| Ozenoxacin 1% cream | Apply to affected areas twice daily for 5 days [^116kxG6g] | - Rapid bactericidal activity <br/> - Low resistance potential <br/> - Effective against MRSA [^113HfApa] |

---

## Systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic therapy is indicated for **extensive disease (> 10 lesions), bullous impetigo, immunocompromised patients, or when topical therapy is impractical** [^11699DEX] [^114PmY5J].

| **Medication** | **Dosage and administration** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | 250 mg orally four times daily for 7 days [^115Bo85M] | - Effective against MSSA and streptococci [^115SYZbY] <br/> - First-line oral agent [^115Bo85M] |
| Dicloxacillin | 250 mg orally four times daily for 7 days [^115Bo85M] | - Effective against MSSA and streptococci [^115SYZbY] <br/> - First-line oral agent [^115Bo85M] |
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally four times daily for 7 days [^112qQN5r] | - Effective against MRSA and streptococci [^115SYZbY] <br/> - Alternative for penicillin allergy [^115SYZbY] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^112kB2T3] | - Effective against MRSA [^115SYZbY] <br/> - Alternative for penicillin allergy [^115SYZbY] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily for 7 days [^112kB2T3] | - Effective against MRSA [^115SYZbY] <br/> - Alternative for penicillin allergy [^115SYZbY] |

---

## Adjunctive measures and prevention

Adjunctive measures are essential to **reduce transmission and recurrence**:

- **Hygiene**: Gentle cleansing with soap and water, avoiding sharing towels, and trimming nails [^11373vYG].
- **Lesion coverage**: Cover lesions to prevent spread [^11373vYG].
- **Return to school**: Children can return after 24 hours of therapy or when lesions are dry and covered [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice depends on **severity, lesion extent, patient age, local resistance, and allergies**. Topical therapy is preferred for limited disease, whereas systemic therapy is reserved for extensive or bullous cases or when topical therapy is impractical [^11715gzp] [^114PmY5J].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Ozenoxacin shows promise due to its **low resistance potential and short course** [^116kxG6g] [^113HfApa]. Minocycline foam is under investigation and may offer a convenient pediatric option [^116zn4jC]. Mass drug administration for scabies has reduced impetigo prevalence in endemic settings, though this is not standard for individual care [^115EXVY8].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most cases resolve within 7–10 days, but recurrence is common without adherence. Complications are rare but include **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis** and cellulitis [^11373vYG].

---

Impetigo treatment is tailored to disease extent and patient factors, with **topical therapy for limited disease** and **systemic therapy for extensive or bullous cases**. Hygiene and lesion coverage are critical to prevent spread and recurrence.

### International comparison of guidelines for management of impetigo: a systematic review [^111FX78s]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial skin infection that affects people worldwide and is usually treated with antibiotics; therefore, its management has implications for global antibiotic stewardship.

Objective

This systematic review and narrative synthesis compares and contrasts international impetigo management guidelines.

Methods

Guidelines for treatment of impetigo that were produced by a national authority; available to primary care physicians; and published since 2008 were included. Following a comprehensive search strategy, data extraction from eligible studies was performed independently in duplicate. Details of antiseptic and antibiotic treatment; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment; and conservative management and preventative measures were tabulated and analysed descriptively.

Results

Fifty-one guidelines were included from 42 different countries. All guidelines recommended systemic antibiotics, 78% of these only for widespread lesions or failure of topical antibiotic treatment. The first-line systemic antibiotic treatment was restricted to narrow-spectrum options in 21 (41%) whilst 7 (14%) recommended only broad-spectrum antibiotics first-line. Thirty-four (67%) guidelines included recommendations for topical antibiotic use. Twenty guidelines (39%) did not mention antiseptic treatment for impetigo. Guidelines did not always provide clear indications for different treatment options.

Conclusions

Despite potentially equal efficacy to systemic antibiotics, only two-thirds of guidelines include topical antibiotic options. Many fail to include recommendations for non-antibiotic treatments such as antiseptics, preventative measures and conservative management, despite potential for antibiotic-sparing. Provision of clear definitions of disease severity and indications for treatment would enhance the ability of clinicians to adhere to recommendations.

### Do antimicrobial resistance patterns matter? An algorithm for the treatment of patients with impetigo [^11699DEX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly occurring in young children, but adults may also be affected. The superficial skin infection is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and less frequently by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide concern and needs to be addressed when selecting treatment for impetigo patients. An evidence-based impetigo treatment algorithm was developed to address the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

Methods

An international panel of pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists employed a modified Delphi technique to develop the impetigo treatment algorithm. Treatment recommendations were evidence-based, taking into account antimicrobial stewardship and the increasing resistance to oral and topical antibiotics.

Results

The algorithm includes education and prevention of impetigo, diagnosis and classification, treatment measures, and follow-up and distinguishes between localized and widespread or epidemic outbreaks of impetigo. The panel adopted the definition of localized impetigo of fewer than ten lesions and smaller than 36 cm² area affected in patients of two months and up with no compromised immune status. Resistance to oral and topical antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of impetigo such as mupirocin, retapamulin, fusidic acid, have been widely reported.

Conclusions

When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to know the local trends in antibiotic resistance. Ozenoxacin cream 1% is highly effective against S. pyogenes and S. aureus, including methycyllin-susceptible and resistant strains (MRSA), and may be a suitable option for localized impetigo.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(2):134–142. doi:10.36849/JDD.5475

### Treatment of impetigo and antimicrobial resistance [^116RM17S]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a contagious bacterial infection that affects the superficial skin layers. Increasing worldwide antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to existing topical agents commonly prescribed to treat impetigo is central to treatment failure. The Worldwide Health Organization developed a global action plan on AMR, but omitted information about AMR stewardship programs for topical antibiotics.

Objectives

The review aims to provide information to clinicians and stakeholders regarding AMR and antimicrobial stewardship on topical antimicrobial drugs for impetigo treatment.

Methods

The literature searches reviewed the status of AMR to current topical antibiotics in impetigo, current therapeutic behavior, and concordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles. Two international panels convened to discuss the output of the searches, and the results of the panel discussions were used in the development of the manuscript.

Results

The literature search included clinical trials, research studies, clinical guidelines, consensus papers, and reviews (if they provided original data), published between January 2008 and May 2019. The articles were selected based on clinical relevancy of impetigo management, clinical efficacy, and safety of the treatment and antimicrobial resistance. The searches resulted in one-hundred and ninety-eight articles. After applying the eligibility criteria, nineteen articles met inclusion criteria and were considered in the present review.

Conclusions

While published antimicrobial stewardship guidelines have focused on systemic antibiotics, few studies have attempted to evaluate topical antibiotic prescribing practices for impetigo treatment. Many of the topical impetigo treatments currently in use have developed resistance. The appropriate use of topical ozenoxacin can help eradicate impetigo while minimizing AMR.J Drugs Dermatol. 20(4):366–372. doi:10.36849/JDD.5795.

### Treatment of impetigo in the pediatric population: consensus and future directions [^113KZvir]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. Treatment of localized lesions can be achieved through topical antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are reserved for extensive disease. Increasing antimicrobial resistance to existing therapies have raised concerns. Antimicrobial stewardship, achieved through the responsible use of antibiotics, is an important measure to re-duce bacterial resistance. This review highlights treatment options for impetigo and shares consensus statements to help guide the management of impetigo in the pediatric population.

Objective

An expert panel of dermatologists and pediatricians convened in February 2019 to establish evidence-based consensus on the management of impetigo in the pediatric patient population.

Methods

The consensus was created in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Prior to the consensus meeting, a systematic literature review was conducted, with the selected literature deemed clinically relevant to the consensus statements. Statements were further refined and assessed systematically following established standards. The consensus process consisted of a modified Delphi approach. The consensus was established through a minimal 75% &ldquo; agree&rdquo; rate.

Results

Thirteen consensus statements were developed addressing clinical challenges, existing treatment options and their limita-tions, and new therapeutic alternatives.

Conclusion

Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in treating impetigo has been reported. Antimicrobial stewardship is critical to optimize patient outcomes and to prevent the development of resistance. Healthcare providers should be aware of local resistance patterns in impetigo to help guide therapy. The use of newer safe and effective topical antibiotic alternatives as a first-line treatment should be an important step in antimicrobial stewardship.J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(3): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.4679.

### Interventions for impetigo [^115zLZM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this. For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08). There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference. Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.

### Emerging treatment strategies for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings: a systematic review [^117Mwt3m]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Impetigo affects approximately 162 million children worldwide at any given time. Lack of consensus on the most effective treatment strategy for impetigo and increasing antibiotic resistance continue to drive research into newer and alternative treatment options. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings.

Methods

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase via Scopus for studies that explored treatments for bullous, nonbullous, primary, and secondary impetigo published between August 1, 2011, and February 29, 2020. We also searched online trial registries and hand-searched the reference lists of the included studies. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias (version 2.0) tool for randomized trials and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for nonrandomized uncontrolled studies to assess the risk of bias.

Findings

We included 10 studies that involved 6651 participants and reported on 9 treatments in the final analysis. Most clinical trials targeted nonbullous impetigo or did not specify this. The risk of bias varied among the studies. In nonendemic settings, ozenoxacin 1% cream appeared to have the strongest evidence base compared with retapamulin and a new minocycline formulation. In endemic settings, oral co-trimoxazole and benzathine benzylpenicillin G injection were equally effective in the treatment of severe impetigo. Mass drug administration intervention emerged as a promising public health strategy to reduce the prevalence of impetigo in endemic settings.

Implications

This review highlights the limited research into new drugs used for the treatment of impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings. Limited recent evidence supports the use of topical ozenoxacin or retapamulin for impetigo treatment in nonendemic settings, whereas systemic antibiotics and the mass drug administration strategy have evidence for use in endemic settings. Given the troubling increase in resistance to existing treatments, there is a clear need to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics and to develop new treatments and alternative strategies; this is particularly important in endemic settings.

### Impetigo and scabies-disease burden and modern treatment strategies [^112ifSnG]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Impetigo and scabies both present different challenges in resource-limited compared with industrialised settings. Severe complications of these skin infections are common in resource-limited settings, where the burden of disease is highest. The microbiology, risk factors for disease, diagnostic approaches and availability and suitability of therapies also vary according to setting. Taking this into account we aim to summarise recent data on the epidemiology of impetigo and scabies and describe the current evidence around approaches to individual and community based treatment.

### Interventions for impetigo [^114bYxtN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938–1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949–1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.

Side Effects

The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.

### Common community-acquired bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections in children: an intersociety consensus on impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis treatment [^116E6F7f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The main objective of this article was to offer practical suggestions, given the existing evidence, for identifying and managing bacterial impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis in ambulatory and hospital settings.

Methods

Five Italian pediatric societies appointed a core working group. In selected conditions, specially trained personnel evaluated quality assessment of treatment strategies according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology. MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched with a strategy combining MeSH and free text terms.

Findings

The literature review included 364 articles focusing on impetigo, skin abscess, and cellulitis/orbital cellulitis. The articles included for quality assessment according to the GRADE methodology for impetigo comprised 5 RCTs and 1 observational study; for skin abscess, 10 RCTs and 3 observational studies were included; for cellulitis and erysipelas, 5 RCTs and 5 observational studies were included; and for orbital cellulitis, 8 observational studies were included. Recommendations were formulated according to 4 grades of strength for each specific topic (impetigo, skin abscesses, cellulitis, and orbital cellulitis). Where controversies arose and expert opinion was considered fundamental due to lack of evidence, agreement according to Delphi consensus recommendations was included.

Implications

Based on a literature review and on local epidemiology, this article offers practical suggestions for use in both ambulatory and hospital settings for managing the most common bacterial SSTIs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^114EwzT8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e., impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. The diagnosis usually is made clinically, but rarely a culture may be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve the discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of an organism that may cause other illnesses (e.g., glomerulonephritis). There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. The topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease. Oral penicillin V is seldom effective; otherwise there is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, although resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.

### Treating impetigo in primary care [^114YuHN1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a superficial, but contagious, bacterial infection of the skin that predominantly affects children and is common in primary care. In UK general practice, around half of the people with impetigo are treated with topical fusidic acid. However, bacterial resistance to this antibacterial drug is increasing. Here we discuss how patients with impetigo should be treated.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Bacterial resistance and impetigo treatment trends: a review [^114Vvzdj]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common cutaneous infection that is especially prevalent in children. The prevalence of colonization and infection with resistant strains is continually increasing, forcing clinicians to reevaluate treatment strategies. Newer topical agents are effective in treating infections with resistant strains and may help minimize resistance and adverse effects from systemic agents. Use of topical disinfectants to decrease colonization is an important adjunctive measure. Physicians should be aware of local resistance patterns in impetigo to help guide therapy.

### Treatment of impetigo: oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed [^113wF4zr]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin disease that is frequently seen in children. While data support the use of topical antibiotics for treatment, the medications actually prescribed in practice are not well documented.

Objectives

To determine the prescribing pattern of dermatologists and nondermatologists when treating impetigo and the demographics of the patients treated.

Methods

National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data on office visits for impetigo were analyzed from 1997 to 2007. Patient demographics and the treatments for impetigo were recorded.

Results

During this 10-year period, dermatologists managed an estimated 274,815 impetigo visits and nondermatologists an estimated 3,722,462 visits. Both dermatologists and nondermatologists most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics to treat impetigo. Topical antibiotics were second most common, and a variety of combination treatments were used.

Conclusions

Oral antibiotics are the most common class of medications used to treat impetigo. There is an opportunity for physicians to take advantage of the equally efficacious topical antibiotics for treating impetigo. A shift towards topical antibiotics would likely decrease morbidity (resulting from adverse effects) associated with use of oral agents.

### Efficacy and safety of retapamulin ointment as treatment of impetigo: randomized double-blind multicentre placebo-controlled trial [^116e4xcC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common skin infection, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and mainly occurring in children. It is usually treated topically with antibiotics to achieve a quick cure and prevent spread of the infection. Worldwide, resistance rates of S. aureus against commonly used antibiotics are rising. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections.

Objectives

Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the treatment of primary impetigo.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed.

Results

Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs. 52.1%; P < 0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and 1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively.

Conclusions

This study shows that topical retapamulin is effective and safe in the treatment of primary impetigo, offering a new treatment option.

### Short-course oral co-trimoxazole versus intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo in a highly endemic region: an open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^1144JPKm]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Impetigo affects more than 110 million children worldwide at any one time. The major burden of disease is in developing and tropical settings where topical antibiotics are impractical and lead to rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Few trials of systemic antibiotics are available to guide management of extensive impetigo. As such, we aimed to compare short-course oral co-trimoxazole with standard treatment with intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin in children with impetigo in a highly endemic setting.

Methods

In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, Indigenous Australian children aged 3 months to 13 years with purulent or crusted non-bullous impetigo were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive benzathine benzylpenicillin (weight-banded injection), twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days (4 mg/kg plus 20 mg/kg per dose), or once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days (8 mg/kg plus 40 mg/kg per dose). At every visit, participants were randomised in blocks of six and 12, stratified by disease severity. Randomisation was done by research nurses and codes were in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. Independent reviewers masked to treatment allocation compared digital images of sores from days 0 and 7. The primary outcome was treatment success at day 7 in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12609000858291.

Findings

Between Nov 26, 2009, and Nov 20, 2012, 508 patients were randomly assigned to receive benzathine benzylpenicillin (n = 165 [156 analysed]), twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days (n = 175 [173 analysed]), or once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days (n = 168 [161 analysed]). Treatment was successful in 133 (85%) children who received benzathine benzylpenicillin and 283 (85%) who received pooled co-trimoxazole (absolute difference 0.5%; 95% CI -6.2 to 7.3), showing non-inferiority of co-trimoxazole (10% margin). Results for twice-daily co-trimoxazole for 3 days and once-daily co-trimoxazole for 5 days were similar. Adverse events occurred in 54 participants, 49 (90%) of whom received benzathine benzylpenicillin.

Interpretation

Short-course co-trimoxazole is a non-inferior, alternative treatment to benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo; it is palatable, pain-free, practical, and easily administered.

Funding

### Efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin cream for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: a randomized clinical trial [^116kxG6g]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Ozenoxacin, a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, has been developed as a cream with 1% active drug for the treatment of impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin cream, 1%, after 5-day twice-daily topical treatment in patients with impetigo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial included patients 2 months or older with impetigo who were enrolled at centers in 6 countries from June 2, 2014, through May 30, 2015. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat from July 9 through July 22, 2015.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topical ozenoxacin or placebo control.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

Among the 411 patients who received treatment (210 males [51.1%]; mean [SD] age, 18.6 [18.3] years), ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success compared with placebo, which was evident after 5 days of therapy (112 of 206 [54.4%] vs 78 of 206 [37.9%]; P = 0.001). Ozenoxacin also demonstrated superior microbiological success compared with placebo after 2 days of therapy (109 of 125 [87.2%] vs 76 of 119 [63.9%]; P = 0.002). Ozenoxacin was well tolerated, with 8 of 206 patients experiencing adverse effects, with only 1 of these potentially related to the study treatment; none were serious.

Conclusions and Relevance

Topical ozenoxacin is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of impetigo in patients 2 months and older. This effect is demonstrated by rapid onset of response and superior clinical and microbiological response compared with placebo. Topical ozenoxacin represents a novel option for the treatment of impetigo.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Topical ozenoxacin cream 1% for impetigo: a review [^113HfApa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Impetigo, a bacterial infection that is highly contagious, involves the superficial skin. Topical treatment for impetigo includes amongst other bacitracin, gentamycin, mupirocin, retapamulin, and more recently, ozenoxacin 1% cream. For more severe conditions systemic antibiotics are prescribed and may be combined with a topical treatment. The current review explored the challenges in treating impetigo in pediatric and adult populations and examined the role of ozenoxacin 1% cream as a safe and effective treatment option.

Methods: We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (2010–2018) using the terms impetigo, bullous impetigo, non-bullous impetigo, antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance, mupirocin, retapamulin, and ozenoxacin. The selected publications were manually reviewed for additional resources.

Results: Although guidelines were updated regularly, the recommended treatments have not changed much since 2014. Emerging antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in dermatology and pediatrics. Impetigo therapy choices should consider the resistance pattern of S. aureus. Ozenoxacin 1% cream is a prescription medicine for topical treatment of impetigo in adults and children 2 months or older. Ozenoxacin has a low probability of selecting spontaneous resistant mutants in quinolone-susceptible or quinolone-resistant bacterial strains and has shown to be active against MRSA isolates. Ozenoxacin 1% cream has potent bactericidal activity and was shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of impetigo in two well-controlled Phase 3 trials.

Conclusions: Resistance patterns in a wide range of pathogens against oral or topical antibiotics and antiseptics used for the treatment of dermatological conditions, such as impetigo have been observed. When making treatment decisions for impetigo MRSA and other antimicrobial resistance has to be taken into account. Ozenoxacin 1% cream offers a potent bactericidal activity and has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety. Combined with its favorable features, such as a low dosing frequency and a 5 days treatment regimen, ozenoxacin 1% cream is an important option for the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

### Retapamulin for impetigo and other infections [^115J5gdw]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Last year, we concluded that topical fusidic acid should be first-line treatment for impetigo. Since then, retapamulin ointment (Altargo - GlaxoSmithKline), a new antibacterial, has been licensed in the European Union as a short-term treatment for impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds in people aged 9 months or above. Advertisements claim that the product "treats localised impetigo in just 5 days"; by comparison, the British National Formulary (BNF) advises a 7-day course of fusidic acid. Here we consider the place of retapamulin in impetigo and its other licensed indications.

### Mass drug administration campaigns for scabies and impetigo: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YZe3D]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Information databases

Electronic databases, including CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Medline (Ovid), ProQuest, Science Direct, PubMed and SCOPUS, will be searched for studies, along with the ANZ Clinical Trials Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry. In addition, grey literature will be explored via the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Informit, OaIster database and WHO. Further, the references of the included articles will also be thoroughly screened for relevant articles potentially missed during the main search.

Types of studies to be included

All treatment studies following MDA protocol, including randomised/quasi-controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, cohort studies and case-control studies, will be considered.

Participants/Settings

The review will consider studies that include participants of any age, gender, or country of origin. Studies that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of individual drug treatments for people with diagnosis of scabies and/or impetigo outside MDA will not be considered.

Intervention, exposure

The review will examine any MDA treatment campaigns involving scabicides that aimed to reduce the burden of scabies and associated impetigo. Treatment interventions may include any antiparasitic drug which is known to have therapeutic activity against scabies infestation, including ivermectin, permethrin, benzyl benzoate, lindane, crotamiton, or malathion.

Comparator/control

Studies with any type of comparator will be included, which may include the intervention population prior to intervention, a population from the same setting as the intervention but not exposed to the intervention, or a population exposed to a different scabies control intervention.

Outcomes

The main outcome is the change in prevalence of scabies and impetigo from baseline to follow-up after MDA intervention. Additional outcomes include relief of symptoms, recurrence rate, adherence to treatment or management regimen, patient acceptability of treatment/s, and adverse effects.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal impetigo… [^11373vYG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Both Streptococcus pyogenesand Staphylococcus aureuscan cause non-bullous impetigo.
- Typically, impetigo features papules that evolve into pustules and break down into crusty lesions.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, impetigo is treated with oral or topical antibiotics that target both bacteria.
- Antibiotic treatment and covering lesions are key prevention strategies.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with impetigo. Clinical features Not everyone whose skin becomes colonized will develop impetigo. For those who do, they typically develop multiple skin lesions. Lesion progression The skin lesions progress in the following way:

- Begin as papules
- Evolve to pustules
- Break down into thick, adherent crusty lesions The crusts are typically golden or "honey colored. " Lesion location The lesions usually appear on exposed areas of the body. They most commonly appear on the face and extremities but can occur anywhere on the body.

Treatment Antibiotics are used to treat impetigo: Oral: Use with multiple lesions Topical: Use with only a few lesions Antibiotic treatment should target both group A strep and S. aureus. Complications Rarely, complications can occur after impetigo. Non-suppurative complications Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur as a delayed complication of impetigo. It most often occurs one to two weeks after the original infection resolves. PSGN is thought to be the result of an immune response that is triggered by the group A strep infection. Prevention Antibiotics Antibiotic treatment limits someone's ability to transmit group A strep bacteria. People with impetigo can return to school or work at least 12 hours after initiating antibiotic treatmentA. Their lesions should be covered. Cover lesions People with impetigo should cover their lesions to help prevent spreading the infection to others and to other body parts.

Hygiene Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette can reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria. Clothing, linens, and towels used by someone with impetigo should be washed every day. They shouldn't be shared with others in the household. After they've been washed, they're safe for others to use.

### Prevalence of scabies and impetigo 3 years after mass drug administration with ivermectin and azithromycin [^115eYM1s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of impetigo was substantially lower at 36 months than at baseline. Our data confirm that in this setting, scabies is the major driver for impetigo and that treatment of scabies results in marked declines in impetigo prevalence. At 3 years, the population-attributable fraction burden of impetigo had declined markedly, suggesting that additional interventions beyond ivermectin-based MDA may be necessary to further reduce impetigo prevalence. We previously demonstrated that the addition of single-dose azithromycin administered at the same time as ivermectin as part of MDA does not appear to drive greater reductions in impetigo. It is plausible that the remaining impetigo burden is a result of multiple distinct risk factors and mechanisms, such as skin breaches from localized trauma, insect bites, and fungal and other skin conditions. With a sufficiently low prevalence of impetigo, as achieved following ivermectin-based MDA, a case-management strategy could potentially be used to control residual disease.

At both the 12- and 36-month follow-up visits, the smallest relative reductions in scabies and impetigo prevalence were among children aged 0–4 years, the group who received treatment with permethrin rather than ivermectin. The reductions seen in this age group were similar to those seen in the permethrin MDA arm of the Skin Health Intervention Fiji Trial in Fiji. On an individual level, some data suggest that permethrin is equivalent, if not superior, to ivermectin for the treatment of scabies. However, in an MDA context, reduced adherence or inadequate application of permethrin compared to directly observed therapy with ivermectin might attenuate its efficacy. Collectively, these data highlight the need for additional strategies to target scabies in this high-risk age group. One option may be to lower the minimum age and/or weight limit for ivermectin administration.

Scabies and impetigo — common paediatric infections in resource-limited settings

Scabies is a skin disease that is caused by the acarine itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mite can live inside the host for up to 60 days and have a 17-day life cycle. They can easily spread from person to person via direct or sexual contact and can also spread through non-living objects such as bedding, clothes and even furniture. The global burden of the disease is estimated to be around 200 million, most of which are children living in resource-limited societies. Scabies is a highly infectious and extremely itchy condition that can lead to loss of sleep and reduced quality of life. A more severe form of scabies is known as 'crusted scabies' (also called Norwegian scabies), characterised by thick crusts on the patient's skin, which harbour up to several million scabies mites; they are highly infectious and such cases should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment. This is mostly seen in immunocompromised patients suffering from AIDS or cancer. Despite the efficacy of the individual targeted therapies for treating scabies, it is difficult to contain scabies and its associated complications. Current treatments for scabies, include the first‐line topical permethrin, the second‐line topical benzyl benzoate and the third‐line oral ivermectin. These treatments have been generally effective when the course has been completed properly; however, there remain a number of challenges associated with current treatments. These include poor adherence to treatments, high costs for resource-poor communities, single-drug modality and increasing treatment failure. The possibility of reinfestation remains high when close contacts are not treated, or the disease is endemic in a population. Also, no currently available treatments possess the combined ability to kill eggs, or have a combined antibacterial and anti-inflammatory/anti-itch properties. They are all ineffective at preventing treatment relapse arising from newly hatched mites, and evidence indicates that the mites are becoming increasingly resistant to existing treatments.

### Impetigo incidence and treatment: a retrospective study of Dutch routine primary care data [^11671oit]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of recently published data on impetigo presentation incidence and treatment practices in the routine Western European primary care setting.

Objectives

To investigate impetigo incidence, treatments and recurrence in primary care in the Netherlands.

Methods

A retrospective, observational study. Electronic records of patients treated for impetigo in 2015 at 29 general practices in Utrecht and surrounds were reviewed. An episode of impetigo was defined as one or more patient-doctor contacts within 8 weeks of the index consultation. Within an episode, patient demographics and prescribing patterns were analysed including number of treatments, and the category and sequence of individual medicines.

Results

A total of 1761 impetigo episodes were managed, with an incidence rate of 13.6 per 1000 person years. Impetigo peaked in summer. Most patients, the majority children, experienced a single episode (93%), and 25% had eczema as comorbidity. Topical antibiotics (primarily fusidic acid) were the most prescribed initial treatments (85%), followed by oral antibiotics (14%). Topical antibiotics were progressively used less over subsequent treatments, while there was an inverse increase in oral antibiotic use. Topical fusidic acid as the most common first line treatment seemed satisfactory as only 12% of initial treatments with this drug received further therapy. Repeat treatments generally occurred within 7 days.

Conclusion

This study of impetigo prescribing patterns in primary care highlighted that Dutch general practitioners were generally adherent to national treatment guidelines. Topical treatment, and if needed systemic small-spectrum antibiotic treatment, appeared satisfactory; these findings aid in antimicrobial stewardship.

### Treatment of impetigo… [^116VX7UL]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the best treatments for impetigo. Evidence-Based Answer Topical mupirocin and fusidic acid are more effective than placebo and at least as effective as oral antibiotics for the treatment of limited impetigo, and are better tolerated. Two recent systematic reviews have cast doubt on the traditional role of oral antibiotics as first-line therapy for impetigo. The first, a meta-analysis of 57 trials including 3, 533 patients, studied varying comparisons of 20 oral and 18 topical treatments for impetigo.
4. Topical antibiotics had better cure rates than placebo, and there was no significant difference between the two most studied topical antibiotics, mupirocin and fusidic acid.

Ten of these trials compared mupirocin with oral erythromycin and showed significantly better cure rates with mupirocin. Oral antibiotic therapy caused more side effects than topical therapy. Topical antiseptic agents, which have traditionally been used either alone or in conjunction with other therapies, have not been adequately studied or have not been compared with placebo treatment. Two older studies were found comparing topical antibiotics with antiseptic treatment; pooled data favored topical antibiotic therapy. 5 There was no significant difference found between the two topical antibiotics, mupirocin and fusidic acid. The review included three trials comparing oral erythromycin with these topical antibiotics and found weak evidence favoring topical therapy.

From the limited high-quality evidence available, the authors recommended a seven-day course of topical therapy for healthy patients with limited disease. Clinical Commentary Impetigo is a common condition seen by most family physicians. Although the evidence shows that topical treatment is as good as oral therapy, patient situations still need to be taken into consideration. Some patients apply pressure for physicians to prescribe oral antibiotics. Topical mupirocin is easy to use but must be applied three times per day and can cost about $70 for a 30-gm tube.

### Topical antibacterial agent for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: pooled analysis of phase 3 clinical trials [^111L6Rsh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Ozenoxacin is a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria that has been developed as a 1% cream for treatment of impetigo. This article presents pooled results of pivotal clinical trials of ozenoxacin with the objective of evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin 1% cream after twice-daily topical treatment for 5 days in patients with impetigo. A pooled analysis was performed of individual patient data from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 registration studies conducted in patients with impetigo. Both clinical trials followed a similar methodology. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ozenoxacin or vehicle. One trial included retapamulin as an internal control. Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were evaluated. Ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success versus vehicle after 5 days of therapy, superior microbiological success versus vehicle after 2 days of therapy, and was safe and well-tolerated. Ozenoxacin showed superior clinical and microbiological response versus vehicle in children as young as 2 months of age, and adults, with impetigo.

- clindamycin PO 300–450 mg QID for 7 days

- TMP/SMX PO 1–2 double-strength tablets BID for 7 days.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115SYZbY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — impetigo and ecthyma therapy notes that cultures of the vesicle fluid, pus, erosions, or ulcers establish the cause and, unless cultures yield streptococci alone, antimicrobial therapy should be active against both S. aureus and streptococci. Oral penicillinase–resistant penicillin or first-generation cephalosporins are usually effective as most staphylococcal isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are methicillin susceptible, with alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients or infections with MRSA including doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice, with a macrolide or clindamycin as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Topical treatment with mupirocin or retapamulin is as effective as oral antimicrobials for impetigo, and systemic therapy is preferred for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission.

### Impetigo: incidence and treatment in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001 – results from two national surveys [^115Kbmqf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common skin infection in children. The epidemiology is relatively unknown, and the choice of treatment is subject to debate.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine the incidence and treatment of impetigo in Dutch general practice, and to assess trends between 1987 and 2001.

Methods

We used data from the first (1987) and second (2001) Dutch national surveys of general practice. All diagnoses, prescriptions and referrals were registered by the participating general practitioners (GPs), 161 and 195, respectively.

Results

The incidence rate of impetigo increased from 16.5 (1987) to 20.6 (2001) per 1000 person years under 18 years old (P < 0.01). In both years, the incidence was significantly higher in summer, in rural areas and in the southern region of the Netherlands, compared with winter, urban areas and northern region, respectively. Socioeconomic status was not associated with the incidence rate. From 1987 to 2001, there was a trend towards treatment with a topical antibiotic (from 43% to 64%), especially fusidic acid cream and mupirocin cream. Treatment with oral antibiotics (from 31% to 14%) and antiseptics (from 11% to 3%) was prescribed less often.

Conclusions

We have shown an increased incidence of impetigo in the past decade, which may be the result of an increased tendency to seek help, or increased antibiotic resistance and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Further microbiological research on the marked regional difference in incidence may contribute to understanding the factors that determine the spread of impetigo. Trends in prescribing for impetigo generally follow evidence-based knowledge on the effectiveness of different therapies, rather than the national practice guideline.

### Mass drug administration campaigns for scabies and impetigo: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115zNK6p]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

Scabies and impetigo present significant health challenges in resource-limited settings and remote communities, compared with urban settings. Globally, around 200 million children are estimated to be affected by scabies and about 162 million children suffer from impetigo at any given time. If left untreated these skin conditions can lead to serious complications, including sepsis, renal disease and rheumatic heart disease.

Mass drug administration

Mass drug administration (MDA) is a treatment and containment approach where all individuals in a particular community are subjected to treatment without any individual diagnosis.MDA dates back to the 1960s, when schools in the USA showed positive results following MDA of anthelminthic drugs; this resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of worm infections and increase in school enrolment and attendance after the drug treatment.MDA is a well-established strategy for some of the highly prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; eg, trachoma, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis) and is a part of the integrated approach to NTDs in various settings. The World Health Organisation recognises MDA as a useful strategy for controlling scabies in resource-constrained communities, where the condition is hyperendemic, based on evidence from individual studies. As the intervention is often population based, it reduces the burden of the disease and it integrates cost-reduction strategies, which is a major hurdle in these areas. In various endemic populations of the Pacific region, MDA has shown positive results in reducing the burden of scabies and impetigo, especially in indigenous communities.MDA has shown potential for both social and economic benefits.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^116Zx6RD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

At 12 months the prevalence of scabies and impetigo had fallen to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3–2.6%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.4–4.5%), respectively, in the ivermectin-only treatment arm and to 0.7% (95% CI 0.2–1.8%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–5.1%), respectively, in the combined treatment arms (Table 2). There was no significant difference between the two groups (91.5% vs 92.4%, P = 0.31), in the change from baseline to 12 months in scabies prevalence or the change in impetigo prevalence (75.2% vs 72.7%, P = 0.49).

Table 2.
Prevalence of Scabies and Impetigo

We performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis to assess whether the lower follow-up in the ivermectin-only arm might have affected our results. We calculated the prevalence of impetigo that would have been seen in the ivermectin-only treatment arm if we had achieved a follow-up at a level similar to the combined treatment arm and the prevalence amongst participants not seen at 12 months had been unchanged from baseline. Under these assumptions, the prevalence of impetigo in the ivermectin-only treatment arm would have been 4.1% at twelve months. In this analysis there was no significant difference in the relative reduction in impetigo between arms (60.2% vs 72.7%, P = 0.23).

Swabs were collected from 73 people with impetigo at baseline, 36 people at 3 months, and 22 people at 12 months. At baseline, 80% of impetigo lesions from which we obtained a swab yielded S. aureus on culture and 62% yielded pyogenic streptococci (predominantly S. pyogenes, 56%). At 3 and 12 months the proportion of S. aureus was unchanged (78% and 86%, respectively), but the proportion of impetigo lesions from which S. pyogenes were cultured had fallen significantly to 33% at 3 months (P = 0.04 for the comparison to baseline) and 23% at 12 months (P < .01 for the comparison to baseline). The relative decrease in S. pyogenes was similar in both arms of the study (Table 3).

### Topical minocycline foam for the treatment of impetigo in children: results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study [^116zn4jC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Currently available treatment options for impetigo are limited by either systemic side effects (for oral therapy) or lack of ease of use (for topical ointment). A novel foam formulation of minocycline for topical use may improve convenience and treatment utilization for pediatric patients with impetigo.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied minocycline foam (FMX-102 1% and 4%) in the treatment of impetigo and to determine the optimal therapeutic active ingredient concentration.

Methods

In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, comparative clinical trial, 32 subjects aged ≥ 2 years with a clinical diagnosis of pure impetigo, impetigo contagiosa, or uncomplicated blistering impetigo were randomized to treatment with FMX-102 1% or 4%, twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were followed for up to 7 days post-treatment.

Results

Clinical cure, defined as ≥ 80% cured lesions (fully recovered lesions, visually determined by investigators), was achieved by 57.1% and 50.0% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, at the end of treatment (visit 3). Clinical success, defined as the absence of lesions, or the drying or improvement of treated lesions (decrease in size of affected area, lesion number, or both), was demonstrated in 81.3% and 78.6% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, following 3 days of treatment (visit 2), in 92.3% and 100% of the respective subjects at the end of treatment, and in 100% in both groups at follow-up (visit 4). Bacteriologic success rates at the end of treatment, defined as complete pathogen eradication, were 85% and 74% in the FMX-102 1% and 4% groups, respectively. The bacteriologic success rate for MRSA infections was 100% (11/11), with no recurrences. Both FMX-102 1% and 4% were considered well tolerated and safe.

Conclusion

Topical minocycline foam may be a safe and effective new treatment option for impetigo in children, including those with MRSA. <br/> <br/> <em> J Drugs Dermatol. </em> 2016;15(10):1238–1243.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^114XJ2kJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Scabies is a public health problem in many countries, with impetigo and its complications important consequences. Ivermectin based mass drug administration (MDA) reduces the prevalence of scabies and, to a lesser extent, impetigo. We studied the impact of co-administering azithromycin on the prevalence of impetigo and antimicrobial resistance.

Methods

Six communities were randomized to receive either ivermectin-based MDA or ivermectin-based MDA co-administered with azithromycin. We measured scabies and impetigo prevalence at baseline and 12 months. We collected impetigo lesions swabs at baseline, 3 and 12 months to detect antimicrobial resistance.

Results

At baseline, scabies and impetigo prevalences were 11.8% and 10.1% in the ivermectin-only arm and 9.2% and 12.1% in the combined treatment arm. At 12 months, the prevalences had fallen to 1.0% and 2.5% in the ivermectin-only arm and 0.7% and 3.3% in the combined treatment arm. The proportion of impetigo lesions containing Staphylococcus aureus detected did not change (80% at baseline vs 86% at 12 months; no significant difference between arms) but the proportion containing pyogenic streptococci fell significantly (63% vs 23%, P < .01). At 3 months, 53% (8/15) of S. aureus isolates were macrolide-resistant in the combined treatment arm, but no resistant strains (0/13) were detected at 12 months.

Conclusions

Co-administration of azithromycin with ivermectin led to similar decreases in scabies and impetigo prevalence compared to ivermectin alone. The proportion of impetigo lesions containing pyogenic streptococci declined following MDA. There was a transient increase in the proportion of macrolide-resistant S. aureus strains following azithromycin MDA.

CDC Yellow Book 2026 — Impetigo in travelers is described with typical presentations and treatment options: streptococcal impetigo "classically presents in children with golden or "honey-colored" crusts formed from dried serum", while "staphylococcal impetigo often appears in body folds, especially the axillae, and might present as fragile pustules". Geography influences etiology because "in temperate climates, most impetigo is caused by S. aureus, either alone or mixed with S. pyogenes", yet "in many tropical areas, however, streptococcal impetigo remains especially common in children". Impetigo "often arises as a secondary skin infection after the epidermal barrier is disrupted by insect bites, scabies, or scratches". For therapy, "Mupirocin, a topical antibiotic, is an excellent treatment for mild, localized impetigo caused by either pathogen", and "more extensive infections may require oral antibiotics, but the regimen differs by pathogen".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112X4A5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — clinical features describe that impetigo can be either bullous or nonbullous, with bullous impetigo caused by strains of S. aureus producing a toxin that cleaves the dermal-epidermal junction to form fragile, thin-roofed vesiculopustules that may rupture into crusted, erythematous erosions; nonbullous impetigo may be due to β-hemolytic streptococci or S. aureus and begins as erythematous papules that evolve into vesicles and pustules forming honey-colored crusts. Ecthyma is a deeper infection than impetigo caused by S. aureus and/or streptococci, with lesions that rupture into circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts and surrounding edema, and unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

Topical antibiotics are used for various purposes in dermatology. Some of the most common uses include treatment of acne, treatment and prevention of wound infection(s), impetigo or impetiginized dermatitis, and staphylococcal nasal carrier state. It is important for the dermatologist to be familiar with the spectrum of activity, the mechanism of action, and the variables that may interfere with the antibiotic of choice. The following discussion will review an update on topical antibiotic use in acne, wound care, impetigo, and in staphylococcal nasal carriers.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^114P6F4C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

At baseline, 1291 individuals (90.8% of the resident population in the 6 study communities) were examined and received treatment. At the 12-month follow-up the resident population of the study communities had decreased to 1255, of whom 1083 individuals were examined (86.3%) (Table 1). Follow-up was lower in the ivermectin-only arm at 12 months (ivermectin-only 76.2% vs combined treatment arm 96.3%). Overall, 46.6% of participants were male, and the median age of participants was 25 years (IQR 11–47) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Demographics

At baseline the prevalence of scabies was 11.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.4–14.6%) in the ivermectin-only arm and 9.2% (95% CI 7.1–11.7%) in the combined-treatment arm. The severity of scabies was similar in both arms; overall, 77.8% of individuals had mild scabies, 20% had moderate scabies, and 2.2% had severe scabies (data not shown). No cases of crusted scabies were detected. At baseline the prevalence of active impetigo was 10.1% (95% CI 8.1–13.0%) in the ivermectin-only treatment arm and 12.1% (95% CI 9.7–14.9%) in the combined-treatment arm. The severity of impetigo was similar in both groups; overall, 84.1% of participants had mild impetigo, 11% had moderate impetigo, and 4.9% had severe impetigo (data not shown).

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United kingdom, 1995–2010 [^113KwpeU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although changes in health-seeking behavior or data recording could underlie the increased consultation rate, the fact that similar increases were reported from other primary and secondary care datasets suggests that our findings are not artifacts. The Read codes used to identify patients were unchanged throughout the study period, and we are unaware of any changes in clinical practice that would lead to an increased tendency to diagnose impetigo.

Impetigo is frequently dismissed as a mild infection that spontaneously resolves with a good outcome. By contrast, this study suggests that an undetected increase in impetigo in the community drove a major increase in hospital admissions of children in England from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004. Awareness of this epidemic by general practitioners could have triggered development of specific guidelines on the management of this condition, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing hospital admissions. Routinely collected primary care data are an underused and potentially rich source of information about infectious diseases in the community. We should do more to find novel ways of incorporating this information into international surveillance networks and using it to guide evidence-based treatment and prescribing decisions in primary care.

### The importance of scabies coinfection in the treatment considerations for impetigo [^116RmfBS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Skin infections account for a high disease burden in indigenous children living in northern Australia. Although the relationship between impetigo and scabies is recognized, the prevalence of scabies in children with impetigo is not well reported. We report the prevalence, demographics and treatment success outcomes of impetigo and scabies coinfection in indigenous children who were participants in a randomized controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia.

Methods

Of 1715 screening episodes for impetigo, 508 children were randomized to receive intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin (BPG), twice daily co-trimoxazole (SXT) for 3 days (4 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 20 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose) or once daily SXT for 5 days (8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose). A clinical diagnosis of scabies; tinea of the skin, scalp or nail; and head lice was made on all children. Scabies presence was not confirmed using diagnostic scrapings. In a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether coinfection with scabies had an impact on treatment success for impetigo.

Results

Of children randomized to receive treatment for impetigo, 84 of 508 (16.5%) had scabies. The presence of scabies ranged from 14.3% to 20.0% in the 3 treatment groups. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection, independent of the treatment groups, was 75.9% and 86.6%, respectively, absolute difference 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): +1% to +21%]. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection in the BPG group was 69.6% and 88.0%, respectively, absolute difference 18.4% (95% CI: -1% to +38%). In the pooled SXT groups, the treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection was 78.6% and 86.0%, respectively, with absolute difference 7.4% (95% CI: -4% to +18%). Treatment success in the pooled SXT group with scabies (78.6%) was higher than in the BPG group (69.6%) with scabies, absolute difference 9.0% (95% CI: +0.1% to +18%). Prediction of treatment success for impetigo is dependent on the presence or absence of scabies and for scabies coinfected impetigo it was higher in the group treated with SXT.

Conclusions

The burden of scabies in an impetigo trial for Indigenous children was high. Treatment success for scabies coinfection was lower than for impetigo overall, with a higher success seen in the SXT group than the BPG group.

### Pediatric burn wound impetigo after grafting [^116HLPxW]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. Secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium in association with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration has been termed burns impetigo. This may result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment. The events preceding development, the impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment appear unclear and poorly reported. In 5 years, between 2006 and 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. Time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days: the mean time to complete healing was greatest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days). Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and prolonged symptoms. Delay in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when postgraft patients present with suggestive clinical signs and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^115PmxzW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Setting and Recruitment

This was a community randomised open label study conducted in Malaita province of the Solomon Islands. Six communities were randomized to one of 2 arms: an ivermectin arm or a combined-treatment arm. We selected communities that were isolated from each other to reduce contamination between the 2 study arms.

All residents living in selected communities were eligible to participate. Community engagement and education were conducted by the study team prior to commencement of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from adults and from the parent or guardian of children. Assent was also obtained from children who were able to provide it.

Data Collection

Study visits took place at 3 timepoints. At baseline, participants were seen for enrollment, initial data collection and treatment. At 3 months, we reexamined children (aged ≤ 12 years) in each community to allow for collection of swabs to monitor for antimicrobial resistance (see below); this age group was selected as they were anticipated to have the highest prevalence of impetigo. At the 12-month follow-up visit, we again aimed to examine all participating residents in participating communities. Prior to visits at both baseline and 12 months, the study team conducted a village census. At baseline and 12 months, participants underwent a standardized examination by an experienced clinician (MM) with data recorded on the presence or absence of any skin lesions, their location, and whether they were consistent with scabies, impetigo, or another diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis of scabies was based on the morphology (burrows, papules, nodules, vesicles) and distribution of rash alongside the presence of pruritus or evidence of excoriation. Active impetigo was diagnosed on the basis of discrete papular, pustular, or ulcerative lesions with associated erythema, crusting, bullae, or frank pus. The severity of scabies and impetigo was classified as previously described. Data were collected directly into Android smartphones using the OpenDataKit software package.

In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cephalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.

### Fusidic acid cream in the treatment of impetigo in general practice: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^112iJvR5]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that fusidic acid would not increase the treatment effect of disinfecting with povidone-iodine alone in children with impetigo.

Design

Randomised placebo controlled trial.

Setting

General practices in Greater Rotterdam.

Participants

184 children aged 0–12 years with impetigo.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical cure and bacterial cure after one week.

Results

After one week of treatment 55% of the patients in the fusidic acid group were clinically cured compared with 13% in the placebo group (odds ratio 12.6, 95% confidence interval 5.0 to 31.5, number needed to treat 2.3). After two weeks and four weeks the differences in cure rates between the two groups had become smaller. More children in the placebo group were non-compliant (12 v 5) and received extra antibiotic treatment (11 v 3), and more children in the placebo group reported adverse effects (19 v 7). Staphylococcus aureus was found in 96% of the positive cultures; no strains were resistant to fusidic acid.

Conclusions

Fusidic acid is much more effective than placebo (when both are given in combination with povidone-iodine shampoo) in the treatment of impetigo. Because of the low rate of cure and high rate of adverse events in the placebo group, the value of povidone-iodine in impetigo can be questioned.

### Topical antibiotics in the dermatological clinical practice: indications, efficacy, and adverse effects [^11187QYz]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical antibiotic therapy is a central component of patient management for several skin conditions, including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, rosacea, impetigo or other superinfected dermatitis, and prevention of wound infections. Moreover, particular situations, such as skin diseases of bacterial origin in pregnancy and infants often warrant topical therapy. However, the occurrence of local delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance are becoming great challenges faced by many dermatologists today. This narrative review provides an overview of the main topical antibiotics used in dermatology, focusing on their clinical role in the most common dermatological indications. For this purpose, a review of MEDLINE and PubMed for pertinent, scientific, and clinical publications until March 2020 was performed. Only articles published in the English language were included.

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United kingdom, 1995–2010 [^116sV4qD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial infection primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is the fourth most common dermatologic condition among children seen in general practice; although most infections are mild, outbreaks have a considerable negative effect because infected children may be barred from attending schools and nurseries.

In the United Kingdom, hospitalizations for impetigo increased 5-fold from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004; among children, the increase was 12-fold. To investigate whether this increase was fueled by increasing rates of infection in the community rather than increased pathogenicity, we used a large and nationally representative primary care database to calculate time trends in incidence of consultation and medications prescribed for impetigo.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^116AWjDy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Sample Collection and Analysis

To assess changes in antimicrobial resistance, we aimed to collect swabs from approximately 40 active impetigo lesions in children (≤ 12 years) per treatment arm at baseline (equivalent to approximately one third of our anticipated cases of impetigo at baseline). At 3 months, swabs were collected from all children with active impetigo. Finally, at 12 months we again aimed to collect swabs from all individuals with active impetigo. We collected swabs from a single lesion in each individual. A sterile cotton-tipped swab was rolled across pus or exudate from active impetigo lesions and placed inside a dry-transport tube, then shipped at ambient temperature within 7 days. Swabs were sent to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia, where they were streaked onto horse blood agar plates and incubated at 37° C in 5% CO₂. Plates were reviewed at 24 hours and purity plating performed. Beta-hemolytic streptococcal colonies were grouped by latex agglutination (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Canada). S. aureus colonies were detected using a latex slide agglutination test (Oxoid, United Kingdom). Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was performed using VITEK 2 (bioMérieux Inc. Durham, NC). We inferred azithromycin resistance from the results of erythromycin sensitivity testing using breakpoints defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. We report sensitivity results for (1) S. aureus and (2) pyogenic streptococci (groups A, C, and G) collectively, including S. pyogenes (group A).

Emm -typing was performed according to the protocol specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with minor modifications, as previously described. Emm -clusters were deduced based on the emm -typing results.

Statistical Analysis

The study was designed to assess whether adding a single oral dose of azithromycin, alongside ivermectin, resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of impetigo at 12 months compared to treatment with ivermectin alone. We calculated the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in each study arm at baseline and 12 months. We calculated the absolute and relative reduction in scabies and impetigo prevalence between baseline and 12 months. We compared the change in prevalence, separately for scabies and impetigo, between study groups by calculating the ratio of the prevalence at baseline and 12 months for each group, and testing the hypothesis that these 2 ratios were equal.

### Evidence at time of regulatory approval and cost of new antibiotics in 2016–19: cohort study of FDA approved drugs [^1138bv5k]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Thirdly, in our cost analysis, we used the comparator in the drug's pivotal trials. The comparator chosen by the drug sponsor might not be the regimen recommended by professional guidelines or the most cost effective option for the indication studied. Some of the comparator regimens were more expensive than generic regimens currently recommended for clinical use. For example, ozenoxacin for impetigo was compared with retapumulin in its pivotal trials and had the lowest cost ratio in our cohort. Retapumulin is a similarly new expensive antibiotic, however, which likely skews the cost ratio towards a more favourable lower number. Generic mupirocin, by contrast, can also treat impetigo, and is available as a low cost over-the-counter treatment. Also, because we used discretion in choosing the comparator National Drug Code, small variations in the cost of treatment with comparator regimens might exist. Fourthly, our cost analysis was also based on wholesale acquisition unit prices that do not account for rebates, which are typically confidential, and so the cost of treatment for each drug does not always reflect the cost to a payer. Finally, all of the postmarketing commitments and postmarketing requirements had not been completed for any of the drugs in our cohort, which limited the scope of our analysis. Hence we could not draw associations between evidence of effectiveness shown in the pivotal trials and any confirmatory evidence provided by a drug's postmarketing requirements and postmarketing commitments.

### Topical antibiotic treatment of impetigo with tetracycline [^1123fZZP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Forty-nine children aged 0.2–13 years with bullous and eroded lesions, from which Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, were diagnosed with impetigo and entered into a randomized, open-labeled trial of topical oxytetracycline hydrochloride (tetracycline) compared with a combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. After one week of topical tetracycline treatment, 22 of the 28 patients were clinically cured, and the remaining six patients had improved. In the other treatment group, 14 patients of 21 were clinically cured and 7 patients improved by the combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, the present study suggests that topical tetracycline treatment is effective for the treatment of impetigo.

### Prevalence of scabies and impetigo 3 years after mass drug administration with ivermectin and azithromycin [^116qscaS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Scabies, caused by infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabei var hominis, is a significant public health problem in many tropical countries and is particularly common in the Pacific region. In these settings, the population prevalence of scabies can be as high as 20%, with peak prevalence as high as 50% among children. Infestation with scabies results in inflammation and itch and is frequently associated with secondary bacterial infection (impetigo) caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (impetigo). These infections can result in more serious complications including septicemia, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease.

In highly endemic settings, the treatment of individuals and their immediate contacts has no impact on the overall community prevalence of scabies due to high rates of reinfestation. Because of this, there is increasing interest in population-level interventions for the control of scabies. Both permethrin- and ivermectin-based mass drug administrations (MDAs) have demonstrated efficacy in single-arm studies. More recently, ivermectin-based MDA was shown to be superior to alternative strategies, including permethrin MDA and standard care, in a comparative trial. A consistent finding in these studies is a substantial reduction in impetigo of 60%–90% following treatment of scabies.

### Retapamulin: an antibacterial with a novel mode of action in an age of emerging resistance to Staphylococcus aureus [^114wKyXf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^113vw2BE]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are 2 distinct cutaneous conditions with substantial clinical overlap. BI is a common, highly contagious cutaneous infection often affecting children, whereas PF is a relatively rare autoimmune blistering condition. Lesions arise from disruption of desmoglein-1, a desmosomal protein required for keratinocyte adhesion, by an epidermolytic toxin or IgG autoantibodies, respectively. Given their shared pathophysiology, it is not surprising that these diseases can have similar clinical presentations and have been mistaken for one another in the literature. Correct diagnosis is critical, as BI is managed with antibiotics to curb rapid spread, and the disease course of PF is meaningfully affected by early systemic immunosuppression. We discuss the diagnosis of a case of BI masquerading as PF and the means of distinguishing the 2 cutaneous conditions.

### Local antibiotics in dermatology [^114bRcaY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although the vast majority of skin infection must be treated with systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics are used overwhelmingly in the world, often as self-prescribed medications without taking into account the sensitivity of the presumed bacteria. Dermatologists are aware that different types of topical antibiotics kill different species of bacteria and tend to be more specific in their prescriptions. At present local antibiotics are advised to treat minor superficial uncomplicated skin infections (e.g., impetigo) and to prevent bacterial infections caused into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. The role of topical antibiotics in the management of acne and atopic dermatitis is controversial. Retapamulin, a novel topical antibacterial agent, will probably replace the use of the old mupirocin and fusidic acid.

Superficial infections

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial skin and soft tissue infections are caused by gram positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. Three common presentations consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a skin infection that is common throughout the world. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-haemolytic streptococci and/or S. aureus.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually S. pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count.

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^114Ah4NM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

Key research topic 5: Develop and conduct economic evaluation of primary prevention strategies in RHD endemic settings

There are few economic evaluations of primary prevention strategies in RHD endemic settings. A high-quality, model-based evaluation of investment in GAS pharyngitis treatment within the African Union from 2021 to 2030 estimated that the primary prevention approach alone would not lead to a positive return-on-investment. However, the return-on-investment ratio may be improved by considering cheaper treatment strategies, including impetigo in the models, and including strategies with better specificity for GAS pharyngitis to reduce: unnecessary antibiotic consumption, increased antimicrobial resistance and increased associated costs to the patient. Nevertheless, the ability to prevent ARF cases by treating superficial GAS infections dictate the need to diagnose and treat these infections at an individual level. Therefore, improving the cost-effectiveness of GAS diagnosis and treatment strategies is still required. Accordingly, the PPWG identified the following as key implementation research priorities:

Convene a multidisciplinary working group to develop a standardised framework for economic evaluations of primary (and other stage) prevention strategies that is relevant to endemic settings.
Acquire cost of illness and quality of life data on superficial GAS infections and sequelae, such as Direct costs for the diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis and impetigo; Indirect costs from formal and informal carer time, work loss or absenteeism, and disruption to education; Quality-of-life impacts through instruments that can be translated to quality-adjusted life-years, such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory or EuroQol Group instruments.
Determine the impact of primary prevention strategies in combination with contemporary diagnostic testing on excessive antimicrobial consumption, which leads to resistance in GAS and by-stander pathogens and disruption of the gut microbiota.
Perform high-quality health economic evaluation of primary prevention strategies, including: The longer-term interaction between improved GAS pharyngitis and impetigo treatment rates preventing new cases of ARF and RHD and secondary and tertiary interventions preventing progression in develop cases of ARF and RHD; Cost-effectiveness, budget-impact and return on investment, of alternative primary prevention strategies; The benefits of increased primary care utilisation beyond the treatment of GAS infection and sequelae alone (ie, treatment of other infectious diseases).
Use implementation science strategies and community engagement efforts, which take into consideration social determinants of health, disease incidences and potential disparities present in vulnerable communities, to ensure sustainable and acceptable primary prevention strategies.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^111W8eDK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

For most common infections treated in primary care, a substantial proportion of antibiotic prescriptions have durations exceeding those recommended in guidelines. This is most noticeable for most respiratory indications and acute cystitis among females. If all patients receiving antibiotics for the included indications received treatment for durations recommended by guidelines over the study period (three years in about 4.4% of the English population; included prescriptions captured around 20% of total antibiotic prescriptions in the included practices during the study period), this would equate to 1.1 million fewer days of antibiotics for respiratory tract indications and 100 000 fewer days for acute cystitis among females. Our findings indicate substantial scope for reducing antibiotic prescribing through better adherence to recommended durations of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, the duration of antibiotic prescriptions for pyelonephritis, acute cystitis among men, impetigo, and cellulitis generally did not exceed guideline recommendations, with only 4–18% of prescriptions exceeding them.

### A primer on topical antibiotics for the skin and eyes [^1168rh6A]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

A thorough knowledge of all topical antibiotics treatment options is important as more pathogens become resistant to standard therapies. As resistance to mupirocin increases, it seems that triple antibiotic ointments and retapamulin (the newest FDA-approved agent) will have greater roles in treating impetigo and skin infections. Awareness of all these agents provides a dermatologist additional tools with which to treat skin infections. As a wide variety of topical antibiotics, combination antibiotics, and combination anti-inflammatory preparations used by ophthalmologists are not part of the therapeutic armamentarium of most dermatologists, this review will provide the knowledge needed to rationally use such ophthalmologic preparations. Finally, information related to the topical nadifloxacin for acne and skin infections, which is in clinical use in Japan, is summarized.

Key research topic 1: Obtain a better understanding of GAS epidemiology to guide programmes and policies

The correlation between episodes of GAS pharyngitis and subsequent development of ARF is well described. Oral antibiotic treatment within 9 days of symptom onset given to patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis (primary prophylaxis) is an effective and safe option for reducing the attack rate of ARF by up to 70%, while intramuscular (IM) benzathine penicillin (PCN) G appears to extend this reduction to 80%. However, GAS pharyngitis may frequently be either asymptomatic or so mild that medical attention is not sought, hampering the effectiveness of primary prophylaxis for the prevention of ARF and RHD. Recent longitudinal studies highlight the increased transmissibility of GAS in crowded settings and the need for effective interventions to hamper bacterial shedding that promotes outbreaks. Additional assessments of transmission are warranted to better understand the frequency of GAS transmission in diverse settings and populations. Community knowledge of the link between a sore throat and the development of ARF remains low — addressing this in partnership with communities to ensure culturally appropriate health awareness materials are developed is needed to increase healthcare-seeking behaviour. Similarly, the overlap between GAS pharyngitis and viral infection in the era of antimicrobial resistance, sometimes leads to under treatment of GAS pharyngitis. In addition, the potential roles of asymptomatic, pharyngeal GAS carriage and group C and G streptococci carriage or pharyngitis in the pathogenesis and progression to ARF/RHD remain unclear.

Recent evidence suggests a strong potential role for GAS skin infections (eg, impetigo) in the pathogenesis of ARF, either alone, or in combination with, GAS pharyngitis. The impetigo burden is high among populations that suffer high rates of ARF in remote Australia, while confirmed GAS pharyngitis is rare. Second, recent data from New Zealand has shown that the risk of ARF following impetigo parallels that following GAS throat infection. While there is appreciable growing evidence that GAS impetigo can be a precedent for ARF, whether treatment of impetigo will prevent ARF in the same way that treatment of pharyngitis may prevent ARF is as yet unstudied. Further research is needed to address this given the heavy global burden of impetigo, with > 162 million children affected at any one time.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1116bQXs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term "skin and soft-tissue infections" describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

Bacterial skin infection treatment — topical care, antibiotic options, and cautions — states to use soap and water for local cleansing, and that a topical antibiotic, preferably mupirocin, can also be used; bacitracin zinc and polymyxin sulfate (often in combination) are alternatives; topical ointments may contain neomycin (a well-recognized cause of acute allergic contact dermatitis), fusidic acid, or gentamicin; in low- and middle-income countries, "triple cream" products may be available over the counter and often contain ultrapotent corticosteroids that can interfere with the healing of common infections and have their own side effects; in many low- and middle-income countries, an application of gentian violet or potassium permanganate is the treatment of choice for impetigo; minor skin abscesses often respond to incision and drainage without needing antibiotics, while oral or parenteral antibiotics might be required if the infection is deep, expanding, extensive, painful, or associated with systemic symptoms; clinicians should consider antibiotic resistance if there is no response to empiric therapy, and animal bites or scratches can lead to anaerobic or unusual gram-negative infections, with appropriate treatment potentially requiring specialists to obtain cultures, prescribe focused therapy, and perform surgical debridement as needed.

### Prevalence of scabies and impetigo 3 years after mass drug administration with ivermectin and azithromycin [^114Pc8WQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The methods of the Azithromycin Ivermectin MDA (AIM) study have been reported in detail elsewhere. Briefly, AIM was a single-arm, before-and-after trial conducted in Choiseul Province, 1 of 10 administrative provinces of the Solomon Islands. The population was estimated at 26 372 in 2009, with the majority of residents on a single large island. The study made use of the infrastructure of a planned azithromycin MDA conducted for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), we integrated an ivermectin-based MDA for the control of scabies into this routine activity. At baseline (2015), all residents in Choiseul Province were offered treatment for both trachoma and scabies. Treatment for trachoma consisted of a single dose of oral azithromycin or (when azithromycin was contraindicated) a self-administered 6-week course of 1% topical tetracycline eye ointment. Treatment for scabies consisted of 2 doses of oral ivermectin (200 µg/kg) or (when ivermectin was contraindicated, specifically, for pregnant or breast-feeding women and children aged < 5 years) topical permethrin. Participants who required permethrin were given the option to have a trained nurse apply the cream in a private room or to apply it themselves at home. The first dose of treatment for scabies was administered at the time of treatment for trachoma, and the second dose was offered 7 to 14 days later. At baseline and at 12 months, 10 villages were randomly selected, and all individuals were offered enrollment and examination for scabies and impetigo. We have previously reported both safety outcomes and the 12-month efficacy results with regards to scabies and impetigo. Overall, AIM enrolled 26 188 participants who, based on the 2009 census, represented 99.3% of the population. The estimated population coverage of the initial dose of treatment for scabies was 98.6%; that of the second dose of treatment for scabies was 83.7%.

### Mupirocin ointment (Sx pre-Op prep pouch) [^117T1puF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in 2 trials. In the first, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or vehicle placebo 3 times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.

In the second trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment 3 times daily or 30 to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day (this was an unblinded trial) for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups.

Pediatrics

There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial described above, all subjects were pediatric except 2 adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for mupirocin ointment (n = 27) was 96%, and for erythromycin it was unchanged (78.5%).

Of the 16 studies, six were related to pharyngitis, two to impetigo, seven to cellulitis, and one to general skin and soft tissue infections.

All the studies on managing pharyngitis were conducted in upper-middle or high-income countries. One study evaluated treatment choiceand five evaluated diagnostic strategy –. Four of the five studies that evaluated diagnostic strategies concluded that routine use of rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) resulted in the lowest cost per case of accurate diagnosis and antibiotic treatment –. The other study evaluated backup testing for negative RADTs, concluding that it was of limited value.

Half of studies on primary prevention for skin infections evaluated antibiotic, analgesic or adjunct treatment choices. This included both studies for impetigo, two of the seven studies for cellulitis, and the two studies on general skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The remaining five studies for cellulitis evaluated management options or treatment setting –.

### Retapamulin (Altabax) [^114qSjpk]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ALTABAX is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients aged 9 months and older for the topical treatment of impetigo (up to 100 cm²in total area in adults or 2% total body surface area in pediatric patients aged 9 months or older) due to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14)].

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ALTABAX and other antibacterial drugs, ALTABAX should

### Impetigo: diagnosis and treatment… [^117VLZ74]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment Treatment options for impetigo include topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics, and topical disinfectants. 8 Topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo and preferable to oral antibiotics for limited impetigo. 8, 11 Systemic antibiotics are often reserved for more generalized or severe infections in which topical therapy is not practical. Clinicians sometimes may choose both topical and systemic therapy. 8 The ideal treatment should be effective, be inexpensive, have limited adverse effects, and should not promote bacterial resistance. 2, 4, 8. TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS Topical antibiotics have the advantage of being applied only where needed, minimizing antibiotic resistance and avoiding gastrointestinal and other systemic adverse effects. 4, 8 The length of time of topical treatment varies based on product, but in clinical trials, a seven-day course was more effective than placebo for resolution of impetigo.

8, 11 Local allergic reactions, skin sensitization, and difficulty with application to areas such as eyelids, mouth, and back are potential disadvantages of topical treatments. Three topical antibiotic preparations recommended for impetigo are mupirocin 2% cream or ointment, retapamulin 1% ointment, and fusidic acid. ORAL ANTIBIOTICS Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. NATURAL THERAPIES The evidence is insufficient to recommend or dismiss popular herbal treatments for impetigo. 24 Natural remedies such as tea tree oil; tea effusions; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful. The fact that impetigo is self-limited means that many "cures" could appear to be helpful without being superior to placebo. In one study, tea leaf ointment and oral cephalexin were similarly effective, with a cure rate of 81% vs.

Future Treatments Future treatments for impetigo might include minocycline foam, which has successfully completed phase II trials, and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone that has successfully completed phase III clinical trials. 27, 28 Few controlled clinical trials have had their results published and most are methodologically weak. This area seems to merit further study through rigorous clinical trials.

### Mass drug administration for the control of scabies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115EXVY8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

We identified 1108 records through database searches and an additional two records through other sources (Figure 1). After duplicates were removed, 841 records were screened by title and abstract. A further 811 were excluded leaving 30 full-text manuscripts, which were reviewed for eligibility. Following full-text assessment, a further 19 were excluded, leaving 11 studies, of which 9 were included in the meta-analysis for scabies and 4 for the meta-analysis for impetigo. We excluded 2 studies from the meta-analysis for both scabies and impetigo because only prevalence in children was available at the 12-month time point.

Figure 1.
Study selection. Abbreviations: MDA, mass drug administration; RCT, randomized control trial.

Studies were reported from 3 geographic regions with the majority (n = 9) conducted in Pacific Island countries (Figure 2). Approximately 36 000 individuals received MDA specifically for scabies, and a further 2269 received MDA with an anti-scabetic for lymphatic filariasis and were assessed for the impact on scabies.

Figure 2.
Map showing the location, agent used, and number of participants of mass drug administration for scabies.

Of the included studies, all but 1 found a decrease in scabies prevalence after MDA (Figure 3). The overall risk-ratio of the change in prevalence following MDA was 0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI].1–.45) indicating that MDA is favored with a relative reduction of 79%. The I² value was 96.19%, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity between studies. There was a greater reduction in scabies prevalence when only studies with a baseline prevalence of more than 10% were included (Supplementary Figure 1). In these studies the overall risk-ratio was 0.15 (95% CI.08–.29) equating to a relative reduction of 85%.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 9 refugees, immigrants, and migrants [^116bY356]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

CDC Yellow Book 2026 — Bacterial skin infection management includes hygiene, topical options, cautions about over-the-counter creams, and abscess care. Recommendations state: "Use soap and water for local cleansing of bacterial skin infections". "A topical antibiotic, preferably mupirocin, can also be used; bacitracin zinc and polymyxin sulfate (often in combination) are alternatives". Topical ointments in other countries "may contain neomycin (a well-recognized cause of acute allergic contact dermatitis), fusidic acid, or gentamicin". In low- and middle-income settings, "'triple cream' products may be available over the counter", and "often contain ultrapotent corticosteroids that can interfere with the healing of common infections and have their own side effects". For impetigo, "an application of gentian violet or potassium permanganate is the treatment of choice". For abscesses, "Minor skin abscesses often respond to incision and drainage without needing antibiotics", but "Oral or parenteral antibiotics might be required if the skin infection is deep, expanding, extensive, painful, or associated with systemic symptoms (e.g., fever)". Clinicians should "Consider antibiotic resistance if the condition does not respond to empiric therapy", and animal exposures matter because "Bites and scratches from animals (both domestic and wild) can lead to infections with anaerobic bacteria or unusual gram-negative organisms". Complex cases might need referral since "Appropriate treatment might require care from specialists who can obtain bacterial cultures, prescribe focused antibiotic therapy, and perform surgical debridement, as needed".

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^115oFYc5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) management — For post-streptococcal GN, infective endocarditis-related GN, and shunt nephritis, we suggest appropriate treatment of the infectious disease and standard approaches to the management of the kidney manifestations (2D). Poststreptococcal GN is the prototypical infection-related acute GN, and although classic poststreptococcal GN occurs 1–3 weeks after the initial clinical manifestations of pharyngitis or impetigo, affected individuals should be treated with penicillin (or erythromycin, if penicillin-allergic) even in the absence of persistent infection in order to decrease the antigenic load; the nephritic syndrome should be treated with diuretics, antihypertensives, supportive care, and dialysis if necessary, and corticosteroids are suggested for severe crescentic GN based on anecdotal evidence only.
