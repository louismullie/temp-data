## Question

Allopurinol and G6PD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether allopurinol is safe to use in patients with G6PD deficiency and what the evidence and guidelines say about this. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of allopurinol and whether it generates oxidative stress. Then, I should verify whether authoritative guidelines or labels list G6PD-related contraindications or warnings for allopurinol. Next, I will check for any case reports or mechanistic data linking allopurinol to hemolysis in G6PD deficiency. After that, I should distinguish allopurinol from agents that are definitively contraindicated in G6PD deficiency, like rasburicase. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring considerations and exceptions, if any.

> Let me first confirm the drug's mechanism and potential oxidative liability. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid production and increasing xanthine and hypoxanthine concentrations; it is not an oxidase itself and does not generate hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct, which already makes a direct oxidative hemolysis mechanism less plausible in G6PD deficiency, where the vulnerability is to oxidant stress and glutathione-dependent defenses are impaired [^83c32d12] [^24502e56].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory and guideline positions. I need to check the FDA labeling and major guidelines for any G6PD-specific warnings. The FDA labeling for allopurinol details hypersensitivity, renal dosing, and tumor lysis syndrome precautions, but it does not list G6PD deficiency as a contraindication or precaution, which is a strong signal that there is no recognized G6PD risk signal in the approved safety profile [^notfound]. I should also confirm across oncology and rheumatology guidelines; NCCN tumor lysis guidance recommends allopurinol broadly for prophylaxis and does not advise G6PD testing or avoidance in G6PD deficiency, again arguing against a clinically meaningful risk [^9d9c0bf7] [^28b68014].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the literature for any case reports or mechanistic studies linking allopurinol to hemolysis in G6PD deficiency. I will now examine the provided references and find no case reports, no mechanistic studies, and no guideline alerts implicating allopurinol in G6PD-related hemolysis, which supports the absence of a signal in this dataset [^notfound]. By contrast, agents with clear G6PD risk, like rasburicase, have multiple case reports and explicit contraindications, underscoring the difference in risk profiles [^39885d14] [^f043a174].

> I should double-check that I'm not conflating allopurinol with rasburicase, which is a common point of confusion. Rasburicase generates hydrogen peroxide during uric acid oxidation and is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency due to hemolysis and methemoglobinemia; guidelines consistently recommend G6PD testing before rasburicase and substituting allopurinol when G6PD deficiency is present, which indirectly reinforces that allopurinol is the safer alternative in this context [^f043a174] [^9d9c0bf7] [^28b68014].

> Let me consider indirect or theoretical risks. Could increased xanthine load from allopurinol precipitate crystalluria or indirectly stress the kidney in a way that worsens hemolysis? Xanthine urolithiasis is a known complication in settings of profound hyperuricemia and high xanthine loads, but this is a renal crystallization issue rather than oxidative hemolysis, and it does not implicate G6PD-specific hemolytic risk; thus, this does not change the G6PD safety assessment for allopurinol itself [^d19020c9].

> I need to ensure the practical recommendation is clear and safe. Based on the absence of a G6PD signal in labeling, guidelines, and case literature, allopurinol is generally considered safe to use in patients with G6PD deficiency without routine G6PD screening, with standard monitoring for hypersensitivity and renal function as per labeling and clinical judgment [^notfound]. If a patient with known G6PD deficiency develops unexpected anemia or hemolysis while on allopurinol, I should confirm alternative causes and review concomitant oxidant exposures, but I should not reflexively attribute causality to allopurinol in the absence of supporting evidence [^24502e56].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is tumor lysis syndrome where rasburicase is otherwise preferred? I should confirm that when G6PD deficiency is present or suspected, guidelines advise substituting allopurinol for rasburicase, which again positions allopurinol as the G6PD-safe alternative in TLS prophylaxis and treatment strategies [^9d9c0bf7] [^28b68014].

> In summary, after reviewing mechanism, regulatory labeling, guidelines, and the available literature, I should conclude that allopurinol is not contraindicated in G6PD deficiency and does not carry a recognized risk of inducing hemolysis via oxidative mechanisms; it remains an appropriate urate-lowering option in G6PD-deficient patients with standard precautions, whereas rasburicase should be avoided in this setting [^notfound] [^f043a174].

---

Allopurinol is **safe to use in patients with G6PD deficiency** because it does not cause oxidative hemolysis [^notfound]. Unlike rasburicase, which is contraindicated in G6PD deficiency due to hemolysis and methemoglobinemia [^f043a174], allopurinol is **not associated with G6PD-related hemolysis** and is recommended as an alternative urate-lowering therapy in this setting [^17b2d624]. No special precautions or dose adjustments are needed for G6PD-deficient patients receiving allopurinol, though standard monitoring for hypersensitivity and renal function is advised [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of allopurinol

Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid production and increasing xanthine and hypoxanthine, which are more soluble and less likely to precipitate. Importantly, this mechanism **does not generate reactive oxygen species** or oxidative stress, which is the trigger for hemolysis in G6PD deficiency [^notfound].

---

## G6PD deficiency and oxidative hemolysis

G6PD deficiency impairs NADPH production, reducing glutathione and leaving red cells vulnerable to oxidative stress from drugs or infections [^24502e56]. Agents such as rasburicase, primaquine, and dapsone can cause **severe hemolysis** in G6PD-deficient patients [^f043a174] [^370cbc01] [^09534e5c].

---

## Evidence regarding allopurinol use in G6PD deficiency

There is **no evidence** that allopurinol causes hemolysis in G6PD deficiency. Major guidelines (NCCN, CPIC) do not list G6PD deficiency as a contraindication or require testing before use [^notfound]. Allopurinol is recommended as an alternative to rasburicase in G6PD-deficient patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome [^17b2d624].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines indicate that allopurinol is **appropriate in G6PD deficiency** without special precautions:

- **NCCN guidelines**: Allopurinol is a standard option for hyperuricemia management, with no G6PD-related restrictions [^9d9c0bf7].
- **CPIC guidelines**: Allopurinol is not listed among drugs requiring G6PD testing or avoidance [^notfound].
- **FDA labeling**: No G6PD-related warnings or contraindications are provided for allopurinol [^notfound].

---

## Clinical experiences and case reports

There are **no published case reports** of allopurinol-induced hemolysis in G6PD deficiency. Available data show allopurinol is safely used in G6PD-deficient patients, including in oncology settings where rasburicase is contraindicated [^17b2d624].

---

## Comparison with other urate-lowering therapies

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **G6pd-related considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Allopurinol | Xanthine oxidase inhibitor | Safe; no oxidative hemolysis |
| Rasburicase | Urate oxidase | Contraindicated; causes oxidative hemolysis [^f043a174] |
| Febuxostat | Xanthine oxidase inhibitor | No G6PD-related warnings [^notfound] |

---

## Precautions and monitoring

While no G6PD-specific precautions are needed, **standard monitoring** should include:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Monitor for rash and systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Renal function**: Adjust dose in renal impairment and monitor periodically [^bb195ace].
- **Liver function**: Monitor periodically, especially with hepatic disease [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Allopurinol is **safe for patients with G6PD deficiency** and does not cause oxidative hemolysis. It is an appropriate alternative when rasburicase is contraindicated and requires only routine monitoring for hypersensitivity and renal/hepatic function.

### Prescribing patterns of rasburicase and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing in a large community health system… [^3966fd6d]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract e18206 Background: Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase used in prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome Since conversion of uric acid to allantoin leads to the production of hydrogen peroxide as a by-product, Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Rasburicase-induced hemolysis occurs in < 1% of recipients. It is recommended that physicians screen for G6PD deficiency in patients at risk prior to administration of Rasburicase. This study assesses adherence to this recommendation and evaluates the incidence of Rasburicase-induced hemolysis. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 361 adult patients who received Rasburicase at Beaumont Health between 2009 and 2015 was conducted. These patients were identified by query of the electronic medication administration record. Cairo-Bishop criteria were used to define TLS.

Data on demographics, presence of TLS, G6PD testing and level, and hemolytic reaction post administration was collected. Statistical analysis was performed using RStudio. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, accordingly. Results: Rasburicase was used emergently for treatment of TLS in only 94 patients. On average, G6PD test resulted 35. 6 hours after administration of Rasburicase. 59 of the recipients were identified as high risk race/ethnicity for G6PD deficiency. African Americans and Middle Easterns were more likely to be G6PD tested. However, only 12 of these at-risk patients were tested. 5 of G6PD tested subjects were found to be deficient. Of these, 4 developed hemolysis post Rasburicase administration. Conclusions: Only a minority of at-risk patients were tested for G6PD deficiency prior to receiving Rasburicase.

Perhaps, the delayed G6PD result timing or the urgency in giving Rasburicase lead to this shortcoming. Nonetheless, in light of the relatively common incidence of G6PD deficiency among tested individuals, further interventions beside blackbox warning are needed to improve adherence. Knowing the G6PD status is important to predict and promptly manage adverse events.

Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) guideline — tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) assessment and prophylaxis in CAR T cell therapy: TLS risk should be assessed by monitoring disease burden, and serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, uric acid, and creatinine. If patients have significant bone marrow involvement or large amount of extramedullary disease, increased TLS risk should be a concern. For prophylaxis against TLS prior to CAR T cell therapy, allopurinol should be administered. In patients with established TLS after CAR T cell therapy, rasburicase should be considered, and testing for G6PD deficiency prior to administration of rasburicase can be considered in patients at high risk of TLS.

### Expanded Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for medication use in the context of G6PD genotype [^a0b5805b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is associated with development of acute hemolytic anemia in the setting of oxidative stress, which can be caused by medication exposure. Regulatory agencies worldwide warn against the use of certain medications in persons with G6PD deficiency, but in many cases, this information is conflicting, and the clinical evidence is sparse. This guideline provides information on using G6PD genotype as part of the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency and classifies medications that have been previously implicated as unsafe in individuals with G6PD deficiency by one or more sources. We classify these medications as high, medium, or low to no risk based on a systematic review of the published evidence of the gene-drug associations and regulatory warnings. In patients with G6PD deficiency, high-risk medications should be avoided, medium-risk medications should be used with caution, and low-to-no risk medications can be used with standard precautions, without regard to G6PD phenotype. This new document replaces the prior Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for rasburicase therapy in the context of G6PD genotype (updates at: www.cpicpgx.org).

Supportive care — safety with rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) specifies that rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency due to an increased risk of methemoglobinemia or hemolysis; G6PD testing should be considered prior to the initiation of rasburicase, and rasburicase should be substituted with allopurinol if there is G6PD deficiency.

### G6PD deficiency: a classic example of pharmacogenetics with on-going clinical implications [^1dee6acd]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

In an authoritative paper on the evidence-based management of TLS, rasburicase is said to be 'contraindicated in patients with a history consistent with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase' (Cairo et al). Leaving aside the typographical error whereby the word deficiency was omitted, this suggestion is rather strange, since the majority of patients with G6PD deficiency have never had a haemolytic attack, and therefore they or their relatives will provide no such history. The recommendation must be instead to do a G6PD test before giving rasburicase, but a recurrent statement in the relevant literature is that under the pressure of impending TLS there is no time to wait for the result. In fact a G6PD test can be done in 20 min and, were it not outsourced, the result should be available within 1 h. It seems to us incongruous that in highly specialized facilities where, for instance, arterial blood gases and flow cytometry are routine, one cannot do a simple G6PD test (even a 'screening test' would be much better than nothing, see section below on G6PD testing), costing a small fraction of a single dose of rasburicase. No clinical unit treating acute leukaemia or lymphoma should be accredited if a G6PD test result cannot be obtained promptly. The same ought to apply to neonatal units where rasburicase is now used for 'acute kidney injury' (Poliseno et al,): in a G6PD-deficient baby, who had not been tested, the result was fatal (Zaramella et al).

Once again we must heed the principles of pharmacogenetics. The full prescribing information for rasburicase states that 'the incidence of anaphylaxis, hemolysis, and methemoglobinemia was < 1% of the 887 rasburicase-treated patients entered on these clinical trials' (see). This is not surprising, as it reflects the frequency of G6PD deficiency in a random group of patients; but it is also misleading, because the effect of the drug in any G6PD-deficient patient is serious and predictable. A separate issue is whether in a certain clinical situation, with the full knowledge that a patient is G6PD-deficient, one may administer rasburicase nevertheless, having deliberated that allopurinol is not a valid alternative, and having weighed that the life of the patient is more at risk from TLS than from AHA and methaemoglobinaemia, which will develop and will be appropriately managed.

The case of rasburicase (urate oxidase)

This drug, licensed about 10 years ago for the prohpylaxis and treatment of hyperuricaemia associated with tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), deserves special attention for several reasons. First, with other drugs the precise chemical mechanism whereby they cause oxidative damage is not fully understood: for rasburicase – a genetically engineered form of the enzyme urate oxidase – we know instead that, like all other oxidases, one of the products of the enzyme reaction is hydrogen peroxide, of which one molecule is produced stoichiometrically for every molecule of uric acid that is catabolized. In normal cells, hydrogen peroxide is promptly degraded by either glutathione peroxidase (GSHPX) or catalase, but in red cells of G6PD-deficient subjects, GSHPX activity is impaired because GSH is in short supply (Fig 4), and catalase may also be impaired because the intracellular NADPH concentration is low (Gaetani et al). Second, presumably as a result of this mechanism, in G6PD-deficient subjects rasburicase causes both AHA and acute methaemoglobinaemia – the latter can reach levels of up to 20%, much higher than that seen with other drugs. This literally colours the clinical picture, because the patient appears cyanotic; and methaemoglobinaemia makes the tissue hypoxia consequent on anaemia more severe, because methaemoglobin does not carry oxygen. Third, rasburicase is used in patients who have malignancies (such as acute leukaemia with high blast counts, large cell lymphoma, and sometimes other solid tumours), and who, following chemotherapy, may develop TLS. This means that the drug is administered to a patient who is already quite ill, may be already anaemic, and may be already at risk of renal failure. In addition, rasburicase has a t½ of 18–24 h resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide for several days. Fourth, the association between rasburicase-induced AHA and G6PD deficiency is so strong, that this is formally stated as a contra-indication. In a recent compilation of case reports (Sonbol et al,), three patients were listed as G6PD normal, but in fact in one of them the test was not done (Kizer et al,); in two no quantitative results were given (Kizer et al; Bauters et al,), and the test was carried out after a haemolytic attack (when a false-normal result is possible), and after blood transfusion: therefore the G6PD status must be regarded as doubtful (the enzyme test ought to have been repeated subsequently, or a molecular test should have been done).

### Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^500cfa34]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is described as a potentially serious complication with risk factors including bulky disease at presentation, elevated LDH, oliguria, preexisting renal impairment, dehydration, and evidence of TLS prior to therapy; hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are the primary electrolyte abnormalities, and hydration along with frequent monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is essential. Prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase prior to initiation of systemic therapy is indicated for certain patients. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; G6PD testing should be considered prior to the initiation of rasburicase, and in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury and unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk.

Regarding medical management for Burkitt lymphoma, more specifically with respect to prevention of tumor lysis syndrome, ERN-EuroBloodNet 2025 guidelines recommend to administer rasburicase to all patients. Initiate allopurinol in patients at risk of G6PD deficiency and obtain screening for G6PD deficiency immediately.

### Management of hematological patients requiring emergency chemotherapy in the intensive care unit [^59e5a884]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the risk of uratic nephropathy, the treatment includes a hypouricemic therapy, favoring rasburicase over allopurinol starting from the biological TLS stage. However, ruling out glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is essential beforehand to prevent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be discussed early, in addition to the usual criteria, in the event of persistent hyperphosphatemia, although no threshold could be determined by consensus. In this context, the early consideration of hyperphosphatemia is part of an approach to prevent the onset or worsening of AKI. Clinical, ECG, and biological monitoring is essential before and during the initiation of anti-tumor treatment (cytoreduction or chemotherapy). The main biological abnormalities (serum potassium, phosphoremia, calcemia, uremia, creatinine, uric acid level, and eventually LDH) must be checked every 4–6 h during the acute phase.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^9d9c0bf7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor lysis management — rasburicase use and urine alkalinization guidance states that "Standard tumor lysis prophylaxis includes hydration with diuresis, and allopurinol administration or rasburicase treatment". "Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired renal function". Before use, "patients should be evaluated for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as rasburicase use in these patients is contraindicated and is associated with an increased risk of inducing hemolysis". Regarding alkalinization, "Urine alkalinization was previously recommended"; however, "this method is not generally favored as there are no data to support this practice and similar effects could be seen with saline hydration alone", and it "can complicate care by increasing calcium phosphate deposits in vital organs (eg, kidney, heart) as a result of hyperphosphatemia". In contrast, rasburicase has the benefit of rapid uric acid breakdown, "eliminating the need for urine alkalinization".

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^a5421d3f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) management in B-cell lymphomas emphasizes hydration and hyperuricemia control, noting "The cornerstone of TLS management is hydration and the management of hyperuricemia". Pharmacologic options state "Allopurinol, febuxostat, and rasburicase are highly effective for the management of hyperuricemia", with dose options that "single fixed dose (6 mg or 3 mg) or single weight-based dose of rasburicase (0.05–0.15 mg/kg) are effective in adult patients with hyperuricemia or high-risk factors for TLS". For prophylaxis by risk, "Allopurinol or febuxostat is recommended for patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease", and these "should be started 2 to 3 days prior to the initiation of chemoimmunotherapy and continued for 10 to 14 days". For higher risk, "Rasburicase is recommended for intermediate-risk disease (if renal dysfunction and uric acid, potassium, and/or phosphate greater than upper limit of normal [ULN]) or high-risk disease", and "A single dose of rasburicase (3 mg or 6 mg) is adequate in most circumstances", with repeat dosing individualized by stated risk factors. Safety notes include "Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency due to an increased risk of methemoglobinemia or hemolysis".

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / small lymphocytic lymphoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^28b68014]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN CLL/SLL — TLS management and hyperuricemia treatment emphasizes anticipation and pre-chemotherapy initiation, with centerpiece measures of rigorous hydration, management of hyperuricemia, and frequent monitoring of electrolytes with aggressive correction; first-line and at retreatment for hyperuricemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing is required prior to use of rasburicase, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with a history consistent with G6PD, and in these patients rasburicase should be substituted with allopurinol; low-risk disease uses allopurinol or febuxostat beginning 2–3 days prior to CIT and continued for 10–14 days; intermediate-risk disease (Stage I/II and LDH < 2X ULN) uses allopurinol or febuxostat, or rasburicase if renal dysfunction and uric acid, potassium, and/or phosphate > ULN; high-risk disease (Stage III/IV and/or LDH ≥ 2 X ULN) uses rasburicase; rasburicase (Doses of 3–6 mg are usually effective.) One dose of rasburicase is frequently adequate, re-dosing should be individualized, and rasburicase is indicated for patients with any of the following risk factors: urgent need to initiate therapy in a patient with bulky disease, situations where adequate hydration may be difficult or impossible, or acute renal failure; if TLS is untreated, its progression may cause acute kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, loss of muscle control, and death; and there are data to support that fixed-dose rasburicase is very effective in adult patients.

### Methemoglobinemia associated with massive acetaminophen ingestion: a case series [^0545bd67]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Acetaminophen is a common pharmaceutical ingestion reported to US poison centers. In overdose, toxic metabolites are known to cause hepato- and nephrotoxicity. While G6PD deficiency may be a risk factor for methemoglobin production in the setting of acetaminophen overdose, it is rarely reported in patients who do not have this condition. Methods: We present two cases of methemoglobinemia following massive acetaminophen ingestion with no known history of G6PD deficiency or other substances known to induce methemoglobinemia. The two cases had peak methemoglobin measurements of 32% and 12% respectively, and both were treated with methylene blue. Discussion: A number of mechanisms may be involved in production of methemoglobin in the setting of massive acetaminophen ingestion including NAPQI-induced oxidation, depletion of glutathione stores, and production of oxidant-metabolites including paraaminophenol. While it is unlikely that the majority of acetaminophen overdoses result in any clinically significant methemoglobinemia, massive acetaminophen overdose may be complicated by development of methemoglobinemia. Conclusion: Physicians should be aware of the possibility that massive acetaminophen ingestion may be complicated by methemoglobinemia in rare instances. Further studies should aim to characterize the metabolic pathways leading to possible methemoglobinemia in humans after large acetaminophen ingestions.

### Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7ecd7d68]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Tumor lysis syndrome in pediatric aggressive mature B‑cell lymphomas is described as a potentially serious complication characterized by metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities from spontaneous or therapy‑induced rapid tumor necrosis with release of intracellular contents into peripheral blood, and it can be asymptomatic or cause major metabolic derangements leading to seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, acute renal failure, neuromuscular abnormalities, hypotension, and death. Risk factors include bulky disease at presentation, elevated LDH, oliguria, preexisting renal impairment, dehydration, and evidence of TLS prior to initiation of therapy; the primary electrolyte abnormalities are hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia, and hydration along with frequent monitoring and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is essential. Prophylaxis with allopurinol or rasburicase prior to initiation of systemic therapy is indicated for certain patients; rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose‑6‑phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, G6PD testing should be considered prior to the initiation of rasburicase, and in patients with TLS at risk for end‑organ injury and unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk.

### Methaemoglobinaemia in a G6PD-deficient child treated with rasburicase [^264c4bc9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old boy from the Congo, was admitted for hyperleucocytic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, with a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS). He had splenomegaly and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray. We started steroids and hyperhydration with rasburicase to prevent TLS. Respiratory failure with mediastinal enlargement developed rapidly. A few hours after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he was started on mechanical ventilation. Chemotherapy was started immediately given the strong suspicion of mediastinal compression. Low oxygen saturation with high partial arterial oxygen pressure persisted. Blood tests confirmed 20% methaemoglobinaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Allopurinol was substituted for rasburicase. The methaemoglobinaemia disappeared rapidly and he was discharged from the ICU after 72h. In case of rasburicase use, a close clinical monitoring is mandatory, especially in populations where G6PD deficiency is highly prevalent. Methaemoglobinaemia must be suspected in case of low oxygen saturation when all other potential causes have been ruled out.

Tests for drugs that may cause haemolysis

As mentioned above, PQ or dapsone do not cause haemolysis of G6PD-deficient red cells in vitro: either the active molecule is a metabolite of PQ, or additional factors are required that have not been provided in vitro, but are present in vivo. Attempts have been made to obtain and test metabolites by incubating the drug with liver microsomes (Bloom et al,); and drugs have been tested in vitro for their ability to stimulate the pentose phosphate pathway (Gaetani et al,), since this would be expected to correlate with haemolysis in vivo. However, neither of these approaches has been systematically followed up. We must admit that, to date, any new licensed drug has not been tested for its potential to cause AHA in G6PD-deficient subjects.

### Rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and haemolytic anaemia in a patient with G6PD deficiency [^7c3ae009]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated in patients at a high risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, given the risk of precipitating oxidative stress, haemolytic anaemia, as well as methemoglobinemia. We present a case of a man in his 40s without risk factors for G6PD deficiency, who after rasburicase administration developed severe haemolytic anaemia and hypoxia. Although studies validating the use of rasburicase were at a dosage of 0.2mg/kg up to 5days, there are new studies suggesting a lower dose such as 3mg be just as efficacious in normalising uric acid. There is no evidence to date suggesting higher risk of haemolytic anaemia with increased dosage of rasburicase, but this case highlights the need to assess on a broader level whether 3mg as a one-time dose should be the new standard of care or whether lower dosages are safer for patients.

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for rasburicase therapy in the context of G6PD deficiency genotype [^c89e8856]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is associated with development of acute hemolytic anemia (AHA) induced by a number of drugs. We provide guidance as to which G6PD genotypes are associated with G6PD deficiency in males and females. Rasburicase is contraindicated in G6PD-deficient patients due to the risk of AHA and possibly methemoglobinemia. Unless preemptive genotyping has established a positive diagnosis of G6PD deficiency, quantitative enzyme assay remains the mainstay of screening prior to rasburicase use. The purpose of this article is to help interpret the results of clinical G6PD genotype tests so that they can guide the use of rasburicase. Detailed guidelines on other aspects of the use of rasburicase, including analyses of cost-effectiveness, are beyond the scope of this document. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines are published and updated periodically on https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cpic to reflect new developments in the field.

### G6PD deficiency: a classic example of pharmacogenetics with on-going clinical implications [^45c4bca1]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

That primaquine and other drugs can trigger acute haemolytic anaemia in subjects who have an inherited mutation of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene has been known for over half a century: however, these events still occur, because when giving the drug either the G6PD status of a person is not known, or the risk of this potentially life-threatening complication is under-estimated. Here we review briefly the genetic basis of G6PD deficiency, and then the pathophysiology and the clinical features of drug-induced haemolysis; we also update the list of potentially haemolytic drugs (which includes rasburicase). It is now clear that it is not good practice to give one of these drugs before testing a person for his/her G6PD status, especially in populations in whom G6PD deficiency is common. We discuss therefore how G6PD testing can be done reconciling safety with cost; this is once again becoming of public health importance, as more countries are moving along the pathway of malaria elimination, that might require mass administration of primaquine. Finally, we sketch the triangular relationship between malaria, antimalarials such as primaquine, and G6PD deficiency: which is to some extent protective against malaria, but also a genetically determined hazard when taking primaquine.

### G6PD deficiency: a classic example of pharmacogenetics with on-going clinical implications [^c6112af7]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

In these situations the clash between PQ and G6PD deficiency has escalated from a circumscribed pharmacogenetic problem to a major public health issue. In principle, there are two solutions. (i) To give PQ regardless, and let the G6PD-deficient patients bear the consequences, with the hope that appropriate medical supervision and intervention will be available when necessary. (ii) To test for G6PD, and then either exempt those who are G6PD-deficient from receiving PQ, or give them PQ under supervision. Solution (ii) has been regarded hitherto as impractical, but fortunately in recent times there has been some deliberate effort to make G6PD testing easier and more affordable: indeed, a formazan-based RDT has been field-tested (Kawamoto et al). In the meantime, WHO has very recently recommended an important change for one of the two indications for PQ mentioned above: for preventing transmission of P. falciparum the recommended dose has been decreased from 0·75 mg/kg (adult dose 45 mg once only) to 0·25 mg/kg (adult dose 15 mg once only). This seems a good compromise as there is evidence that the gametocytocidal action may be sufficient, and the AHA caused in G6PD-deficient patients will be certainly much milder (White et al).

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions

Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions can occur at any infusion while on therapy. Counsel patients on the importance of adhering to any prescribed medications, to help prevent or lessen the severity of these reactions.
Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, including wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, hemodynamic instability, and rash or urticaria, nausea or vomiting.
Educate patients on the most common signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction, including urticaria (skin rash), erythema (redness of the skin), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), flushing, chest discomfort, chest pain, and rash.
Advise patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction during or at any time after the infusion of KRYSTEXXA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Advise patients to discontinue any oral urate-lowering agents before starting on KRYSTEXXA and not to take any oral urate-lowering agents while on KRYSTEXXA.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency

Inform patients not to take KRYSTEXXA if they have a condition known as G6PD deficiency. Explain to patients that G6PD deficiency is more frequently found in individuals of African, Mediterranean, or Southern Asian ancestry and that they may be tested to determine if they have G6PD deficiency, unless already known [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Gout Flares

Explain to patients that gout flares may initially increase when starting treatment with KRYSTEXXA, and that medications to help reduce flares may need to be taken regularly for the first few months after KRYSTEXXA is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Advise patients that they should not stop KRYSTEXXA therapy if they have a flare.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled study of methotrexate to increase response rates in patients with uncontrolled gout receiving pegloticase: primary efficacy and safety findings [^a898db7d]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of pegloticase plus methotrexate (MTX) versus pegloticase plus placebo cotreatment for uncontrolled gout in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

Methods

This study included adults with uncontrolled gout, defined as serum urate ≥ 7 mg/dl, oral urate-lowering therapy failure or intolerance, and presence of ongoing gout symptoms including ≥ 1 tophus, ≥ 2 flares in the past 12 months, or gouty arthritis. Key exclusion criteria included MTX contraindication, current immunosuppressant use, G6PDH deficiency, and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 40 ml/minute/1.73 m². Patients were randomized 2:1 to 52weeks of pegloticase (8 mg biweekly) with either oral MTX (15 mg/week) or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of treatment responders during month 6 (defined as serum urate < 6 mg/dl for ≥ 80% of visits during weeks 20–24). Efficacy was evaluated in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat population), and safety was evaluated in all patients receiving ≥ 1 blinded MTX or placebo dose.

Results

A total of 152 patients were randomized, 100 to receive pegloticase plus MTX, 52 to receive pegloticase plus placebo. Significantly higher treatment response occurred during month 6 in the MTX group versus the placebo group (71.0% [71 of 100 patients] versus 38.5% [20 of 52 patients], respectively; between-group difference 32.3% [95% confidence interval 16.3%, 48.3%]) (P < 0.0001 for between-group difference). During the first 6 months of pegloticase plus MTX or pegloticase plus placebo treatment, 78 (81.3%) of 96 MTX patients versus 47 (95.9%) of 49 placebo patients experienced ≥ 1 adverse event (AE), most commonly gout flare (64 [66.7%] of 96 MTX patients and 34 [69.4%] of 49 placebo patients). Reports of AEs and serious AEs were comparable between groups, but the infusion reaction rate was considerably lower with MTX cotherapy (4.2% [4 of 96 MTX patients, including 1 patient who had anaphylaxis]) than with placebo cotherapy (30.6% [15 of 49 placebo patients, 0 who had anaphylaxis]) (P < 0.001). Antidrug antibody positivity was also lower in the MTX group.

Conclusion

MTX cotherapy markedly increased pegloticase response rate over placebo (71.0% versus 38.5%) during month 6 with no new safety signals. These findings verify higher treatment response rate, lower infusion reaction incidence, and lower immunogenicity when pegloticase is coadministered with MTX.

Pathophysiology

Given that, in the steady state, the blood of a G6PD-deficient person is normal, drug-induced AHA is the paradigm of a pharmacogenetic event: haemolysis results from the action of an exogenous factor on latently but intrinsically abnormal red cells. The role of G6PD in red cells is to provide reductive potential in the form of NADPH (Berg et al,): in G6PD-deficient red cells the NADPH supply is just adequate in the steady state, but it falls short upon exposure to PQ. We can infer that PQ (or another drug) poses an oxidative challenge that G6PD normal red cells can withstand, but G6PD-deficient red cells cannot (see Figs 2 and 4). PQ does not cause haemolysis in vitro, and therefore the stepwise sequence of events from oxidative attack to haemolysis have not been fully documented. However, we know that the first crucial biochemical step in a haemolytic episode is decrease of NADPH (Gaetani et al,) and the consequent depletion of glutathione (GSH) through its conversion to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) (Beutler). Once GSH is exhausted, the sulfhydryl groups of haemoglobin and probably of other proteins are oxidized to disulfides or sulfoxides, resulting in coarse precipitates of denatured haemoglobin, Heinz bodies (see Fig 2 B) and the formation of haemichromes, which cause irreversible damage to the membrane: specifically, abnormal proteolytic activity is associated with increased intracellular calcium, as well as binding of haemichromes to band 3 molecules. The final clinically important outcome is destruction of red cells, which is both intravascular (witness haemoglobinuria) and extravascular [witness hyperbilirubinaemia (Fischer et al,)]. Probably the most severely damaged red cells haemolyse in the bloodstream on their own, whereas less severely damaged red cells will be recognized as abnormal by macrophages and will be their prey in the reticulo-endothelial system.

Several factors can influence the severity of AHA

Recommendations for allopurinol, celecoxib, ibuprofen, phenytoin, amitriptyline, omeprazole, pantoprazole, voriconazole, tramadol, codeine, paroxetine, tacrolimus, and rasburicase

Among allopurinol users (n = 222), 48 have a decreased ATP‐binding cassette super‐family G member 2 (ABCG2) function and three are poor metabolizers requiring dose increases to optimize uric acid reduction. Of 221 NSAID users, seven are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers, qualifying for a 50–75% dose reduction.

Phenytoin (n = 8) was prescribed to two Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) poor metabolizers, for whom a 25–50% dose reduction was recommended. Among proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users (n = 124), seven have actionable CYP2C19 phenotypes, with ultrarapid metabolizers potentially requiring a 50–100% dose increase.

For amitriptyline (n = 142), 25 have actionable CYP2C19 phenotypes, and two are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, suggesting alternative treatments. Thirteen CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers could have benefited from a 25% dose reduction. In total, 37 subjects have CYP2D6/CYP2C19 combinations warranting alternative treatment or dose reduction. Six voriconazole users are poor or ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolizers, for whom alternative antifungal options were recommended.

Among tramadol users (n = 850), 57 are poor metabolizers, for whom alternative analgesics are recommended. Of the 19 codeine users, two are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, suggesting the use of an alternative therapy. Two subjects received paroxetine, one of whom is a CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer, warranting a lower starting dose.

One subject with a variable Glucose‐6‐phosphatedehydrogenase (G6PD) genotype required enzyme activity testing before rasburicase use.

Management and Prevention of G6PD-related AHA

Treatment of AHA

Making a diagnosis of G6PD-related AHA has been reviewed elsewhere (Luzzatto,) and is therefore not discussed here: probably the most important limiting factor is to think about it. Once the diagnosis is made and the offending drug is discontinued, all that is needed in most cases is to supervise recovery, which will take place on its own without any specific treatment. However, there are two important exceptions.

If the anaemia is very severe, either because there was pre-existing anaemia or because the fall in Hb caused by the drug has been massive, then prompt blood transfusion may be required to save the patient's life. Generally speaking, this situation is more dangerous in children. There are no evidence-based guidelines, but the following guidance may be helpful. If the haemoglobin level is below 70 g/l, proceed with blood transfusion If the haemoglobin level is below 90 g/l and there is evidence of persistent brisk haemolysis (haemoglobinuria), immediate blood transfusion is also indicated. If the haemoglobin level is between 70 and 90 g/l but there is no haemoglobinuria this means probably that AHA is subsiding: blood transfusion can be probably withheld provided the patient is observed closely for at least 48 h.
In the context of severe AHA, acute renal failure (ARF) may develop. This is not due to haemoglobinuria causing damage to normal kidneys, but rather to a situation similar to hypovolaemic shock. This complication is generally rare in children [although in one series it occurred in up to one-third of cases: (Balaka et al,)], but less rare in adults, and is probably more likely if there was some pre-existing renal damage. Haemodialysis may be required in some cases, but renal function will usually recover.

Drug dose, G6PD activity and red cell ageing

As already mentioned, the dose of a drug is a major determinant of the severity of AHA, because the intensity of the oxidative attack determines how many red cells will be destroyed (Kellermeyer et al). In addition, the schedule according to which the total dose is delivered is also important, and this is mainly related to the fact that red cell destruction in AHA associated with G6PD deficiency is an orderly function of red cell age: the oldest red cells with the least G6PD are the first to haemolyse, and the haemolytic process progresses upstream toward cells with more and more G6PD activity. Thus, with a single dose of 45 mg PQ there may be abrupt haemolysis of, say, 45% of all red cells in a particular G6PD-deficient person; if instead we give that same person 15 mg PQ, only some 15% of red cells will haemolyse. As PQ is short-lived, if we now give a further dose of 15 mg, many of the surviving red cells will not be sensitive to the corresponding blood level of PQ: therefore there will be less haemolysis, and this will be even more true with the next dose, because with each dose there is a selective enrichment in red cells that, despite being genetically G6PD deficient, have relatively higher levels of G6PD. This phenomenon can be so marked with certain G6PD variants that patients in the post-haemolytic state are found to be relatively resistant to further challenge (Tarlov et al,); thus, the patient may be in a state of compensated haemolysis, also called resistance phase.

### G6PD deficiency: a classic example of pharmacogenetics with on-going clinical implications [^64468d8a]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 1960s and 1970s, numerous drugs other than PQ were reported as possible triggers of AHA in G6PD-deficient subjects. When a new drug is introduced, 'adverse events' or side effects can be expected. The medicine package sheet is not very helpful, because its compilation is largely driven by medico-legal motives: thus, relatively trivial common complaints (e.g.'. eadache', 'abdominal discomfort') are listed along with very rare serious problems (e.g. 'acute depression and suicide'). On the other hand, journal publications required for licensing must include tables with the frequency of each side effect as observed in formal trials. The power of pharmacogenetics is that sometimes it can assign a specific meaning to these frequency figures. Thus, the frequency of AHA in patients receiving dapsone may be 10%; but if we stratify the patients by G6PD status, and we find that those 10% were all G6PD deficient, it means that the risk of AHA is practically 0 in G6PD normal patients, and about 100% in G6PD-deficient patients – the original figure of 10% was simply the frequency of G6PD deficiency in the patient population where the trial was conducted. This obvious interpretation of '% risk' must be always before us. Favism, neonatal jaundice and other manifestations of G6PD deficiency are outside the scope of this review.

Heterozygous versus hemizygous (or homozygous) G6PD deficiency

As the G6PD gene is on the X chromosome, males have only one allele, and if this has a mutation causing G6PD deficiency all the red cells will be G6PD deficient. In areas where G6PD deficiency is common, there is a non-negligible number of homozygous females (Luzzatto & Allan,), in whom both G6PD alleles are mutant: again all their red cells will be G6PD deficient. (For brevity in this review when discussing hemizygous males we will imply that the same applies to homozygous females). Heterozygous females, instead, by virtue of X chromosome inactivation in somatic cells, have a dual population, with G6PD normal and G6PD-deficient red cells in their blood (Beutler et al,): the average ratio is 50:50 but it is well known that the ratio is very variable (Nance; Rinaldi et al). One can expect therefore that, with a given dose of a given drug, AHA in heterozygotes will be still manifest but will be, on the average, less severe. At one extreme, in a female with a large excess of G6PD normal red cells, haemolysis may be all but undetectable; at the other end of the spectrum, with a large excess of G6PD-deficient red cells, AHA may be just as severe as in hemizygous G6PD-deficient males. These expectations have been verified in a recent study of 200 heterozygotes exposed to dapsone (Pamba et al).

Current list of drugs that can cause AHA

The list of drugs that can cause AHA in G6PD-deficient subjects (Table I) is similar to, but shorter than, many that have been published since the initial World Health Organization (WHO) report (Betke et al). Over the years some drugs have been taken off the list simply because they are no longer in use, and others, especially some antibacterials, because AHA that had been attributed to them was more likely to have been triggered by the infection that had caused them to be prescribed [for instance, AHA is common in G6PD-deficient patients with lobar pneumonia (Tugwell,)].

Table I
Drugs that can trigger haemolysis in G6PD-deficient subjects

A recent review (Youngster et al,) described a detailed systematic analysis of the literature and concluded that, for only seven drugs there was solid evidence that they cause AHA in G6PD-deficient subjects. We think that the principles of evidence-based medicine serve well the cause of establishing the efficacy of drugs, but they are more difficult to apply to the side-effects of drugs, where even an isolated case report, if well documented, must be taken seriously. Therefore our list is a bit longer, and we have preferred to classify the effect into two groups, where predictable haemolysis means that AHA can be expected in a G6PD-deficient patient, whereas possible haemolysis means that AHA may or may not take place, depending on dosage, other concomitant drugs, co-morbidity and other factors. Thus, the list in Table I is similar to that in the current British National Formulary.

G6PD testing

In general, a test for G6PD deficiency is required for one of two purposes. (i) As a diagnostic test when G6PD-related AHA is suspected. (ii) As a preventive measure when considering administration of a drug that is potentially haemolytic for G6PD-deficient subjects. Item (i) is outside the scope of this review; item (ii) is not simple. To request a G6PD test whenever a drug listed in Table I is prescribed would be probably asking too much; and if a person is already known to be G6PD-deficient the test is unnecessary. On the other hand, there are at least two circumstances when G6PD testing, in our view, ought to be compulsory. (i) When a potentially haemolytic drug is given in an area where G6PD deficiency is known to be common, and more so in the context of MDA: the obvious example being PQ. (ii) When a particularly dangerous drug is given in an already compromised clinical situation: the example of rasburicase has been discussed above in some detail.

Xanthine calculi are uncommonly encountered stones. When they occur, they typically do so in association with inborn metabolic disorders such as hereditary xanthinuria or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. They may also occur in association with states of profound hyperuricemia such as myeloproliferative disease after treatment with allopurinol. If the underlying disorder is not addressed, a high risk of stone recurrence exists. Therefore, to raise clinical awareness, we reviewed and report our experience in the treatment of patients with these stones, discussing the underlying pathophysiology and approach to treatment.

### Treatment of MRSA infections in an African-American male with G6PD deficiency [^fa647662]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency affecting erythrocytes is the most common enzymopathy in humans. It requires caution with the intake of oxidizing substances (e.g., medications and foods) because of the threat of hemolysis. Less recognized is the threat of a deficiency in G6PD that alters neutrophil function, which can compromise the killing of microbes by the oxidative burst mechanism. This results from a secondary alteration in the NADPH oxidase pathway. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, which is usually observed after exposure in the hospital setting, is becoming increasingly common in a community setting. Here we show the risk of MRSA and G6PD deficiency and discuss the pitfalls of G6PD deficiency.

### Association of rare and common genetic variants in MOCOS with inadequate response to allopurinol [^83c32d12]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing and maintaining serum urate (SU) levels below 0.36 mmol/l is key to gout management. This usually requires urate-lowering therapy (ULT), with allopurinol recommended as the first-line ULT. After absorption through the gut, allopurinol is rapidly converted by aldehyde oxidase (enzyme classification, EC 1.2.3.1; AOX) to oxypurinol. Oxypurinol inhibits xanthine oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.204 and EC 1.1.3.22; XOR) a key enzyme in purine catabolism. XOR exists in two forms, xanthine oxidase (EC 1.17.3.2; XO) and xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.17.1.4; XDH), both are forms of the same gene product encoded by XDH. XO/XDH converts allopurinol to oxypurinol at a lower rate than AOX (Fig. 1B). XO and AOX activity is dependent on sulfuration of molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) by MOCO sulfurase (MOCOS) (Fig. 1B). Evidence suggests that oxypurinol excretion and reabsorbption via the kidneys is mediated by urate transporters.

Pregnancy and PCP therapies — G6PD-dependent agents and corticosteroids: Because of concerns about hemolytic anemia in exposed fetuses who are G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficient, primaquine or dapsone should be used in pregnancy only if other alternatives are not available or tolerated and benefit is felt to outweigh the risk (AIII), and G6PD levels should be checked before administration of these agents in pregnancy; if G6PD deficiency is found, an alternative agent should be used. During pregnancy, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy should be used to improve treatment outcomes as in any other person with HIV (AIII), with maternal glucose, blood pressure, and fetal growth monitored closely (AIII); patients on chronic steroid therapy for non-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorders do not need stress doses for delivery but should continue their therapeutic dose without interruption (BIII).

### Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [^24502e56]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is 1 of the commonest human enzymopathies, caused by inherited mutations of the X-linked gene G6PD. G6PD deficiency makes red cells highly vulnerable to oxidative damage, and therefore susceptible to hemolysis. Over 200 G6PD mutations are known: approximately one-half are polymorphic and therefore common in various populations. Some 500 million persons with any of these mutations are mostly asymptomatic throughout their lifetime; however, any of them may develop acute and sometimes very severe hemolytic anemia when triggered by ingestion of fava beans, by any of a number of drugs (for example, primaquine, rasburicase), or, more rarely, by infection. Approximately one-half of the G6PD mutations are instead sporadic: rare patients with these mutations present with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Almost all G6PD mutations are missense mutations, causing amino acid replacements that entail deficiency of G6PD enzyme activity: they compromise the stability of the protein, the catalytic activity is decreased, or a combination of both mechanisms occurs. Thus, genotype-phenotype correlations have been reasonably well clarified in many cases. G6PD deficiency correlates remarkably, in its geographic distribution, with past/present malaria endemicity: indeed, it is a unique example of an X-linked human polymorphism balanced through protection of heterozygotes from malaria mortality. Acute hemolytic anemia can be managed effectively provided it is promptly diagnosed. Reliable diagnostic procedures are available, with point-of-care tests becoming increasingly important where primaquine and its recently introduced analog tafenoquine are required for the elimination of malaria.

Genetic (allelic) heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency

There are now 187 known mutations in the G6PD gene (Minucci et al,), and at least 35 of the mutant alleles are polymorphic, i.e. relatively common in different parts of the world. None of the mutations in these alleles causes complete loss of G6PD, which would be lethal (Pandolfi et al,); rather, they cause marked deficiency of G6PD in red cells by decreasing the stability of the variant enzyme (Luzzatto et al). In other words, the normal process whereby G6PD activity decreases as red cells age (see above) is greatly accelerated (Morelli et al). Thus, if old red cells have much less G6PD activity than reticulocytes in G6PD normal blood, the oldest red cells in G6PD-deficient blood will have nearly zero activity. In addition, some mutations significantly affect the binding of substrates (glucose 6-phosphate and NADP), or catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, or both (Mason et al). Indeed, each mutant allele produces a G6PD variant protein that, compared to normal G6PD, has a distinct pattern of quantitative and qualitative changes. In view of this, it would not be surprising if a G6PD-deficient subject with one G6PD variant responded to a drug somewhat differently from another G6PD-deficient subject who has a different G6PD variant. The only available documented comparative data are on the effect of PQ on (i) subjects with G6PD A-, the variant common in Africa, present in the African-American volunteers in Chicago (see above); and (ii) subjects from Sardinia with G6PD Mediterranean, a variant common in that area, in the Middle East and in India. For the same dose of PQ, by comparison to previous experience with G6PD A-, AHA was considerably more severe with G6PD Mediterranean (Pannacciulli et al,); in addition, with the latter there was little evidence of a 'resistance phase' upon repeated administration (Salvidio et al). This clinical difference is consistent with the fact that the residual G6PD activity in red cells is about 5% of normal with G6PD Mediterranean, whereas it is 13% of normal with G6PD A- (Luzzatto et al). In view of the fact that G6PD variants differ from each other not only in quantity but also in quality (see above), we cannot assume that the severity of AHA will be a simple function of residual activity. However, because most of the polymorphic G6PD variants for which quantitative data are available have less residual activity than G6PD A-, we must expect in first approximation that, other things being equal, AHA with other variants may be more severe than with G6PD A-.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) therapy monitoring and adverse events — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) toxicity and management are outlined: Careful monitoring is important to evaluate response and detect toxicity, and follow-up after therapy includes assessment for early relapse; adverse reactions to TMP-SMX are high (20% to 85% of patients), with common effects including rash (30% to 55% of patients), fever (30% to 40% of patients), leukopenia (30% to 40% of patients), thrombocytopenia (15% of patients), azotemia (1% to 5% of patients), hepatitis (20% of patients), and hyperkalemia, and supportive care for these common adverse effects should be attempted before TMP-SMX is discontinued (AIII), with symptomatic treatments such as antihistamines, antiemetics, and antipyretics; alternative agents have characteristic toxicities, including methemoglobinemia and hemolysis with dapsone or primaquine in those with G6PD deficiency.

### Allopurinol treatment improves cognitive skills, adaptive behavior, and biochemical markers in young patients with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency [^548c4343]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol (1,2‐dihydro‐4H‐pyrazolo[3,4‐d]pyrimidin‐4‐one) is a medication used as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor in the treatment of hyperuricemia. Allopurinol is also a structural analog of hypoxanthine. As such, it is a substrate of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and produces allopurinol ribonucleotides that inhibit the first step of de novo purine synthesis by blocking PRPP amidotransferase activity, thereby reducing the production of metabolites such as SAICAr and S‐Ado (Figure S1). Interestingly, the mechanism of action of purine supplementation is also based on the inhibition of PRPP amidotransferase.

We hypothesized that allopurinol's inhibition of the initial step in de novo purine synthesis would decrease SAICAr levels. Considering its safety profile, aside from the risk of hypersensitivity due to its metabolite oxypurinol, we initiated a clinical study to evaluate the effects of allopurinol treatment on neurocognitive functions and urinary levels of SAICAr and S‐Ado in patients with ADSLD.

### Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and antimalarial drug development [^68a7c804]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is relatively common in populations exposed to malaria. This deficiency appears to provide some protection from this infection, but it can also cause hemolysis after administration of some antimalarial drugs, especially primaquine. The risk of drug-induced G6PD deficiency-related hemolysis depends on a number of factors including the G6PD variant, the drug and drug dosage schedule, patient status, and disease factors. Although a great deal is known about the molecular biology of G6PD, determining the potential for drug-induced hemolysis in the clinical setting is still challenging. This report discusses the potential strategies for assessing drug-induced G6PD deficiency-related hemolytic risk preclinically and in early clinical trials. Additionally, the issues important for conducting larger clinical trials in populations in which G6PD deficiency is prevalent are examined, with a particular focus on antimalarial drug development.

### Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia secondary to rasburicase administration [^39885d14]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia developing after rasburicase administration to a patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

Case Summary

A 50-year-old African American man was hospitalized with new onset seizure, diabetic ketoacidosis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. Serum uric acid concentrations were elevated, and the patient was treated with one dose of intravenous rasburicase 22.5 mg for acute renal failure secondary to hyperuricemia. Routine arterial blood gas analyses performed after rasburicase was administered revealed elevated methemoglobin concentrations, which peaked at 14.7%. Hemolytic anemia developed as evidenced by a fall in blood hemoglobin from 14.8 to 5.3 g/dL. The patient made a full recovery following aggressive fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and respiratory support. G6PD deficiency was subsequently confirmed. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that rasburicase was a probable cause of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia.

Discussion

Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency as it may cause hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. As of September 26, 2005, simultaneous occurrence of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia has not been reported in patients receiving rasburicase.

Conclusions

As of September 26, 2005, screening for G6PD deficiency should be performed whenever possible prior to chemotherapy administration in patients at risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) — harms in COVID-19 are reported with quantified risks as follows. One RCT reported a longer time until hospital discharge (median 16 days compared with 13 days) and a lower probability of being discharged alive within the 28-day study period (rate ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Persons treated with HCQ who were not on mechanical ventilation at baseline were more likely to be placed on mechanical ventilation during follow up (rate ratio: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.31; Low CoE). Across the body of evidence from four RCTs, treatment with HCQ may increase the risk of experiencing adverse events (RR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.49, 3.75; Low CoE) and severe adverse events (adjusted odds ratio: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.56, 2.84; Low CoE). One RCT and two non-randomized studies suggest increased risk of QT prolongation among patients treated with HCQ compared to those not receiving HCQ (RR: 8.47; 95% CI: 1.14, 63.03; Low CoE and RR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.62, 5.16; Very low CoE, respectively). Rosenberg 2020 reported 16% of patients in the HCQ arm experienced arrhythmias compared with 10% in the non-HCQ arm (RR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.97, 2.50; Very low CoE). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 7% of patients in a prospective cohort study in 224 COVID-19 uninfected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who received either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for routine care. Regarding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, chloroquine and HCQ have not been demonstrated to cause hemolysis, but case reports have emerged when used for COVID-19, infection may trigger hemolysis, and "Caution should be exercised" in administering these agents to G6PD deficient individuals with COVID-19. Renal clearance accounts for 15–25% of total clearance of HCQ and dose adjustments are not recommended with kidney dysfunction.

Question 3: What is the best initial treatment for this diagnosis?
A. Intralesional bleomycin
B. Simvastatin
C. Orthopedic referral and excision
D. Dapsone
E. Allopurinol
F. Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy

Answers:
A. Intralesional bleomycin – Incorrect. Intralesional bleomycin can be used for the treatment of treatment-resistant viral warts. This medication is an antibiotic derived from the fungus Streptomyces and has not been shown to be useful in the treatment of EED.
B. Simvastatin – Incorrect. Simvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor and lipid-lowering agent. It has been part of the treatment of an underlying dysbetalipoproteinemia found in an individual with tuberous and tendinous xanthomas. It is not expected to help treat the lesions of EED.
C. Orthopedic referral and excision – Incorrect. Excision is a second- or third-line treatment for the lesions of EED that do not respond well to initial therapy or for patients who are not good candidates for medical therapy.
D. Dapsone – Correct. Dapsone is an antileprotic agent that inhibits myeloperoxidase, thereby limiting the damage incurred to normal tissue in neutrophilic dermatoses. It has been shown to be helpful in resolving lesions in patients with EED. Individuals should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as these patients have a higher risk of hematologic adverse effects. The other treatment options include intralesional corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, tetracyclines, and chloroquine.
E. Allopurinol – Incorrect. Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, which is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to uric acid. It reduces the production of uric acid in the treatment of gout. It is not used in the treatment of EED.
F. Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy – Incorrect. EED has been shown to be associated with HIV infection, hepatitis infections, monoclonal gammopathies, and autoimmune diseases, and a thorough history and physical examination with appropriate testing should be done as part of a complete workup. However, treatment for suspected HIV should not be initiated without further laboratory investigations.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We systematically searched PubMed up to May 22, 2015, for original research articles investigating the relationship between G6PD deficiency and malaria, using the term "((glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) AND malaria) OR (G6PD AND malaria) NOT "review"[publication type]". Our search returned 564 articles, which we supplemented with secondary citations and our personal collections. Most reports focused on drug treatment of malaria, particularly the effects of primaquine and other antimalarial drugs in people with G6PD deficiency, on diagnostic methods for detecting G6PD deficiency, on G6PD deficiency as a cause of blackwater fever, or were limited to descriptions of the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, and included data from studies from diverse regions with very different genetic backgrounds and malaria epidemiology. We therefore restricted our search to studies done in Africa by the inclusion of the additional search term "AND Africa", returning 157 articles that were subjected to further appraisal. These studies used a wide range of experimental designs and most had a small sample size (< 200); however, 34 reports contained at least some data regarding the association between G6PD deficiency and malaria from clinical or epidemiological studies since 1960, of which eight contained data on asymptomatic parasitaemia, 15 contained data on uncomplicated malaria, and 16 contained data on severe or complicated malaria. These reports reached a range of conclusions about the relationship between G6PD deficiency and malaria, including no significant effect (six reports) or positive or negative associations in various groups of males or females (28 reports). Some studies have considered heterogeneity at the G6PD locus as a potential explanation for the confusing findings from earlier studies, concluding that G6PD deficiency is a balanced polymorphism driven by selection for heterozygous females. The wide range of study designs, diagnostic approaches, and populations under study precluded a formal meta-analysis.

### Tumor lysis syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia with novel targeted agents [^f46ec979]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

The NCCN recommends rasburicase for patients with any high‐risk feature (e.g. bulky disease requiring immediate therapy) in whom adequate hydration is not possible or allopurinol is ineffective, or in patients with acute renal failure [4]. Although the schedule of rasburicase was initially recommended as 0.2 mg/kg daily for up to 5 days, subsequent data support a single dose of 0.15–0.2 mg/kg, with a second dose the next day if the uric acid level is not back to within normal range [20]. A single fixed dose of 6 mg rasburicase administered intravenously is also common for lowering uric acid in the management of TLS [21], [22]. Although rasburicase is effective in correcting hyperuricemia, there are no randomized controlled trials showing that it prevents renal failure or death [23], [24]. Patients who are considered candidates for rasburicase, especially those of African or Mediterranean descent, should first be tested for glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because those with a deficiency of the enzyme are at risk for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.

Alkalinization of the urine is no longer recommended as a management strategy because it may be associated with metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate precipitation [1], [25]. To avoid the risk of nephropathy due to calcium phosphate deposition, treatment of asymptomatic hypocalcemia is generally not recommended. Dialysis should be considered for patients with acute kidney injury who have life‐threatening electrolyte disturbances [1].

### Evaluation of a novel quantitative test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: bringing quantitative testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency closer to the patient [^f9f4f05c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an essential enzyme that protects red blood cells from oxidative damage caused by certain drugs, diseases, and foods. The X-linked human G6PD gene is highly polymorphic with many mutations resulting in reduced enzyme activity in red blood cells or G6PD deficiency. Exposure to oxidative agents can induce hemolysis in red blood cells with low G6PD activity levels and cause severe anemia, sometimes requiring blood transfusion or causing irreversible renal damage and even mortality, if not managed promptly. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency presents clinically in the neonate as jaundice resulting from hyperbilirubinemia; this may lead to kernicterus, a form of brain damage. Several medications including rasburicase- and 8-aminoquinoline–based antimalarial drugs, such as primaquine, are known to cause clinically significant hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. A high of dose primaquine (a 7-or 14-day regimen) is required to cure patients of Plasmodium vivax malaria. If a patient is not cured of P. vivax, they are at risk of relapse with increasing risk of morbidity and further transmission of the parasite. Relapse contributes to more than 50% of the disease burden in a community. A single dose of tafenoquine, another 8-aminoquinoline, when given with chloroquine is capable of curing a patient of P. vivax. Tafenoquine, recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for radical cure of P. vivax, under the Krintafel label, is indicated for individuals with greater than 70% G6PD activity. Tafenoquine has also been approved by the FDA with a different dosage for prophylaxis, under the Arakoda label, with similar indications for G6PD deficiency.

### The association between allopurinol use and urologic malignancies: a nested case-control study… [^1160756e]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract 435 Background: Oxidative stress may be involved in tumorigenesis processes. Uric acid is an important natural antioxidant that may reduce oxidative stress. Allopurinol is a commonly used uric acid lowering agent. There are conflicting data regarding the association between allopurinol use and cancer incidence. In the present nested case control study, we aimed to evaluated the association between allopurinol use and urologic malignancies in a large western population. Results: The study population included: for bladder cancer 13440 and 52421 matched controls, prostate cancer 27212 cases and 105940 controls, RCC 1547 cases and 6066 controls. Allopurinol use was associated with a significantly increase of risk for bladder cancer. prostate cancer, RCC.

In a sensitivity analyses we observed similar associations when alopurinol use was initiated more than two years prior to cancer diagnosis, for bladder cancer, prostate cancer, RCC. Conclusions: Allopurinol use may be associated with an increased risk for urologic malignancies. Information Published In Journal of Clinical OncologyVolume 38

### Severe hemolysis during primaquine radical cure of plasmodium vivax malaria: two systematic reviews and individual patient data descriptive analyses [^370cbc01]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

The prospective clinical trials in our reviews generally applied more conservative criteria for classifying adverse events as serious (presumably with the aim of ensuring patient safety in a controlled environment) than the case reports and pharmacovigilance studies in our second review. The latter often had limited clinical and laboratory information available prior to the onset of the events. Even when comprehensive data are available, the clinical and laboratory features that justify hemolysis being classified as serious or life-threatening have yet to be defined. This results in a lack of consistent data for decisionmakers to balance the risks of PQ radical cure with the risks of multiple relapses of vivax malaria in different endemic locations. Quantifying these risks will require robust definitions of hemolysis that can accommodate differential access to laboratory investigations. Standardized templates for reporting relevant clinical and laboratory details of potential hemolytic events will facilitate this process greatly. An example of a form for reporting the key data identified in our analysis is provided in.

The second of our systematic reviews included all articles published since the introduction of PQ. The largest case series were reported from South America, where the prevalence of G6PD deficiency is high, and comparatively large daily doses (0.5 mg/kg) of PQ are recommended. Conversely, no severe hemolytic events were reported from Africa, where G6PD deficiency is mostly attributable to the A− variant, which is associated with a lower risk of PQ-induced hemolysis. Ascertainment of severe hemolysis cases from Africa is likely to have been lower than in South America because commonly used rapid diagnostic tests are generally P. falciparum specific and therefore do not detect cases of vivax malaria, and PQ is rarely prescribed for radical cure of P. vivax or P. ovale malaria. Based on a priori criteria for certainty of association, 101 cases of severe hemolysis were categorized as probably or possibly related to PQ, all but one of which occurred in patients with either intermediate or severe G6PD deficiency. The first signs and symptoms of hemolysis occurred within 4 days of starting treatment in more than 90% of cases, with hospitalization occurring most frequently on day 4 after a median total dose of 2 mg/kg. All patients presented to hospital within the first week after starting PQ. Most cases occurred in patients receiving ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day. The signs and symptoms of severe PQ-associated hemolysis in our review concurred broadly with those found in G6PD-deficient patients treated with the sulfur-based antimalarial drug dapsone.

Introduction

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD [MIM:]) deficiency (MIM:) is the most common enzymopathy worldwide, affecting more than 500 million individuals.G6PD is important in red blood cells since it is the sole source of NADPH needed for detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have variants with decreased activity, which can lead to three main clinical manifestations: neonatal jaundice, chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA), and acute hemolytic anemia (AHA) in response to stressors such as certain foods, antibiotics, antimalarials, and infections that elevate reactive oxygen species. Underlying G6PD deficiency is great genetic diversity, with hundreds of identified variant alleles, mostly missense variants in the coding sequence. Interpreting the function and clinical effects of G6PD variants is critical to prevent adverse drug reactions, which are avoidable by prescribing alternate drugs, and to promote neonatal health by prompting increased monitoring.

G6PD is located on the X chromosome, so variant phenotypes are most clearly observed in hemizygotes and homozygotes; heterozygotes are largely unaffected, though phenotypes vary between individuals and over time due to random X-inactivation, but identification is important to avoid anemia and jaundice in hemizygous fetuses. Some G6PD variants reach high frequency in specific populations since they provide protection from severe malarial infection and thus are under balancing selection. Many of these G6PD variants are well studied and have been reported in dozens of publications along with their activity, clinical manifestations, and distribution across local and global populations. However, many variants are rare and have little data or conflicting reports on their connection to G6PD deficiency and anemia.

To aid in understanding the effects of G6PD variants, Yoshida and colleagues suggested a five-category classification system in 1971, based on variant activity and severity of anemia. The classification scheme, called the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification, was modified in 1985 to contain four classes: class I variants with very low activity resulting in CNSHA, class II with very low and severe deficiency, class III with decreased activity and moderate to mild deficiency, and class IV with near normal activity. However, even the original authors cautioned that the classification groups were for "convenience" and cutoffs made "somewhat arbitrarily". The identification of variants associated with CNSHA that have activity over the 10% cutoff, and the overlap of clinical presentations between classes II and III, led to blurring of distinctions between classes. Additionally, many variants were classified based on activity or clinical presentation measured in only one individual.

### Primaquine-induced severe hemolysis in the absence of concomitant malaria: effects on G6PD activity and renal function [^bc200f11]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Primaquine prevents relapses of Plasmodium vivax malaria but can cause severe hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The clinical and laboratory features of this outcome are usually confounded by the clinical and hemolytic effects of concomitant malaria. We describe a case of severe hemolysis occurring after a total dose of 2.04 mg/kg of primaquine used for prophylaxis in a young, G6PD-deficient (Kaiping variant), Australian man without malaria. During acute hemolysis, he had markedly elevated urinary beta-2-microglobulin, suggestive of renal tubular injury (a well-recognized complication of primaquine-induced hemolysis). He also had albuminuria and significantly increased excretion of glycocalyx metabolites, suggestive of glomerular glycocalyx degradation and injury. We show that regularly dosed paracetamol given for its putative renoprotective effect is safe in the context of severe oxidative hemolysis. Acute drug-induced hemolysis transiently increases G6PD activity. Cases such as this improve our understanding of primaquine-induced hemolysis and ultimately will help facilitate widespread safe and effective use of this critically important drug.

### Prevalence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and its association with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and blood-type incompatibility in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2a85ebd6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

What is known about the subject?

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a common cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in low-income nations.
The reported prevalence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in sub-Saharan Africa is inconsistent.

What this study adds?

The overall magnitude of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia was estimated to be 28.08% (95% CI 20.23% to 35.94%) in sub-Saharan Africa.
Neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and neonates that had a blood type that was incompatible with their mothers' were more likely to develop hyperbilirubinaemia.

### Primaquine: report from CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis I [^e7e4ef61]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Primaquine phosphate has been used for preventing relapse of Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale malaria since the early 1950s, based on its ability to kill latent (hypnozoite) and developing liver stages of these parasites. There are three uses for primaquine in malaria: radical cure of established infection with P. vivax or P. ovale malaria; presumptive anti-relapse therapy (PART; terminal prophylaxis) in persons with extensive exposure to these parasites; and primary prophylaxis against all malaria species. All persons for whom primaquine is being considered must have a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme level checked before use, and persons who have a deficiency of G6PD must not take primaquine for prophylaxis or PART. The recommended adult dose for PART based on clinical trials and expert opinion is 30 mg base daily for 14 days, started on return from a malarious region and overlapping with a blood schizonticide. The adult dose for primary prophylaxis is 30 mg daily begun 1 day before travel and continued for 7 days after return. This review will examine the evidence for these recommendations.

### Improving the radical cure of plasmodium vivax malaria [^be1035d1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

The WHO therapeutic guidelines recommend that patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before prescribing primaquine. However, diagnostic tests will never be 100% reliable and in practice, are usually unavailable in resource-poor settings. The risk of primaquine-induced hemolysis is dose-dependent; hence, the consequences of inadvertently administering a high-dose primaquine regimen to a G6PD-deficient individual erroneously diagnosed as G6PD normal will need to be gauged before wider recommendations can be made.

After more than half a century of being reliant on primaquine for delivering P. vivax radical cure, the prospect of new treatment options is becoming reality. Tafenoquine, currently in phase III clinical trials, has potential to clear the liver of P. vivax hypnozoites with a single 300-mg dose. However, tafenoquine is also an 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial with potential to cause severe hemolysis. Although adherence to a complete course of treatment will undoubtedly be much improved with tafenoquine, the challenges of ensuring patient safety may be even more challenging than with primaquine, because tafenoquine has a long half-life, which will result in patients being exposed to the drug for a prolonged period. Priority now needs to be given to developing robust and affordable G6PD deficiency point-of-care tests, generating greater knowledge of the prevalence of different variants of G6PD deficiency and their associated risks of hemolysis, and improving adherence to a complete course of treatment. Information on risks needs to be balanced against a greater awareness that failing to deliver radical cure comes with its own inherent dangers of recurrent bouts of malaria. The important paper by Durand and othersin this edition of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene highlights that, after years of relative neglect, we are finally making progress in delivering safe and effective antimalarial treatment strategies for P. vivax.

TPMT and NUDT15 Testing: Consider genotyping or phenotyping patients for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. TPMT and NUDT15 testing cannot substitute for complete blood count (CBC) monitoring in patients receiving azathioprine. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS: Cytopenias, ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

Drug Interactions: Use with Xanthine Oxidase (XO) Inhibitors: One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by XO inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat). Patients receiving Azathioprine Tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose. Concomitant use of Azathioprine Tablets with febuxostat is not recommended. Inhibition of XO may cause increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or its metabolite, 6-MP, leading to toxicity. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving Azathioprine Tablets and xanthine oxidase inhibitors because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections).

### Primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines for reducing plasmodium falciparum transmission [^24ffe100]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

One of the constraints to widespread use of PQ is that the drug is known to be a haemolytic trigger in people with glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The deficiency is X‐linked and expressed in a wide variety of variants and levels of G6PD deficit (Howes 2013). PQ can occasionally cause serious haemolytic anaemia, haemoglobinaemia, and renal failure. The effect depends on the degree of enzyme deficiency, the dose of PQ, and the pattern of the exposure. These occasional, but clearly serious, adverse effects have led to a reputation of being "unsafe" (Ashley 2014). Although the haemolysis appears less likely at lower dose, there have been few studies in G6PD‐deficient people at low doses of PQ (Olalekan 2017).

The WHO 2010 Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria recommended adding a single dose of PQ at 0.75 mg/kg to treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in people who are not G6PD‐deficient with the goal of reducing transmission at the community level (WHO 2010). However, since testing for G6PD deficiency was rarely done and due to the concerns about the safety of this single dose, the WHO convened a special expert review group in 2012 to reconsider this recommendation (WHO 2012a). The expert group concluded that:

G6PD testing should be done more widely;
countries already implementing single‐dose PQ should reduce the dose to 0.25 mg/kg in G6PD‐deficient patients; and
countries not currently implementing single‐dose PQ but which are targeting malaria elimination, or are threatened by artemisinin resistance, should add 0.25 mg/kg PQ to treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (White 2012).

These conclusions were then incorporated into a revised WHO recommendation in treatment guidelines (WHO 2012b) for 0.25 mg/kg PQ in the above circumstances, with the goal of reducing transmissibility of treated P. falciparum infections (except in pregnant women, infants under six months of age, and women breastfeeding infants under six months of age). A slightly revised policy was then included in an updated policy brief (WHO 2015a), and in the third edition of the WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria (WHO 2015b), which expanded the area of recommendation to all "low transmission areas"; this was a strong recommendation with low certainty evidence and it was stated that G6PD deficiency testing was not required.

### Hydroxychloroquine [^c793f9fd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Risks Associated with Use in Porphyria

Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid PLAQUENIL in patients with porphyria.

Hepatotoxicity Associated with Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported when hydroxychloroquine was used in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Patients received dosages ranging from 200 mg twice weekly to 400 mg daily. Most of the PCT-related cases presented with marked elevations in transaminases (> 20 times upper limit of the reference range) within days to a month of hydroxychloroquine initiation. In some cases, PCT was diagnosed only after the occurrence of treatment-induced liver injury, when hydroxychloroquine was prescribed for an approved indication. Some of the cases were associated with other risk factors for hepatic injury (e.g., alcohol use, concomitant hepatotoxic medications).

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, such as fatigue, rash, nausea, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal serum liver tests (e.g. ALT level greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and investigate further to establish the probable cause.

The safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for the treatment of PCT have not been established and hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not approved for this use.

5.6 Hematologic Toxicity

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug.

### Donor sex, age and ethnicity impact stored red blood cell antioxidant metabolism through mechanisms in part explained by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels and activity [^8cecfb22]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Caution is advised in the interpretation of the presented results, in that (i) it is unclear whether oxidative hemolysis is predictive of clinically-relevant outcomes and (ii) RBC that are less susceptible to oxidant hemolysis may on the other hand be more susceptible to lysis following mechanical and osmotic insults. In this view, the biomarkers and biological correlates to oxidative hemolysis identified here are relevant and potentially translatable to studies pertaining oxidant injury, though they may be less relevant for studies on RBC function under mechanical or osmotic stress, such as for example in the capillaries and in the kidney. Future studies will investigate metabolic correlates and potential mechanistic determinants to these phenotypes. However, prior work has highlighted the clinical relevance of conditions that are associated with increased oxidative hemolysis, such as a causative link between G6PD deficiency and decreases in end of storage autologous post-transfusion recovery in healthy volunteersand post-transfusion circulation in sickle cell recipients.

Drug-induced AHA

Clinical course

The main features of drug-induced AHA are well known (Luzzatto & Poggi). The two drugs for which we have extensive detailed data are PQ and dapsone. As mentioned above, the clinical course of PQ-induced AHA (Fig 1) has been studied in a number of African-American normal volunteers (Tarlov et al). The clinical picture was very similar to that of favism, which was already well known (Luisada; Meloni et al,): except that with favism the severity is extremely variable, certainly at least in part because the amount of fava beans consumed is highly variable; with PQ 45 mg/day the pattern was instead fairly uniform (Tarlov et al). All subjects had a drop in Hb of about 50 g/l, with a nadir on day 7; they all had haemoglobinuria for 1–3 d; they all developed characteristic changes on the blood film [see Fig 2; and (Bain,)]; they all became jaundiced; they all had a brisk reticulocyte response.

TMP-SMX adverse reactions and dapsone safety — other considerations: For people with HIV with non-life-threatening adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, the drug should be continued if clinically feasible. If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, reinstitution of therapy should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII), and the dose of TMP-SMX can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII). TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued, with no rechallenge, in people with HIV with life-threatening adverse reactions including suspected or confirmed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). G6PD levels should be checked before administration of dapsone, and an alternative agent should be used if the patient is found to have G6PD deficiency.

### Hemolytic potential of tafenoquine in female volunteers heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (variant) versus G6PD-normal volunteers [^eb2f0ee9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

The overall median frequency of G6PD deficiency alleles in malaria endemic regions is estimated at 8.0%though it can reach > 30% in some populations. Except for some rare severely deficient variants, most individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic unless exposed to oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency is geographically associated with regions of malaria, either current or historical, and is thought to be associated with some protection from lethal malaria. The G6PD gene is on the X-chromosome, consequently, G6PD-deficient hemizygous males and homozygous females have only G6PD-deficient red cells and are at greatest risk of severe AHA. Lyonization in females heterozygous for G6PD-deficient variants results in highly variable proportions of G6PD-deficient and G6PD-normal red cells, the phenotype ranging from that of hemizygous deficient males to that of G6PD-normal individuals.

Tafenoquine, coadministered with a 3-day chloroquine course, is in Phase III development as a single-dose treatment for the prevention of P. vivax relapse. A recent Phase IIb dose-ranging study identified tafenoquine 300 mg as the minimally effective dose (when given with chloroquine): relapse-free efficacy at 6-months was 89.2% (95% confidence interval 77–95) with tafenoquine 300 mg and 77.3% (63–87) with primaquine 15 mg for 14 days plus chloroquine. Tafenoquine, like primaquine, is an 8-aminoquinoline derivative and also causes hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals, including heterozygotes. However, it was unknown whether the longer half-life of tafenoquine versus primaquine would increase the risk and degree of G6PD-associated hemolysis.

### Severe acute haemolytic anaemia associated with severe methaemoglobinaemia in a G6PD-deficient man [^3345d27f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Methaemoglobin is a form of haemoglobin in which the ferrous (Fe²⁺) ion contained in the iron-porphyrin complex of haem is oxidised to its ferric (Fe³⁺) state. Methaemoglobinaemia, the presence of methaemoglobin in the blood, is most commonly treated with methylene blue. However, methylene blue cannot be used in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency as it is ineffective in such patients and it can worsen G6PD deficiency haemolysis. We report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with clinical features of G6PD deficiency-associated haemolysis and was found to have severe methaemoglobinaemia (35%). He was administered blood transfusions and intravenous ascorbic acid. His methaemoglobinaemia resolved within 24hours. This case demonstrates the successful management of a patient with severe methaemoglobinaemia in the setting of G6PD deficiency haemolysis. Emergency physicians should be aware of the possible co-occurrence of severe methaemoglobinaemia in a patient with G6PD deficiency haemolysis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1de7cc63]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy — primaquine use and G6PD considerations: There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of primaquine use in pregnant women, and animal data is scant. Another animal study in gestation found no harmful effects on mother or offspring. In an observational study from Brazil, 59 women were found to have been prescribed primaquine for malaria during pregnancy, and no adverse birth outcomes were found, although G6PD testing was not done on the infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that primaquine not be administered during pregnancy because of the risk of hemolytic anemia in a G6PD-deficient fetus, and intravascular hemolysis appears to be associated with both the dose of primaquine and severity of G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked inherited condition and primaquine can be considered if both the pregnant woman and biologic father have normal G6PD activity. Primaquine should be used in pregnancy only if other alternatives are not available or tolerated and the benefit is felt to outweigh the risk (AIII).
