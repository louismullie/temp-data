## Question

Otitis externa treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of acute otitis externa, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing AOE from mimics. Then, I should assess pain and management modifiers. Next, I will select initial therapy, including topical choice and delivery optimization. After that, I need to define when to add systemic therapy and how to monitor for treatment failure. Finally, I will consider special populations, prevention, and summarize a practical algorithm with durations and follow-up anchored to guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions. Diffuse AOE typically presents with rapid-onset otalgia, canal edema/erythema, and tenderness with tragal pressure or pinna traction; I should verify these features and actively exclude mimics such as AOM, furunculosis, herpes zoster oticus, contact dermatitis, and referred otalgia, because management diverges substantially and misclassification drives inappropriate systemic antibiotics [^111C8v8t] [^114pRRqk] [^11228YG5].

> I need to check for factors that modify management before choosing therapy. Nonintact tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromise, prior head/neck radiotherapy, and inability to deliver topical therapy all change risk and drug selection; I should confirm tympanic membrane status visually when possible and remember that tympanometry with a type A tracing supports an intact membrane unless there is a reason to suspect otherwise [^1132tbYL] [^112TDfG3].

> Pain is often severe in AOE, so I should assess severity explicitly and treat proactively. Wait, let me verify the strength of this recommendation: guidelines make pain assessment and analgesia a strong recommendation; NSAIDs or acetaminophen are first-line, with scheduled dosing for persistent pain, and short-course opioids reserved for severe cases; topical anesthetic drops are not recommended due to limited evidence and potential interference with contact of therapeutic drops [^111sWt9f] [^116vvmL1] [^114M75tG].

> Now, for initial therapy, I should confirm that topical therapy is first-line for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding oral antibiotics; multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show topical antimicrobials increase clinical cure by about 46% and bacteriologic cure by about 61% versus placebo, and adding systemic antibiotics to topical therapy does not improve outcomes in uncomplicated cases, so I should avoid routine oral antibiotics unless specific indications exist [^113zxUG2] [^112nHFst] [^111qDrVB].

> Choosing among topical agents, I should double-check comparative efficacy. Most high-quality syntheses show no clinically meaningful differences between classes; quinolones may have small bacteriologic advantages but no consistent clinical superiority, and steroid-containing combinations can hasten symptom relief without compromising safety in typical cases; acetic acid is effective early but underperforms beyond week 1, so I should tailor to cost, adherence, tympanic membrane status, and patient preference [^113WD5Lw] [^112sa5M5] [^111qDrVB].

> If the tympanic membrane is perforated or status is uncertain, I need to ensure I select a non-ototoxic preparation. Fluoroquinolone otic solutions such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin are preferred because they are safe across the middle ear; aminoglycosides should be avoided when the membrane is not intact due to ototoxicity risk with prolonged or repeated exposure, even though single short courses may be tolerated in some contexts [^114C4PPy] [^112TDfG3] [^115wkSsV].

> Next, I should review delivery optimization because edema and debris can block penetration. Let me consider aural toilet to remove obstructing material and placement of an ear wick when the canal is too swollen for drops to reach the epithelium; I should also teach proper instillation technique, including tragal pumping and maintaining position for several minutes, and warm the bottle to reduce vestibular symptoms; if a wick is used, I should reassess in 48–72 hours and remove or replace as needed [^117PjRY1] [^114aCnLQ] [^115wkSsV].

> I should confirm duration and expectations. Typical courses are 7–10 days, with many patients improving within 48–72 hours; if symptoms persist beyond a week, extending to a total of 14 days is reasonable, but persistent symptoms beyond 2 weeks warrant reassessment for adherence, obstruction, misdiagnosis, resistant organisms, or contact sensitivity; patient education should emphasize keeping the ear dry during treatment and avoiding instrumentation [^114M75tG] [^111qDrVB] [^11228YG5].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to systemic therapy. Indications include extension beyond the canal (cellulitis of the pinna, periauricular tissues, or lateral skull base), diabetes, immunocompromise, failure of appropriate topical therapy with assured delivery, or inability to deliver topical therapy despite measures; when indicated, I should choose an oral agent active against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin commonly used, and consider MRSA risk in selected patients [^116Tyv8V] [^114aMwxC] [^11228YG5].

> I will now examine treatment failure and follow-up. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, I should reassess the diagnosis, ensure adequate drug delivery and adherence, consider culture if atypical or refractory, and evaluate for alternative or additional pathology; persistent symptoms at 2 weeks constitute treatment failure and should trigger a change in management, including consideration of fungal superinfection or noninfectious etiologies [^114aCnLQ] [^113sAFLV] [^116z8JU6].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly, diabetic, or has severe otalgia out of proportion to exam? I need to check for necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa, a skull base osteomyelitis with high morbidity; red flags include severe night pain, granulation tissue, cranial neuropathies, and systemic symptoms; early CT with contrast, ESR as a disease marker, ENT involvement, and prolonged antipseudomonal therapy are indicated, with hyperbaric oxygen reserved for refractory cases and no RCT evidence to mandate its routine use [^115PcmEb] [^111wNmKS] [^111xpjYp].

> For suspected fungal otitis externa (otomycosis), I should confirm with otoscopy for hyphae and debride thoroughly, then initiate topical antifungals such as clotrimazole or boric acid; if Aspergillus is identified, IDSA guidance supports mechanical cleansing plus topical antifungal therapy for noninvasive disease, reserving systemic voriconazole for tissue-invasive disease or refractory cases [^115N9TDv] [^116z4f8K].

> In children, I need to ensure age-appropriate dosing and safety. Ofloxacin 0.3% is FDA-approved down to 6 months with once-daily dosing for 7 days, and ciprofloxacin otic combinations are similarly supported; I should avoid neomycin-containing drops in children with tympanostomy tubes or suspected perforation due to ototoxicity risk and favor non-ototoxic fluoroquinolones when TM status is uncertain [^115wkSsV] [^117TkkCm].

> For prevention and recurrence mitigation, I should counsel on water precautions during treatment and for several weeks after, consider acidifying drops after swimming in recurrent cases, and address underlying dermatologic drivers; let me reconsider the role of routine water precautions during active therapy — evidence is limited, but pragmatically keeping the canal dry reduces maceration and supports healing, aligning with guideline emphasis on patient education and risk-factor modification [^114M75tG] [^114U9KpW] [^11228YG5].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I should confirm AOE clinically and exclude mimics, assess pain and treat analgesically, screen for modifying factors including TM status, and start topical therapy with delivery optimization; if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours, reassess and consider culture and systemic therapy; if severe, refractory, or high risk for MOE, image early and involve ENT; typical uncomplicated cases improve within 2–3 days and resolve within 7–10 days with adherence and dryness precautions [^115Fetqo] [^114aCnLQ] [^11228YG5].

---

Otitis externa treatment centers on **topical antibiotics with corticosteroids** [^111nP3hx] for 7–10 days [^11228YG5], with **analgesia and aural toilet** [^116ZLvWP] as needed. Use **non-ototoxic fluoroquinolones** (e.g. ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) [^114C4PPy] if the tympanic membrane is perforated or status is unknown [^116vvmL1]. Avoid **systemic antibiotics** unless there is extension beyond the canal or the patient is immunocompromised [^116Tyv8V] [^113YUrtu]. Reassess at 48–72 hours [^114aCnLQ]; if there is no improvement, confirm the diagnosis, reassess adherence, and consider alternative causes or referral [^113sAFLV].

---

## Topical antibiotic therapy

Topical antibiotics are **first-line therapy** [^111nP3hx] for uncomplicated otitis externa, achieving high local concentrations and rapid symptom relief [^112nHFst]. Commonly used agents include:

- **Ciprofloxacin**: Effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus; non-ototoxic and safe for use with perforated tympanic membranes [^116c4UPX] [^11228YG5].

- **Ofloxacin**: Similar efficacy to ciprofloxacin; non-ototoxic and suitable for patients with tympanic membrane perforation [^117TkkCm] [^115wkSsV].

- **Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone**: Effective and low-cost; avoid if tympanic membrane is perforated due to potential ototoxicity [^114C4PPy].

---

## Role of corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are often combined with topical antibiotics to **reduce inflammation, edema, and pain** [^116c4UPX]. Clinical trials demonstrate faster symptom resolution and higher cure rates with steroid-containing drops compared to antibiotics alone [^notfound]. Commonly used combinations include ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin/hydrocortisone [^notfound].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **recommended duration** of topical therapy is typically 7–10 days [^11228YG5]. Most patients experience significant symptom improvement within 48–72 hours [^114aCnLQ]; persistent symptoms beyond this period warrant reassessment [^113sAFLV].

---

## Adjunctive measures

### Aural toilet

Aural toilet (ear canal cleaning) is **essential** to remove debris, exudate, and cerumen, allowing topical medications to penetrate effectively [^116CCdrP]. It is particularly important in cases of canal obstruction or severe edema [^114aMwxC].

---

### Ear wick placement

Ear wicks (expandable sponges) are **beneficial** when canal edema prevents drop penetration [^116CCdrP]. They facilitate medication delivery and are typically removed after 48–72 hours once edema subsides [^notfound].

---

### Patient education

Patients should be instructed on **proper drop administration** [^116CCdrP], including warming drops to body temperature, positioning the affected ear upward, and maintaining position for several minutes post-instillation [^115wkSsV]. Keeping the ear dry during treatment is essential to prevent recurrence [^11228YG5].

---

## Systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are **not recommended as initial therapy** for uncomplicated otitis externa [^116Tyv8V] due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects [^111eFdvA]. Indications for systemic therapy include:

- Extension of infection beyond the external auditory canal (e.g. cellulitis, malignant otitis externa) [^115PcmEb].

- Immunocompromised patients or those with systemic symptoms [^114aMwxC].

- Failure of topical therapy after 48–72 hours [^notfound].

Preferred systemic agents include **fluoroquinolones** (e.g. ciprofloxacin) or **amoxicillin-clavulanate**, selected based on local resistance patterns and patient factors [^notfound].

---

## Management of special populations

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric management mirrors adult care, with topical antibiotics as **first-line therapy** [^11228YG5]. Ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin are preferred due to their non-ototoxic profile and ease of administration [^116c4UPX].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients require **careful assessment** and may need systemic antibiotics or prolonged topical therapy. Close follow-up and early specialist referral are recommended [^115PcmEb].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Preventive measures are **critical** to reduce recurrence risk:

- Keep the ear canal dry (use earplugs or cotton balls with petroleum jelly during bathing) [^114M75tG].

- Avoid trauma or instrumentation of the ear canal [^114U9KpW].

- Consider prophylactic acidifying drops (e.g. acetic acid 2%) for frequent recurrences [^114U9KpW].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Patients should be **reassessed within 48–72 hours** [^114aCnLQ] to ensure symptom improvement and adherence to therapy. Persistent symptoms warrant re-evaluation of the diagnosis, medication delivery, and consideration of alternative causes (e.g. fungal infection, contact dermatitis) [^116z8JU6].

---

Otitis externa management centers on **topical antibiotics with corticosteroids** [^111qDrVB], with adjunctive aural toilet and patient education. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for complicated cases, and reassessment at 48–72 hours ensures effective treatment and identifies alternative diagnoses if symptoms persist [^114aCnLQ].

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111JMW5U]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — classification of evidence-based statements explains that guidelines are intended to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, to minimize harm, and to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, with an evidence-based approach requiring that the evidence supporting a policy be identified, appraised, and summarized and that an explicit link between evidence and statements be defined; evidence-based statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm, and the definitions for evidence-based statements are listed in Tables 3 and 4; guidelines are not intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion, and less frequent variation in practice is expected for a "strong recommendation" than for a "recommendation", with "Options" offering the most opportunity for practice variability; values applied by the panel sought to minimize harm and diminish unnecessary and inappropriate therapy and aimed to be transparent and explicit about how values were applied and to document the process.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1114su9G]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — recommendation strength categories and clinician implications are defined as follows: A strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; a recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences; an option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role; and no recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms and clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making while remaining alert to new published evidence, with patient preference having a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1133n2bV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — scope and target population covers an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 and provides evidence-based recommendations to manage AOE, defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE, and recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. The guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists — head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, and is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed. Differences from the prior guideline include new evidence from 12 randomized controlled trials and 2 systematic reviews.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aCnLQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111zhfeC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — outcomes prioritize clinical resolution of AOE, defined as resolution of presenting signs and symptoms (for example, pain, fever, otorrhea), and additionally consider minimizing ineffective treatments, eradicating pathogens, minimizing recurrence, cost, complications, and adverse events, maximizing health-related quality of life, and minimizing distress and inconvenience among caregivers.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^113YUrtu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis externa, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, AAO-HNS 2014 guidelines recommend to do not offer systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116cTiiN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute otitis externa, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AAO-HNS 2014 guidelines recommend to reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse acute otitis externa and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa [^113zxUG2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa.

Study Design

Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups permitting one or more of the following comparisons: antimicrobial vs placebo, antiseptic vs antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic vs nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial vs antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid vs steroid.

Results

Twenty trials met inclusion criteria and 18 had data suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval, 29% to 63%) and bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences were noted in clinical cure rates for other comparisons, except that steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but had statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.

Conclusion

Topical antimicrobial is highly effective for acute otitis externa with clinical cure rates of 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences were noted in comparative efficacy, but broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes make these of questionable clinical significance.

Significance

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa executive summary [^116SLoNd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Necrotizing otitis externa: a systematic review [^117VX4vw]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review of scientific evidence available about necrotizing otitis externa, emphasizing epidemiologic data, diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols, follow-up criteria, prognosis factors, and chronologic evolution.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.

Study Selection

We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.

Data Extraction

We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.

Data Synthesis

For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.

Conclusion

Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^114tQTwk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® inflammatory ear disease [^112vZAq1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

This document provides evidence-based guidelines for appropriateness of imaging modalities in cases of inflammatory ear disease covering acute and chronic, and uncomplicated and complicated otitis media and otitis externa in adults. Imaging recommendations for initial imaging and postoperative surveillance of cholesteatoma in adults have also been addressed. This document provides guidance for physicians in the choice of imaging while managing cases of complicated or uncomplicated inflammatory conditions of the ear, and managing initial presentation or postoperative cases of cholesteatoma. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa [^111xpjYp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.

Data Collection and Analysis

No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.

Main Results

Due to the lack of data we could present no results.

Authors' Conclusions

No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^113JAUMB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa:

- **Definition**: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- **Pathophysiology**: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### Initial impact of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care [^112q4WmU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives. Determine the influence of the acute otitis externa clinical practice guideline on clinical care. Study Design. Cross-sectional study with historical controls. Setting. Outpatient departments in the United States. Methods. Cases of acute otitis externa occurring in 2004–2005 (before guideline publication) and 2007–2008 (after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Prescribing rates for ototopical medications, analgesic recommendations, and oral antibiotics were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations. Results. An estimated 5.50 (standard error of the estimated mean, 0.38) million visits (mean age, 27.7 [1.7] years; 49.8% male) with a primary and singular coded diagnosis of acute otitis externa were studied (2.64 [0.26] million visits for 2004–2005 and 2.86 [0.28] million visits for 2007–2008). Prescribing rates for ototopical preparations were 67.2% (5.3%) and 67.6% (5.0%) before and after guideline publication, respectively (P = 0.955). Recommendation rates for analgesics were 14.2% (3.3%) and 20.6% (3.9%), respectively (P = 0.248). Prescription rates for oral antibiotics were 21.7% (4.8%) and 30.5% (3.6%), before and after, respectively (P = 0.166). Conclusion. Clinician behavior in the medical treatment of acute otitis externa has not significantly changed after guideline publication, despite clear, evidence-based guideline recommendations. These data have important implications for performance measures based on the guideline. Further efforts toward guideline dissemination are likely needed.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Malignant otitis externa [^115tKgMV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is an invasive, potentially life-threatening infection of the external ear and skull base that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. It affects immunocompromised individuals, particularly those who have diabetes. The most common causative agent remains Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Definitive diagnosis is frequently elusive, requiring a high index of suspicion, various laboratory and imaging modalities, and histologic exclusion of malignancy. Long-term oral antipseudomonal agents have proven effective; however, pseudomonal antibiotic resistance patterns have emerged and therefore other bacterial and fungal causative agents must be considered. Adjunctive therapies, such as aggressive debridement and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, are reserved for extensive or unresponsive cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^11228YG5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

Acute otitis externa — topical therapy efficacy and bacteriologic outcomes — shows high clinical resolution across agents, as about 65% to 90% of patients had clinical resolution within 7 to 10 days, while a network meta-analysis reported superior clinical cure for topical quinolones versus antibiotic-steroid combinations (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.57) but the superiority of quinolones was no longer significant in the direct comparisons. For bacteriologic endpoints, nonquinolone therapy achieved 87% cure with an 8% absolute increase when a quinolone antibiotic is used, and the clinical significance of this modest effect (NNT of 12 patients) is noted; another meta-analysis reported higher bacteriologic cure with quinolones (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02).

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^115nN2h8]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^114bH3WX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

Aspergillus ear infections — treatment differs by disease type: noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, also called otomycosis, is treated by thorough mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal followed by topical antifungals or boric acid (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas we recommend that clinicians treat IA of the ear with a prolonged course of systemic voriconazole, usually combined with surgery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Tissue-invasive Aspergillus otitis should be treated with prolonged systemic voriconazole, often necessitating surgical debridement, and in the absence of evidence of tissue invasion, we do not recommend that colonization should be treated.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^113WD5Lw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

Statement 1 — differential diagnosis for acute otitis externa (AOE) specifies that clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal, with a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk; the action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality Grade C observational studies and Grade D reasoning from first principles, level of confidence in evidence high, benefit improved diagnostic accuracy, risks/harms/costs none in following the recommended action, benefits-harm assessment preponderance of benefit over harm, value judgments importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences none regarding the need for a proper diagnosis, and exceptions none. Supporting text notes symptoms including otalgia (70%), itching (60%), or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%) or ear canal pain on chewing; identifies a hallmark sign of diffuse AOE as tenderness of the tragus when pushed and the pinna when pulled, or both; and states that otoscopy will reveal diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, and material in the ear canal. It also warns that AOE can mimic the appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) and emphasizes that distinguishing AOE from AOM is important because the latter may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^111MDeQS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

Statement 2 — modifying factors in diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE): Clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk. The action statement profile characterizes the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as High, the benefits-harms assessment as a Preponderance of benefits over harm, and the policy level as Recommendation. Key clinical history components that can modify management include diabetes, HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, history of radiotherapy, and presence of tympanostomy tubes or a perforated tympanic membrane (nonintact tympanic membrane).

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112ckTkN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2–4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare "home therapies" (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

### Malignant otitis externa: an updated review [^116oXW2E]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Malignant otitis externa is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most isolated microorganism and it affects mostly to diabetic, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Non-resolving otalgia and chronic otorrhea are the clinical manifestations presented. Facial nerve palsy is a common and well recognized complication. (Computed tomography) CT scan is useful for initial assessment, Technetium-99m is highly sensitive and is part of the protocol for diagnosis. Treatment should be individualized, with multidisciplinary cooperation among specialties. Management involves systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics and monitoring with radiologic techniques, it also involves the strict control of diabetes. It is essential to follow up the patients for at least a year post-treatment. In refractory malignant otitis externa and affection of facial nerve, surgical management is recommended. We reviewed the most recent studies on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment to provide an update on Malignant Otitis Externa that can offer an overview for clinical practice and future research.

### Use of systemic antibiotics for acute otitis externa: impact of a clinical practice guideline [^1132wK97]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the extent of systemic antibiotic use among patients with acute otitis externa (AOE), as well as the impact of an AOE clinical practice guideline publication in 2006.

Study Design

Interrupted time series study of retrospective data.

Setting

Medicaid billing data from 29 states between 2002 and 2010.

Patients

Patients with age less than 65 years, continuous Medicaid eligibility for 12 months before AOE diagnosis, and dispensation of antibiotics within 1 day before through 3 days after AOE diagnosis.

Main Outcome Measures

The proportion of AOE visits that received systemic antibiotics among all AOE visits that were dispensed any antibiotics, systemic or topical.

Results

We found 682,865 AOE visits that received systemic or topical antibiotics for AOE. The proportion of systemic antibiotic therapy either with or without topical therapy was 43.1% before and 38.3% after AOE guideline publication. There was no significant immediate drop (-0.01; 95%CI, -0.031–0.011) or change in trend (0.002; 95%CI, -0.001–0.004) in the prevalence of systemic antibiotic therapy after guideline publication.

Conclusion

Publication of an AOE clinical guideline did not lead to a decline in systemic antibiotic therapy as initial AOE treatment. Additional efforts will be needed to curb systemic antibiotic treatment for AOE.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Is biofilm the cause of chronic otitis externa? [^116FqkWY]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study was undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, we considered patients affected by chronic external otitis treated either by chemical ear peeling (CEP) or by antibiotic/steroid treatment to compare the clinical and microbiological outcomes. In the second phase, we compared the microscopic findings observed in the CEP samples of patients affected by chronic otitis externa's acute exacerbation or by acute otitis externa to demonstrate the role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of chronic otitis externa.

Study Design

Prospective, double-blind, controlled study.

Methods

In phase 1 we compared clinical and microbiological data collected from two groups of 25 patients with chronic otitis externa treated by CEP or by conventional antibiotic/steroid treatment. In phase 2 we compared the results of the optical and electron microscopic analysis of specimens obtained by performing CEP in two groups of patients (25 with chronic otitis externa exacerbation and 15 with acute otitis externa).

Results

In phase 1 the disease control rate yielded markedly better results when treated with CEP. In phase 2 biofilms were identified in 23 of the 25 patients with chronic otitis externa exacerbation (92%) and in only three acute external otitis cases (20%).

Conclusions

CEP is a simple and effective method for the treatment of chronic external otitis. The removal of the bacterial biofilm has a high correlation with a long-term clinical remission.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Ofloxacin otic (ofloxacin) [^115wkSsV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Otitis Externa: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of otitis externa is:

For pediatric patients (from 6 months to 13 years old): Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.

For patients 13 years and older: Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear once daily for seven days.

The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for five minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Acute Otitis Media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients (from 1 to 12 years old) with tympanostomy tubes is:

Five drops (0.25 mL, 0.75 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for ten days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness that may result from the instillation of a cold solution.

The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media with perforated tympanic membranes: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes in patients 12 years and older is:

Ten drops (0.5 mL, 1.5 mg ofloxacin) instilled into the affected ear twice daily for fourteen days. The solution should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness which may result from the instillation of a cold solution. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, before instilling the drops. The tragus should then be pumped 4 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. This position should be maintained for five minutes. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^117TkkCm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (< 12 years of age) as is the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently to achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial [^1111QJxS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 6 months and had OE of < 2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to < 13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged ≥ 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.

Results

Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52% males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).

Conclusions

Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111eFdvA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — overuse and harms of oral antibiotics: Despite the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy of topical preparations, about 20% to 40% of subjects with AOE nonetheless receive oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical antimicrobials, and despite a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics clinicians actually prescribed more systemic antibiotics postpublication (31% vs 22%). Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112nHFst]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116Pji9w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) medical therapy — For purposes of counseling parents, the clinician should convey that drugs and medications are not recommended for managing OME. Antihistamines, decongestants, antireflux therapy, and topical nasal steroids are ineffective. Orally administered steroids have short-term efficacy, but after 1 or 2 months the benefit is no longer significant. Antibiotics have a small benefit in resolving OME, but they have significant adverse effects and do not improve HLs or reduce the need for future surgery. Last, despite the popularity of complementary and alternative therapy, there are no RCTs to show benefits in managing OME.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — drug delivery recommendation: The clinician should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; this recommendation is based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality "Grade C, observational studies and D, first principles", level of confidence "High", benefit "Improved adherence to therapy and drug delivery", and risks/costs "Pain and local trauma caused by inappropriate aural toilet or wick insertion; direct cost of wick (inexpensive)".

### Current indications for surgical intervention with lateral skull base osteomyelitis [^113bnj8L]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Lateral skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), also called malignant otitis externa or necrotitizing otitis externa, is a subacute yet relentless infection of the external auditory canal and skull base most often found in elderly males and diabetics. When SBO was first described in the 1950s, the first‐line therapy was surgical intervention. Over the past few decades, a transition toward culture‐directed antibiotics has shifted the treatment paradigm of SBO toward primary medical management, with mortality rates now decreased to 10%–20% compared to 50% initially.

Today, the treatment of SBO involves multidisciplinary coordination between otolaryngology and infectious disease. Although the introduction of quinolone antibiotics has significantly decreased mortality rate, the rate of surgical intervention has not drastically changed over time. Due to the rarity of this condition, there is significant variability in practice styles between individuals and institutions, and there is no consensus on the specific indications for surgical intervention. The purpose of this best practice review was to interpret the available evidence to better define contemporary indications for surgery.

### Malignant otitis externa: a novel stratification protocol for predicting treatment outcomes [^113n8q75]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

1) Stratify malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories. 2) Predict treatment courses and outcomes based on this stratification.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients

Retrospective review 2004 to 2014; 28 patients. Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics/debridement, minimum 1 year of follow-up.

Interventions

Severe group stratification if two or more of the following: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, major radiographic findings. All other patients stratified to nonsevere group.

Main Outcome Measures

Cure, alive/refractory disease, death by disease, death by other cause. Secondary measures are antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.

Results

Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p = 0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% and 0% in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 wk; p = 0.01) and more disease-related admissions/relapses (1.6 versus 1, p < 0.001). Only four of 12 severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.

Conclusion

A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement. A combination of clinical and radiographic findings may be useful for stratifying patients into severe/nonsevere categories. Patients with severe disease may be more likely to die of their disease and have worse treatment courses such that additional surgical intervention may be indicated.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^112mLwzR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical study, ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure. However, the findings suggest the benefits of combining the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to better manage patients with AOE, with regard to both the bacterial infection and the typical disease signs and symptoms.

Symptoms lasted for a median of 8.0 days (95% confidence interval 7.0 to 9.0) in the acetic acid group, 7.0 days (5.8 to 8.3) in the steroid and acetic acid group, and 6.0 days (5.1 to 6.9) in the steroid and antibiotic group. The overall cure rates at seven, 14, and 21 days were 38%, 68%, and 75%, respectively. Compared with the acetic acid group, significantly more patients were cured in the steroid and acetic acid group and steroid and antibiotic group at day 14 (odds ratio 2.4, 1.1 to 5.3, and 3.5, 1.6 to 7.7, respectively) and day 21 (5.3, 2.0 to 13.7, and 3.9, 1.7 to 9.1, respectively). Recurrence of symptoms between days 21 and 42 occurred in 29% (50/172) of patients and was seen significantly less in the steroid and acetic acid group (0.3, 0.1 to 0.7) and steroid and antibiotic group (0.4, 0.2 to 1.0) than in the acetic acid group.

Conclusions

Ear drops containing corticosteroids are more effective than acetic acid ear drops in the treatment of acute otitis externa in primary care. Steroid and acetic acid or steroid and antibiotic ear drops are equally effective.

Type of antibiotic prescribed for ear symptoms and conditions

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, this antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases (Fig. 2, Supplementary Appendix 4).

### Clinician adherence to the clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112qWgkL]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Over 10years have passed since the Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa (CPG-AOE) was first published, and it has been several years since its update. We sought to assess clinicians' adherence as well as referral patterns.

Study Design

Survey.

Methods

A 23-question survey was distributed to regional primary care clinicians evaluating demographic data, perception of the clinical practice guideline (CPG), adherence, and details of specialist referral. Statistical analysis was performed to compare adherence and referral patterns using the Fisher exact test or the χ² test.

Results

One hundred seventeen clinicians completed the survey. Fifteen respondents (12.8%) had reviewed the CPG. The recommendations with the least reported adherence were pain management (39.1%) and accounting for prior radiotherapy as a modifying factor (43.0%). The recommendations of prescribing ototopical therapy and avoiding systemic antimicrobials in uncomplicated acute otitis externa had adherence of 94.0% and 83.8%, respectively. When analyzed by provider type (e.g., resident, nurse practitioner/physician assistant), there were no significant differences in adherence. No significant differences in adherence were observed based on previous review of the CPG. When reporting frequency of specialist referral, the majority of respondents selected rarely (53.9%). The most favored reason for referral was symptoms > 4weeks (86.3%).

Conclusions

Of the providers who responded, very few had reviewed the CPG-AOE. Despite the added emphasis on pain management in the CPG update, this recommendation had the lowest adherence. Rates of adherence were similar across provider types and did not differ significantly if the CPG was reviewed. Efforts at improved provider education should be considered to increase adherence to the CPG.

### An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa [^111wNmKS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC). This disease is rare but has severe morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurologic deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC, and culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.

Conclusions

MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis that must be suspected when patients with immunocompromise, diabetes, or advanced age present with severe otalgia. Rapid diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and improve outcomes.

Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa — epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment: Necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa is an aggressive infection that predominantly affects elderly, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients, and P aeruginosa is isolated from exudate in the ear canal in more than 90% of cases. A clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate plus an abnormal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan, with other imaging modalities including gallium scan, indium-labeled leukocyte scan, technetium bone scan, and single-photon emission tomograph. Treatment includes surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics adequate to cover pseudomonal and staphylococcal infection, including methicillin-resistant S aureus, and biopsy may be necessary to detect neoplasia if the diagnosis is uncertain or response to therapy is delayed.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^116c4UPX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canalthat can be acute (most common) or chronic. The estimated incidence of acute otitis externa (AOE) is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 of the general population, and it is a common infection treated by health care professionals.

Historically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as common causative pathogens. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with water exposure in the ear canal commonly noted. Patients with AOE present with otalgia, tenderness, diffuse ear canal edema, and otorrhea. In severe cases, symptoms may result in sleep disturbance and severe discomfort, leading to many health care visits.

In uncomplicated AOE, current guidelines recommend treatment with topical antimicrobial agents with or without anti-inflammatory drugs, risk factor avoidance, and pain management, when required. Topical antibiotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they can reach high local concentrations in the infected area, demonstrate a low risk of adverse events (AEs), and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance.

Topical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (neomycin and gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin), with cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Topical fluoroquinolones are not associated with ototoxic effects and are effective in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria (including P aeruginosa).

In AOE, the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotic treatment is believed to enhance the resolution of the inflammatory response and improve associated symptoms. Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, has already shown superiority vs ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of diffuse otitis externaand vs ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone for children with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMTs). This combination is currently approved to treat AOE and AOMTs in more than 50 countries outside the US and for AOMTs in the US and Canada. The present study was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, vs ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone to treat AOE.

We describe the patterns of antimicrobial prescribing and trends in disease occurrence among children with otitis externa using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1995 to 2000. Oral antimicrobial therapy for otitis externa is more likely to contribute to antimicrobial resistance than is topical antimicrobial therapy and is rarely indicated. Thirty-nine percent of visits resulted in a prescription for topical antibiotics, and 25% of visits resulted in a prescription for oral antibiotics. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing for otitis externa occurs frequently.

### A single topical agent is clinically equivalent to the combination of topical and oral antibiotic treatment for otitis externa [^112axshr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate clinical equivalence (statistical noninferiority) of topical ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone (CHC, Cipro HC) and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone (NPH, Cortisporin) with systemic amoxicillin (AMX, Amoxil), for treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Design

Randomized, active-control, observer-blind, multicenter trial.

Patients

Altogether, 206 patients were enrolled (CHC, 106; NPH + AMX, 100). Patients were ≥ 1 year of age, had AOE > 2 days with at least mild symptoms, and gave informed consent. All were evaluable for safety, and 151 were evaluable for efficacy.

Interventions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone 3 drops twice daily for 7 days (adults and children) or NPH 4 drops (adults) or 2 drops (children) with AMX 250 mg (adults and children) 3 times daily for 10 days, as directed in approved product labeling.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy 7 days after treatment ended (test of cure). Secondary variables included time to end of pain, symptom scores (otalgia and tenderness) and microbiological eradication. Noninferiority was declared if the lower confidence limit around the measurement difference was above -10 (nearer zero).

Results

Response to therapy was higher for CHC (95.71% vs 89.83%) but was statistically noninferior (lower confidence limit, -4.98) to NPH + AMX. Median time to end of pain was 6 days for both groups. Noninferiority was declared for symptom scores at all measurement periods and for microbiological eradication. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone is clinically equivalent to NPH + AMX for the treatment of AOE in adults and children. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC.

### Improving patient care pathways in otitis externa [^115VNDHx]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Referrals for otitis externa (OE) have dramatically increased but the reasons for this remain unclear. We aim to characterize management of patients both pre- and post-referral to identify areas of improvement at the primary-secondary care interface.

Methods

Questionnaire study from consultant-led research clinic specifically set up to prospectively analyse OE referrals at a tertiary referral centre for Otolaryngology.

Results

Sixty-two patients were included; 63% female, median age 57 years. One was excluded (clinically not OE). Most patients had multiple primary care visits before referral (average 4 GP; 2 practice nurse). Sixty per cent had received oral antibiotics (16% multiple classes). Eighteen per cent had never had ear drops. Thirty-nine per cent were not advised to keep ears dry. Twenty-one per cent had dermatitis; 13% contact allergy, 30% systemic allergy, 5% diabetes. Less than 10% had narrow canals. Thirty-six per cent had active discharge but < 7% needed a wick. Approximately 75% appear suitable for community aural care clinics.

Conclusions

OE occurs most commonly in female patients, often with associated risk factors. Patients often consult primary care several times prior to referral. Lifestyle advice and ototopical drops are frequently overlooked; instead, often inappropriately treated with oral antibiotics. Most ears were anatomically normal, and community aural care clinics may have a role in more timely and accessible treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^112WQcci]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The study Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) was published by Laurence Chu and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute otitis externa. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the trial question was: is the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide superior to fluocinolone acetonide in patients with acute otitis externa? In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the population was: 297 patients (153 female, 144 male). The inclusion criteria were adult and pediatric patients aged > 6 months with acute otitis externa. The key exclusion criteria were previous episode of acute otitis externa within 4 weeks or > 1 episode of acute otitis externa within 6 months; tympanic membrane perforation; otitis media; malignant otitis externa. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the interventions were: n = 197 ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution BID for 7 days) n = 100 fluocinolone acetonide alone (fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution BID for 7 days). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinical and microbiological cure at day 8–10 (61.2% vs. 44.4%; AD 16.7%, 95% CI -0.6 to 34). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median number of days until cessation of ear pain (5 days vs. 7.7 days; AD -2.7 days, 95% CI -6.7 to 9) Significant increase in sustained microbiological response (91.3% vs. 75.6%; AD 15.7%, 95% CI 2 to 29.4) No significant difference in clinical and microbiological cure at day 15–17 (87.4% vs. 80%; AD 7.4%, 95% CI -6 to 20.7). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the conclusion was: in adult and pediatric patients aged > 6 months with acute otitis externa, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide was not superior to fluocinolone acetonide alone with respect to clinical and microbiological cure at day 8–10.

### Abstract… [^112HPpyD]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of the external auditory canal. In one recent study, 1 otitis externa was found to be disabling enough to cause 36 percent of patients to interrupt their daily activities for a median duration of four days, with 21 percent requiring bed rest. It is typically a localized process that can be easily controlled with topical agents, yet physicians use systemic medications to treat this condition 65 percent of the time. 2 If otitis externa is not optimally treated, especially in immunocompromised patients, the potentially life-threatening infection can spread to the surrounding tissues. Anatomy and Physiology of the External Auditory Canal The unique structure of the external auditory canal contributes to the development of otitis externa. 4, 25 as a means of monitoring response to treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can also be used to monitor therapeutic response.

25 The excellent antipseudomonal activity of the fluoroquinolones has generally made them the treatment of choice for necrotizing otitis externa, although a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic and aminoglycoside is also effective. 26 In severe cases, a prolonged course of parenteral antibiotics may be needed, but the excellent gastrointestinal absorption of the fluoroquinolones allows milder infections to be treated with a two-week course of oral therapy. Treatment should also include surgical debridement of any granulation or osteitic bone. 4, 7, 25 Thus, an otolaryngologist should usually be involved early in the course, especially if the patient does not respond quickly to appropriate treatment. Another potential complication of otitis externa is a focal furuncle of the lateral third of the external auditory canal, which can occur as a result of obstructed apopilosebaceous glands. Localized swelling is usually significant and may include a superficial abscess that can be drained.

Treatment consists of local heat and topical and systemic antibiotics to eradicate the most common pathogen. At times, only normal flora can be cultured. Treatment consists of the use of acidifying drops combined with steroid drops, but persistent cases require referral to an otolaryngologist for frequent otomicroscopic cleansing and debridement. Rarely, surgery is needed to enlarge and resurface the external auditory canal. 4, 6. Treatment Cleansing of the ear canal by suctioning is a principal treatment. Acidifying drops, given three or four times daily for five to seven days, are usually adequate to complete treatment.

### Acute otitis externa: an update… [^116vvmL1]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment TOPICAL MEDICATIONS Topical antimicrobials, with or without topical corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. Topical antimicrobials are highly effective compared with placebo, demonstrating an absolute increase in clinical cure rate of 46 percent or a number needed to treat of slightly more than two. TREATMENT METHODS Use of a topical otic preparation without culture is a reasonable treatment approach for patients who have mild symptoms of otitis externa. If the tympanic membrane is intact and there is no concern of hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, a neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone otic preparation would be a first-line therapy because of its effectiveness and low cost. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone are approved for middle ear use and should be used if the tympanic membrane is not intact or its status cannot be determined visually.

4; these also may be useful if patients are hypersensitive to neomycin, or if nonadherence to treatment because of dosing frequency is an issue. Use of a corticosteroid-containing preparation is recommended to provide more rapid relief when symptoms warrant. ANALGESIA Pain is a common symptom of acute otitis externa, and can be debilitating. 12 Oral analgesics are the preferred treatment. First-line analgesics include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. When ongoing frequent dosing is required to control pain, medications should be administered on a scheduled rather than as-needed basis. Opioid combination pills may be used when symptom severity warrants. Benzocaine otic preparations may compromise the effectiveness of otic antibiotic drops by limiting contact between the drop and the ear canal. The lack of published data supporting the effectiveness of topical benzocaine preparations in otitis externa limits the role of such treatments.

CHRONIC OTITIS EXTERNA The treatment of chronic otitis externa depends on the underlying causes. Because most cases are caused by allergies or inflammatory dermatologic conditions, treatment includes the removal of offending agents and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. Chronic or intermittent otorrhea over weeks to months, particularly with an open tympanic membrane, suggests the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Initial treatment efforts are similar to those for acute otitis media. With control of the symptoms of otitis externa, attention can shift to the management of chronic suppurative otitis media.
