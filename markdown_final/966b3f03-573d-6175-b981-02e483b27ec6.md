## Question

Can Portal Hypertension In Chronic Liver Disease Contribute To The Development Of Mallory-Weiss Tears?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether portal hypertension in chronic liver disease can contribute to the development of Mallory-Weiss tears. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and how it alters gastroesophageal hemodynamics. Then, I should verify the classic mechanism of Mallory-Weiss tears and whether portal hypertension modifies that substrate. Next, I will examine direct and indirect clinical evidence linking portal hypertension to Mallory-Weiss bleeding. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, mechanistically grounded conclusion and outline the clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I anchor each claim to appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in chronic liver disease. Portal hypertension arises from increased intrahepatic resistance due to fibrosis and nodule formation, compounded by splanchnic vasodilation that increases portal inflow; clinically significant portal hypertension is typically defined by a hepatic venous pressure gradient of 10 mmHg or more, which drives portosystemic collateral formation and varices, and creates a hyperdynamic, relatively hypotensive splanchnic circulation with impaired mucosal perfusion dynamics [^042cb76c] [^cadf657e].

> Now, I need to check the classic mechanism of Mallory-Weiss tears. Traditionally, these are nontransmural lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction precipitated by a sudden rise in intragastric pressure during forceful vomiting, retching, coughing, or seizures; the mucosa and submucosa tear while the muscularis remains intact, producing bleeding that is often self-limited but can be substantial in some cases [^326b61d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how portal hypertension could plausibly modify this substrate. Portal hypertension produces mucosal congestion, edema, and friability at the cardia and GE junction, and it impairs mucosal defenses, which together could lower the threshold for shear-induced laceration during abrupt pressure spikes; additionally, the hyperdynamic circulation and coagulopathy common in cirrhosis may amplify bleeding once a tear occurs, even if the initiating event is modest [^042cb76c] [^042cb76c].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. Multiple contemporary sources explicitly list Mallory-Weiss tears among nonvariceal causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis and portal hypertension, indicating recognized occurrence in this population; for example, a 2024 sub-Saharan African cohort of cirrhotic patients includes Mallory-Weiss tears as a significant nonvariceal etiology, and a 2025 pediatric series identifies Mallory-Weiss tears as a notable cause of UGIB in infants, a group in whom portal hypertension from chronic liver disease can occur, albeit less commonly than in adults [^78b3c3ce] [^e0300bc0].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are mechanistic or guideline-level statements that bridge portal hypertension to Mallory-Weiss tears. AASLD guidance on portal hypertension details how elevated portal pressures distort mucosal perfusion and compromise defenses, creating a vulnerable mucosa that is more susceptible to injury; while not naming Mallory-Weiss tears specifically, this pathophysiologic framework supports a lower threshold for mucosal laceration during pressure surges, which aligns with the observed clinical association in cirrhotic patients [^042cb76c].

> I should double-check for indirect signals in interventional contexts. In cirrhotic patients undergoing intragastric balloon placement, Mallory-Weiss tears occurred as adverse events, suggesting that even iatrogenic gastric distension and retching in this population can precipitate such tears; this reinforces the concept that portal hypertensive mucosal vulnerability plus pressure events increases risk, even when the exact pressure dynamics are not purely spontaneous [^f7be2d7a].

> But wait, what if I'm overstating causality? Let me reconsider and ensure I distinguish contribution from sole causation. Mallory-Weiss tears are not exclusively a portal hypertensive phenomenon; they occur in the general population without liver disease, so portal hypertension does not create the tear mechanism de novo. Rather, it contributes by weakening the mucosal substrate and amplifying bleeding risk, thereby lowering the threshold for a pressure-triggered laceration and worsening its clinical impact when it occurs [^326b61d4] [^4a28ae53].

> I will now examine the clinical implications to ensure the synthesis is actionable. In cirrhotic patients with acute UGIB, endoscopists should actively search for Mallory-Weiss tears alongside varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy, because management differs; endoscopic hemostasis with band ligation or injection is effective for Mallory-Weiss bleeding, and guidelines emphasize early endoscopy to identify and treat the source, which is especially critical when portal hypertension coexists and bleeding can be severe despite a seemingly modest mucosal lesion [^a8d0b45a] [^b6f2abd7] [^e21416aa] [^22358ccd].

> In summary, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the evidence. Portal hypertension in chronic liver disease contributes to Mallory-Weiss tears by inducing mucosal congestion, edema, and impaired defenses at the gastroesophageal junction, which lowers the threshold for laceration during abrupt rises in intragastric pressure and worsens bleeding once a tear occurs; this is supported by clinical series listing Mallory-Weiss tears among nonvariceal sources in cirrhosis, pathophysiologic reasoning from portal hypertensive mucosal injury, and interventional observations in cirrhotic cohorts, even though the fundamental tear mechanism still requires a pressure surge and is not unique to portal hypertension [^78b3c3ce] [^4a28ae53] [^f7be2d7a] [^326b61d4].

---

Portal hypertension in chronic liver disease **increases the risk** of Mallory-Weiss tears by causing mucosal congestion, edema, and friability at the gastroesophageal junction, making the mucosa more vulnerable to shear injury from vomiting or retching [^4a28ae53]. While the classic trigger is forceful emesis, portal hypertension **lowers the threshold** for mucosal laceration and can worsen bleeding severity. Mallory-Weiss tears are a recognized non-variceal cause of UGIB in cirrhosis and should be considered in the differential, especially with recent vomiting or retching [^78b3c3ce] [^e8e277a7].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking portal hypertension to Mallory-Weiss tears

Portal hypertension leads to **structural and functional changes** in the gastrointestinal mucosa that predispose to Mallory-Weiss tears:

- **Mucosal congestion and edema**: Elevated portal pressure causes venous congestion and edema at the gastroesophageal junction, weakening the mucosa and submucosa and increasing susceptibility to shear injury [^4a28ae53].

- **Friability of the mucosa**: Chronic congestion and ischemia render the mucosa friable, reducing its tolerance to mechanical stress from vomiting or retching [^042cb76c].

- **Increased intraluminal pressure**: Portal hypertension increases intra-abdominal pressure, which during vomiting or retching can exceed the tensile strength of the weakened mucosa, causing lacerations [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Several studies and guidelines **recognize Mallory-Weiss tears** as a notable non-variceal cause of UGIB in cirrhosis:

- **Non-variceal UGIB in cirrhosis**: Mallory-Weiss tears are explicitly listed among non-variceal causes of UGIB in cirrhotic patients, alongside peptic ulcer disease and portal hypertensive gastropathy [^78b3c3ce] [^dd7bd9f0].

- **Endoscopic series**: Clinical series document Mallory-Weiss tears in patients with portal hypertension, often in the context of recent vomiting or retching, supporting a causal relationship [^e8e277a7].

- **Pediatric data**: In infants, Mallory-Weiss tears are a recognized cause of UGIB, likely related to immature gastroesophageal junctions and frequent forceful vomiting, with portal hypertension contributing to mucosal vulnerability [^e0300bc0].

---

## Risk factors and clinical presentation

Patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension who develop Mallory-Weiss tears typically present with:

- **Recent vomiting or retching**: Forceful emesis is the most common precipitating event, though the threshold for mucosal injury is lower in portal hypertension [^326b61d4].

- **Hematemesis**: Bright red blood or coffee-ground emesis is the hallmark presentation [^e8e277a7].

- **Melena**: Black, tarry stools may occur if bleeding is slower or intermittent [^e8e277a7].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Severe bleeding can cause shock, particularly in decompensated cirrhosis [^e8e277a7].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Endoscopy is the **gold standard** for diagnosing Mallory-Weiss tears in patients with portal hypertension:

- **Timing**: Endoscopy should be performed within 12–24 hours of presentation, ideally after hemodynamic stabilization [^b6f2abd7] [^a57b7ee3].

- **Endoscopic findings**: Linear mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction, often with active bleeding or visible vessels, are characteristic [^326b61d4].

- **Differentiation**: Care must be taken to distinguish Mallory-Weiss tears from variceal bleeding, as management differs significantly [^e8e277a7].

---

## Management strategies

Management of Mallory-Weiss tears in patients with portal hypertension follows **general principles** of UGIB care, with some modifications:

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Aggressive resuscitation with fluids and blood products is essential, especially in decompensated cirrhosis [^e57d49e8].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors is recommended to promote mucosal healing and reduce rebleeding risk [^96e961da].

- **Endoscopic therapy**: Endoscopic hemostasis with band ligation or injection therapy is highly effective for active bleeding or high-risk lesions [^e21416aa] [^22358ccd].

- **Monitoring for rebleeding**: Close observation for recurrent bleeding is necessary, as portal hypertension increases the risk of persistent or recurrent hemorrhage [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The prognosis of Mallory-Weiss tears in portal hypertension **depends on liver disease severity** and the adequacy of hemostasis. Recurrence is more likely in decompensated cirrhosis due to persistent mucosal vulnerability and coagulopathy, underscoring the importance of optimizing portal hypertension management and addressing underlying liver disease [^32eb2ad6].

---

Portal hypertension in chronic liver disease **increases the risk** of Mallory-Weiss tears by causing mucosal congestion, edema, and friability, which lower the threshold for shear injury from vomiting or retching. Recognizing this association is essential for timely diagnosis and management, as Mallory-Weiss tears are a significant non-variceal cause of UGIB in cirrhosis.

### Descriptive analysis of common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients in kerman: a study from 2022 to 2023 [^e0300bc0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Esophageal varices were the second most common cause of UGIB in our study, accounting for 13.3% of cases. This prevalence is notably higher than that reported in Western studies, such as Owensby et al. who found variceal bleeding in only 5–10% of pediatric UGIB cases. The higher prevalence in our population may reflect regional differences in the epidemiology of chronic liver disease, including higher rates of viral hepatitis and other causes of portal hypertension. Additionally, genetic predisposition, dietary habits, and environmental factors, such as exposure to hepatotoxins, may influence the progression of liver fibrosis and variceal development in this population. The age distribution of our study population, with a significant proportion of older children and adolescents, may also contribute to the higher prevalence of varices, as the risk of variceal bleeding increases with the duration of portal hypertension.

The etiological distribution of UGIB in our cohort demonstrated apparent age-dependent variations, consistent with trends reported in the literature. Gastric erosions were the predominant cause across all age groups, while Mallory-Weiss syndrome emerged as the second most common etiology in infants. This finding differs from previous studies that typically associate Mallory-Weiss tears with older children and adolescents. Infants may be predisposed to Mallory-Weiss tears due to the immature gastroesophageal junction and the frequent episodes of forceful vomiting or retching characteristic of this age group. However, the small sample size of certain subgroups, such as infants, limited the statistical power needed to detect significant age-related differences.

Endoscopy was performed in 100% of our study population, yielding a diagnostic rate of 88.4%. This reflects the critical role of endoscopy in identifying bleeding sources and guiding therapeutic decisions in pediatric UGIB. However, despite comprehensive endoscopic evaluation, 11.6% of cases remained without a definitive diagnosis. These undiagnosed cases may involve rare or subtle conditions, such as vascular malformations or small bowel bleeding beyond the reach of standard upper endoscopy. Advanced diagnostic techniques, such as capsule endoscopy or double-balloon enteroscopy, could improve diagnostic accuracy in such cases, but their availability remains limited in resource-constrained settings.

### Burden and determinants of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients: evidence from sub-saharan Africa, 2024 [^78b3c3ce]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), or bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz, is a common and ominous complication of liver cirrhosis, primarily caused by portal hypertension, variceal rupture, and coagulopathy. Though variceal bleeding is the most common etiology, non-variceal sources such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD), portal hypertensive gastropathy, and Mallory-Weiss tears also contribute a significant role.

Cirrhosis is usually developed due to chronic alcoholism, viral hepatitis, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and predisposes to UGIB, increasing morbidity and mortality. Despite the advancement in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, UGIB continues to be a formidable problem, especially in decompensated cirrhosis, increasing hospital stay, readmission rates, and healthcare costs.

In Ethiopia, a meta-analysis by Tesfaye BT, et al. (2021) showed the growing burden of viral hepatitis B and C, coupled with increased alcohol use, has fueled the growing prevalence of cirrhosis with overall hospital mortality reaching 25.0%. However, there is limited local data on UGIB for this population, which limits the formation of effective and context-specific interventions.

Globally, UGIB incidence is 50–100 per 100,000 person-years, with wide regional differences because of access to health care, population age, and management practices. There is regional variation in prevalence of UGIB: 5.78% in the USA, 42.3% in Nepal, 34.6% in China, with 94% of UGIB in India being caused by varices. In Africa, variceal etiologies in cirrhosis account for about 32.7% of UGIB in Ghana, 60% in Nigeria, and 68% in Uganda. In Ethiopia, a 52% prevalence of variceal hemorrhage was recently reported. Varices remain the most common etiology, but non-variceal etiologies play a role.

### Quality improvement guidelines for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [^1200e7e8]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Indications for Treatment and Contraindications

TIPS Indications

Generally, patients with a Child-Pugh score of > 12 are in high risk of postprocedural death. A thorough selection of patients is the key to successful treatment with TIPS. Scoring of patients by the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been validated to predict early mortality after TIPS. Patients with MELD scores of > 15–18 or a bilirubin level of > 60 μmol/L (3.5 mg/dl) should be informed of their poor prognosis, and TIPS should only be performed in the absence of any other treatment possibilities.

Refractory Ascites

Refractory ascites is the most frequent indication for TIPS. Refractory ascites is defined as an abdominal fluid collection that cannot be mobilized or the early recurrence of abdominal fluid that cannot adequately be prevented by medical therapy. The term refractory ascites has two different meanings: diuretic-resistant ascites and diuretic-intractable ascites. Diuretic-resistant ascites does not respond to an intensified diuretic treatment of up to 400 mg/day spironolactone, up to 160 mg/day of furosemide, and sodium restriction to a maximum intake of 5.2 g of salt/day. Diuretic-intractable ascites cannot be mobilized or their early recurrence cannot be prevented because of the development of diuretic-induced complications that preclude the use of an effective diuretic dosage.

Two important complications occur in patients with cirrhotic ascites: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in patients with ascites when there is direct communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. In most patients, the defect is in the diaphragm that overlies the dome of the liver. Hepatic hydrothorax is due to an accumulation of ascitic fluid migrating through the diaphragmatic defect.

Variceal Bleeding

The causes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in a patient with portal hypertension may be variceal rupture, portal hypertension gastropathy, postsclerotherapy ulcers, peptic ulcer disease, hemorrhagic gastritis, and Mallory-Weiss tear. TIPS is generally accepted as a second-line therapy after failure of endoscopic and medical therapy of bleeding from gastroesophageal varices.

Massive Thrombosis of the Hepatic Veins

TIPS is indicated when medical therapy fails. TIPS is technically feasible in most patients with thrombosis of the hepatic veins. A direct puncture from the intrahepatic inferior vena cava into the liver parenchyma is possible in patients without a remaining hepatic vein stump. The rationale of the use of TIPS is to decompress the liver from venous congestion using the portal vein and TIPS as an outflow tract.

### Esophageal bleeding disorders [^9ccbf5a3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Esophageal varices and Mallory Weiss syndrome are the two major esophageal bleeding disorders. Although there have been major breakthroughs in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding, the management of esophageal bleeding disorders remains a challenging problem. This review focuses on studies published in the previous 12 months that provide further understanding of the appropriate treatment of various esophageal bleeding disorders. Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding are also discussed.

Recent Findings

With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacologic treatments, mortality resulting from variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Band ligation is the first-line endoscopic treatment of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Vasoactive agents such as somatostatin analog and terlipressin are both safe and effective pharmacologic treatments of esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Use of a nonselective beta-blocker is still the most widely accepted treatment for both primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, the effectiveness of beta-blockers is limited by intolerance and nonresponders in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, endoscopic band ligation is used increasingly as an alternative strategy for primary prophylaxis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should be reserved as rescue therapy for failure of medical and endoscopic treatments. In recent years, noninvasive surrogate markers have been reported to identify high-risk patients with large esophageal varices. Platelet count, spleen diameter, and their ratio are accurate predictors of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. The endosonographic measurement of the cross-sectional surface area predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. For Mallory Weiss syndrome, endoscopic clipping is an emerging treatment modality, especially for deep laceration with risk of perforation.

Summary

A combination of various clinical, laboratory, and endosonographic parameters accurately predicts the risk of variceal hemorrhage. A streamlined screening strategy allows more cost-effective use of endoscopy and prompt prophylactic treatment for high-risk esophageal varices.

### Timing of endoscopy in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding: protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^e8e277a7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and definitions

AUGIB is defined as hematemesis and/or melena occurring within 5 days prior to the admission. Hematemesis is characterized as patients vomiting fresh red blood or coffee-ground-like contents. Melena is characterized as patients having black tarry stools or brown feces. Sometimes, patients with AUGIB also present with hematochezia.

The highly suspected diagnosis of variceal bleeding would be primarily dependent on the history of liver cirrhosis and clinical and imaging characteristics of portal hypertension.

Variceal bleeding would be diagnosed, if any one of the following conditions was met: (1) active bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices under endoscopy, (2) white thrombus on the surface of varices, suggesting recent variceal bleeding; or (3) only varices in the esophagus or stomach without any other sources of bleeding.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is characterized as gastrointestinal bleeding located above the Treitz ligament is caused by non-variceal sources, primarily including peptic ulcer, upper gastrointestinal tumors, stress ulcer, acute gastrointestinal mucosal damage, Mallory–Weiss syndrome, upper gastrointestinal vascular malformations, Dieulafoy's lesions, periampullary tumors, pancreatic tumors, and bile duct tumors.

Failure to control bleeding is defined as any one of the four following conditions within 5 days of admission: (1) vomiting of fresh blood; (2) suction of more than 100 mL of fresh blood from the nasogastric tube; (3) a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 30 g/L in the absence of blood transfusion; or (4) death.

Rebleeding is defined as a new onset of hematemesis or melena after successful treatment, and/or a decrease in hemoglobin concentration of 30 g/L in the absence of blood transfusion, and/or development of hypovolemic shock.

### Management of variceal and nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis [^dd7bd9f0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage remains the most common medical emergency managed by gastroenterologists. Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with liver cirrhosis can be grouped into two categories: the first includes lesions that arise by virtue of portal hypertension, namely gastroesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy; and the second includes lesions seen in the general population (peptic ulcer, erosive gastritis, reflux esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, tumors, etc.). Emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the standard procedure recommended for both diagnosis and treatment of UGIB. The endoscopic treatment of choice for esophageal variceal bleeding is band ligation of varices. Bleeding from gastric varices is treated by injection with cyanoacrylate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs as well as antibiotic treatment is started before or at the same time as endoscopy. Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is less frequent, usually chronic and treatment options include β-blocker therapy, injection therapy and interventional radiology. The standard of care of UGIB in patients with cirrhosis includes careful resuscitation, preferably in an intensive care setting, medical and endoscopic therapy, early consideration for placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and, sometimes, surgical therapy or hepatic transplant.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver's normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. Chronic inflammatory liver injury causes activation of hepatic myofibroblasts and macrophages, which increase collagen accumulation in the extracellular matrix. This process disrupts the connection between hepatocytes and sinusoids where blood flows, leads to formation of nodules of fibrosis, and impedes portal inflow resulting in portal venous hypertension. Chronic liver injury results in increased vasoconstrictor signaling and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow.

Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance. In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease. 57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver's capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance. Over time, patients may progress from compensated cirrhosis without clinical manifestations to decompensated cirrhosis with variceal hemorrhage, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension, defined as a pressure gradient between the hepatic and portal vein of 10 mm Hg or greater, promotes development of varices. Increasing portal pressure induces ascites from hepatic sinusoids.

Increased sinusoidal pressure causes increased lymph production, which extravasates into the peritoneum when lymphatic drainage capacity is exceeded. Gut-derived toxins, such as ammonia and bacterial products that induce systemic inflammation, cause hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy can develop at low ammonia levels in the context of infection. 59 While the mechanisms are incompletely characterized, the presence of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic injury from inflammation contribute to the genetic and epigenetic aberrations that lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Portal pressures can be estimated using a transjugular catheter to determine the hepatic venous pressure gradient, a measure of the pressure gradient across the liver.

### A bleeding vallecular varix, visualized by GI endoscopy, confirmed with CT angiography, and treated with sclerotherapy and cyanoacrylate [^2c4673b5]. VideoGIE (2018). Low credibility.

Upper-GI bleeding is most commonly secondary to peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, esophagitis, or variceal hemorrhage. Significant hemorrhage from an oropharyngeal source such as vallecular varices is rare, with only a few case reports available in the literature.

Sublingual varices have been described commonly in patients with cardiovascular disease and smoking; however, the pathogenesis of vallecular varices is poorly understood and believed to be secondary to chronic coughing resulting from respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and tuberculosis. Only 1 case of base-of-the-tongue varices in a patient with portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis has been reported. The diagnosis and treatment of the majority of these patients is based on an otolaryngology approach, with laryngoscopy-based or bronchoscopy-based diathermy coagulation, or laser. Only a solitary case has been treated with laryngoscopy-based injection sclerotherapy of 4 mL of tetradecyl sulfate.

A 59-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis and portal hypertension, who had undergone esophageal variceal ligation to obliteration within the preceding year, presented with episodes of "spitting up blood" without vomiting, melena stools, or coughing. She had experienced 3 similar presentations within 5 months, and no bleeding source had been identified by upper endoscopies performed on each occasion. After extensive investigations, including an evaluation by a pulmonary specialist, she was labeled to have "pseudohemoptysis". At this presentation, an otorhinolaryngologist performed an otorhinolaryngology evaluation and did not identify a source but stated that "abnormal-appearing" vessels were seen in the oropharynx.

The patient's hemoglobin dropped from 9.9 g/dL to 7.9 g/dL within 8 hours; her blood urea was normal at 2.9 mmol/L. EGD with an Olympus therapeutic gastroscope revealed no blood in the distal esophagus, stomach, or duodenum; however, fresh blood was visualized in the oral cavity.

### Efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon placement for weight loss in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation [^f7be2d7a]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of a fluid-filled intragastric balloon (IGB) for weight loss in patients with cirrhosis on the liver transplantation (LT) waiting list is unknown. We enrolled stable compensated patients with body mass index > 35 kg/m² and on the waiting list for IGB placement endoscopically for a maximum of 6 months. A total of 8 patients (7 men) aged mean ± SD, 56 ± 4.6 years with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium (MELD-Na) scores 14.1 ± 3.4 experienced weight reduction (146 ± 22.2 kg versus 127 ± 21.6 kg [P = 0.005] with IGB in place and 130 ± 24.6 kg [P = 0.014] at 6 months), with a total body weight loss of 12.2% ± 8.8% with IGBs in place and 10.9% ± 8.9% at 6 months. Body fat decreased from 48.6% ± 5.8% to 40.6% ± 6.4% (P = 0.001) and lean mass increased from 51.3% ± 6% to 59.4% ± 6.4% (P = 0.001). No change in MELD-Na scores occurred (P = 0.770). Early balloon retrieval was attributed to accommodative symptoms (n = 2) and liver decompensation (n = 1). Mallory Weiss tears (n = 3), but no portal hypertensive bleeding, occurred. Liver decompensation and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in 3 patients. A total of 4 patients with LT ± sleeve gastrectomy maintained overall weight loss. Of 4 patients who did not receive transplants, 2 experienced weight regain. IGB results in short-term weight loss in patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT, with body fat loss without lean mass loss. Adverse effects were common. Decompensation and HCC did occur, with uncertainty of the relation to weight loss, and thus careful patient selection and close follow-up are required.

### Endoscopic ligation for patients with active bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears [^cfa90a21]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Only a few patients with active nonesophageal variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding have been treated with endoscopic ligation. To further address this issue, four patients with active bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears who underwent endoscopic band ligation are presented.

Patients and Methods

Endoscopic ligation was performed in four patients with a median age of 52 years (range, 40–93 years) after a diagnosis of active bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears (MWTs). A 45-year-old man with massive persistent upper gastrointestinal bleeding as a cause of a MWT underwent therapeutical endoscopic band ligation after an unsuccessful endoscopic injection trial. On the contrary, injection therapy should have been performed on a 93-year-old woman with multiple myeloma because of an actively bleeding MWT caused by the fibrotic tissue after an unsuccessful endoscopic ligation trial, although her other actively bleeding MWT lesion had been ligated successfully.

Results

After endoscopic ligation, all patients achieved complete hemostasis, and rebleeding did not occur. They were discharged without complications after a control endoscopy.

Conclusions

### Construction and validation of a predictive model for the risk of rebleeding in patients with esophageal and gastric varices hemorrhage [^2c881115]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate and decompensation events in patients with liver cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices are significantly higher than those without esophagogastric varices. The risk of bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis is associated with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), and patients with HVPG ≥ 12 mmHg have a significantly higher risk of bleeding compared to those with HVPG < 12 mmHg. The RS scoring system includes important indicators such as endoscopic diagnoses like Mallory-Weiss tears, ulcers, tumors, and endoscopic findings such as bleeding, blood clots, and vessel exposure. However, it does not include the LDRf classification of esophagogastric varices. Therefore, the predictive ability of this scoring system for rebleeding risk in EGVH patients has certain limitations. In the process of constructing the model in this study, we conducted a detailed comparison and analysis of the location (upper, middle, lower esophagus; gastric fundus), diameter, and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of varices. The results revealed that patients with severe esophageal varices and involvement of the upper esophagus have a significantly higher risk of rebleeding compared to other EGVH patients. This result provides strong evidence for clinicians to visually assess the risk of rebleeding in patients based on endoscopic findings.

Introduction

When chronic causes of liver disease, such as alcohol, viral hepatitis or metabolic syndrome, persist, liver injury may develop slowly and progress to fibrosis, and eventually to cirrhosis. This process is paralleled with the development of portal hypertension (PHT), i.e. increasing pressure in the portal vein that takes blood from the gastrointestinal system and spleen to the liver. PHT usually progresses without symptoms until it reaches a critical threshold, known as clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), when symptoms like ascites, variceal bleeding and encephalopathy can become apparent. These 3 manifestations define decompensated liver cirrhosis, and are accompanied by a dramatic reduction in median survival, from more than 12 years in compensated cirrhosis to less than 2 years in decompensated cirrhosis. Cirrhosis currently accounts for 2 million deaths worldwide each year. Therefore, it is imperative to identify patients at risk for decompensation and mortality so that targeted (secondary) preventive measures can be implemented. Historically, the role of PHT in disease progression was largely overlooked; it was not until 1990, during the first international Baveno consensus meeting, that consensus definitions for PHT were established. More than 30 years have passed since Baveno I, and 6 other Baveno meetings have followed, leading to an exponential increase in research regarding PHT. This research has refined the concept of CSPH, which now serves as one of the most robust predictive biomarkers for liver disease progression. Although a great deal of knowledge has been gained about PHT, much remains to be discovered. This review provides an overview of what is currently known and which areas still need exploration.

### AASLD practice guideline on noninvasive liver disease assessment of portal hypertension [^aa60d942]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) for portal hypertension — rationale and limitations are described: NILDAs are attractive because "the presence and degree of portal hypertension is typically associated with poor clinical outcomes such as decompensation and death", and "NILDAs are most accurate in the detection of advanced forms of fibrosis (especially cirrhosis)", such that "it follows that NILDAs should readily detect portal hypertension, especially CSPH". Limitations include that "the correlation between fibrosis and degree of portal hypertension may not correlate", that prediction of esophageal varices "is not addressed in this guideline" and that "the additional confounder — variation in the propensity to develop esophageal varices in the setting of portal hypertension — is difficult to overcome", and that "the pathogenesis of severe portal hypertension is complex".

### Biomarkers of bacterial translocation in advanced chronic liver disease: the key to individualizing prognosis [^697e486f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with liver cirrhosis has evolved significantly in the past decade. No longer considered as having an invariably poor outcome, the need for better risk stratification and prognostic models for this patient group has become increasingly apparent. The definition and use of the term "cirrhosis" per se is also under scrutiny, with the recent Baveno VI consensus guidelines suggesting that the term "advanced chronic liver disease" (ACLD) should be used interchangeably. This highlights the ongoing paradigm shift where advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are perceived as two often clinically indistinguishable points on the same spectrum, with both attributing the risk of developing complications of chronic liver disease.

Portal hypertension has long been recognized as the main pathophysiological process governing the prognosis of patients with ACLD. However, the development of clinical signs of portal hypertension is an event already too late in the clinical trajectory of patients. This is illustrated by the substantial increase in the 1-year mortality of patients from 3.4% to 20% for stage 2 and stage 3 ACLD respectively, with the distinction between these stages being the development of ascites. Earlier identification of those at risk of disease progression is therefore urgently needed.

### Prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality in older UGIB patients using a simplified risk score and comparison with AIMS65 score [^d2dff4a2]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This risk stratification framework offers valuable guidance for healthcare providers when managing older patients with UGIB. If a patient's calculated ABCAP score is 3 or higher, timely intervention becomes crucial due to the significantly elevated risk of mortality. Conversely, if the score is below 3, while the mortality rate remains relatively high, the prognosis is generally expected to be more favorable. This risk-based approach facilitates informed decision-making and aids in prioritizing appropriate interventions for optimal patient care.

Variceal UGIB, often linked to liver disease and esophageal or gastric varices, contrasts with nonvariceal UGIB caused by peptic ulcers or Mallory-Weiss tears. Research in UGIB commonly focuses on nonvariceal cases due to the specialized treatment variceal bleeding requires. The differentiation between variceal and nonvariceal UGIB, crucial in many studies, can be complex. For example, one investigation reported higher mortality in nonvariceal bleeding, while another found no significant outcome differences between the two groups.

In our dataset, differentiating between variceal and nonvariceal bleeding was complicated by sparse varices information, reflecting the older population's lower endoscopy rates. Despite this, our univariable analysis indicated an association between variceal bleeding and prognosis, although it was selected as a variable by only three methods. Crucially, the ABCAP score performed consistently across both variceal and nonvariceal UGIB cases, showing no significant differences in score distribution or predictive accuracy. This underscores the ABCAP score's utility in risk stratification for UGIB, affirming its value as a versatile prognostic tool regardless of variceal status.

Limitation

Our study has provided valuable insights and promising results. However, certain data-related limitations need to be acknowledged. First, the relatively small sample size may limit the generalizability of our findings to a broader population. Additionally, missing data and potential biases in our retrospective study require careful consideration, even though we used imputation methods cautiously. In terms of study design, our adoption of a single-center retrospective design may introduce selection bias and limit the ability to establish causality. Conducting a multicenter prospective study would enhance the robustness of our findings.

### Hematemesis from varices in a 14-year-old without hepatobiliary disease: a "Wandering" diagnosis… [^97461a78]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematemesis, especially when severe enough to cause hemodynamic instability, typically occurs in patients with hepatobiliary pathology associated with portal hypertension and varices. However, hematemesis can rarely be the presenting symptom of a wandering spleen, via the development of varices from sinistral portal hypertension. This case report describes a 14-year-old previously healthy male with acute hematemesis, who was found to have a WS and variceal hemorrhage that required emergent resuscitation and splenectomy. Hematemesis because of variceal bleeding is a common diagnosis in adults with cirrhosis or other causes of generalized portal hypertension. In children and adolescents, hematemesis is most frequently because of Mallory-Weiss tears or peptic ulcer disease. Severe pediatric upper gastrointestinal bleeds are most often because of varices.

1 At all ages, varices usually result from generalized portal hypertension, but they can also result from isolated sinistral portal hypertension. One rare etiology of SPH is torsion of a WS. This case of a 14-year-old male with hemodynamically significant hematemesis as his presenting symptom represents an exceptionally rare manifestation of WS. 7–13 Varices result from increased pressure in the splenic venous system, leading to isolated SPH and high venous pressures in collateral drainage systems, namely the left portal venous system. This high pressure produces gastric varices, typically without esophageal varices because of their distinct drainage systems.

14 This contrasts with varices caused by generalized portal hypertension, which begins as right-sided venous hypertension and inevitably leads to left-sided venous hypertension. Isolated SPH in adults is usually caused by pancreatitis, pancreatic cysts, or pancreatic tumors, leading to splenic vein occlusion or thrombosis.
14. 9, 20 A few other case reports mention gastric varices that led to melena without hematemesis, 11, 20, 21 including one in which a pregnant patient presented with acute pancreatitis and then after cesarean delivery developed hemodynamically significant lower gastrointestinal bleeding from a gastric ulcer amid gastric varices, requiring splenectomy. 11.

### Endoscopic band ligation therapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding related to Mallory-Weiss syndrome [^e21416aa]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

No consensus exists as to the best endoscopic treatment for Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Endoscopic band ligation is a readily available and easily learned technique. This prospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic band ligation therapy for Mallory-Weiss syndrome.

Methods

From August 1998 to June 2005, a clinical trial assessed 37 patients with a diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss syndrome who had active bleeding, exposed vessels, or both. Their lesions were treated using endoscopic band ligation.

Results

Endoscopic band ligation was successful in 36 of 37 cases, with a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 24 months. The remaining patient had severe liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient bled again at 12 h and subsequently died. Except for this case, no recurrent bleeding, perforation, or other complications occurred.

Conclusions

The study results suggest that endoscopic band ligation is an effective, safe, and easily learned procedure for treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding related to Mallory-Weiss syndrome.

### Advances and challenges in cirrhosis and portal hypertension [^4b8ac02c]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is the fourth cause of death in adults in Western countries, with complications of portal hypertension being responsible for most casualties. In order to reduce mortality, development of accurate diagnostic methods for early diagnosis, effective etiologic treatment, improved pharmacological therapy for portal hypertension, and effective therapies for end-stage liver failure are required.

Discussion

Early detection of cirrhosis and portal hypertension is now possible using simple non-invasive methods, leading to the advancement of individualized risk stratification in clinical practice. Despite previous assumptions, cirrhosis can regress if its etiologic cause is effectively removed. Nevertheless, while this is now possible for cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C, the incidence of cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has increased dramatically and effective therapies are not yet available. New drugs acting on the dynamic component of hepatic vascular resistance are being studied and will likely improve the future management of portal hypertension.

Conclusion

Cirrhosis is now seen as a dynamic disease able to progress and regress between the compensated and decompensated stages. This opinion article aims to provide the author's personal view of the current major advances and challenges in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^e57d49e8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of rebleeding in patients with UGIB shows a wide range from 5% to more than 20%, depending on the aetiology of the bleeding and the timing of endoscopic therapy. There is strong evidence that the risk of rebleeding is highest in the initial period of admission, and a 24-h time frame for endoscopic therapy is internationally recommended as the optimal window of opportunity. Naturally, rebleeding must be prevented whenever possible.

PUB is the most common cause of acute UGIB, accounting for 31%-67% of all cases, followed by erosive disease, varices, oesophagitis, malignancies and Mallory-Weiss tears (Table 3).

Table 3
Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

In the subgroup of patients with PUB, bleeding from duodenal ulcers is slightly more frequent than from gastric ulcers.

Emergency surgery for PUB has continued to decrease; in the UK, the rate of surgery dropped from 8% to 2% between 1993 and 2006. In the same period in the USA, admissions to hospital for peptic ulcer bleeding fell by 28,2%, the use of endoscopic treatment increased by 58,9%, and the rate of emergency surgery for PUB decreased by 21,9%.

Initial assessment, resuscitation and risk-scores

A primary goal of the initial assessment is to determine whether the patient requires urgent intervention (e.g. endoscopic, surgical, transfusion) or can undergo delayed endoscopy or even be discharged to outpatient management.

Patients presenting with acute UGIB should be assessed promptly and resuscitated if needed. Volume should be replenished initially with crystalloid solutions.

In patients with ongoing blood loss, symptomatic anaemia, or those at increased risk of impaired tissue oxygenation (e.g. patients with chronic heart conditions), blood should be transfused. In haemodynamically stable patients who are not bleeding actively, the threshold of transfusion needs to be defined. International guidelines recommend a policy of transfusion to a haemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL.

Coagulopathy at presentation is a major adverse prognostic factor. From the UK National Audit, coagulopathy defined by an international normalised ratio (INR) above 1,5 was present in 16,4% of patients and was associated with a 15% mortality rate.

### Portal hypertension: from bedside to bench [^e47c41a5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The initial factor leading to portal hypertension is an increase in hepatic resistance. Later, an increase in portal blood flow contributes to maintain and exacerbate portal hypertension despite the development of portosystemic collaterals. The critical step in the development and acceptance of these concepts, which proved crucial for the management of patients with portal hypertension, was the development of animal models. These allowed the full characterization of the profound hemodynamic abnormalities in the systemic and splanchnic circulation associated with portal hypertension, and the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms implicated in these disturbances. This review traces how seminal clinical observations in the 1950s raised meaningful questions that were subsequently answered at the bench, leading to our current understanding of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and of the pathogenesis of severe complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal bleeding or ascites.

### Mallory-Weiss syndrome in four hemodialysis patients: a case study [^326b61d4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

MWS refers to non-transmural lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction that are generally caused by severe vomiting but can result from other causes, including increased intra-abdominal pressure and a rapid increase in the intragastric pressure (i.e. vomiting, severe coughing, epilepsy, acute or severe asthma, constipation, or endoscopy). It was first reported by Mallory and Weiss in 1929 and accounts for 1% to 15% of the causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. In most cases, MWS is a self-limiting, benign disease. Mild cases may be asymptomatic. In 85% of cases, the main symptom is hematemesis. The quantity of blood is variable. The diagnosis is based on gastroscopy, where a tear of the mucosa, submucosal hematoma, and bleeding are the diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis and cause of MWS are usually clear.

### Gallbladder perforation without cholecystitis in a patient awaiting liver transplantation: a peculiar case report of anaemia in cirrhosis [^5d396b84]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This study reported a peculiar case of gallbladder perforation without cholecystitis in a cirrhotic patient awaiting liver transplantation. The most interesting elements of this case are the diagnostic work-up, the presence of an advanced liver disease in the patient and the modality of treatment of one of the most severe complications of biliary pathology.

For patients with liver cirrhosis, causes of acute anaemia include haemolytic anaemia (autoimmune or secondary to hypersplenism), aplastic anaemia or occult haemorrhage. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases does not occur with haematemesis or melena and may be due to variceal haemorrhage, portal hypertensive gastropathy, gastric vascular ectasia, peptic ulcer, Dieulafoy's lesion, Mallory-Weiss syndrome or portal hypertensive enteropathy. Another possibility can be hemoperitoneum due to spontaneous ruptured intraperitoneal varix or hepatocellular carcinoma; in these cases, diagnostic paracentesis with ascitic fluid cytology confirms the diagnosis.

Gallbladder perforation is a rare complication of acute cholecystitis: Derici and coll. reported a prevalence of 4.8% in a retrospective study including 332 patients. In these cases, gallbladder perforations are attributed to ischemia and necrosis secondary to inflammation and are usually located at the fundus which, as a part of the gallbladder, is most distant from the organ's blood supply. Hemoperitoneum associated with gallbladder perforation is a rare event and has been associated with haemophilia, diabetes, abdominal trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Diagnosis of gallbladder perforation is a difficult challenge in cirrhotic patients due to concomitant edema of gallbladder wall, leukopenia secondary to hypersplenism and ascites. Stones outside the gallbladder documented at the CT scan are considered a direct sign of the perforation. In our patient, gallbladder morphology changed from swelling to scleroatrophic compared to previous CT exams, whereas no thickened walls of gallbladder, signs of interruptions, pericholecystic inflammation or liver abscesses were documented.

For all reviews, only studies in English that examined ≥ 50 patients in single liver disease etiologies and compared noninvasive tests with the gold standard HVPG were included. Exclusions were studies with sample size < 50, mixed etiologies, non-HVPG reference standards, or unreported cutoffs; mixed-etiology studies were included only if data were provided for unique diseases with a sample size ≥ 50. Two independent reviewers screened titles/abstracts and full articles, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Hepatic catheterization and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in portal hypertension… [^c6e95ee3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Portal hypertension and its relation to liver disease, the development of ascites, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage has increasingly engaged the interest of the physician and laboratory worker in recent years. The impetus of this renewed study is due to a great degree to the work of such men as Whipple, 1 and Blakemore and Lord2 on portal shunt for the relief of portal hypertension. Although substantial progress has been made in answering some of the perplexing questions, the understanding of the pathological physiology of these conditions remains to some extent theoretical and confusing at the present time. It is well accepted that portal hypertension may clinically and anatomically be divided into two groups. The first is the extrahepatic group in which the basis for the increased portal pressure arises from obstruction in the extrahepatic portal vein. A number of pathological states may contribute to this, such as post-traumatic thrombosis. Browne DC, Welch GE.

### Endoscopic injection therapy in bleeding Mallory-Weiss syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^22358ccd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic injection is widely used in the therapy of bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers, but its role in the management of bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears has not been properly assessed.

Methods

Sixty-three patients undergoing emergency endoscopy in whom there was a high index of suspicion that a Mallory-Weiss tear was the source of bleeding were randomly assigned to undergo endoscopic injection therapy (epinephrine and polidocanol) or no endoscopic therapy in 2 university-affiliated hospitals. Rates of recurrent bleeding, transfusion requirements, complications, mortality, and length of hospital stay were determined for both groups of patients.

Results

Bleeding recurred in 8 patients in the control group versus only 2 in the endoscopic treatment group (25.8% vs. 6.2%, p < 0.05). Hospital stay was longer for the control group (5.5 ± 0.2, median 6.0, range 2.0–8.0 days vs. 3.4 ± 0.2, median 3.0, range 2.0–6.0 days; p < 0.001). There was a trend toward a higher transfusion requirement after endoscopy in the control group versus the patients treated by injection (0.9 ± 0.2, median 0.0, range 0.0–4.0 units vs. 0.2 ± 0.1, median 0.0, range 0.0–2.0 units; p = 0.09). No complications or adverse events caused by endoscopic injection were noted. Two patients in the control group died of causes unrelated to bleeding.

Conclusions

Endoscopic injection therapy is a useful option in the management of patients with Mallory-Weiss syndrome at high risk for recurrent bleeding.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^70aaee47]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

### Endoscopic gastrointestinal manifestations of liver disease [^5688a9fc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Esophageal and gastric varices are common manifestations of advanced chronic liver disease, but other endoscopic gastrointestinal manifestations of portal hypertension may occur. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, portal hypertensive gastropathy, particularly when severe, and gastric antral vascular ectasias are important alternative causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Portal hypertensive enteropathy is an uncommon source of gastrointestinal bleeding, and its overall clinical significance remains unknown. In the lower gastrointestinal tract, portal hypertension may be associated with hemorrhoids, anorectal varices, and portal hypertensive colopathy, all of which are occasional causes of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^4a28ae53]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of portal hypertension and related complications — mechanisms and sequelae are outlined as follows: Portal hypertension results from maladaptive responses to chronic liver injury and cirrhosis with structural mechanisms (fibrous tissue, regenerative nodules, microthrombi, parenchymal extinction, collapse) increasing intrahepatic vascular resistance; dynamic sinusoidal vasoconstriction contributes to 30% of the total increase in vascular tone. When the portal pressure gradient reaches values of about 10 mm Hg, portal-systemic collaterals form and compensatory splanchnic vasodilation increases portal blood flow and portal pressure. Early consequences include development of portosystemic collaterals in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven angiogenesis plays an important role; gastroesophageal varices are the most clinically relevant collaterals because of increased risk of bleeding. Variceal bleeding is directly dependent on increased wall tension determined by portal pressure, variceal diameter, and thin wall thickness. Systemic vasodilation produces a hyperdynamic circulatory state with decreased effective arterial blood volume leading to activation of neurohumoral and vasoactive systems, sodium and water retention, and increased cardiac output, culminating in ascites and, at late stages, hepatorenal syndrome due to compensatory renal vasoconstriction. Hepatic encephalopathy is multifactorial, resulting from portosystemic shunting, impaired synthetic liver function, increased bacterial translocation, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Pulmonary vascular imbalances yield hepatopulmonary syndrome (increased vasodilation) and portopulmonary hypertension (increased vasoconstriction).

### A practical guide to portal hypertension: the basics of diagnostics and medical management [^824d9706]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension is a hemodynamic consequence of altered mesenteric circulation. The chief drivers of portal hypertension are rising hepatic resistance and venous remodeling. A major challenge in treating patients with portal hypertension is early diagnosis because most patients progress through disease asymptomatically. Noninvasive tests such as serologic markers and elastography are the basis of determining if patients have clinically significant portal hypertension. If identified early, patients placed on carvedilol and who undergo etiologic cure may be able to delay or avert decompensation altogether. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical management of portal hypertension.

AASLD guideline framework — evidence grading and recommendation strength are defined as follows: The guideline uses the GRADE approach, and the quality of evidence for each recommendation is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Strength of recommendations is based on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, burden of testing, and feasibility, and the "strength of recommendation" determination assumed that performing tests with good (> 80%) or excellent (> 90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. Accordingly, recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, with acceptable variation), and because patient representation was not included, patient values and preferences beyond the panel's experience were not specifically addressed; technical remarks and supporting evidence are included to facilitate implementation.

### Vascular pathobiology in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis-current status and future directions [^980b4a1f]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is associated with remarkable alterations in the intra- and extrahepatic vasculature. Because of these changes, the fields of liver vasculature and portal hypertension have recently become closely integrated within the broader vascular biology discipline. As developments in vascular biology have evolved, a deeper understanding of vascular processes has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of the dynamic vascular changes associated with portal hypertension and chronic liver disease. In this context, hepatic vascular cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells and pericyte-like hepatic stellate cells, are closely associated with one another, where they have paracrine and autocrine effects on each other and themselves. These cells play important roles in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Further, a variety of signaling pathways have recently come to light. These include growth factor pathways involving cytokines such as transforming growth factor β, platelet derived growth factor, and others as well as a variety of vasoactive peptides and other molecules. An early and consistent feature of liver injury is the development of an increase in intra-hepatic resistance; this is associated with changes in hepatic vascular cells and their signaling pathway that cause portal hypertension. A critical concept is that this process aggregates signals to the extrahepatic circulation, causing derangement in this system's cells and signaling pathways, which ultimately leads to the collateral vessel formation and arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic and systemic circulation, which by virtue of the hydraulic derivation of Ohm's law (pressure = resistance × flow), worsens portal hypertension. This review provides a detailed review of the current status and future direction of the basic biology of portal hypertension with a focus on the physiology, pathophysiology, and signaling of cells within the liver, as well as those in the mesenteric vascular circulation. Translational implications of recent research and the future directions that it points to are also highlighted.

### Pathogenesis of portal hypertensive gastropathy: translating basic research into clinical practice [^042cb76c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is often seen in patients with portal hypertension, and can lead to transfusion-dependent anemia as well as acute, life-threatening bleeding episodes. This Review focuses on the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of PHG that provide reasonable grounds for the treatment of this condition, and ultimately enable translation of basic research into clinical practice. Increased portal pressure associated with cirrhosis and liver dysfunction is critical for the development of clinically significant PHG, and leads to impaired gastric mucosal defense mechanisms that render the stomach susceptible to mucosal injury. The use of pharmacological agents such as beta-blockers reduces the frequency of bleeding episodes in PHG. As a last resort, surgical decompression of the portal system, transjugular intrahepatic stent placement and liver transplantation can resolve this condition. Elimination of known risk factors for gastric injury such as alcohol, aspirin and traditional NSAIDs is critical. The role of Helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa in PHG is not clear. Careful and critical interpretation of human and experimental data can be helpful to establish a rationale for the medical management of this important condition.

### A prospective, randomized trial of endoscopic band ligation vs. epinephrine injection for actively bleeding Mallory-Weiss syndrome [^a75bd32f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Effective hemostatic treatment is mandatory for patients with actively bleeding Mallory-Weiss syndrome. This study evaluated the respective efficacy and the safety of endoscopic band ligation and endoscopic epinephrine injection in Mallory-Weiss syndrome.

Methods

Thirty-four consecutive patients with actively bleeding Mallory-Weiss syndrome were prospectively enrolled and were randomly assigned to undergo endoscopic band ligation or endoscopic injections of a 1:10,000 solution of epinephrine. Demographic characteristics, endoscopic variables, and outcome parameters, including rates of hemostasis and recurrent bleeding, were analyzed.

Results

The number of elastic bands applied was one or two; the mean volume of epinephrine injected was 18.0 mL: 95% CI[16.8, 19.2]. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to age, gender, alcohol ingestion, presenting symptoms, Hb level, shock, comorbid diseases, coagulopathy, tear location, blood transfusion, or duration of hospitalization. Primary hemostasis was achieved in all 17 patients in the band ligation group and in 16 of 17 patients (94.1%) in the epinephrine injection group. There was no recurrence of bleeding or major complication in either group.

Conclusions

In this small study, no difference was detected in the efficacy or the safety of band ligation vs. epinephrine injection for the treatment of actively bleeding Mallory-Weiss syndrome.

### Noncirrhotic portal hypertension [^0df2f12f]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noncirrhotic portal hypertension represents a heterogeneous group of liver disorders that is characterized by portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis. The purpose of this review is to serve as a guide on how to approach a patient with noncirrhotic portal hypertension with a focus on recent developments.

Recent Findings

Recent studies pertaining to noncirrhotic portal hypertension have investigated aetiological causes, mechanisms of disease, noninvasive diagnostic modalities, clinical characteristics in the paediatric population and novel treatment targets.

Summary

Noncirrhotic portal hypertension is an underappreciated clinical entity that can be difficult to diagnosis without a healthy suspicion. Diagnosis then relies on a comprehensive understanding of the causes and clinical manifestations of this disease, as well as a careful interpretation of the liver biopsy. Noninvasive approaches to diagnosis may play a significant role moving forward in this disease. Treatment in NCPH remains largely targeted at the individual sequalae of portal hypertension.

### Endoscopic management of portal hypertension and varices [^41534d36]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic liver disease as well as various other conditions can change vascular resistance in the portal system thereby leading to portal hypertension. Acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is a dreaded complication of portal hypertension associated with high morbidity and mortality. Historically, endoscopy in the management of portal hypertension was limited to the prevention and treatment of esophageal varices. However, advancements in endoscopic-ultrasound techniques and availability of new devices have opened a new frontier in the management of gastric varices. Additionally, advancements in endoscopic techniques now allow for a more comprehensive diagnostic approach to portal hypertension. In this review, we summarize the role of endoscopy in the management of portal hypertension and varices.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^7a421192]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensated cirrhosis — surveillance endoscopy intervals for no or small varices: Patients with compensated cirrhosis (CC) without varices on screening endoscopy should have endoscopy repeated every 2 years (with ongoing liver injury or associated conditions, such as obesity and alcohol use) or every 3 years (if liver injury is quiescent, e.g., after viral elimination, alcohol abstinence). Patients with CC with small varices on screening endoscopy should have endoscopy repeated every year (with ongoing liver injury) or every 2 years (if liver injury is quiescent, e.g., after viral elimination, alcohol abstinence). Because development of decompensation could indicate worsening of PH and liver dysfunction, patients with no or small varices on screening endoscopy should have a repeat endoscopy performed when and if decompensation develops. Although probably reasonable, there are no data to support discontinuing screening endoscopies if several of them are negative for varices.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^d7992b31]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification in cirrhosis and portal hypertension — Cirrhosis has high mortality, constitutes the fifth-leading cause of adult deaths, and ranks eighth in economic cost among the major illnesses. It is classified into two prognostic stages, compensated and decompensated, based on the presence or absence of clinically evident decompensating events (specifically ascites, VH, and encephalopathy [HE]); median survival in the compensated stage exceeds 12 years, whereas it is only 1.8 years in patients who develop decompensation. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification is often used to stratify disease at a particular time, with CTP-A compensated and CTP-B/C mostly decompensated. Portal hypertension (PH) is the initial and main consequence of cirrhosis, and portal pressure (PP) determined by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is better than liver biopsy for predicting development of complications in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) without cirrhosis on liver biopsy; a new entity denominated advanced chronic liver disease (aACLD) has been proposed, emphasizing that PH may occur.

### Suicide following acute admissions for physical illnesses across england and wales [^1e644d90]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We found evidence of an elevated suicide mortality of four- to eight-fold for several gastrointestinal disorders that are either wholly or partially linked with alcohol misuse or heavy alcohol consumption, particularly among younger people. These disorders were gastritis, alcoholic liver disease, chronic pancreatitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The suicide risk for gastritis in England was increased further (11.7-fold) for cases of alcoholic aetiology. A previous cohort study reported 3.6-fold increased suicide mortality for liver disease overall (Erlangsen et al.), although there have been no previous reports on suicide risks for gastritis, chronic pancreatitis or upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Links between suicide and both alcohol misuse disorder and heavy alcohol consumption are well established (Britton & McPherson; Wilcox et al; Schneider et al.) with a recent meta analysis citing suicide SMRs of 9.8 and 3.5, respectively, for these two disorders (Britton & McPherson). Alcohol consumption or misuse accounts for about 70% of cases of chronic pancreatitis and high minorities of both gastritis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding cases, the latter in particular through bleeds caused by varices, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastritis and oesophageal cancer (Williams et al.). The high SMR for other liver disease may also involve some cases that were alcohol related but not recorded. As well as a strong link between alcohol misuse and suicide, attempted suicides have also been documented occasionally in case reports of gastritis (Wu et al; Descatha et al.), pancreatitis (Hantson & Mahieu,) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (Zhao et al; Altay et al.), disorders that can each arise through complications of medicinal intoxication or poisoning during suicide attempts.

### Hepatic endothelial dysfunction and abnormal angiogenesis: new targets in the treatment of portal hypertension [^6bbf3c27]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension is the main cause of complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Over the past 25 years, progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension was followed by the introduction of an effective pharmacological therapy, consisting mainly of treatments aimed at correcting the increased splanchnic blood flow. It is only recently that this paradigm has been changed. Progress in our knowledge of the mechanisms of increased resistance to portal blood flow, of the formation of portal-systemic collaterals, and of mechanisms other than vasodilatation maintaining the increased splanchnic blood flow have opened entirely new perspectives for developing more effective treatment strategies. This is the aim of the current review, which focuses on: (a) the modulation of hepatic vascular resistance by correcting the increased hepatic vascular tone due to hepatic endothelial dysfunction, and (b) correcting the abnormal angiogenesis associated with portal hypertension, which contributes to liver inflammation and fibrogenesis, to the hyperkinetic splanchnic circulation, and to the formation of portal-systemic collaterals and varices.
