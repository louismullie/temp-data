## Question

is staph lugdunensis usually a contaminant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Staphylococcus lugdunensis is usually a contaminant in clinical cultures and how to interpret its isolation across specimen types. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's baseline ecology and colonization patterns. Then, I should verify its intrinsic virulence and clinical behavior compared with other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Next, I will examine the clinical significance of isolates by specimen source, especially blood, sterile sites, and skin and soft tissue infections. After that, I need to check guideline positions and diagnostic frameworks that treat S. lugdunensis differently from other CoNS. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a clear conclusion with caveats for special contexts like urine or pediatric settings.

> Let me first confirm the ecological context. S. lugdunensis is a recognized human skin and mucosal commensal with a predilection for the inguinal, perineal, axillary, and lower extremity sites, and it is notably less common in the anterior nares than S. aureus, which helps explain why it is less frequently isolated as a blood culture contaminant compared with other CoNS such as S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus [^111CaYwR] [^114fN9E6] [^117KVt8K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — being a commensal does not automatically equal contamination. I need to check the organism's pathogenic potential. Multiple reviews and studies describe S. lugdunensis as unusually virulent for a CoNS, with a clinical spectrum and severity closer to S. aureus than to typical CoNS, including aggressive native-valve endocarditis, prosthetic joint infections, osteomyelitis, and device-related infections, often with complications such as perivalvular abscess and embolic events [^113VmSBg] [^111K93Ps] [^111MkGgE] [^114FGNkp].

> Next, I should review how often S. lugdunensis isolates are clinically significant when recovered. In a prospective series of 42 isolates, 86% were judged clinically significant, with 44% in pure culture and 83% from skin and soft tissue infections, indicating that most recoveries reflect true infection rather than contamination when the clinical context fits [^111pV7D3]. Similarly, unbiased speciation with MALDI-TOF has increased detection and revealed that a substantial proportion of S. lugdunensis isolates are associated with infection risk, reinforcing that this species is not "usually a contaminant" in routine practice [^114PHmN7] [^117MQaYC].

> I will now examine blood culture data specifically. Wait, let me verify the endocarditis risk signal. Retrospective cohorts and systematic reviews show that approximately 13–15% of patients with S. lugdunensis bacteremia have definite or possible infective endocarditis, and the proportion rises to about 25% when two or more blood culture sets are positive, which is comparable to S. aureus and far above what one would expect for a mere contaminant [^112ULuyj]. But wait, what if only one set is positive? Even then, guidelines and decision support tools advise caution and often recommend additional sets or targeted evaluation rather than dismissing the isolate as contamination, especially when clinical suspicion exists [^1147Ckya].

> Let me consider sterile-site isolates next. I should confirm guideline positions for native vertebral osteomyelitis and related syndromes. IDSA guidance explicitly treats S. lugdunensis differently from other CoNS: if S. lugdunensis is isolated from blood, further image-guided biopsy is not required to establish microbiologic diagnosis, whereas other CoNS recovered from nonsterile-site aspirates are considered likely contaminants and prompt repeat sampling is advised, underscoring the higher pretest probability of true infection with S. lugdunensis [^114kbsA8] [^111PQ9bH] [^116iZFF9]. Case series also document clinically significant S. lugdunensis osteoarticular infections, including vertebral osteomyelitis and device-associated infections, where the organism should not be dismissed as contamination without careful evaluation [^116ehd7K] [^116nGJwQ] [^112fYu1v].

> Now, I should review skin and soft tissue infections. Population-based and clinical series consistently show S. lugdunensis as a common cause of community-acquired abscesses, wound infections, and paronychia, with a high proportion of isolates judged clinically significant, and a predilection for lower extremity and pelvic girdle sites that aligns with its colonization niches, again arguing against a default assumption of contamination when recovered from purulent lesions [^111Qfjet] [^114DaeuJ] [^111pV7D3]. Hmm, wait a minute — could some of these be mixed flora or colonization at the time of sampling? Even in polymicrobial settings, careful clinical-microbiologic correlation and, when available, repeat sampling or source control often clarify significance, and multiple series still find S. lugdunensis to be a true pathogen in a substantial fraction of cases [^111pV7D3] [^1151nJzz].

> But wait, what if the isolate comes from a typically nonsterile site like urine or a superficial swab? I should double-check those contexts. In urine, S. lugdunensis is infrequently isolated and is often part of mixed flora; however, rare cases of true UTI have been described, so I should avoid reflexively labeling it a contaminant if there are urinary symptoms, pyuria, or repeated isolation, especially in patients with risk factors or procedural histories [^1145WABd]. In pediatrics, S. lugdunensis appears uncommon, and many isolates may be contaminants, yet case reports document significant infections including abscesses and endocarditis, so age alone should not lead to dismissal without clinical correlation [^11394nNu] [^114RTSP7] [^115qynY3].

> Next, I should review how guidelines and diagnostic frameworks operationalize this. The IDSA guidance for native vertebral osteomyelitis explicitly carves out S. lugdunensis from the "likely contaminant" CoNS category, and contemporary microbiology utilization guidance continues to emphasize species-level identification and targeted management for S. lugdunensis when recovered from sterile or high-consequence sites [^114kbsA8] [^1164MRbN]. Decision support algorithms for staphylococcal bacteremia similarly treat S. lugdunensis more like S. aureus than like other CoNS, prompting repeat cultures, source evaluation, and consideration of endocarditis workup when multiple sets are positive or clinical suspicion is high [^1147Ckya].

> I need to ensure I account for laboratory detection issues. Historically, S. lugdunensis was underrecognized due to reliance on limited phenotypic panels. Implementation of MALDI-TOF has increased accurate speciation and revealed a higher burden of clinically relevant S. lugdunensis infections than previously appreciated, which in turn reduces misclassification as "contamination" or generic CoNS [^114PHmN7] [^117MQaYC]. Hold on, I should verify resistance considerations too — most isolates remain susceptible to beta-lactams, but emerging mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance has been reported, so susceptibility testing should be performed and interpreted carefully to guide therapy rather than assuming resistance patterns of other CoNS [^113VmSBg] [^114LwEWD].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. S. lugdunensis is not usually a contaminant; rather, it is a pathogenic CoNS with a virulence profile closer to S. aureus, and its isolation — particularly from sterile sites, in multiple blood culture sets, or from clinically compatible skin and soft tissue infections — should prompt serious consideration of true infection and appropriate evaluation and treatment rather than dismissal as contamination [^113VmSBg] [^111K93Ps] [^111pV7D3] [^112ULuyj]. I should double-check that I am not overstating this; yes, rare single-set isolates from nonsterile sites may still represent contamination, but the pretest probability of significance is high enough that clinical correlation and, when indicated, additional cultures or source workup are warranted before concluding contamination [^1151nJzz] [^1147Ckya].

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is **not usually a contaminant**; it is a **clinically significant pathogen** that can cause severe infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and prosthetic joint infections [^111K93Ps] [^115oTLQy]. Unlike other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. lugdunensis is **more virulent and often behaves like Staphylococcus aureus** [^113VmSBg], so any isolation from sterile sites — especially blood, deep tissue, or prosthetic material — should be taken seriously and not dismissed as contamination [^1164MRbN]. Misidentification is common; use of MALDI-TOF MS improves accuracy and recognition of its clinical importance [^114PHmN7] [^117MQaYC].

---

## Clinical significance and virulence

- **Virulence**: S. lugdunensis is more virulent than other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), with clinical behavior resembling S. aureus [^113VmSBg] [^114FGNkp].

- **Infections**: It causes severe infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, and skin and soft tissue infections [^111Qfjet] [^111upebM].

- **Endocarditis**: S. lugdunensis endocarditis is aggressive, often requiring surgical intervention and associated with high mortality [^115oTLQy] [^1175aqB8].

---

## Contamination versus true infection

- **Contamination**: S. lugdunensis is rarely a contaminant compared to other CoNS, and its isolation from sterile sites should be considered clinically significant [^1151nJzz] [^1164MRbN].

- **Clinical correlation**: The clinical context, number of positive cultures, and presence of clinical symptoms are essential to differentiate contamination from true infection [^1147Ckya].

- **Multiple cultures**: Repeated isolation of S. lugdunensis from sterile sites strongly suggests true infection rather than contamination [^112ULuyj].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and misidentification

Misidentification is common because traditional phenotypic methods can confuse S. lugdunensis with other CoNS or even S. aureus [^111MkGgE] [^117GpKpZ]. MALDI-TOF MS provides **accurate identification** of S. lugdunensis, reducing misidentification and improving recognition of its clinical significance [^114PHmN7] [^117MQaYC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

IDSA guidelines emphasize the **clinical significance** of S. lugdunensis, particularly in endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections, and recommend treating it as a true pathogen rather than a contaminant [^114kbsA8] [^1164MRbN]. ESC guidelines similarly recognize S. lugdunensis as a **significant pathogen** in infective endocarditis, underscoring the need for aggressive management [^115NhkzD].

---

## Clinical outcomes and treatment

Outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate antibiotic therapy, but **severe infections may require surgical intervention**, particularly in endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections [^111Dr4MH] [^1175aqB8] [^116XP4Y7]. Antibiotic susceptibility is typically favorable, with most isolates susceptible to beta-lactams; however, **resistance can occur**, necessitating susceptibility testing [^114LwEWD] [^113VmSBg].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical context** | **Likelihood of contamination** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Blood cultures | Low | - Treat as true infection <br/> - Evaluate for endocarditis [^111K93Ps] [^112ULuyj] |
| Prosthetic joint infections | Low | - Treat as true infection <br/> - Consider surgical intervention [^116nGJwQ] |
| Skin and soft tissue infections | Moderate | - Clinical correlation required <br/> - Treat if clinically indicated [^111Qfjet] [^1151nJzz] |
| Urine cultures | High | - Often contamination <br/> - Clinical correlation required [^1145WABd] |

---

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is **not usually a contaminant** and should be considered clinically significant, particularly when isolated from sterile sites or in the context of compatible clinical symptoms. Accurate identification and clinical correlation are essential to ensure appropriate management and avoid underestimating its pathogenic potential [^114kbsA8].

### Lugdunin amplifies innate immune responses in the skin in synergy with host-and microbiota-derived factors [^115jYA68]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Skin is a challenging habitat for bacteria with conditions, including dryness, low nutrient availability, high salt concentrations, and low pH, as well as the presence of host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lipids. Nevertheless, human skin is populated by a complex microbiota whose composition is mainly determined by the ecologic feature of the body site, but is also largely influenced by host- and bacteria-derived factors. During steady state, a constant interplay among them allows for colonization with commensal microorganisms, while at the same time pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can be efficiently prevented from persisting.

Characteristic changes in the composition of skin microbial consortia have been associated with chronic skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Usually, S. aureus can hardly be found on healthy skin and only in 30% of the human population in the anterior nares, but it is abundant on inflamed and non-inflamed skin of AD patients. Interestingly, overabundance of cutaneous S. aureus, especially during AD flares, is associated with loss of microbiome diversity, indicating that the skin microbiome shapes S. aureus skin colonization. However, the mechanisms that are used by the skin microbiota during steady state to prevent colonization by S. aureus still remain elusive. Only recently we showed that the skin commensal S. epidermidis is able to amplify the innate immune response of the skin against pathogens by creating a protective environment, which ultimately leads to reduction of S. aureus colonization.

Apart from occupying space and triggering innate immune responses, the microbiota shields our skin from pathogen colonization by the release of specific AMPs called bacteriocins that can directly act on competing bacteria. Commensal-produced factors were shown to directly inhibit S. aureus growth. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are frequent producers of post-translationally modified lanthionine-containing bacteriocins (lantibiotics). Recently, we discovered a novel peptide antibiotic produced by the nasal and skin commensal Staphylococcus lugdunensis, named lugdunin. This newly discovered compound is a thiazolidine-containing cyclic peptide antibiotic, which is non-ribosomally synthesized and belongs to a new class of antibacterials. Lugdunin displays potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus. Importantly, humans who carry S. lugdunensis have a 6-fold lower risk of S. aureus nasal carriage.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — next steps after nondiagnostic image-guided aspiration biopsy — includes that in the absence of concomitant bloodstream infection, we recommend obtaining a second aspiration biopsy when the original specimen grew a skin contaminant (coagulase-negative staphylococci [except S. lugdunensis], Propionibacterium species, or diphtheroids) (strong, low); in patients with a nondiagnostic first biopsy and suspected NVO, further testing should be done to exclude difficult-to-grow organisms (eg, anaerobes, fungi, Brucella species, or mycobacteria) (strong, low); and when biopsy and laboratory workup are nondiagnostic, we suggest either repeating a second image-guided aspiration biopsy, performing percutaneous endoscopic discectomy and drainage (PEDD), or proceeding with an open excisional biopsy (weak, low).

Suture and fixation material

Suture and fixation material of 102 patients (58 male, 44 female) was examined, which showed a contamination rate of 28.4% (29 cases) (Fig. 2). The detected bacteria on suture and fixation material vary in the different types of surgery (Table 2).

Table 2
Microbial identification on suture material for each group

Fig. 2
Graph showing positive bacterial cultures. For isolated ACL reconstruction, positive microbiological cultures occurred in 17.4% (n = 8/46 cases) of suture and fixation material. Patients undergoing meniscus repair showed the contamination rates of 48.0% (n = 12/25 cases) of suture and fixation material. For ACL reconstruction combined with meniscal repair, the contamination rate was 29.0% (n = 9/31 cases) of suture and fixation material

Within the 29 cases with culture-positive findings of the total cohort (n = 155), bacterial contamination was found in both, irrigation fluid and suture material, in 8 cases (27.6%).

Overall, the most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the second most frequent was Cutibacterium acnes (Fig. 3).

Over the follow-up period of 12 months, intra-articular hematoma developed in two patients, which did not require surgical intervention within the follow-up period. Only one clinically and laboratory proven postoperative joint infection was detected in the total patient cohort. This patient received an isolated ACL reconstruction and presented in our emergency department with pain, joint redness and fever 6 days after surgery. In the revision surgery (arthroscopic synovectomy, irrigation and debridement), Staphylococcus lugdunensis was identified, which was also isolated previously from both irrigation fluid and suture samples of the initial ACL reconstruction surgery.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococci release a purine analog that inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence [^113MrfrQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to severe life-threatening diseases such as endocarditis and pneumonia. The enormous health burden caused by S. aureus is, in part, attributed to its ability to acquire resistance against several classes of antibiotics, making it refractory to many treatment options. Moreover, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) can infect both healthy and immunocompromised populations in the community and hospital setting –. Due to the emergence of MRSA, drug discovery is critically important for combating S. aureus infections.

To identify compounds that antagonize S. aureus, several groups have focused on coagulase-negative staphylococcal species (CoNS) as many of these species often colonize the same niches as S. aureus and likely compete for space and nutrients –. To successfully compete with S. aureus, CoNS have been shown to secrete antimicrobials that directly kill S. aureus. Indeed, strains of S. epidermidis and S. hominis species, among others, have been reported to secrete posttranslationally modified peptides termed bacteriocins that inhibit S. aureus colonization on human skin. In addition, S. lugdunensis has recently been shown to produce the non-ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide antibiotic termed lugdunin that directly kills S. aureus. Moreover, lugdunin can stimulate host production of antimicrobial peptides and recruit immune cells to clear S. aureus infections. Another strategy used by some CoNS including S. schleiferi and S. caprae is the secretion of autoinducing peptides that specifically block the activation of the agr quorum sensing system in S. aureus. By doing so, these CoNS reduce S. aureus virulence and interfere with colonization of the host. Clearly, CoNS have evolved mechanisms to antagonize S. aureus growth and virulence to gain a competitive advantage.

### Incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacteremia [^113q2TJf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Of 63 patients with Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacteremia, 15 (23.8%) had clinically significant bacteremia, with an incidence of 1.3 cases per 100,000 admissions. Of the five patients with community-acquired S. lugdunensis bacteremia, three had endocarditis. Catheters were the most common portal of entry for health-care-associated or hospital-acquired bacteremia. Only one patient died of bacteremia-related causes.

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^113VmSBg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an update on recent findings about the clinical and microbiological characteristics of Staphylococcus lugdunensis.

Recent Findings

European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) differ in their methodology and breakpoints for the detection of penicillin and oxacillin resistance in S. lugdunensis. The EUCAST method for beta-lactamase detection recommends a 1-unit penicillin disk and has demonstrated superior performance compared to the 10-unit penicillin disk recommended by CLSI. A similar outcome has been previously reported in Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, there is emerging oxacillin resistance in some geographical areas. Of particular concern is that oxacillin resistance in mecA positive isolates may not be reliably detected by current cefoxitin breakpoints.

Summary

Coagulase negative staphylococci are now recognised as a heterogenous group of organisms that do not microbiologically or clinically behave the same way. The spectrum of clinical disease is species dependent and is particularly true for S. lugdunensis, which causes an array of clinical infections like that of S. aureus. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of phenotypic tests to detect resistance, to ensure that appropriate antimicrobial therapy is delivered to patients.

At nonscheduled revision [n = 10 (14.92%)], seven implants (10.4%) were contaminated with bacteria. Two (28.57%; 2.99% overall) were ruptured, two (28.57%; 2.99% overall) were exposed, two (28.57%; 2.99% overall) were dislocated, and one (14.29%; 1.49% overall) showed capsular contraction (Table 4). The remaining three implants were revised because of dislocation (and associated discomfort) without contamination. Moreover, three implants were contaminated but displayed no complications. Bacterial contamination was found incidentally.

S. epidermidis was isolated most frequently (50%) in this group. Furthermore, S. lugdunensis (16.66%), S. capitis (11.11%), and F. magna (11.11%) were detected. S. caprae and C. acnes (5.56% each) were found (Table 3).

### Septic arthritis with Staphylococcus lugdunensis following arthroscopic ACL revision with BPTB allograft [^11439KLq]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is an uncommon but a serious complication resulting in six times greater hospital costs than that of uncomplicated ACL surgery and an inferior postoperative activity level. Promptly initiating a specific antibiotic therapy is the most critical treatment, followed by open or arthroscopic joint decompression, debridement and lavage. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus predominantly infecting the skin and soft tissue. The few reported cases of bone and joint infections by S. lugdunensis indicate that the clinical manifestations were severe, the diagnosis elusive, and the treatment difficult. If the microbiology laboratory does not use the tube coagulase (long) test to confirm the slide coagulase test result, the organism might be misidentified as Staphylococcus aureus. S. lugdunensis is more virulent than other coagulase-negative staphylococcus; in many clinical situations it behaves like S. aureus, further increasing the confusion and worsening the expected outcome. S. lugdunensis is known to cause infective endocarditis with a worse outcome, septicemia, deep tissue infection, vascular and joint prosthesis infection, osteomyelitis, discitis, breast abscess, urine tract infections, toxic shock and osteitis pubis. We present the first case report in the literature of septic arthritis with S. lugdunensis following arthroscopic ACL revision with bone-patellar-tendon-bone allograft.

### Working formulation for the standardization of definitions of infections in patients using ventricular assist devices [^1177ausv]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Medium credibility.

Ventricular assist device (VAD) infection definitions — scope and classification include hardware (pump/cannula), pocket, and percutaneous driveline infections with specified criteria and taxonomy. The first group of VAD-specific infections are hardware-related (e.g., pump and/or cannula), and the definition of pump and/or cannula infections have been partly based on the modified Duke's criteria, which have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE); a patient must have at least one of the microbiologic, histopathologic, radiologic, or clinical criteria to achieve a firm diagnosis. The pump or VAD refers to the blood-propulsion device, including continuous-flow and/or pulsatile-flow (intracorporeal and paracorporeal) devices; "inflow cannula", "outflow cannula", and "suture lines" are defined by their anatomic connections. The term "pocket" describes the body space that holds the pump, and pocket infections in devices that still require a surgical pocket may be diagnosed without removing the VAD at the time of surgery if samples from the inner surface of the pocket and the exterior surface of the VAD are taken. Percutaneous driveline infection definitions have been adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance definitions and are classified as superficial or deep according to the depth, with this report sub-classifying definitions into proven, probable, and possible superficial and deep infections and describing categories for each as surgical and histology, microbiology, clinical, or general appearance. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is included along with S aureus in the definitions rather than with coagulase-negative staphylococci.

### Unbiased species-level identification of clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci: does it change the perspective on Staphylococcus lugdunensis? [^117MQaYC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Unbiased species-level identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identified Staphylococcus lugdunensis to be a more commonly isolated CoNS in our laboratory than previously observed. It has also highlighted the possibility of vertical transmission.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^111K93Ps]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci and species distribution in endocarditis: In a multicenter, prospective, observational investigation involving > 1000 consecutive patients with definite IE from > 20 countries, S aureus was the most common cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (25.8% of 214 cases), whereas 64 cases of native valve endocarditis (8%) resulted from CoNS; an important subset of CoNS IE is due to S lugdunensis, and this species tends to cause a substantially more virulent form of IE, with a high rate of perivalvular extension of infection and metastatic infection, and is uniformly susceptible in vitro to most antibiotics.

### Validation of the proposed definition for complicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia [^117XVY6j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the presence of implanted devices in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of infection should not automatically be considered a criterion for complicated disease. In our cohort, for patients where device infection was excluded and treated with a short course of antimicrobial therapy (< 14 days), none experienced device-related infections within the 120 days.

S. epidermidis was the predominant species, limiting the ability to fully assess the impact on mortality of other species, including S. lugdunensis. As expected, S. lugdunensis was more prevalent among episodes with complicated diseases and showed a higher 30-day mortality compared to other species but this difference was not statistically significant. This finding is consistent with the study by Yukawa et al, which also reported a numerically higher 30-day mortality for S. lugdunensis bacteremia (15%) compared to S. epidermidis (8%), though the difference was not statistically significant because of the small sample size. The increased rates of complicated disease and mortality observed with S. lugdunensis may be due to its greater number of virulence factors that enhance its pathogenicity compared to other CoNS species. However, S. lugdunensis lacks key virulence factors characteristic of S. aureus, such as coagulase.

This study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective, single-center study conducted at a tertiary hospital, which tends to manage more complex cases; furthermore, we used patients from the cohort of suspected IE, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of cases at high risk for IE. Consequently, our findings may not fully represent the epidemiology of CoNS bacteremia in nontertiary care settings. Second, numerous confounding factors can influence decisions regarding early source control interventions, including care-limiting decisions or withdrawal of care, potentially introducing survivorship bias. However, no patient died within 48 hours from bacteremia onset, and only 2 were considered for withdrawal of care within the same timeframe.

Our study highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing CoNS bacteremia, which includes early interventions such as ID consultation, tailored antimicrobial therapy, and timely source control measures when indicated. The proposed definition for complicated CoNS bacteremia failed to identify patients at higher risk for mortality in our cohort. Further studies are needed to refine the definition and improve its ability to identify patients with an elevated risk of poor outcomes.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^1132MC3t]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Five samples from lesions did not correspond to the 2 identified microbiological profiles (Technical Appendix Figure 5). These samples were 2 Hurley stage 1 samples yielding pure culture of Propionibacterium acnes and 2 samples yielding corynebacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and coagulase negative staphylococci. A pure culture of Streptococcus pyogenes was recovered from the fifth sample. A review of the medical file of the patient revealed that he was admitted for an acute infectious syndrome that is unusual in HS patients and probably corresponded to an acute superinfection.

Considering the polymicrobial nature of profile B, including bacterial species known to be nonpathogenic skin commensals, we aimed at determining the relevance of these bacteria in the pathogenic process. To achieve this goal, we first analyzed the culture results of 45 purulent drainage on swabs for which a perilesional control sample was obtained (Technical Appendix Figure 6). S. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, micrococcaceae, corynebacteria, Propionibacterium spp. Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterococcus spp. were isolated from both purulent drainage and perilesional controls. However, these organisms were isolated less frequently and in lower quantity from purulent drainage than from controls. Conversely, strict anaerobes, actinomycetes, and streptococci of the milleri group were recovered from almost all purulent drainage samples (42/45) and rarely from controls (6/45).

We next compared the culture results of 23 open suppurating lesions that were sampled by biopsy, needle aspiration under strict asepsis, or swabbing, for each of which a control perilesional swab was obtained (Technical Appendix Figure 7). Anaerobes, actinomycetes, and streptococci of the milleri group were isolated from purulent drainage, biopsies, and aspirations, but not from perilesional swabs. By contrast, S. aureus, non- lugdunensis coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and Propionibacterium spp. were commonly isolated from purulent drainage and swabs but very rarely from biopsies.

These data demonstrate that anaerobes, actinomycetes, and streptococci of the milleri group are specifically associated with HS lesions. Other species isolated from purulent drainage samples were part of the normal skin flora and were likely to be present as contaminants.

### Metalware-associated orthopaedic infections caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis: an emerging pathogen [^116nGJwQ]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this small series confirms a niche for S. lugdunensis as a cause of orthopaedic infections involving prosthetic material. In knee and hip PJI in our centre, it accounts for cases at a ratio of 1:8 compared with S. aureus. Ascertainment of cases is likely to continue while molecular approaches to diagnostics become more widely adopted.

Optimum therapy has not been clearly defined, and we have demonstrated variation in antimicrobial prescribing practice. Given the small numbers of patients, it is not currently possible to advocate any particular management approach to S. lugdunensis prosthesis infections. However, in vitro data confirm an organism that is susceptible to conventional therapy for S. aureus, and outcomes appear to be good when patients are treated using surgical and medical management protocols equivalent to those employed for S. aureus. Further work is needed to establish with more confidence the optimum route, choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy in order to unify a treatment approach.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for vertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to biopsy and culture, IDSA 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain a second aspiration biopsy in patients with suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis, in the absence of concomitant bloodstream infection, if the original image-guided aspiration biopsy specimen grew a skin contaminant (coagulase-negative staphylococci, except S. lugdunensis), Propionibacterium species, or diphtheroids).

### Clinical features, outcomes, and molecular characteristics of community-and health care-associated Staphylococcus lugdunensis infections [^1158pb9b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a major cause of aggressive endocarditis, but it is also responsible for a broad spectrum of infections. The differences in clinical and molecular characteristics between community-associated (CA) and health care-associated (HA) S. lugdunensis infections have remained unclear. We performed a retrospective study of S. lugdunensis infections between 2003 and 2014 to compare the clinical and molecular characteristics of CA and HA isolates. We collected 129 S. lugdunensis isolates in total: 81 (62.8%) HA isolates and 48 (37.2%) CA isolates. HA infections were more frequent than CA infections in children (16.0% versus 4.2%, respectively; P = 0.041) and the elderly (38.3% versus 14.6%, respectively; P = 0.004). The CA isolates were more likely to cause skin and soft tissue infections (85.4% versus 19.8%, respectively; P < 0.001). HA isolates were more frequently responsible for bacteremia of unknown origin (34.6% versus 4.2%, respectively; P < 0.001) and for catheter-related bacteremia (12.3% versus 0%, respectively; P = 0.011) than CA isolates. Fourteen-day mortality was higher for HA infections than for CA infections (11.1% versus 0%, respectively). A higher proportion of the HA isolates than of the CA isolates were resistant to penicillin (76.5% versus 52.1%, respectively; P = 0.004) and oxacillin (32.1% versus 2.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). Two major clonal complexes (CC1 and CC3) were identified. Sequence type 41 (ST41) was the most common sequence type identified (29.5%). The proportion of ST38 isolates was higher for HA than for CA infections (33.3% versus 12.5%, respectively; P = 0.009). These isolates were of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec)type IV, V, or Vt. HA and CA S. lugdunensis infections differ in terms of their clinical features, outcome, antibiotic susceptibilities, and molecular characteristics.

### Multi-virulence-locus sequence typing of Staphylococcus lugdunensis generates results consistent with a clonal population structure and is reliable for epidemiological typing [^114mMLWM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an emergent virulent coagulase-negative staphylococcus responsible for severe infections similar to those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. To understand its potentially pathogenic capacity and have further detailed knowledge of the molecular traits of this organism, 93 isolates from various geographic origins were analyzed by multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST), targeting seven known or putative virulence-associated loci (atlLR2, atlLR3, hlb, isdJ, SLUG_09050, SLUG_16930, and vwbl). The polymorphisms of the putative virulence-associated loci were moderate and comparable to those of the housekeeping genes analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). However, the MVLST scheme generated 43 virulence types (VTs) compared to 20 sequence types (STs) based on MLST, indicating that MVLST was significantly more discriminating (Simpson's index [D], 0.943). No hypervirulent lineage or cluster specific to carriage strains was defined. The results of multilocus sequence analysis of known and putative virulence-associated loci are consistent with a clonal population structure for S. lugdunensis, suggesting a coevolution of these genes with housekeeping genes. Indeed, the nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary substitutions (dN/dS) ratio, the Tajima's D test, and Single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) analysis suggest that all virulence-associated loci were under negative selection, even atlLR2 (AtlL protein) and SLUG_16930 (FbpA homologue), for which the dN/dS ratios were higher. In addition, this analysis of virulence-associated loci allowed us to propose a trilocus sequence typing scheme based on the intragenic regions of atlLR3, isdJ, and SLUG_16930, which is more discriminant than MLST for studying short-term epidemiology and further characterizing the lineages of the rare but highly pathogenic S. lugdunensis.

### Leveraging electronic medical records to evaluate a computerized decision support system for Staphylococcus bacteremia [^1147Ckya]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

HELP computerized computerized decision support system

The HELP CDSS assigns patients to one of two arms: one for CoNS bacteremia (including Staphylococcus intermedius) or one for S. aureus bacteremia (including Staphylococcus lugdunensis). In the CoNS arm, the CDSS checks the number of independent blood cultures. If only one positive blood culture is available without evidence of catheter infection by the same pathogen (clinical judgment by the physician in charge), the CDSS recommends a follow-up blood culture to rule out contamination before starting antibiotics. If two separate blood cultures yield positive results for the same CoNS species with matching antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the CDSS suggests investigating a possible source of infection and considering antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures were considered separate if they were collected from different sites and at different times (2 h to 5 days). A negative follow-up blood culture suggested contamination, prompting a reevaluation of antibiotic therapy if it was already initiated.

The HELP CDSS for S. aureus bacteremia is based on treatment recommendations published by Hagel et al. It was developed by a panel of IDS and medical microbiologists in collaboration with medical informaticians from all study sites. A simplified schematic representation is shown in Fig. 5.

Schematic representation of the HELP CDSS.

Rough overview of the decision algorithm that was the basis for the HELP CDSS.

For SAB, the CDSS distinguishes between uncomplicated and complicated cases based on criteria such as positive follow-up blood cultures, permanent foreign bodies, prolonged fever, or vasopressor use. Treatment of complex SAB exceeds the capabilities of the CDSS, so immediate IDS consultation is advised. This also applies to polymicrobial bacteremia when more than one pathogen is detected in addition to staphylococci. For uncomplicated SAB treatment, guidance is offered, including source control, diagnostic imaging, and appropriate antibiotics.

### Clinical performance of the novel genMark Dx ePlex blood culture ID Gram-Positive panel [^112Xo5Dm]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clostridium species were among the most commonly missed Gram-positive organisms not targeted by this panel and are typically the second most common anaerobes isolated from blood cultures, behind thegroup. Isolation of Clostridium species from blood cultures may represent contamination or transient or clinically insignificant bacteremia; however, it can also be an indicator of severe life-threatening infections requiring prompt identification and treatment. For these reasons, consideration should be given to including a Clostridium target in future iterations of BCID panels.

Resistance gene detection and/or rapid phenotypic testing is important for early optimization of treatment. Several studies have demonstrated that when either of these is combined with stewardship interventions, the median time to optimal therapy, especially for methicillin-susceptible(MSSA) and Enterococcus species, can be shortened by 14 h to more than 24 h. In this study, vanA prevalence was low (n = 8 vanA enterococci) among the prospective samples, and no vanB -containing enterococci were detected. Distinguishing vanA from vanB is important in predicting susceptibility to glycopeptides. vanA -containing enterococci are resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, whereas vanB -containing enterococci remain susceptible to teicoplanin. Performance among all samples, both clinical and contrived, revealed PPA and NPA for vanA of 96.8% and 99.0%, respectively, and 100% PPA and NPA for vanB detection, similar to the performance reported for other rapid blood culture panels and the only other publication on the ePlex BCID Panels. Likewise, the overall PPA and NPA for mecA detection of 97.1% and 95.3%, respectively, in the clinical samples among staphylococci are similar to those reported for other nucleic acid-based rapid methods. This is the first commercially available rapid multiplex PCR panel able to identify S. lugdunensis along with the presence of a mecA gene. S. lugdunensis is an important species of staphylococci to identify due to its more aggressive nature than those of other coagulase-negative staphylococci. In addition, accurate identification is needed because the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for this organism follow the guidelines for. Knowing whether mecA is present helps ensure earlier targeted therapy and hopefully a successful clinical outcome. The frequency of mecA is still very low in this species compared to those in other CoNS, but recently, two clones of mecA -positive S. lugdunensis (sequence type 38 [ST38] and ST44) were described that tested susceptible to cefoxitin and were shown by whole-genome sequencing to possess SCC mec type IVa(2b) with variations on the J3 region.

### Working formulation for the standardization of definitions of infections in patients using ventricular assist devices [^113rEY1D]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Medium credibility.

Ventricular assist device (VAD) pump/cannula infection — major and minor clinical criteria define diagnostic elements as follows: Major clinical criteria include recovery of an indistinguishable organism from 2 or more peripheral blood cultures taken > 12 hours apart with no other focus of infection; all of 3 or a majority of ≥ 4 separate positive blood cultures with the first and last sample drawn at least 1 hour apart; 2 or more positive blood cultures taken from the central venous cannula (CVC) and peripherally at the same time classified as either BSI-VAD-related or presumed VAD-related; and echocardiogram positive for VAD-related infective endocarditis (TEE recommended for patients with prosthetic valves, rated at least "possible IE" by clinical criteria, or complicated IE [paravalvular abscess], and in any patient in whom VAD-related infection is suspected and TTE is non-diagnostic; TTE as first test in other patients) defined by intracardiac mass suspected to be vegetation adjacent to or in the outflow cannula, an area of turbulent flow such as regurgitant jets, vegetation on implanted material, abscess, or new partial dehiscence of outflow cannula. Minor clinical criteria include Fever ≥ 38°C with vascular phenomena (major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracerebral or visceral, conjunctival hemorrhage, Janeway's lesions), immunologic phenomena (glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth spot), and microbiologic evidence via positive blood culture that does not meet major criteria, excluding single positive coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus lugdunensis.

A child with congenital heart disease developed infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Despite an apparent excellent response to initial antibiotic treatment in clinical, inflammatory and echocardiographic indices, the patient's valve damage progressed silently and surgical intervention was required. This case highlights the potential for misidentification of S. lugdunensis, its usual susceptibility to penicillin and in particular the aggressive nature of endocarditis caused by this coagulase-negative staphylococcus. The epidemiology and treatment of endocarditis caused by this organism are reviewed.

Table 3
Suggested duration of therapy by site of infection

UTI, urinary tract infection.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### Treatment of acervical epidural abscess [^116ADuRY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

First reported in 1988, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a virulent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species often associated with endocarditis. This is the first case report describing this infection in the cervical spine. A 58-year-old, left-handed Caucasian woman with no significant medical history presented with neck and left arm pain. Neurological examination revealed mild left deltoid 4/5 weakness and myelopathy. She was found to have an epidural cervical spinal cord mass that was causing severe cord compression and underwent partial anterior cervical decompression of the mass. On entering what was believed to be the mass, yellow-tinged fluid was encountered. An abscess was immediately suspected, so the dura was not entered. The specimen sent for culture was identified a day later as S. lugdunensis A two-dimensional echocardiogram was negative for vegetations. A peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed and the patient discharged on 6 weeks of physical therapy and 6–8 weeks of intravenous cefazolin.

### Working formulation for the standardization of definitions of infections in patients using ventricular assist devices [^117B1mXn]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Medium credibility.

Ventricular assist device (VAD)-specific pocket infection — case definitions specify proven, probable, possible, and rejected categories. Proven pathologic/microbiologic criteria include organisms cultured from the pocket space obtained during a surgical operation or needle sampling, taken intra-operatively or with radiologic guidance; isolation of indistinguishable organism (genus, species, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern) from aspirate taken intra-operatively with either 2 exterior aspect culture positive samples from VAD or 1 exterior aspect culture positive sample from the VAD and 1 culture from pocket space surrounding VAD obtained intra-operatively; and abscess or other evidence of infection in the pocket area during surgery/imaging or histopathology examination. Proven clinical criteria are 2 major criteria. Probable requires 1 major criteria and 3 minor criteria or 4 minor criteria. Possible requires 1 major and 1 minor or 3 minor. Rejected includes firm alternative diagnoses, resolution of evidence of VAD pocket infection with antibiotic therapy for ≤ 4 days or no pathologic evidence of VAD pocket infection at surgery or autopsy with antibiotic therapy for ≤ 4 days, does not meet criteria for possible VAD pocket infection, and rejected microbiology evidence (negative culture or scanty growth of coagulase-negative staphylococcus excluding Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and non-purulence aspirated fluid or tissue obtained during surgical operation or needle aspiration from the pocket area.

### Microorganisms that commonly cause infective endocarditis: what about aerococcus in the Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases criteria? [^114csHY9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) criteria, recently published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, include important revisions to the microbiological aspects of the diagnostic criteria for infective endocarditis (IE). The revised criteria provide useful simplifications for the interpretation of blood culture results in relation to whether a bacteremia constitutes a major or a minor Duke–ISCVID criterion. The most significant change, however, is that a number of pathogens have been added to the list of "microorganisms that commonly cause IE". For such pathogens, 2 positive blood cultures are sufficient to be regarded as a major Duke–ISCVID criterion. The inclusion of an increased number of microorganisms that commonly cause IE is claimed to increase the sensitivity of the criteria, but this remains to be proven for most pathogens. Moreover, the reclassification will likely decrease the specificity of the Duke–ISCVID criteria, resulting in an increased number of possible IE cases.

Whereas several bacterial species that can cause IE, such as Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella, have been "upgraded" to microorganisms that commonly cause IE, Aerococcus spp. are not regarded as common causes of IE. Thus, 3 positive blood cultures for Aerococcus spp. are needed to fulfill the major microbiology criterion.

IE caused by Aerococcus was described in 1991. However, it was only after the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for species determination of bacteria that Aerococcus urinae was found to be a relatively common IE-causing organism. Most reports on A. urinae IE have been case reports, but some larger case studies have also been published. From published cases, it is clear that A. urinae IE affects older men with underlying urinary tract pathology.

### Bacterial contamination of irrigation fluid and suture material during ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery: low infection rate despite increasing contamination over surgery time [^116Qz5CA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Only few studies have yet dealt with the contamination of suture material in arthroscopic surgery. Roach et al. showed a relevant microbial colonization of subscapularis tagging sutures in shoulder surgery and again a significant association of procedure length and positive microbacterial finding (p = 0.03). There is no comparable study for the knee joint in the literature.

As there was only one postoperative joint infection in this series, no final assumption can be made whether positive suture or irrigation fluid culture is a more reliable factor for predicting the risk of surgical site infection. The reported infection was a Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection after positive fluid and suture specimens for this bacterium. This example indicates that in case of bacteria with high virulence such as Staphylococcus aureus or intermediate virulence such as S. lugdunensis, the contamination of the material and fluid can be relevant. However, the majority of contaminations did not lead to a postoperative infection. This might be due to the character of the arthroscopic surgery with continuous flushing of the operation site and the standard-of-care single-shot antibiotic, which might be sufficient in most cases to fight the evolvement of an infection.

Interestingly enough, only one out of four patients with same positive suture material and irrigation fluid results (only 0.6% of all patients and 2% of all culture-positive patients examined) developed a postoperative knee infection during the follow-up period. All other culture-positive patients remained free of any sign of infection in our 12-month follow-up.

The pathogen causing the only postoperative joint infection in this study, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, is involved in a wide range of severe infections. Frank et al. were the first to show S. lugdunensis to be a virulent CoNS that behaves similarly to Staphylococcus aureus in causing deep abscesses, skin and soft tissue infections, central nervous system infections and blood stream infections including sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and endocarditis complicated by embolic events. With its specific adhesions molecules, cytotoxins and biofilm synthesis system, S. lugdunensis, although a CoNS, shows a high pathogenicity comparable to S. aureus and is frequently verified in post-arthroscopic joint infections. Therefore, single positive microbiological samples with S. lugdunensis should be treated as significant rather than as contamination.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis vertebral osteomyelitis [^116ehd7K]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

We report a case of vertebral osteomyelitis due to the coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis. This is only the second such case reported in the literature in an immunocompetent host. When the patient's lumbar spine inflammatory mass was drained, the coagulase-negative staphylococcus obtained was discarded as a likely contaminant. We discuss the situation when coagulase-negative staphylococci require further identification and look at the unique features of S. lugdunensis. Isolation of S. lugdunensis is usually significant, and the organism should not be discarded as a contaminant without careful consideration.

### Is Staphylococcus lugdunensis significant in clinical samples? [^111t55Jv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

The implication of coagulase-negative staphylococci in human diseases is a major issue, particularly in hospital settings wherein these species often act as opportunistic pathogens. In addition, some coagulase-negative staphylococci such as S. lugdunensis have emerged as pathogenic bacteria, implicated in severe infections, particularly, osteoarticular infections, foreign-body-associated infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis. In vitro studies have shown the presence of several putative virulence factors such as adhesion factors, biofilm production, and proteolytic factors that might explain clinical manifestations. Taken together, the clinical and microbiological data might change the way clinicians and microbiologists look at S. lugdunensis in clinical samples.

### Multicenter clinical evaluation of bacT / alert virtuo blood culture system [^1156LozF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Positive.

Bottles that gave a positive signal by either instrument when viable organisms were present in the bottle were classified as representing a positive result.

False positive.

Bottles that gave a positive signal by either instrument when no viable organisms were present in the bottle were classified as representing a false-positive result.

False negative.

Bottles that gave a negative signal by either instrument when viable organisms were present on subculture of the bottle were classified as representing a false-negative result.

Significance of positive blood culture isolates.

The significance of positive blood culture isolate results was determined by an independent infectious disease clinician or clinical microbiologist at each trial site by performing a patient chart review in conjunction with the definitions shown below to determine clinical significance. These definitions are based on FDA guidance and recommendations in the literature.

Significant.

Results from one or both bottles of the study set that were positive with one or more typical pathogens and that were consistent with the patient's clinical findings were classified as representing significant results. Multiple blood culture sets positive for unusual or typically environmental species were also considered significant.

Contaminant.

The presence of one of the organisms listed below in a single blood culture bottle or blood culture set from the same draw and in which no other cultures were positive for the same organism from blood collected within 96 h (i.e. 48 h before or after) of the index positive blood culture was considered to represent the presence of a contaminant. Single isolations of the following organisms were generally considered contaminants and typically included about 90% of contaminants as follows: coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), with the exception of; spp.; spp. other than; spp. (diphtheroids);-like organisms; spp.; viridans group streptococci other than; andspp. other thanor.

Indeterminate.

A result with insufficient information available for classification, e.g. the presence of one positive bottle with a likely contaminant where only one set of bottles had been obtained from the patient and clinical relevance could not be determined from the patient's clinical course, was considered to represent an indeterminate result.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^111MkGgE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

During the past decade, Staphylococcus lugdunensis has emerged as an important pathogen implicated in both community-acquired and nosocomial infections. Clinical manifestations of infections with these organisms include abscesses, meningitis, ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection, spondylodiscitis, prosthetic joint infection, catheter-related bacteremia, and endocarditis. Infections with S. lugdunensis tend to have a more fulminant course, with an outcome resembling that of S. aureus infections rather than that caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. In addition, these organisms are frequently misidentified as S. aureus because of their morphologic appearance with yellow pigmentation and complete hemolysis when cultured on blood agar.

Small-colony variants (SCVs) are mainly reported in S. aureus, and interest in infections with SCVs has recently increased after an association between recovery of S. aureus SCVs and persistent and relapsing infection has become evident. SCVs are a slow-growing subpopulation of the species with characteristics that can associated by a common factor, i.e. alterations in electron transport. The generation time for SCVs is up to 9-fold longer than for metabolically normal strains, which results in tiny colonies that are frequently not visible until after 48 to 72 hours of incubation. Consequently, correct identification and susceptibility testing for clinical laboratories are complicated, which may result in diagnostic underestimation and therapeutic failures. While most studies have dealt with SCVs of S. aureus, little is known about infections with SCVs of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Recently, 2 cases of bloodstream infections caused by SCVs of S. epidermidis and S. capitis, respectively, were reported. Both infections were related to foreign bodies and observed after pacemaker implantation.

We report the first known case of a device-related bloodstream infection due to S. lugdunensis SCVs and other colony variants of this species. Of particular interest, this infection was also observed after pacemaker implantation.

### A prospective, multicenter, clinical study of duodenoscope contamination after reprocessing [^115UMC5y]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Definition of microorganism and contamination

The identified microorganisms were classified as low- to moderate-concern organisms (LMC) and high-concern (HC) organisms according to FDA–CDC–ASM surveillance protocols, which state that, compared with other organisms, HC organisms are often associated with disease. HC organisms included gram-negative organisms (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp, and yeasts). As a precaution, we defined all gram-negative rods as HC organisms, including potentially opportunistic organisms (usually pathogenic only to plants but may infect humans under unique circumstances). We classified HC organisms into 4 categories: gastrointestinal, human origin (other than gastrointestinal), environmental, or waterborne.

The LMC organisms included filamentous fungi, several gram-positive bacterial species (eg, Micrococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (excluding S. lugdunensis), Bacillus), and diphtheroids or other gram-positive bacilli. Organisms of moderate concern comprise oral-cavity colonizers (eg, saprophytic Neisseria, viridans group streptococci, and Moraxella spp). We classified LMC organisms into 2 categories: human origin or environmental.

Endoscope contamination was defined as "actionable" per the FDA–CDC–ASM protocolsas follows: (1) growth of ≥ 1 CFU of any HC organism on a cultured plate or (2) growth of > 100 CFU of any LMC organism on a cultured plate.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis: a rare pathogen for osteomyelitis of the foot [^112vqx8f]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an aggressive gram-positive bacteria that can lead to devastating infections in humans. S. lugdunensis has been associated with rare cases of osteomyelitis of the vertebra, prosthetic implants, and endocarditis. Reports of this organism associated with osteomyelitis of the foot or ankle have been infrequent. We present a unique case of acute osteomyelitis of a foot caused by S. lugdunensis after a patient stepped on a thorn. Our case is unique, because the radiographic changes were noted within 4 days, despite normal plain films and magnetic resonance images on the day of admission. This finding suggests the aggressiveness and virulence of S. lugdunensis. In addition, we report the first case of foot osteomyelitis as a result of isolated S. lugdunensis that involved 2 distinct specimens with 2 different antibiotic sensitivity reports.

### Multilocus sequence typing analysis of Staphylococcus lugdunensis implies a clonal population structure [^116s5KQF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is recognized as one of the major pathogenic species within the genus Staphylococcus, even though it belongs to the coagulase-negative group. A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme was developed to study the genetic relationships and population structure of 87 S. lugdunensis isolates from various clinical and geographic sources by DNA sequence analysis of seven housekeeping genes (aroE, dat, ddl, gmk, ldh, recA, and yqiL). The number of alleles ranged from four (gmk and ldh) to nine (yqiL). Allelic profiles allowed the definition of 20 different sequence types (STs) and five clonal complexes. The 20 STs lacked correlation with geographic source. Isolates recovered from hematogenic infections (blood or osteoarticular isolates) or from skin and soft tissue infections did not cluster in separate lineages. Penicillin-resistant isolates clustered mainly in one clonal complex, unlike glycopeptide-tolerant isolates, which did not constitute a distinct subpopulation within S. lugdunensis. Phylogenies from the sequences of the seven individual housekeeping genes were congruent, indicating a predominantly mutational evolution of these genes. Quantitative analysis of the linkages between alleles from the seven loci revealed a significant linkage disequilibrium, thus confirming a clonal population structure for S. lugdunensis. This first MLST scheme for S. lugdunensis provides a new tool for investigating the macroepidemiology and phylogeny of this unusually virulent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.

### Clinical significance of Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolated from routine cultures [^111pV7D3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Over 1 year, 42 Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates, identified by phenotypic and genotypic testing, were recovered from clinical specimens. Thirty-six (86%) were clinically significant pathogens, mostly from healthy outpatients; 16 (44%) of 36 were isolated in pure culture; and 30 (83%) of 36 were from skin and soft-tissue infections.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis infections, filling in the gaps: a 3-year retrospective review from a comprehensive cancer center [^115A2KF2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is considered to be more aggressive than other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). There are gaps in knowledge regarding the importance of isolating S. lugdunensis from different sources and in different patient subsets. Our objective was to describe the spectrum, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of infections caused by S. lugdunensis in patients with cancer.

Methods

A retrospective review of all cancer patients from whom S. lugdunensis was isolated in a pure culture from clinically significant sites.

Results

Between 2011 and 2014, 2263 CoNS were isolated, of them 45 S. lugdunensis were isolated in a pure culture and were included in this analysis. Only three patients were neutropenic. Skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) occurred most often (36 cases) followed by five blood stream infections, one of which had destructive endocarditis and four infections at other sites. Of the 36 SSSIs, 29 were related to surgical or invasive procedures, and six of these involved an implanted medical device. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, 98% to levofloxacin and 89% to oxacillin. All patients responded to the therapy.

Conclusions

Cancer patients including those with neutropenia do not appear to have an increased frequency of infections caused by S. lugdunensis. SSSIs are predominant and are often associated with surgical procedures and/or implanted medical devices. Blood stream infections caused by S. lugdunensis are uncommon but may have an increased rate of serious complications such as endocarditis. Nevertheless, these organisms are generally susceptible to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents, and the overall response to therapy is high.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — initial laboratory and tissue diagnostics include that two sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures and ESR and CRP should be obtained, with Brucella blood cultures and serologic tests in endemic areas, fungal blood cultures based on risk factors, and tuberculosis testing considered for those at risk; patients with S. aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, or Brucella bloodstream infection or, in an endemic setting, a positive Brucella serology do not need further testing, whereas for all others, image-guided aspiration/biopsy of a disc space or vertebral endplate is recommended with submission for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, and histopathology; if results are negative or inconclusive, a second sampling procedure should be considered, and microorganism-specific NAATs or 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR/sequencing may be considered, with strategies including setting aside a specimen for testing if cultures are negative or performing molecular testing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue for histopathologic evaluation.

### Multicenter evaluation of the portrait staph ID / R blood culture panel for rapid identification of staphylococci and detection of theGene [^1158XiM5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and are associated with increased health care costs. We evaluated the Portrait Staph ID/R blood culture panel (BCP) multiplex PCR assay (Great Basin Scientific, Salt Lake City, UT) for the rapid and simultaneous identification (ID) of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and Staphylococcus species to the genus level and the detection of the mecA gene directly from a positive blood culture bottle. A total of 765 Bactec bottles demonstrating Gram-positive cocci in singles or clusters were tested during the prospective trial at 3 clinical sites. The Portrait Staph ID/R BCP results were compared with results from conventional biochemical and cefoxitin disk methods performed at an independent laboratory. Discordant ID and mecA results were resolved by rpoB gene sequencing and mecA gene sequencing, respectively. A total of 658 Staphylococcus species isolates (S. aureus, 211 isolates; S. lugdunensis, 3 isolates; and Staphylococcus spp., 444 isolates) were recovered from monomicrobial and 33 polymicrobial blood cultures. After discrepant analysis, the overall ratios of Portrait Staph ID/R BCP positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement were 99.4%/99.9% for Staphylococcus ID and 99.7%/99.2% for mecA detection.

###: an emerging cutaneous pathogen [^112u7saX]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

S simulans is a CoNS and a well-established animal pathogen affecting cows, sheep, goats, and horses. It is commonly implicated in bovine mastitis. Reports of S simulans as the sole pathogen in human infections are rare; however, we hypothesize that our patient may have acquired infection from his farm and regular handling of animals, an identifiable risk factor. S simulans has also been implicated in osteoarticular infections, native valve endocarditis, and diabetic osteitis, with diabetes and prosthetic joints identified as additional risk factors.

Previously classified as rare opportunistic agents, Staphylococcus lugdunensis and Staphylococcus schleiferi are additional CoNS with emerging pathogenicity. Limited data exist explaining how these species are gaining pathogenicity, but shared virulence factors with Staphylococcus aureus have been documented in infectious animal isolates, including staphylococcal enterotoxins, tissue necrosis cytotoxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl), and the methicillin-resistance gene, mecA (Table I). Importantly, mecA-positive CoNS are able to horizontally transfer their genes within the staphylococcal genus with the potential to give rise to new methicillin-resistant strains. Theoretically, with horizontal gene transfer possible, staphylococcal strains could acquire the ability to generate superantigens and cytotoxins, amplifying their virulence. Of particular dermatologic importance is the presence of pvl-producing S simulans, as pvl-positive strains of S aureus have been preferentially linked to furuncles, cutaneous abscesses, and severe skin necrosis. These virulence factors are not routinely tested for in human cultures nor reported in our patient.

Consistent with this case, CoNS cases can be difficult to treat because of multidrug resistance and varying susceptibilities among strains. This finding further highlights the need for precise speciation and sensitivity detection with a low threshold for treatment alteration when clinical improvement does not occur. Cultured CoNS strains are often not speciated, making it difficult to monitor for antibiotic resistance and impossible to identify horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors.

Adequate speciation and susceptibility determination in skin and soft tissue infections is increasingly important. Dermatologists should be aware of S simulans and other CoNS species as potential pathogens and understand the origin of these newly named bacteria as MALDI-TOF-MS technology becomes more widely available.

Key data chart of included study patients and clinical findings.

Bacterial growth was isolated from 16 breast implants (16%) in 26 specimens. Identified bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus caprae, Micrococcus luteus, Finegoldia magna, and Cutibacterium acnes (Table 3). The most common bacteria isolated was S. epidermidis, with 57.7%. All identified pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria. In 85.7% of cases, contamination was seen unilaterally, whereas the remaining 14.3% showed bilateral contamination. Bilateral contamination was seen in patients of group A only. The main reasons for implant revisions were delayed-immediate reconstruction procedure, implant rupture, capsular contracture, implant exposure, implant dislocation, or aesthetic dissatisfaction (Table 4).

Breast Cancer Patients (Group A)

We performed 67 implant revisions (67%) in 49 breast cancer patients. Mean implant inlay duration and mean patient age were 4.34 ± 7.59 years and 51 ± 11.88 years, respectively. Mean BMI was 24.38 ± 4.28 kg/m 2 (Table 1).

In 57 operations, revision was performed as scheduled for two-stage breast reconstruction after mastectomy (of which four tissue expanders were dislocated but still scheduled, because of nondiscomfort) (Table 4). Furthermore, four tissue expanders were incidentally found to be ruptured, without contamination. In total, 18 revised breast implants (26.87%) were associated with implant-related complications (eight scheduled and 10 nonscheduled), of which seven (10.45%) were contaminated. The remaining 49 implants display no associated complication (Figs. 5 and 6).

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^112SdFAY]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — bacterial mastitis is described as cellulitis in a specific region of the breast that may spread to different quadrants, with common organisms including Staphylococcus (e.g. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, and S. hominis) and Streptococcus (e.g. S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae). Evaluation by a medical professional "should be performed if there are persistent systemic symptoms (> 24 hours) such as fever and tachycardia", and if systemic signs are absent, diagnosis should be considered when the breast is not responding to conservative measures. The protocol notes that "Bacterial mastitis is not a contagious entity and does not pose a risk to the infant nor require an interruption in breastfeeding", advises that "There is no evidence to support poor hygiene as a cause of bacterial mastitis or the need for routine sterilization of pumps" with basic handwashing and pump cleaning, and states that despite perceptions about yeast, "no scientific evidence exists to support this diagnosis".

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection sites: predominance of abscesses in the pelvic girdle region [^114DaeuJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We used a screening protocol to identify Staphylococcus lugdunensis in clinical specimens with pure or predominant growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci. S. lugdunensis was isolated from 17 patients in a 12-month period and was judged to be the cause of infection in 14 cases. In 13 cases, the patient had a soft-tissue abscess, and in 9 of these, the abscess was located in the pelvic girdle region, which suggests that this may be the natural habitat of S. lugdunensis.

### Metalware-associated orthopaedic infections caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis: an emerging pathogen [^112fYu1v]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

The increasing use of molecular diagnostics (e.g. MALDI-TOF) that facilitate speciation of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), has led to enhanced detection of Staphylococcus lugdunensis as the causative agent of a variety of infections. A series of cases of infective endocarditis among patients with S. lugdunensis bacteraemia was recently reported in this journal by Non et al. In addition to other reports of endocarditis, this organism has also increasingly been recognized in association with invasive infections at other sites including those arising in an orthopaedic setting. A recent retrospective study of prosthetic joint infections (PJI) in France found that S. lugdunensis may result in less favourable outcomes than other CoNS, with reported outcomes similar to S. aureus. The optimal management of S. lugdunensis orthopaedic infections is not established.

On this basis, we undertook a study to evaluate the contribution of S. lugdunensis to prosthetic orthopaedic infections, and to evaluate treatment and outcomes. We interrogated electronic records for patients treated under the care of Oxford trauma team and/or Bone Infection Unit, a specialist UK tertiary referral centre for bone and joint infection that handles approximately 200 revision arthroplasties each year. At this centre, patients are routinely started on broad-spectrum antimicrobials intraoperatively, after multiple samples are taken. Once identification and sensitivity testing are complete, antimicrobial therapy is adjusted according to susceptibility testing. Traditionally, most patients with confirmed deep bone and joint infection have been treated with six weeks of parenteral therapy before switching to oral antibiotics.

We identified cases of S. lugdunensis retrospectively, among patients age ≥ 18 years, by reviewing a 24 month period commencing April 2014 (when MALDI-TOF was first introduced into the diagnostic laboratory). We collated information pertaining to microbiology samples, surgical intervention, choice, route and duration of antibiotic therapy, and clinical outcomes. As a denominator group, we identified patients with S. aureus prosthetic hip and knee infections. Patient identifying information was removed before further analysis. As this was undertaken as a quality improvement project with no intervention, ethical approval was not required.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis uses the agr regulatory system to resist killing by host innate immune effectors [^1147B4bh]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are frequently commensal bacteria that rarely cause disease in mammals. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an exceptional CoNS that causes disease in humans similar to virulent Staphylococcus aureus, but the factors that enhance the virulence of this bacterium remain ill defined. Here, we used random transposon insertion mutagenesis to identify the agr quorum sensing system as a regulator of hemolysins in S. lugdunensis. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we revealed that agr regulates dozens of genes, including hemolytic < u > S < /u >. < u > lu < /u > gdunensis < u > s < /u > ynergistic < u > h < /u > emolysins (SLUSH) peptides and the protease lugdulysin. A murine bacteremia model was used to show that mice infected systemically with wild-type S. lugdunensis do not show overt signs of disease despite there being high numbers of bacteria in the livers and kidneys of mice. Moreover, proliferation of the agr mutant in these organs was no different from that of the wild-type strain, leaving the role of the SLUSH peptides and the metalloprotease lugdulysin in pathogenesis still unclear. Nonetheless, the tropism of S. lugdunensis for humans led us to investigate the role of virulence factors in other ways. We show that agr -regulated effectors, but not SLUSH or lugdulysin alone, are important for S. lugdunensis survival in whole human blood. Moreover, we demonstrate that Agr contributes to survival of S. lugdunensis during encounters with murine and primary human macrophages. These findings demonstrate that, in S. lugdunensis, Agr regulates expression of virulence factors and is required for resistance to host innate antimicrobial defenses. This study therefore provides insight into strategies that this Staphylococcus species uses to cause disease.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis native tricuspid valve endocarditis: a case report and review of literature [^112irwp3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coagulase negative staphylococci are skin commensals and are generally disregarded as contaminants in clinical specimens. Repeated isolation of coagulase negative staphylococci in blood cultures should warrant a species identification to recognize unusually virulent organisms that demand aggressive treatment, such as Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is known to cause a wide variety of infections, including a predominant left-sided endocarditis. We report a rare case of native tricuspid valve Staphylococcus lugdunensis endocarditis in a non-intravenous drug user and include a brief literature review.

### Lugdunin amplifies innate immune responses in the skin in synergy with host-and microbiota-derived factors [^114fN9E6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is most frequently found in humans in the inguinal and perineal areas, the axilla, as well as in the nail bed and the nose, where it is considered a part of the normal human skin flora. Staphylococcus lugdunensis can co-exist with other commensals on human skin such as S. epidermidis, but intriguingly, nasal colonization by S. aureus or S. lugdunensis, was shown to be mutually exclusive as a result of lugdunin production. In fact, humans who are colonized by S. lugdunensis in the nose have a 6-fold lower risk of S. aureus carriage than individuals who are not colonized. However, the total number of S. lugdunensis in the noses of carriers is considerably low compared to the number of other commensals. Therefore, we speculated that apart from its antimicrobial activity, lugdunin might exhibit additional properties that contribute to the prevention of S. aureus colonization. Here we show that the protective potential of lugdunin can be further increased both by combined action with factors produced by other commensals that promote the host innate defense by inducing the expression of AMPs and by recruiting phagocytic immune cells, as well as by synergistic antimicrobial action with the host AMPs LL-37 and dermcidin-derived peptides. These results may explain why such low numbers of S. lugdunensis can completely prevent S. aureus from colonizing epithelial tissues.

### Mechanisms of microbe-immune system dialogue within the skin [^1115oizw]. Genes and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Microbe–microbe interactions on the skin

Bacterial species colonizing the same ecological niche interact extensively with each other as they compete for nutritional resources. Bacteria may sequester or consume nutrients in a niche preventing their competitors from accessing them, produce antimicrobials that synergise with host-derived AMPs to inhibit the growth of their competitors, or produce factors that interfere with the virulence signalling pathways of their competitors. These competitive interactions are important in shaping the composition and diversity of microbial communities and ecosystems, which have important consequences to skin health.

S. aureus overabundance, accompanied by a concomitant decline in microbial richness and diversity (especially protective staphylococci) is associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Intraspecies competition among Staphylococci can inhibit pathogenic strains such as S. aureus, by production of (i) bacteriocins, and (ii) autoinducing peptides, which inhibit accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing systems that controls production of virulence factors. The peptides phenol soluble modulin (PSM) γ and PSMδ, produced by S epidermidis, limit survival of S. aureus on the skin surface. These PSMs cause membrane leakage and membrane perturbation in bacteria, suggesting that these peptides function by a mechanism similar to that of human AMPs. S epidermidis strains are also capable of producing specific serine proteases that interfere with S. aureus biofilm formation. Staphylococcus hominis strains can produce Sh -lantibiotics α/β- a class of cyclic AMP that contain lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Staphylococcus lugdunensis also produces the cyclic peptide lugdunin that inhibits S. aureus. An unidentified antimicrobial factor from Corynebacterium pseudodiphteriticum can inhibit S. aureus growth and colonization as well as biofilm formation on anterior nares.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis infective endocarditis: description of 10 cases and analysis of native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker lead endocarditis clinical profiles [^115oTLQy]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the incidence and the clinical and echocardiographic features of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis and to identify the prognostic factors of surgery and mortality in this disease.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Study at two centres (a tertiary care centre and a community hospital).

Patients

10 patients with IE caused by S lugdunensis in 912 consecutive patients with IE between 1990 and 2003.

Methods

Prospective study of consecutive patients carried out by the multidisciplinary team for diagnosis and treatment of IE from the study institutions. English, French, and Spanish literature was searched by computer under the terms "endocarditis" and "Staphylococcus lugdunensis" published between 1989 and December 2003.

Main Outcome Measures

Patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, required surgery, and prognostic factors of mortality in left sided cases of IE.

Results

10 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified at our institutions, representing 0.8% (four of 467), 1.5% (two of 135), and 7.8% (four of 51) of cases of native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker lead endocarditis in the non-drug misusers. Native valve IE was present in four patients (two aortic, one mitral, and one pulmonary), prosthetic valve aortic IE in two patients, and pacemaker lead IE in the other four patients. All patients with left sided IE had serious complications (heart failure, periannular abscess formation, or shock) requiring surgery in 60% (three of five patients) of cases with an overall mortality rate of 80% (four of five patients). All patients with pacemaker IE underwent combined medical treatment and surgery, and mortality was 25% (one patient). In total 59 cases of IE caused by S lugdunensis were identified in a review of the literature. The combined analysis of these 69 cases showed that native valve IE (53 patients, 77%) is characterised by mitral valve involvement and frequent complications such as heart failure, abscess formation, and embolism. Surgery was needed in 51% of cases and mortality was 42%. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (nine of 60, 13%) predominated in the aortic position and was associated with abscess formation, required surgery, and high mortality (78%). Pacemaker lead IE (seven of 69, 10%) is associated with a better prognosis when antibiotic treatment is combined with surgery.

Conclusions

S lugdunensis IE is an uncommon cause of IE, involving mainly native left sided valves, and it is characterised by an aggressive clinical course. Mortality in left sided native valve IE is high but the prognosis has improved in recent years. Surgery has improved survival in left sided IE and, therefore, early surgery should always be considered. Prosthetic valve S lugdunensis IE carries an ominous prognosis.

### Poly-N-acetylglucosamine is not a major component of the extracellular matrix in biofilms formed by icaADBC-positive Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates [^113ng4tS]. Infection and Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a pathogen of heightened virulence that causes infections resembling those caused by Staphylococcus aureus rather than those caused by its coagulase-negative staphylococcal counterparts. Many types of S. lugdunensis infection, including native valve endocarditis, prosthetic joint infection, and intravascular catheter-related infection, are associated with biofilm etiology. Poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), a polysaccharide synthesized by products of the icaADBC locus, is a common mechanism of intercellular adhesion in staphylococcal biofilms. Here we report the characterization of ica homologues and the in vitro biofilm formation properties of a collection of S. lugdunensis clinical isolates. Isolates formed biofilms in microtiter wells to various degrees. Biofilm formation by most isolates was enhanced with glucose but diminished by sodium chloride or ethanol. icaADBC homologues were found in all S. lugdunensis isolates tested, although the locus organization differed substantially from that of other staphylococcal ica loci. icaR was not detected in S. lugdunensis, but a novel open reading frame with putative glycosyl hydrolase function is located upstream of the ica locus. icaADBC sequence heterogeneity did not explain the variability in biofilm formation among isolates. PNAG was not detected in S. lugdunensis extracts by immunoblotting with an anti-deacetylated PNAG antibody or wheat germ agglutinin. Confocal microscopy with fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin showed a paucity of PNAG in S. lugdunensis biofilms, but abundant extracellular protein was visualized with SYPRO Ruby staining. Biofilms were resistant to detachment by dispersin B and sodium metaperiodate but were susceptible to detachment by proteases. Despite the genetic presence of icaADBC homologues in S. lugdunensis isolates, PNAG is not a major component of the extracellular matrix of in vitro biofilms formed by this species. Our data suggest that the S. lugdunensis biofilm matrix contains proteinaceous factors.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^1178EwCj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Identification of organisms and appropriate treatment are urgently needed to improve the quality of life of HS patients. An infectious process related to HS has been suspected for a long time. However, considering the polymicrobial nature of the cultures obtained from HS lesions and bacteria usually isolated from the skin microflora, it remained unclear whether bacterial factors were involved in the pathophysiology of HS.

We conducted a large prospective study of the microbiology of HS lesions among a cohort of 82 patients. Altogether, we studied 102 HS lesions using optimized sampling and culture methods. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption–time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify the predominant microflora of lesions and of normal skin samples. The main advantage of this technique is that identification can be obtained to the species level within a few minutes for a very wide range of bacteria, including species of the normal microflora, anaerobes, and bacteria that are usually identified by molecular techniques.

This study demonstrates that 2 specific microbiological profiles, neither corresponding to the normal skin microflora, nor to usual skin pathogens (S. aureus and S. pyogenes) are associated with HS lesions. Two new bacterial pathogens species associated with HS lesions were identified: S. lugdunensis and anaerobic actinomycetes.

S. lugdunensis was mostly cultured from HS nodules and abscesses. S. lugdunensis is a skin commensal that primarily colonizes the lower extremities and inguino-perineal area, the latter including typical sites for HS lesions. S. lugdunensis seems to be an infrequent pathogen, but skin abscesses caused by this organism are similar to those caused by S. aureus, demonstrating a particular virulence compared with other coagulase negative staphylococci. This organism was initially described as a cause of post-surgical wound infections, suggesting that local predisposing factors are required for its pathogenicity.

### Shear-resistant binding to von Willebrand factor allows Staphylococcus lugdunensis to adhere to the cardiac valves and initiate endocarditis [^114FGNkp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an emerging cause of endocarditis. To cause endovascular infections, S. lugdunensis requires mechanisms to overcome shear stress. We investigated whether platelets and von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediate bacterial adhesion to the vessel wall and the cardiac valves under flow.

Methods

S. lugdunensis binding to VWF, collagen, and endothelial cells was studied in a parallel flow chamber in the absence and presence of platelets. In vivo adhesion of S. lugdunensis was evaluated in a mouse microvasculature perfusion model and a new mouse model of endocarditis.

Results

Contrary to other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. lugdunensis bound to VWF under flow, thus enabling its adhesion to endothelial cells and to the subendothelial matrix. In inflamed vessels of the mesenteric circulation, VWF recruited S. lugdunensis to the vessel wall. In a novel endocarditis mouse model, local inflammation and the resulting release of VWF enabled S. lugdunensis to bind and colonize the heart valves.

Conclusions

S. lugdunensis binds directly to VWF, which proved to be vital for withstanding shear forces and for its adhesion to the vessel wall and cardiac valves. This mechanism explains why S. lugdunensis causes more-aggressive infections, including endocarditis, compared with other coagulase-negative staphylococci.

### Bacterial contamination of irrigation fluid and suture material during ACL reconstruction and meniscus surgery: low infection rate despite increasing contamination over surgery time [^117JfzDw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

During knee arthroscopy, irrigation fluid from the surgical site accumulates in the sterile reservoir. Whether these fluid collections and also suture material used during the arthroscopic surgical processes show bacterial contamination over time during surgery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine this contamination rate and to analyze its possible influence on postoperative infection.

Materials and Methods

In this study, 155 patients were included. Fifty-eight underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), 63 meniscal surgery and 34 patients combined ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair. We collected pooled samples of irrigation fluid from the reservoir on the sterile drape every 15 min during the surgery. In addition, we evaluated suture material of ACL graft and meniscus repair for bacterial contamination. Samples were sent for microbiological analysis, incubation time was 14 days. All patients were seen in the outpatient department 6, 12 weeks and 12 months postoperatively and examined for clinical signs of infection.

Results

A strong statistical correlation (R² = 0.81, p = 0.015) was found between an advanced duration of surgery and the number of positive microbiological findings in the accumulated fluid. Suture and fixation material showed a contamination rate of 28.4% (29 cases). Despite the high contamination rate, only one infection was found in the follow-up examinations, caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis.

Conclusion

Since bacterial contamination of accumulated fluid increases over time the contact with the fluid reservoirs should be avoided.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^112F7VvU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Previous reports have rarely emphasized colony variation as an important feature of S. lugdunensis. In the initial description of the species in 1988, colony variation was observed in 3 of 11 strains. More recently, Leung et al. reported colony variation of S. lugdunensis in a fatal case of endocarditis. Unlike other staphylococcal species such as S. capitis and S. hominis, which show colony variation that disappeared after extended incubation, mixed morphotypes of S. lugdunensis were persistently detectable through incubation and subculture. The authors speculated that preceding antimicrobial drug therapy may play a role in producing colony variation in S. lugdunensis and that previous studies may have underreported the characteristic of colony variation seen in this species.

Some of the aberrant morphotypes described in earlier studies may have in fact been SCVs. Both prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs and the presence of chronic or recurring infections, often with indwelling foreign devices that have been associated with SCVs of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. capitis, are features commonly observed in infections with S. lugdunensis. In our case, repeated courses of gentamicin therapy may have selected for SCVs. Although the infection showed a rather benign clinical course and did not confirm other reports of S. lugdunensis endocarditis in which the infection was more aggressive, it illustrates the chronic, recurrent, and persistent nature of infections with SCVs and the problems associated with delayed identification of S. lugdunensis colony variants and interpretation of its clinical significance.

### Human commensals producing a novel antibiotic impair pathogen colonization [^112gSRJY]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The vast majority of systemic bacterial infections are caused by facultative, often antibiotic-resistant, pathogens colonizing human body surfaces. Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus predisposes to invasive infection, but the mechanisms that permit or interfere with pathogen colonization are largely unknown. Whereas soil microbes are known to compete by production of antibiotics, such processes have rarely been reported for human microbiota. We show that nasal Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains produce lugdunin, a novel thiazolidine-containing cyclic peptide antibiotic that prohibits colonization by S. aureus, and a rare example of a non-ribosomally synthesized bioactive compound from human-associated bacteria. Lugdunin is bactericidal against major pathogens, effective in animal models, and not prone to causing development of resistance in S. aureus. Notably, human nasal colonization by S. lugdunensis was associated with a significantly reduced S. aureus carriage rate, suggesting that lugdunin or lugdunin-producing commensal bacteria could be valuable for preventing staphylococcal infections. Moreover, human microbiota should be considered as a source for new antibiotics.

### Evaluation of oxacillin and cefoxitin disk diffusion and MIC breakpoints established by the clinical and laboratory standards institute for detection of-mediated oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus schleiferi [^115cmLZc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus schleiferi is a beta-hemolytic, coagulase-variable colonizer of small animals that can cause opportunistic infections in humans. In veterinary isolates, the rate of mecA -mediated oxacillin resistance is significant, with reported resistance rates of > 39%. The goal of this study was to evaluate oxacillin and cefoxitin disk diffusion (DD) and MIC breakpoints for detection of mecA -mediated oxacillin resistance in 52 human and 38 veterinary isolates of S. schleiferi Isolates were tested on multiple brands of commercial media and according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods. Zone diameters and MIC values were interpreted using CLSI breakpoints (CLSI, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. M100-S27, 2017) for Staphylococcus aureus / Staphylococcus lugdunensis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius Results were compared to those of mecA PCR. Twenty-nine of 90 (32%) isolates were mecA positive. Oxacillin inhibition zone sizes and MICs interpreted by S. pseudintermedius breakpoints reliably differentiated mecA -positive and mecA -negative isolates, with a categorical agreement (CA) of 100% and no very major errors (VMEs) or major errors (MEs) for all media. For cefoxitin DD results interpreted using S. aureus / S. lugdunensis and CoNS breakpoints, CA values were 85% and 75%, respectively, and there were 72% and 64% VMEs, respectively, and 0 MEs. For cefoxitin MICs interpreted using S. aureus/S. lugdunensis breakpoints, CA was 81%, and there were 60% VMEs and no MEs. Our data demonstrate that oxacillin DD or MIC testing methods using the current S. pseudintermedius breakpoints reliably identify mecA -mediated oxacillin resistance in S. schleiferi, while cefoxitin DD and MIC testing methods perform poorly.

### Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections [^114sYJVp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms may be normal flora of human skin, however these bacteria can also be pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections. A summary of skin and soft tissue infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus species is provided in this review. We conducted a search of the PubMed database using the following terms: abscess, auricularis, biofilm, capitis, cellulitis, coagulase, contaminant, cyst, draining, epidermidis, felon, folliculitis, furuncle, haemolyticus, hominis, indolent, infection, lugdunensis, mecA, microbiome, negative, osteomyelitis, paronychia, saprophyticus, skin, simulans, sinus, soft, staphylococcus, systemic, tissue, virulence, virulent, and vulvar. The relevant papers, and their references, generated by the search were reviewed. Skin and soft tissue infections have been observed to be caused by many coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms: Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus simulans. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin infections predominantly present as abscesses and paronychia. They are most common in elderly patients or those individuals who are immunosuppressed, and tend to be broadly susceptible to antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, albeit less common, coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms can result in skin and soft tissue infections, particularly in older and/or immunocompromised individuals. A review of the literature found that coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms are most commonly grown in cultures of abscesses and paronychia. Therefore, coagulase-negative staphylococcal organisms should not always be considered as contaminants or normal flora, but rather as causative pathogens. They are usually susceptible to antibiotics used to treat methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

### A prospective, multicenter, clinical study of duodenoscope contamination after reprocessing [^117Wm538]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective:

Several clinical procedures utilize duodenoscopes, which are processed for reuse after the procedures are completed. However, infection outbreaks due to improper duodenoscope processing occur frequently. To address this, we aimed to assess the contamination rates of duodenoscopes after reprocessing in nonoutbreak settings.

Design and setting:

Prospective study in 16 clinical sites in the United States.

Methods:

We sampled and cultured reprocessed duodenoscopes following the FDA/CDC/ASM guideline; "Duodenoscope Surveillance Sampling and Culturing – Reducing the Risks of Infection". High-concern (HC) organisms were those highly associated with disease, including gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp, and yeasts. We evaluated duodenoscopes with ≥ 1 CFU of organisms after reprocessing. The reprocessing environments were also sampled and cultured.

Results:

We assessed 859 newer-model (NM) duodenoscopes (TJF-Q180V) and 850 older-model (OM) duodenoscopes (TJF-160F/VF); of these, 35 NM samples (4.1%) and 56 OM samples (6.6%) were contaminated with HC organisms. We detected and classified the HC organisms as gastrointestinal (45.4%), human origin (16.7%), environmental (24.1%), waterborne (13.0%), and unidentified (0.9%).

Conclusions:

We detected an overall HC contamination rate of 5.3% in nonoutbreak settings. Although the relationship between endoscopic contamination and the occurrence of infections remains unclear, attempts should continue to be made to further reduce contamination rates. Additional improvements to the manufacturer's instructions for use, human factors during the reprocessing procedure, ongoing training programs, cleanliness of reprocessing environments, and the design of the distal end of the duodenoscope should be considered.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^112RrLj2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Sheep blood agar plates (A–E) and magnified sectors (a–e) after overnight incubation at 37°C showing different morphotypes of clonal isolates of the Staphylococcus lugdunensis strain recovered from blood cultures and the infected pocket of a patient with pacemaker infection. Plates A–D/a–d show S. lugdunensis colonies exhibiting the normal phenotype characterized by colonies of different diameter, ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 mm with creamy (A/a) or yellow (B–D/b–d) pigmentation and moderately heavy (B/b), weak (C–D/c–d), or absent (A/a) hemolysis; plate E/e shows the small-colony variant phenotype characterized by tiny (pinpoint), nonpigmented, and nonhemolytic colonies.

Four months later in July 2003, the patient came to the local hospital with recurrent high fever and chills, a leukocyte count of 12,200/μL, and a CRP value of 37 mg/L, but he did not show any peripheral sign of endocarditis. Four sets of blood cultures drawn on admission showed S. lugdunensis. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed large vegetations in the right atrium inserting at the ventricular lead but no involvement of cardiac valves. The patient responded promptly to the initiation of antimicrobial drug therapy with intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin and became afebrile. He was then transferred to our cardiothoracic surgery department for pacemaker ablation.

Four days later, the complete pacemaker system, including the intracardiac leads, was removed by open heart surgery. The cardiac valves did not show signs of infective endocarditis, but large vegetations adhered to both the atrial and the ventricular lead. Follow-up blood cultures remained negative but thrombotic material scraped from the pacemaker leads was analyzed by culture. After 2 days of incubation, this material yielded nonhemolytic and nonpigmented, as well as yellow-pigmented, hemolytic colonies of variable size, which were gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, consistent with staphylococci. The results of subcultures on solid media suggested a mixed population of staphylococci, with at least 4 different colony morphologies (Figure 1B–E). Four single-colony subcultures of different colony morphotypes also produced colony variations that persisted in serial subcultures of single colonies.

### Staphylococcus epidermidis in urine is not always benign: a case report of pyelonephritis in a child [^112Ri7TT]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Staphylococcus epidermidis in urine cultures from previously healthy children is usually considered to be a contaminant. The goal of this study was to identify cases in which S. epidermidis was an infectious cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Methods

A literature search identified 7 cases, 6 of which were previously published and 1 which was unpublished, described herein.

Results

S. epidermidis was identified as the causative organism of UTIs in children with underlying urinary tract abnormalities.

Conclusion

UTIs caused by S. epidermidis in a previously healthy child should not be disregarded as a contaminant and further workup for urinary tract abnormality is indicated.

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of community-acquired Staphylococcus lugdunensis infections in Southern Taiwan [^111Dr4MH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Most Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains (49/59, 83%) were related to clinical infections, were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents with an overall oxacillin-resistant rate of 5% (3/58), and carried relatively great genetic diversity. Community-acquired infections (41/49, 84%) were dominant, often developed in patients with comorbidity, and had rather benign clinical courses without mortality.

### Disk diffusion testing for detection of methicillin-resistant staphylococci: does moxalactam improve upon cefoxitin? [^111f1ngh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Disk diffusion testing is widely used to detect methicillin resistance in staphylococci, and cefoxitin is currently considered the best marker for mecA-mediated methicillin resistance. In low-inoculum diffusion testing (colony suspension at 10⁶ CFU/ml), the addition of moxalactam in combination with cefoxitin has been reported to improve on cefoxitin alone for the detection of methicillin-heteroresistant staphylococci. However, moxalactam is absent from EUCAST and CLSI guidelines, which use high-inoculum diffusion testing (colony suspension at 10⁸ CFU/ml), calling into question the potential interest of including moxalactam in their recommendations. The inhibition zone diameters of cefoxitin and moxalactam, alone and in combination, were evaluated for concordance with mecA and mecC positivity in a large collection of clinical Staphylococcus isolates (611 Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates and 307 coagulase-negative staphylococci other than S. lugdunensis and S. saprophyticus isolates, of which 22% and 53% were mecA-positive, respectively) and in 25 mecC-positive S. aureus isolates using high-inoculum diffusion testing. Receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, and specificity analyses indicated that the detection of mecA- and mecC-positive and negative isolates did not improve with moxalactam, either alone or in combination with cefoxitin, compared to cefoxitin alone. These findings were similar in both the S. aureus/S. lugdunensis/S. saprophyticus group and in the coagulase-negative staphylococci group. Our results do not support the use of moxalactam as an additional marker of methicillin resistance when testing with high-inoculum disk diffusion.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the community [^111Qfjet]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a rare cause of severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, often causes superficial skin infections similar to Staphylococcus aureus infections. We initiated a study to optimize the identification methods in the routine laboratory, followed by a population-based epidemiologic analysis of patients infected with S. lugdunensis in Viborg County, Denmark. Recognition of a characteristic Eikenella corrodens-like odor on Columbia sheep blood agar combined with colony pleomorphism and prominent beta-hemolysis after 2 days of incubation, confirmed by API-ID-32 Staph, led to an 11-fold increase in the detection of S. lugdunensis. By these methods we found 491 S. lugdunensis infections in 4 years, corresponding to an incidence of 53 per 100,000 per year, an increase from 5 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the preceding years. Seventy-five percent of the cases were found in general practice; these were dominated by skin abscesses (36%), wound infections (25%), and paronychias (13%). Fifty-six percent of the infections occurred below the waist, and toes were the most frequently infected site (21%). Only 3% of the patients suffered from severe invasive infections. The median age was 52 years, and the male/female ratio was 0.69. Our study shows that S. lugdunensis is a common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) and is probably underrated by many laboratories. S. lugdunensis should be accepted as a significant pathogen in SSTI and should be looked for in all routine bacteriological examinations, and clinicians should be acquainted with the name and the pathology of the bacterium.

### Pathogenesis of infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci [^114m5qwp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

As a group, the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are among the most frequently isolated bacteria in the clinical microbiology laboratory and are becoming increasingly important, especially as causes of hospital-acquired infections. These bacteria are normal inhabitants of human skin and mucous membranes and, therefore, one of the major challenges of daily diagnostic work is to distinguish clinically significant CoNS from contaminant strains. This overview addresses current knowledge of the pathogenesis of infections due to CoNS and particularly focuses on virulence factors of the species Staphylococcus epidermidis. S epidermidis has been identified as a major cause of nosocomial infections, especially in patients with predisposing factors such as indwelling or implanted foreign polymer bodies. Most important in the pathogenesis of foreign-body-associated infections is the ability of these bacteria to colonise the polymer surface by the formation of a thick, multilayered biofilm. Biofilm formation takes place in two phases. The first phase involves the attachment of the bacteria to polymer surfaces that may be either unmodified or coated with host extracellular matrix proteins. In the second phase, the bacteria proliferate and accumulate into multilayered cell clusters that are embedded in an extracellular material. The bacterial factors involved in both phases of biofilm formation are discussed in this review. In addition, the most important aspects of the pathogenic potential of S saprophyticus, S lugdunensis, and S schleiferi are described, although, compared with S epidermidis, much less is known in these species concerning their virulence factors.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^111tcYXs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Results

We analyzed the microbiological test results of 102 typical HS lesions excised from 82 patients, comprising 38 nodules and abscesses (Hurley stage 1 lesions) and 64 chronic suppurating lesions (45 Hurley stage 2 and 19 Hurley stage 3 lesions) (Table 1). Altogether, we collected 125 lesional samples, including 11 needle aspirations, 49 biopsies performed under strict asepsis, and 65 swab samples of open suppurating lesions (Table 1). Twenty-three open suppurating lesions were sampled both by biopsy and swabbing. We obtained 58 perilesional control samples by swabbing normal perilesional skin 5 cm away from the lesion, bringing the total number of samples to 183.

Identification of Microbiological Profiles Associated with HS Lesions

Culture results of the 183 samples are presented in Technical Appendix Figure 1. Of the 125 lesional samples, 106 yielded a positive culture. To identify single or multiple bacterial species specifically associated with HS lesions, hierarchical clustering was performed on these samples (Technical Appendix Figure 2). This strategy identified 2 microbiological profiles (Technical Appendix Figures 3–5).

The profile A group identified Staphylococcus lugdunensis as a unique or predominant isolate (Technical Appendix Figure 3). This group of samples comprised 24 lesion samples: 22/38 lesions were at Hurley stage 1 and 2/45 were at Hurley stage 2.

The profile B group was characterized by a mixed anaerobic flora composed of strict anaerobes and/or anaerobic actinomycetes and/or streptococci of the milleri group (Technical Appendix Figure 4). Various other bacteria, such as S. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, corynebacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Propionibacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. were inconstantly and in smaller amounts associated with the mixed anaerobic flora, especially when lesions were sampled by swabbing. Profile B organisms were found in 77 samples corresponding to 65 lesions.

### Analytical and clinical validation of direct detection of antimicrobial resistance markers by plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing [^113juJNB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The additional AMR markers included mecA and mecC for methicillin in S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis; vanA and vanB for vancomycin in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis; bla CTX-M for oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam; and bla KPC for carbapenem resistance in Enterobacter cloacae complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella bongori, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The AMR gene detection workflow (Fig. 1) is triggered by Karius test results that reported one or more of the 18 targeted bacteria provided that additional requirements were met: sufficient plasma volume remaining (> 500 µL); for bla CTX-M and bla KPC testing, the target bacterial species is reported at > 1,000 MPM; for S. aureus, the SCC mec caller reports "indeterminate"; and for S. aureus with MPM < 300, the abundance of interfering coagulase-negative staphylococci is < 5 MPM. SCC mec -detected/not detected results are reported on day 1 along with the microbe identification report, and the other AMR marker results > 95% are reported on day 2 after receipt in the laboratory as an addended report.

Fig 1
Overview of Karius test AMR workflow. See text for more details.

In the AMR wet-lab workflow, 500 µL of plasma was spiked with two synthetic control DNA molecules, an ID spike and an AMR WINC. mcfDNA was extracted, followed by targeted amplification using more than 300 primers to amplify mcfDNA fragments from mecA, mecC, vanA, vanB, bla CTX-M, bla KPC, several species-specific housekeeping genes, and the synthetic control molecules. Following sequencing, libraries were demultiplexed and amplicons aligned to AMR markers, human reference, and synthetic sequence spike-ins. The number of unique amplified mcfDNA molecules referred to as estimated deduplicated templates (EDTs) detected was estimated from the amplicon alignments for each marker and housekeeping gene and from the unique molecular identifiers for the quality control oligonucleotides. Background EDT levels of each marker and housekeeping gene were estimated per sequencing batch using negative batch controls. An upper bound estimate of background signal was subtracted from the observed EDT for each gene to generate a corrected EDT estimate.

### Implementation of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry in routine clinical laboratories improves identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci and reveals the pathogenic role of Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^114PHmN7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

The use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for staphylococcal identification is now considered routine in laboratories compared with the conventional phenotypical methods previously used. We verified its microbiological relevance for identifying the main species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) by randomly selecting 50 isolates. From 1 January 2007 to 31 August 2008, 12,479 staphylococci were isolated with phenotypic methods, of which 4,594 were identified as Staphylococcus aureus and 7,885 were coagulase negative staphylococci. Using MALDI-TOF MS from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2012, 14,913 staphylococci were identified, with 5,066 as S. aureus and 9,847 as CoNS. MALDI-TOF MS allowed the identification of approximately 85% of the CoNS strains, whereas only 14% of the CoNS strains were identified to the species level with phenotypic methods because they were often considered contaminants. Furthermore, the use of MALDI-TOF MS revealed the occurrence of recently characterized Staphylococcus species, such as S. pettenkoferi, S. condimenti, and S. piscifermentans. Microbiological relevance analysis further revealed that some species displayed a high rate of microbiological significance, i.e., 40% of the S. lugdunensis strains included in the analysis were associated with infection risk. This retrospective microbiological study confirms the role of MALDI-TOF MS in clinical settings for the identification of staphylococci with clinical consequences. The species distribution reveals the occurrence of the recently identified species S. pettenkoferi and putative virulent species, including S. lugdunensis.

### Novel selective medium for isolation of Staphylococcus lugdunensis from wound specimens [^114LwTfD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We compared a novel selective Staphylococcus lugdunensis (SSL) medium with routine media (blood and chocolate agars) for the detection of S. lugdunensis in 990 clinical specimens (from tissue, pus, or wound swabs). Significantly more S. lugdunensis isolates were detected on SSL medium (34/990) than on routine medium (7/990) (P = 0.001, McNemar's test).

### Frequency of isolation of Staphylococcus lugdunensis in consecutive urine cultures and relationship to urinary tract infection [^1145WABd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent reports associate Staphylococcus lugdunensis with severe infection in humans. The frequency of this microorganism in urine cultures is unknown. Five hundred isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were recovered from 4,652 consecutive urine specimens submitted for culture to the Mayo Clinic Microbiology Laboratory. Thirty-one (6%) of 500 isolates of CoNS were identified as S. lugdunensis. In no case was S. lugdunensis isolated in pure culture; 29 (94%) of 31 S. lugdunensis isolates were part of mixed nonpathogenic flora. Medical records were reviewed for 30 of the 31 patients from whom these 31 isolates were isolated. Twenty-one (70%) of the 30 evaluable patients were not treated with antibiotics; the remaining 9 (30%) of 30 patients were treated with antibiotics that may be effective against S. lugdunensis. S. lugdunensis may be an unrecognized yet infrequent cause of urinary tract infection.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis: low prevalence and clinical significance in a pediatric microbiology laboratory [^11394nNu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is reported to be a highly virulent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, but whether it is an important pediatric pathogen is uncertain. At our pediatric center, only 2.1% (7/347) of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates were found to be S. lugdunensis, and only 1 isolate was considered possibly clinically significant.S. lugdunensis does not appear to be a common pathogen in children.

### Clinical and microbiological aspects of β-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^114LwEWD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility results from broth microdilution MIC testing of 993 Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates recovered from patients at a tertiary care medical center from 2008 to 2015 were reviewed. Ninety-two oxacillin-susceptible isolates were selected to assess the accuracy of penicillin MIC testing, the penicillin disk diffusion test, and three β-lactamase tests, including the cefoxitin-induced nitrocefin test, penicillin cloverleaf assay, and penicillin disk zone edge test. The results of all phenotypic tests were compared to the results of blaZ PCR. The medical records of 62 patients from whom S. lugdunensis was isolated, including 31 penicillin-susceptible and 31 penicillin-resistant strains, were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the clinical significance of S. lugdunensis isolation, the antimicrobial agents prescribed, if any, and the clinical outcome. MIC testing revealed that 517/993 (52.1%) isolates were susceptible to penicillin and 946/993 (95.3%) were susceptible to oxacillin. The induced nitrocefin test was 100% sensitive and specific for the detection of β-lactamase compared to the blaZ PCR results, whereas the penicillin disk zone edge and cloverleaf tests showed sensitivities of 100% but specificities of only 9.1% and 89.1%, respectively. The penicillin MIC test had 100% categorical agreement with blaZ PCR, while penicillin disk diffusion yielded one major error. Only 3/31 patients with penicillin-susceptible isolates were treated with a penicillin family antimicrobial. The majority of cases were treated with other β-lactams, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or vancomycin. These data indicate that nearly all isolates of S. lugdunensis are susceptible to narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Clinical laboratories in areas with resistance levels similar to those described here can help promote the use of these agents versus vancomycin by effectively designing their antimicrobial susceptibility reports to convey this message.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^117GpKpZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clumping factor was not present and tube coagulase test results were negative. Identification was initially attempted with the gram-positive identification card provided with the VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The large hemolytic morphotype (Figure 1B) showed a profile consistent with S. lugdunensis, with positive results for ornithine decarboxylase, trehalose, and l-pyrrolidonyl-β-naphthylamide. Other morphotypes were repeatedly identified as S. haemolyticus (Figure 1C; T index 0.93) and S. auricularis (Figure 1D and E; T index 0.46), respectively. The S. lugdunensis isolate that grew as tiny (pinpoint), nonpigmented, and nonhemolytic colonies was shown to be a hemin-auxotrophic SCV (Figure 1 E). The S. lugdunensis isolate (large colony morphotype) was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents in the VITEK GPS-P526 card test (bioMérieux) and did not produce β-lactamase. The other morphotypes did not grow sufficiently to allow antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK system. However, susceptibility to penicillin and oxacillin was confirmed by an Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) for all colony variants.

The API ID 32 Staph system (bioMérieux) identified all morphotypes as S. lugdunensis, which was later confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing using the RIDOM entries. All isolates, including an additional S. lugdunensis blood isolate obtained in February 2003 that produced flat, white, and nonhemolytic colonies (Figure 1A), were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and found to be identical, although the colony morphology was different (Figure 2).

### VISLISI trial, a prospective clinical study allowing identification of a new metalloprotease and putative virulence factor from Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^111upebM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that displays an unusually high virulence rate close to that of Staphylococcus aureus. It also shares phenotypic properties with S. aureus and several studies found putative virulence factors. The objective of the study was to describe the clinical manifestations of S. lugdunensis infections and investigate putative virulence factors.

Method

We conducted a prospective study from November 2013 to March 2016 at the University Hospital of Strasbourg. Putative virulence factors were investigated by clumping factor detection, screening for proteolytic activity, and sequence analysis using tandem nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Results

In total, 347 positive samples for S. lugdunensis were collected, of which 129 (37.2%) were from confirmed cases of S. lugdunensis infection. Eighty-one of these 129 patients were included in the study. Bone and prosthetic joints (PJI) were the most frequent sites of infection (n = 28; 34.6%) followed by skin and soft tissues (n = 23; 28.4%). We identified and purified a novel protease secreted by 50 samples (61.7%), most frequently associated with samples from deep infections and PJI (pr 0.97 and pr 0.91, respectively). Protease peptide sequencing by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a novel protease bearing 62.42% identity with ShpI, a metalloprotease secreted by Staphylococcus hyicus.

Conclusion

This study confirms the pathogenicity of S. lugdunensis, particularly in bone and PJI. We also identified a novel metalloprotease called lugdulysin that may contribute to virulence.

IDSA 2015 native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — image-guided aspiration biopsy or blood cultures: We recommend an image-guided aspiration biopsy in patients with suspected NVO (based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies) when a microbiologic diagnosis for a known associated organism (S. aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and Brucella species) has not been established by blood cultures or serologic tests (strong, low). We advise against performing an image-guided aspiration biopsy in patients with S. aureus, S. lugdunensis, or Brucella species bloodstream infection suspected of having NVO based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging studies (strong, low). We advise against performing an image-guided aspiration biopsy in patients with suspected subacute NVO (high endemic setting) and strongly positive Brucella serology (strong, low).

### Metalware-associated orthopaedic infections caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis: an emerging pathogen [^116XP4Y7]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1
S. lugdunensis and S. aureus as a cause of knee and hip prosthetic joint infections (PJI) in a UK cohort over two years from April 2014. A: Absolute case numbers and relative contributions of the two organisms to knee and hip PJI. Percentages shown on black bars indicate proportion of all cases that are associated with knee infection. P-value by Fisher's Exact Test. B: Age distribution of patients with S. lugdunensis and S. aureus. Horizontal lines indicate median. P-value by Mann–Whitney test.

None of the 68 S. lugdunensis isolates demonstrated resistance to glycopeptides, daptomycin, oxacillin, rifampicin, clindamycin or linezolid, but 14 isolates from 4 different patients were found to demonstrate in vitro resistance to at least one antistaphylococcal agent (co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, fucidic acid, gentamicin); Suppl. data table 3.

Details of antibiotic therapy are shown in Suppl. data table 1. Following the immediate postoperative period, nine patients continued with intravenous therapy for a median of six weeks (glycopeptide or ceftriaxone, at the discretion of the infectious diseases/microbiology consultant). A variety of oral treatment strategies were employed, with the most common being dual therapy with ciprofloxacin and rifampicin (n = 8). Therapy duration ranged from 6 to 21 weeks for 15 patients, whilst three underwent a strategy of longer term suppressive therapy on the grounds that infected metalware could not be removed or adequately debrided. We were unable to determine the antibiotic strategy retrospectively for two patients.

Follow up data were available for 16 patients (at median 118 days following operation/initiation of antimicrobials, range 43–583 days), of whom 15 (94%) had no reported evidence of ongoing or recurrent infection. One patient was found to have a minimally symptomatic persistent fracture non-union and a decision was made to continue with a suppressive strategy, without further surgery. Outcome data were unavailable for the remaining four patients, probably due to transfer out of area. There was no difference between infection outcomes for patients receiving intravenous followed by oral antimicrobial strategies, when compared to those treated with oral antimicrobials alone, although a substantially larger prospective study is required to determine whether oral therapy is non-inferior. The active approach to thorough surgical debridement in the majority of cases, together with the susceptibility data of S. lugdunensis is in keeping with the good clinical outcomes.

### The occurrence of infective endocarditis with Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacteremia: a retrospective cohort study and systematic review [^112ULuyj]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus with similar virulence characteristics as Staphylococcus aureus. Whether S. lugdunensis causes infective endocarditis (IE) in a similar proportion of cases as S. aureus (reported to be 12.6% in a definitive multicenter prospective study) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with at least one blood culture positive for S. lugdunensis at our institution from January 2006 to December 2014. We examined microbiology data, ascertained disease severity and determined the proportion of patients with definite or possible IE based on the 2000 Modified Duke Criteria. Because coagulase-negative staphylococci were routinely identified to the species level at our institution from 2012 onwards, we determined the proportion of patients with definite or possible IE before and after implementation of routine speciation. We also compared our results with reported proportions of IE among patients with S. lugdunensis bacteremia (SLB) in other institutions by conducting a systematic review of the scientific literature. Nonparametric bootstrapping methods were performed to determine 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions of IE in patients with SLB.

Results

Seventy-four patients with SLB were identified, of whom 64% (47/74) had sepsis by SIRS criteria, and 18% (13/74) had severe illness by Pittsburgh bacteremia score (PBS). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that one-year survival among patients with severe illness was worse than patients with non-severe illness (p = 0.02). Fifteen percent (11/74) of patients had definite or possible IE (95% CI 6.8–23.0%). The proportion of SLB patients with definite or possible IE was 15.8% (6/38, 95% CI 5.3–28.9%) prior to routine speciation and 13.9% (5/36, 95% CI 2.8–27.8%) after routine speciation (p = 0.71). Among patients with at least two positive blood cultures for S. lugdunensis, 25% (10/40, 95% CI 12.5–40.0%) had IE. Systematic review of the literature yielded eight relevant retrospective studies. Of studies that included patients with one or more positive blood cultures for S. lugdunensis, the proportion of IE ranged from 6.3% to 27.0%.

Conclusion

The proportion of definite or possible IE among patients with SLB is similar to the proportion of IE among patients with S. aureus bacteremia. The proportions of IE among patients with SLB at other institutions fall within the 95% CI yielded by bootstrapping. Our findings suggest that growth of S. lugdunensis in two separate blood cultures should prompt consideration of workup for IE.

True C acnes Infection Cohort

According to our definition, C acnes was considered to be a causative pathogen in eight patients who had at least one positive C acnes culture, whereas the other 40 culture-positive patients were considered indeterminate (subclinical infection or contaminated) by C acnes. In the subset of true C acnes infections, two were monoinfections and six were coinfections with an additional organism (Figure 1). The additional organisms identified included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Group B Streptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus.

Figure 1
Patient flowchart.

The true C acnes infections occurred in patients undergoing the following procedures: two thigh sarcoma resections, two lipoma resections, two groin sarcoma resections, one total hip revision, and one implant removal. In the true infection group, six of the eight patients underwent repeat surgery for irrigation and débridement for infection treatment. All patients who underwent a second surgery for infection treatment were classified as coinfections. The two true C acnes monoinfections were in patients undergoing removal of implants and lipoma excision. Both were treated with a short course (10 days) of doxycycline and required no additional surgical intervention.

The postoperative complications identified in the true infection group of patients included revision total hip arthroplasty due to coinfection of S aureus and C acnes, cellulitis after lipoma resection that subsequently resolved with oral antibiotics, and abscess formation after soft-tissue sarcoma and lipoma resections.

Local inflammatory signs were present in 6 of the 8 patients (75%) meeting the criteria for true C acnes infections. The white blood cell count, CRP, and ESR were elevated in only 2 of the 8 patients with true C acnes infection (25%). Of the two true monoinfections, one patient showed local incisional cellulitis postoperatively; however, neither patient had elevated inflammatory laboratory findings.

Comparison of True C acnes Infection and Indeterminate (Subclinical Infection or Contaminant) Cohorts

Implants

In total, 42 surgeries were conducted with orthopaedic implants that included either implantation or removal of implant. In both cohorts, a total of six procedures (12.5%) included orthopaedic implants. In patients classified as suspected true C acnes infection, 1 of the 8 patients (12.5%) underwent surgery that included orthopaedic implants. In the indeterminate group, 5 of the 40 patients (12.5%) underwent a procedure with implants involved. No notable difference was found between the two groups.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^114SVnuT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The refusal of the patient to have the pacemaker removed added to the chronic course of the infection. Although these variants were not identified until removal of the device, the clinical importance of SCVs for this persistent infection can be anticipated. Clinical isolates are often a mixed population of parent strains and SCVs. Because of their different generation times, even a small percentage of normally growing organisms may rapidly replace SCVs in liquid medium such as a blood culture during overnight incubation. Thus, SCVs may have gone undetected in previously obtained blood cultures. Increased awareness of colony variation and the possible occurrence of SCVs as a characteristic feature of S. lugdunensis should be helpful in earlier recognition of the pathogen and appropriate management of the infection.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis abscesses complicating molluscum contagiosum in two children [^114RTSP7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

We report the occurrence of Staphylococcus lugdunensis abscesses in two girls with molluscum contagiosum who both required surgical intervention under general anaesthesia. S. lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus recently recognized as an emerging human pathogen. Because of its ubiquitous nature and the high prevalence of molluscum contagiosum in children, it is likely that this as yet unreported association may be underestimated, thus raising the question as to whether bacterial culture of superinfected mollusca should be obtained more often.

### Osteomyelitis of the ear canal caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^1151UBHU]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis of the temporal bone caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis has never been reported before. This infection was diagnosed in a 51-year-old diabetic man. S. lugdunensis is an unusually virulent coagulase negative staphylococcus and has been implicated in a variety of severe infections. Considering the serious morbidity and mortality associated with osteomyelitis and in particular with S. lugdunensis, special awareness and alertness are required when otitis externa, which predisposes to osteomyelitis, is refractory to treatment.

### Endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^1175aqB8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a case of native valve endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a perineal skin commensal, and review 28 other cases from the medical literature. Correctly identifying this coagulase-negative organism is critical because endocarditis is usually associated with left sided valvular disruption and life-threatening embolic complications, reminiscent of disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Urgent surgical intervention is necessary in most cases.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis in several niches of the normal skin flora [^111CaYwR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS). Its pathogenicity and virulence are more similar to Staphylococcus aureus than to a CNS. It causes severe infections with high mortality, such as endocarditis, but more often painful and prolonged skin- and soft-tissue infections. Little is known of its normal habitat. Whether it is an integral part of the normal skin flora like many other CNS has been questioned, since it is rarely seen in blood cultures. This study was designed to determine whether S. lugdunensis has a niche in the normal skin flora and to compare S. lugdunensis and S. aureus in these niches. From 75 healthy subjects in Kronoberg County, Sweden, 525 swabs were obtained from the nose, axilla, perineum, groin, breast, toe and nail bed of the first toe. Significantly more of the 525 skin samples as well as of the 75 healthy subjects yielded S. lugdunensis (50/75) as opposed to S. aureus.(16/75). Swabs from the nose frequently yielded S. aureus, but only rarely S. lugdunensis. Swabs from the groin and the lower extremities, especially the nail bed of the first toe, often yielded S. lugdunensis but rarely S. aureus. This study shows that S. lugdunensis is an integral part of the normal skin flora, primarily of the lower abdomen and extremities, and that the niches of this coagulase-negative staphylococcus are distinctly different from those of S. aureus. The predominant niches of S. lugdunensis explain why the bacterium is an uncommon contaminant of blood cultures.

### The impact of two-component sensorial network in staphylococcal speciation [^116SLZLo]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and future directions

S. aureus and S. saprophyticus have been classified as high and medium-pathogenic staphylococci, respectively. Medium-pathogenic staphylococci are more specialized in their infective strategies and cause a narrow spectrum of diseases. The reduced number of TCSs is not by itself the reason for a lower pathogenic capacity because many other medium-pathogenic staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. lugdunensis, S. haemolyticus and S. pseudointermedius) have at least the same number of TCSs as S. aureus. Instead, the number of TCSs correlates with the presence/absence of those genes encoding for metabolic pathways necessary to adapt bacterial growth to the hostile environment of the host and to harmonize their expression. A question that remains open is whether the common staphylococcal ancestor contained the sixteen TCSs and S. saprophyticus suffered genome reduction events during evolution or alternatively, the staphylococcal ancestor contained a lower number of TCSs and S. saprophyticus, contrary to other staphylococcal species, did not gain additional TCSs. The mechanisms of TCS acquisition/loss during bacterial evolution have been theoretically predicted but they have not been experimentally addressed. Hence, an effort that considers long-term experiments, in which bacteria gain a selective advantage through the acquisition/loss of a TCS would provide insights into how adaptation to different niches was established over evolutionary time.

### Clinical significance of coagulase-negative staphylococci recovered from nonsterile sites [^1151nJzz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory criteria were used to select coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from nonsterile body sites for further investigation. Fifty-seven percent of the study isolates were clinically significant, predominantly causing community-acquired soft tissue infections. There were species-related differences in virulence, with 91% of Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates clinically significant compared with 11% of S. haemolyticus isolates.

### Make modern microbiology matter more in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis [^115NhkzD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria for IE do not make use of the improvements in species determination of bacteria, in particular, streptococci, that have occurred since the first publication of the Duke criteria in 1994. For example, it has become evident that patients with bacteremia with streptococci of the mutans, bovis, or sanguinis groups often have IE, whereas patients with bacteremia caused by anginosus group streptococci rarely have IE. In addition, several pathogens are not mentioned in the ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria despite having a propensity similar to that of Staphylococcus aureus or "oral streptococci" to cause IE. Such bacterial genera and species include Abiotrophia, Aerococcus, Corynebacterium striatum, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and these should all be regarded as typical pathogens. Some of these pathogens are recognized as typical IE pathogens in the Duke–ISCVID criteria.

An entire section (5.3.1) of the ESC guidelines describes standard blood culture practices, which is of limited interest to the clinician and of no use for laboratory personnel. In particular, the guidelines recommend drawing blood cultures at a 30-minute interval, referring to Lamy et al. This reference states that "a 30–60 min interval between samples has been arbitrarily recommended" and that "Li et al (1994) found no difference in blood culture yield whether samples were collected within a 24-h period, either simultaneously or serially", which does not support the recommendation of continued use of the arbitrary sampling interval. It is very impractical to wait between blood cultures, and such a recommendation necessitates firm evidence, which is lacking. What is not mentioned but would have been useful for the reader of the guidelines is that a short time to blood culture positivity in S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia is associated with increased risk of IE; positive blood cultures drawn at 48–72 hours after the initiation of antibiotic treatment is associated with increased likelihood of IE; and Cutibacterium acnes, a not uncommon cause of prosthesis valve IE, grows slowly; therefore, incubation is longer than the standard 120 hours, increasing the likelihood of finding this pathogen.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis infections: high frequency of inguinal area carriage [^117KVt8K]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Following a change in surgical practice, we noted that the rate at which Staphylococcus lugdunensis was isolated from samples from the plastic surgery unit of our hospital increased considerably. We investigated the sources of these S. lugdunensis strains, and we found that in the case of drain colonization or surgical site infection, the strain was more likely to have come from the patient's skin bacteria when the pubic site had been shaved preoperatively. To test the hypothesis of pubic site colonization, we evaluated the prevalence of S. lugdunensis carriage among the cutaneous flora of the inguinal area. We found that 22% of 140 incoming patients carried S. lugdunensis in this area and that carriage at both inguinal folds was frequent (68% of carriers). A study of the genetic structure of the total population, including the clinical (n = 18) and the commensal (n = 53) strains, revealed that the diversity of the species was low and that the population was composed of two major groups that diverged at a distance of 35%. No particular characteristics made it possible to distinguish between clinical and commensal strains. Only isolates producing beta-lactamase were homogeneous; six of the eight beta-lactamase-positive strains displayed the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^112PkRjs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We report the first known case of a device-related bloodstream infection involving Staphylococcus lugdunensis small-colony variants. Recurrent pacemaker-related bloodstream infection within a period of 10 months illustrates the poor clinical and microbiologic response even to prolonged antimicrobial drug therapy in a patient infected with this staphylococcal subpopulation.

### A prospective, multicenter, clinical study of duodenoscope contamination after reprocessing [^115rGRQL]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several clinical procedures utilize duodenoscopes, which are processed for reuse after the procedures are completed. However, infection outbreaks due to improper duodenoscope processing occur frequently. To address this, we aimed to assess the contamination rates of duodenoscopes after reprocessing in nonoutbreak settings.

Design and Setting

Prospective study in 16 clinical sites in the United States.

Methods

We sampled and cultured reprocessed duodenoscopes following the FDA/CDC/ASM guideline; "Duodenoscope Surveillance Sampling and Culturing - Reducing the Risks of Infection". High-concern (HC) organisms were those highly associated with disease, including gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, β-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp, and yeasts. We evaluated duodenoscopes with ≥ 1 CFU of organisms after reprocessing. The reprocessing environments were also sampled and cultured.

Results

We assessed 859 newer-model (NM) duodenoscopes (TJF-Q180V) and 850 older-model (OM) duodenoscopes (TJF-160F/VF); of these, 35 NM samples (4.1%) and 56 OM samples (6.6%) were contaminated with HC organisms. We detected and classified the HC organisms as gastrointestinal (45.4%), human origin (16.7%), environmental (24.1%), waterborne (13.0%), and unidentified (0.9%).

Conclusions

We detected an overall HC contamination rate of 5.3% in nonoutbreak settings. Although the relationship between endoscopic contamination and the occurrence of infections remains unclear, attempts should continue to be made to further reduce contamination rates. Additional improvements to the manufacturer's instructions for use, human factors during the reprocessing procedure, ongoing training programs, cleanliness of reprocessing environments, and the design of the distal end of the duodenoscope should be considered.

### Acute necrotizing sinusitis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^117G7kpY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is most commonly associated with infections arising from the inguinal region, but here we report this organism as a cause of bacterial sinusitis, highlighting its potential niche as a commensal of the upper airways. The severity of necrosis demonstrates the potential for destructive pathology mimicking Staphylococcus aureus disease.
