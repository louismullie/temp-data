## Question

Thyroid level at 4.9

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a TSH of 4.9 mIU/L, and what the next steps should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the laboratory abnormality and ruling out transient causes. Then, I should verify whether free T4 is normal to classify subclinical versus overt hypothyroidism. Next, I will consider risk stratification by TSH tier, thyroid antibodies, age, and comorbidities. After that, I need to check special populations such as pregnancy, older adults, and reproductive-age women. Finally, I will synthesize a monitoring or treatment plan, and address patient counseling points, ensuring I do not jump to conclusions from a single value before confirming persistence over time [^114bqgrE] [^116vHLh6] [^116XK1nC].

> Let me first confirm the finding and avoid premature labeling; TSH can fluctuate by roughly 40–50% from day to day, and up to about half of individuals with a mildly elevated TSH revert to normal on retesting, so I should repeat a morning TSH in 3–6 months, ideally using the same assay and drawing at the same time of day, before making a diagnosis or initiating therapy [^117Qttrs] [^114bqgrE] [^116vHLh6].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical context; I need a concurrent free T4 to distinguish subclinical hypothyroidism, which is elevated TSH with normal free T4, from overt hypothyroidism, which has elevated TSH with low free T4, and if the TSH is persistently abnormal I should add thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) to refine risk of progression and autoimmune etiology [^112wUhU4] [^1129gwkb].

> I will now examine the risk strata; with TSH around 4.9 mIU/L, this sits in the 4.5–10 mIU/L band where benefits of treatment are uncertain and observational data suggest limited or no clinical advantage to therapy in most adults, especially when TSH is under 10 mIU/L, so observation rather than immediate levothyroxine is appropriate in the absence of compelling indications [^111trvZ4] [^114LBMH9] [^111yYVBa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating everyone in this range; high-quality randomized trials, including the NEJM TRUST trial in older adults, show no improvement in symptoms, quality of life, or cardiovascular surrogate outcomes with levothyroxine in subclinical hypothyroidism, reinforcing a conservative, monitor-first approach when TSH is below 10 mIU/L [^1141nsSW] [^114LBMH9].

> Next, I should review who might warrant treatment despite TSH below 10; symptomatic patients with supportive clinical context, those with positive TPOAb, or individuals with established cardiovascular disease or heart failure are reasonable candidates for a monitored therapeutic trial, recognizing the evidence is mixed and decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making and careful attention to overtreatment risks [^1168sTdk] [^114LBMH9].

> I need to ensure I factor in age; in adults over about 65 years, many have physiologic TSH shifts upward, and multiple guidelines and cohort analyses suggest treatment thresholds around 7–10 mIU/L, with treatment often deferred below 7 mIU/L due to lack of symptomatic or cardiovascular benefit, so in older patients with TSH 4.9 mIU/L, observation is favored [^1156Pzrh] [^117Qttrs].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or trying to conceive; I should confirm pregnancy status and gestational timing because pregnancy lowers the TSH reference range, particularly in the first trimester, and in assisted reproduction some data suggest tighter thresholds, so thresholds near 2.5–4.0 mIU/L in early pregnancy may prompt consideration of treatment depending on antibody status and local reference intervals, and management should follow pregnancy-specific guidance [^1161vUCh] [^1127uEEh] [^115cJYMZ].

> Let me consider reproductive-age women without pregnancy; contemporary fertility guidelines emphasize using the laboratory's reference range to define the upper limit of normal rather than fixed low cutoffs, and they note no clear increase in miscarriage risk with TSH 2.5–4.0 mIU/L, so at 4.9 mIU/L I should individualize based on symptoms, antibodies, and clinical context rather than automatically treating [^1127uEEh] [^114VpXEJ].

> I should double-check modifiable contributors; medications like amiodarone, lithium, and others can elevate TSH, and acute illness or caloric intake timing can transiently suppress or shift TSH, so reviewing drugs, timing of phlebotomy, and recent intercurrent illness helps avoid misclassification and unnecessary treatment [^114bqgrE] [^114XqAtQ].

> Next, I should review what to monitor and when; if free T4 is normal and the patient is asymptomatic, I would recheck TSH in 3–6 months, then, if stable, annually, with earlier reassessment if symptoms emerge; if TSH trends upward and crosses 10 mIU/L or if free T4 becomes low, that shifts the balance toward treatment because progression risk rises and cardiovascular risk signals strengthen in that higher tier [^116vHLh6] [^113wCSHV] [^114p3NSf].

> Hold on, I should verify antibody implications; TPOAb positivity increases the likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism about 2.5-fold, so even at TSH 4.9 mIU/L, antibody-positive patients merit closer surveillance, whereas antibody-negative patients are more likely to revert and may be observed with less frequent follow-up if clinically well [^114p3NSf] [^112n7Goc].

> If treatment is ultimately indicated, I need to ensure dosing is conservative; typical starting doses for subclinical hypothyroidism are 25–50 mcg daily, adjusted to TSH and clinical response, with lower starts in older adults or those with coronary disease, and I should counsel about overtreatment risks including atrial fibrillation and bone loss if TSH is suppressed, aligning dosing with guideline targets rather than chasing very low TSH values [^111HEjaz] [^112JaoNb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said TSH is the "gold standard" for monitoring in all scenarios; let me reconsider and correct that — while TSH is the primary screening and titration marker in primary hypothyroidism, there are exceptions where free T4 better guides care, such as central hypothyroidism, pregnancy, or certain drug interactions, so I should tailor the test panel to the clinical scenario and not rely on TSH alone when the axis is atypical [^113Fad1b] [^117NAzVH].

> Finally, I should communicate clearly; at TSH 4.9 mIU/L with normal free T4, most adults do not benefit from levothyroxine, many normalize spontaneously, and a strategy of watchful waiting with repeat testing is evidence-based, with treatment reserved for specific high-risk features or clear symptomatic correlates after confirming persistence, using shared decision-making to weigh uncertain benefits against the burdens of lifelong therapy [^111trvZ4] [^114LBMH9] [^1117izyA].

---

A TSH of 4.9 mIU/L is a **mild elevation** and most often represents subclinical hypothyroidism [^117PVhnp], especially if free T4 is normal [^112wUhU4]. Confirm with a **repeat TSH and free T4** in 3–6 months, and check TPO antibodies to assess autoimmune risk [^116vHLh6] [^111Rqekd]. Treatment is **not routinely indicated** at this level; consider levothyroxine only if there are symptoms, positive antibodies, pregnancy plans, or persistent TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^1168sTdk] [^115ZWXFL]. Monitor annually if stable, and reassess sooner if symptoms or pregnancy occur [^111TPnZE].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 4.9 mIU/L

A TSH of 4.9 mIU/L sits at the **upper end of normal** for most labs (0.4–4.5 mIU/L) and is best interpreted as subclinical hypothyroidism when free T4 is normal [^112wUhU4] [^111trvZ4]. This pattern reflects early thyroid failure with a compensatory TSH rise [^112VJzEn].

---

## Factors influencing TSH levels

Several factors can **modestly raise TSH**, so I should confirm persistence and context:

- **Age**: TSH rises with age; up to 12% of adults > 80 may have TSH > 4.5 mIU/L without disease [^117Qttrs].
- **Sex**: Women have higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease and elevated TSH [^115J4SoN].
- **Medications**: Amiodarone, lithium, and some psychotropics can elevate TSH [^113zg2w3].
- **Illness**: Acute or chronic illness can alter TSH, though usually downward [^113Fad1b].
- **Circadian variation**: TSH peaks overnight and falls by ~30% after breakfast; morning fasting samples improve consistency [^114XqAtQ].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Confirmatory testing

Repeat **TSH and free T4** in 3–6 months to confirm persistence and exclude transient causes [^114bqgrE] [^116vHLh6]. Concurrently measure **TPO antibodies** to assess autoimmune risk and guide follow-up [^114p3NSf].

---

### Clinical evaluation

Assess for fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and cognitive changes; symptoms are often nonspecific at this TSH level [^111mVjnY]. Also review medications, family history, and personal history of autoimmune disease to contextualize risk [^115hUpGH].

---

### Management guidelines

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L and normal free T4, observe and recheck annually if stable [^114LBMH9] [^111yYVBa].
- **Treatment**: Consider levothyroxine if symptoms are present, TPOAb is positive, pregnancy is planned, or TSH is persistently ≥ 10 mIU/L [^1168sTdk] [^115ZWXFL].
- **Dosing**: Start low (25–50 mcg) and titrate to normalize TSH, monitoring for overtreatment [^111HEjaz].

## Potential risks and benefits of treatment

### Benefits

Treatment may improve symptoms in those with true hypothyroid symptoms, though benefits are modest at TSH < 10 mIU/L [^notfound]. Therapy can **lower LDL** and total cholesterol when TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L or antibodies are positive [^116GJCRE]. In women planning pregnancy, treatment may reduce miscarriage and adverse outcomes, especially if TPOAb-positive [^1154Pv2t].

---

### Risks

Overtreatment can cause atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety, so TSH targets should be conservative [^111yYVBa]. Lifelong therapy and monitoring may be burdensome, particularly if symptoms are minimal [^114LBMH9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Annual **TSH monitoring** is reasonable if stable, with earlier checks if symptoms, pregnancy, or new medications arise [^111TPnZE]. Continue to reassess symptoms, cardiovascular risk, and medication effects at each visit [^1168sTdk].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

In pregnancy, the **first-trimester TSH upper limit is ~4.0 mIU/L**; a TSH of 4.9 mIU/L warrants close monitoring and often treatment if antibodies are positive or symptoms are present [^1161vUCh] [^1154Pv2t].

---

### Elderly patients

In older adults, TSH rises with age, and overtreatment is common; use conservative thresholds and **individualize treatment** [^1156Pzrh] [^117Qttrs].

---

A TSH of 4.9 mIU/L is a **mild, nonspecific abnormality** that most often reflects subclinical hypothyroidism. Confirm with repeat testing and TPO antibodies, assess symptoms and context, and reserve treatment for those with symptoms, positive antibodies, pregnancy plans, or TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L [^1168sTdk] [^115ZWXFL].

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152bLpf]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

As the number of subjects in the analysis increased, the superior associations with thyroid hormones did not diminish (Fig. 3), and similarly the system did not play a significant role (Fig. 4). In an analysis including the number of covariates in the original result, at higher numbers of covariates, the association of clinical parameters with TT3/fT3 levels was no longer significantly different from the association with TSH levels (Fig. 5).

FIG. 5.
Associations of thyroid hormone and TSH levels with clinical parameters according to number of covariates.

The basic analysis provided earlier ignores the many sources of dependence between the results reported in each study. To account for this, it was necessary to incorporate a random intercept for study in the model (p = 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶). There was still then a statistically significant effect of thyroid test in predicting the significance of results (p < 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶). Post hoc pairwise comparisons show that there was a statistically higher proportion of significant results for fT4 compared with TSH (p < 1 × 10⁻⁵), and also a statistically higher proportion of significant results for TT3/fT3 compared with TSH (p < 1 × 10⁻⁵). These results confirmed those illustrated in the earlier mentioned confidence interval plots. We found that the additional main effects of system, cohort size, and number of covariates again did not improve the predictive effect of the model, compared with one with just a thyroid test (based on minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion). We found that a nested random effects structure of cohort within study was a statistically valid addition to the model, but it did not change the observed effects of the thyroid test on what has been cited earlier.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1143FMWs]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — therapeutic endpoints and TSH targets indicate that the most reliable therapeutic endpoint for primary hypothyroidism is the serum TSH value, since confirmatory total T4, free T4, and T3 lack sufficient specificity as stand-alone endpoints; when serum TSH is within the normal range, free T4 will also be normal, whereas T3 may be in the lower reference range and occasionally mildly subnormal. The normal TSH range with an upper limit of 4.12 mIU/L is largely based on NHANES III, but some propose an upper normal of 2.5 or 3.0 mIU/L because the distribution is skewed by values between 3.1 and 4.12 mIU/L and mean/median are approximately 1.5 mIU/L; however, measurements vary up to 50% above and below the mean, and setting 2.5 mIU/L as the upper normal could yield more than 10 million additional diagnoses per year in the United States without clear-cut benefit.

### Thyroid function within the reference range and the risk of stroke: an individual participant data analysis [^116v5UNG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

The currently applied reference ranges for thyroid function are under debate. Despite evidence that thyroid function within the reference range is related with several cardiovascular disorders, its association with the risk of stroke has not been evaluated previously.

Design and Setting

We identified studies through a systematic literature search and the Thyroid Studies Collaboration, a collaboration of prospective cohort studies. Studies measuring baseline TSH, free T 4, and stroke outcomes were included, and we collected individual participant data from each study, including thyroid function measurements and incident all stroke (combined fatal and nonfatal) and fatal stroke. The applied reference range for TSH levels was between 0.45 and 4.49 mIU/L.

Results

We collected individual participant data on 43 598 adults with TSH within the reference range from 17 cohorts, with a median follow-up of 11.6 years (interquartile range 5.1–13.9), including 449 908 person-years. Age- and sex-adjusted pooled hazard ratio for TSH was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.95 across the reference range of TSH) for all stroke and 0.83 (95% CI 0.62–1.09) for fatal stroke. For the free T 4 analyses, the hazard ratio was 1.08 (95% CI 0.99–1.15 per SD increase) for all stroke and 1.10 (95% CI 1.04–1.19) for fatal stroke. This was independent of cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking, and prevalent diabetes.

Conclusion

Higher levels of TSH within the reference range may decrease the risk of stroke, highlighting the need for further research focusing on the clinical consequences associated with differences within the reference range of thyroid function.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Qttrs]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — serum TSH interpretation and reference ranges: TSH levels vary diurnally by up to approximately 50% of mean values, with up to 40% variation on serial same-time specimens, tending to be lowest in the late afternoon and highest around the hour of sleep; thus within-normal-range fluctuations of up to 40%-50% do not necessarily reflect a change in thyroid status. In population data, the NHANES III disease-free population places the upper normal TSH level at 4.5 mIU/L, while a more restricted reference population had an upper normal value of 4.12 mIU/L. Further analyses reported 97.5th percentile TSH values as low as 3.24 for African Americans aged 30–39 years and as high as 7.84 for Mexican Americans > 80 years of age, with the 97.5th percentile increasing by 0.3 mIU/L for every 10-year age increase after 30–39 years. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemists indicated that 95% of individuals without thyroid disease have TSH concentrations below 2.5 mIU/L, and it has been suggested that the upper limit of the TSH reference range be lowered to 2.5 mIU/L. In individuals without serologic evidence of AITD, elderly (> 80 years) had a 23.9% prevalence of TSH values between 2.5 and 4.5 mIU/L and a 12% prevalence above 4.5 mIU/L.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116GJCRE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) — lipids and cardiovascular risk: Across included studies, 82% defined SCH as normal T4 with TSH 5–10 mIU/L and 18% as normal T4 with TSH 10 to 20 mIU/L; SCH cohorts generally show lipid abnormalities, with higher total cholesterol and LDL-C reported even when TSH < 10 mIU/L, though some studies find elevations only when TSH > 10 mIU/L. Lipid levels decrease after levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, with an Endocrine Society meta-analysis showing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG after LT4 while lipids did not change in untreated SCH. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data indicate increased CV events at TSH > 10 mIU/L; overall stroke risk was not increased for adults with SCH (TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L) but was significantly higher in those younger than 65 years, and across TSH 4.5 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and 10–19.9 mIU/L, fatal stroke rose with higher TSH without a significant trend. An individual participant meta-analysis (11 studies; 55 287 adults, including 3450 with SCH) found increased CVD risk with TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L but not at lower TSH; CHD mortality was increased for TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L and 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, reaching statistical significance only in the higher TSH group.

### Optimal thyrotropin level: normal ranges and reference intervals are not equivalent [^111fnSEQ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^111BvPEu]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — TSH target ranges for treatment: In nonpregnant patients, the target range should be within the normal range, and data are lacking to support targeting low normal or subnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. If third-generation assay normal limits are unavailable, use the NHANES III reference population range of 0.45–4.12. In pregnancy, there are no prospective trials establishing optimal target TSH ranges, and the lower range of normal for serum TSH in pregnancy is generally 0.1–0.2 mIU/L lower than the normal range for nonpregnant individuals.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PVhnp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### The change in thyroid function categories with time in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Rqekd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Overall, in this systematic review of 8 studies involving 1,859 participants, many patients maintained persistent SCH (45.4%) or returned to EU (44.4%) during the study period, while 10.1% of patients progressed to OH. This indicates that the natural outcome of SCH in the general population is relatively favorable and further underscores the importance of distinguishing high-risk individuals for targeted treatment.

In 1995, the Whickham survey recorded the prevalence of thyroid diseases in adult populations in the community, suggesting that elevated TSH and positive antibodies may be risk factors for the progression of hypothyroidism. Another 13-year longitudinal study also confirmed that TSH levels combined with thyroid antibodies can provide a clinically useful assessment of the long-term risk of hypothyroidism. However, considering the substantial variability in TSH levels, the controversy surrounding the use of TSH measurements for diagnosing SCH remains a significant concern. A five-year network follow-up study was conducted in 2007 and found that over 50% of patients with elevated or decreased serum TSH levels exhibited normal levels during repeated measurements. Our results verified that patients with TSH ≥ 10mU/L were more prone to disease progression. In addition, compared to TPOAb-negative patients, TPOAb-positive patients were more likely to progress to OH. Therefore, in TPOAb-negative patients with TSH ranging from 4.5 to 9.9mU/L, monitoring may not be as frequent due to the low rate of progression to OH. However, we found no association between gender and SCH outcomes, which is consistent with some studies, but further validation is needed in future research. To enhance the precision of patient management, it is recommended to engage in repeated monitoring of TSH levels before initiating treatment. Additionally, since TSH levels are influenced by diurnal rhythms, peaking between 11 PM and 4 AM and subsequently reaching low and stable serum levels after 11 in the morning, future follow-up studies should strive to ensure consistency in TSH measurement times as much as possible. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of research in this field, it is crucial to emphasize the changes in FT4 levels during disease progression. Among the studies we included, only a few mentioned this aspect, and due to data inconsistencies, we were unable to perform a categorized analysis. This stands as a significant limitation of our article. We eagerly anticipate that future research endeavors will prioritize the assessment of FT4 variations alongside TSH, thereby contributing new evidence to this area.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

Analytical performance specifications (APS) and biological variation — TSH and fT4: To prevent inaccurate measurements affecting clinical decision making, analytical performance specifications (APSs) have been established to safeguard assay performance, and specifically the APS model based on biological variation seeks to limit the analytical variability of a test relative to the biological variability; the biological variation of TSH is much wider than that of fT4, therefore the desirable APSs for bias and imprecision of TSH are significantly larger than those for fT4; Table 4 reports within-subject biological variation for TSH as 18 (15–29) and between-subject biological variation as 36 (24–48), and for fT4 within-subject biological variation as 4.8 (4.8–9.5) and between-subject biological variation as 7.7 (7.5–12.1), with 95% confidence interval of estimate in parentheses.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals [^1156Pzrh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism, which is defined as a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration higher than the reference range (generally 4.5 mIU/L or higher) with normal free thyroxine concentrations, is frequently found in older individuals. International guidelines differ in recommendations for management of subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals. We assessed published data during the past decade on the clinical significance and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in individuals aged 65 years and older. Meta-analyses, randomised clinical trials, and cohort studies are discussed in this narrative Review. Studies showed no significantly increased incidence in adverse cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, or cognitive outcomes in individuals aged 65 years or older when serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration was 4.5–7.0 mIU/L versus a euthyroid group. Moreover, in older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism, symptoms of hypothyroidism and cardiac and bone parameters did not improve after levothyroxine treatment. These data suggest that treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for individuals aged 65 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism when thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is persistently 7 mIU/L or higher and to not initiate treatment with thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations of less than 7 mIU/L. Levothyroxine doses should be personalised according to age, comorbidities, and life expectancy.

### The change in thyroid function categories with time in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114p3NSf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is characterized by elevated levels of thyroid hormone (TSH) and normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4). The outcomes of SCH patients are crucial for determining treatment plans; therefore, our aim is to summarize the existing prospective studies to understand the changes in thyroid function over time in SCH patients and the factors influencing these changes, providing references for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for prospective follow-up studies on natural outcomes of SCH published until September 2024. Results are presented as the overall risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results

We reviewed 8 prospective follow-up studies involving 1,859 individuals and extracted data from them for a meta-analysis. We found that when TSH levels are ≥ 10 mU/L, patients with SCH are more likely to progress to overt hypothyroidism (OH) (RR11.38, 95%CI 4.98–26.03, P < 0.001) and were less likely to return to normal TSH levels (RR 0.20, 95%CI 0.09–0.42, P < 0.001) compared to patients with TSH between 4.5 and 9.9 mU/L. In addition, patients who test positive for thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are more likely to progress to OH (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.86–3.44, P < 0.001) and less likely to return to euthyroidism (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60–0.76, P < 0.001) compared to TPOAb-negative patients.

Conclusion

The results indicated that a large proportion of patients diagnosed with SCH will return to normal TSH levels or maintain SCH. Additionally, patients with TSH levels ≥ 10 mU/L or positive for TPOAb are more likely to experience progression and should be closely monitored. However, we did not find any gender differences in the natural outcome of SCH.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^116FXEuQ]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association guideline — T4 measurement and FT4 index as alternatives (Recommendation 3) states that in lieu of measuring FT4, total thyroxine (T4) measurement with a pregnancy-adjusted reference range is a highly reliable means of estimating hormone concentration during the last part of pregnancy, and accurate estimation of FT4 can also be done by calculating a FT4 index. Measurement of T4 and the calculated FT4 index show the expected inverse relationship with serum TSH. During normal pregnancy, total T4 increases from weeks 7–16, ultimately reaching ~50% above the prepregnancy level; a clinically acceptable upper range can be calculated by shifting the nonpregnant limit 50% higher after week 16, or before that (weeks 7–16) by increasing the nonpregnant upper reference limit by 5% per week beginning with week 7, for example at 11 weeks the upper reference range is increased by 20% (4 weeks x 5%/week). Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

Hypothyroidism — treatment thresholds and pregnancy exception: Patients with primary hypothyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels above 10 mIU/L should be treated, whereas which patients with TSH levels of 4.5–10 mIU/L will benefit is less certain; there are virtually no clinical outcome data to support treating patients with subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH levels between 2.5 and 4.5 mIU/L, with a possible exception in pregnancy where the rate of pregnancy loss before 20 weeks and stillbirth after 20 weeks has been reported increased in anti-thyroid antibody-negative women with TSH values between 2.5 and 5.0.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: state-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^116z4rxm]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

1.9 Suggested follow‐up of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear feature lesions

Cases of NIFTP represent a new thyroid tumor diagnostic category introduced in 2016 and long‐term prospective follow‐up of patients with these tumors does not exist. Therefore, our clinical suggestions are based in large part on expert opinion and retrospective case‐control studies rather than prospective trials.

The diagnosis of NIFTP should not be based on retrospective interpretation of written pathologic reports created before May of 2016. The pathologic rendering of a diagnosis of NIFTP requires that the entire tumor be available for sectioning and that the whole specimen is evaluated for presence of papillary architecture or evidence of capsular or vascular invasion. Such an evaluation is time‐consuming but necessary for accurate diagnosis and meaningful prospective data collection.

The suggestions below are no substitute for the evidence‐based, individualized, clinical judgement of a physician caring for a unique patient with thyroid nodular disease.

Based on the significant lack of tumor recurrence in several retrospectively analyzed NIFTP cohorts, 7, 24, 25 patients with resected solitary NIFTP tumors should require less active follow‐up than that recommended for patients with "low‐risk recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer" in the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines. 26 Measurement of yearly quantitative thyroglobulin in patients with NIFTP is also appropriate, with expected values 6 weeks after surgery < 5 ng/mL for total thyroidectomy patients and levels < 30 ng/mL for lobectomy patients, in the absence of thyroglobulin antibodies. 27 Single thyroglobulin measurements are of less value than mapping the thyroglobulin trend over 3 or more data points. Maintenance of thyroid‐stimulating hormone in the normal range should be sufficient. If significant thyroid tissue remains in the neck, as documented by a 6‐week post‐total thyroidectomy serum thyroglobulin concentration in excess of 5, a neck ultrasound examination should be considered every 1 to 2 years for the first decade after surgery to evaluate residual thyroid tissue and lymph node architecture and size.

The NIFTP tumors are currently viewed as thyroid cancer precursors and frequently present with microcarcinomas and macrocarcinomas elsewhere in the thyroid. 28 Therefore, when there is multifocal tumor associated with an NIFTP lesion, follow‐up frequency and intensity should be based on the coexisting malignant lesion with the highest risk, as assessed by pathologic evaluation of all excised tissue.

T4 measurement — free versus total: T4 is the main hormone exclusively produced and secreted by the thyroid gland (T4 to T3 ratio in thyroglobulin is ∼10:1), while the majority of T3 (∼80%) is generated in extrathyroidal tissues. Circulating TH concentrations are affected by serum TH binding proteins, and serum fT4 should be measured in preference to T4 despite its very low fraction of T4 (0.03%).

### The TSH upper reference limit: where are we at? [^113kszhz]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism — serum TSH levels above and T(4) levels within the laboratory reference ranges — depends critically on the upper limit of the TSH reference interval. Calls have been made to lower the current upper TSH reference limit of 4.0 mU/l to 2.5 mU/l to exclude patients with occult hypothyroidism. However, data from population studies do not indicate that the distribution of TSH is altered owing to inclusion of such individuals. The opposite suggestion has also been put forward; the TSH upper reference limit is often too low, especially in the elderly, in women and in white individuals, which may lead to unnecessary or even harmful therapy. Studies in elderly individuals have shown that although aging may be associated with increased TSH levels, paradoxically, overt hypothyroidism in this population may be associated with a less robust TSH response than in young individuals. This Review highlights the interindividual and intraindividual variability of TSH levels and discusses the current controversy that surrounds the appropriateness of reference ranges defined on the basis of age, race, sex and amount of iodine intake. Moreover, the current evidence on lowering or increasing the upper limit of the TSH reference interval is reviewed and the need to individualize levothyroxine treatment in patients with elevated TSH levels is discussed.

### Serum CA 19–9 and CA 72–4 levels in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a prospective case-control study [^113SBG5t]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, levothyroxine replacement improved thyroid function and was associated with a significant reduction in CA 19 − 9 levels among those who achieved euthyroidism. These findings suggest that fluctuations in CA 19 − 9 might not only indicate malignancy but could potentially be associated with autoimmune-mediated inflammation or regenerative responses linked to thyroid tissue injury and remodeling. Therefore, careful interpretation of this biomarker is necessary to prevent unnecessary diagnostic interventions. Larger, multicenter studies with longer follow-up are warranted to understand better the clinical importance and potential utility of CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 in autoimmune thyroid disorders.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

Fetal thyroid function across gestation — cord sampling data indicate the mean fetal serum T4 is 2 μg/dL (26 nmol/L) at 12 weeks, with fetal FT4 increasing and typically reaching values comparable to nonpregnant females (10 μg/dL [138 nmol/L]) by 36 weeks; owing to up-regulation of the TSH receptor, fetal FT4 increases from approximately 0.1 ng/dL (1.3 pmol/L) to 2 ng/dL (25.7 pmol/L) beginning early in the third trimester. In contrast, fetal T3 is low, with fetal serum T3 approximately 0.9 ng/dL (0.09 nmol/L) at 12 weeks rising to 45 ng/dL (0.68 nmol/L) at 36 weeks, while brain T3 levels are 60%–80% those of the adult by fetal age 20–26 weeks. Fetal pituitary activity also evolves, with serum TSH rising from < 4 mIU/L at 12 weeks to 8 mIU/L at term.

### Association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B19e5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefit of thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain. New evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier from inception until July 4, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (eg, quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models for meta-analyses were applied.

Main Outcomes and Measures

General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms after a minimum follow-up of 3 months.

Results

Overall, 21 of 3088 initially identified publications met the inclusion criteria, with 2192 adults randomized. After treatment (range, 3–18 months), thyroid hormone therapy was associated with lowering the mean thyrotropin value into the normal reference range compared with placebo (range, 0.5–3.7 mIU/L vs 4.6 to 14.7 mIU/L) but was not associated with benefit regarding general quality of life (n = 796; SMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; I² = 66.7%) or thyroid-related symptoms (n = 858; SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.14; I² = 0.0%). Overall, risk of bias was low and the quality of evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was judged moderate to high.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, the use of thyroid hormone therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms. These findings do not support the routine use of thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^114wGc2M]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

### Reference intervals in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction: treating patients not numbers [^1117izyA]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on current clincial trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomised manner. Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target, and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JY1Hu]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We believe this is the first systematic review studying TSH and thyroid hormone associations with various clinical parameters. The results indicate that, contrary to the current paradigm, thyroid hormone levels are associated more strongly with clinical parameters than TSH levels. Any relationship of clinical parameters with TSH levels can be explained by the strong population relationship between thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, such that TSH levels are merely indirect measures of thyroid hormone levels.

In our sample, we found no indication of, or reference to, any work that suggested that TSH levels consistently indicate thyroid status of any organ or tissue more strongly than thyroid hormone levels.

As our goal was not to estimate the effect size for one treatment, our meta-analysis methodology differed from some other meta-analysis methodologies in that we did not use a weighted technique or pool all original patient data. In addition, it would not have been appropriate to combine all of these factors by using such meta-analysis methodology, as our analysis encompassed multiple studies covering various clinical outcomes, using different methodologies, different assays, and statistical methods.

Theoretically, one could use such other methodology to do a meta-analysis of each clinical parameter, but these individual meta-analyses would still need to be combined by using a method akin to ours (i.e. summing the meta-analyses in some way) to determine whether levels of thyroid hormones or TSH are more likely to be associated in general with clinical parameters. Further, in using such a technique of analysis, the information from many of the studies in our sample would be lost as the parameter/population/statistical method might not be amenable to pooling.

The results of the individual patient meta-analysis of AF do, in fact, support our conclusions, showing superior associations with fT4 levels than with TSH levels. Also supportive is a recently published similar meta-analysis of pre-term delivery, showing that fT4 levels are associated with the clinical parameter at least as well as TSH levels. One could even argue that the results of these two conventional meta-analyses alone disprove the general hypothesis that TSH levels provide a better guide to thyroid status than fT4 levels.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine considerations — thyroid function in bariatric surgery candidates: Patients evaluated for bariatric procedures have a significant burden of endocrine abnormalities, including hypothyroidism, and obesity-related TSH elevation leads to higher reference ranges by BMI class — underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m²), 0.6 to 4.8 uIU/mL; normal weight and overweight (BMI 20 to 29.9 kg/m²), 0.6 to 5.5 uIU/mL; obese (BMI 30 to 39.9 kg/m²), 0.5 to 5.9 uIU/mL; and severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), 0.7 to 7.5 uIU/mL; accordingly, TSH levels are therefore not recommended as a routine screen prior to bariatric procedures, and postoperatively thyroid hormone replacement or supplementation requirements may change due to body mass/volume changes, malabsorption, and variable GI absorption effects.

### Effects of calorie intake and sampling time on thyroid stimulating hormone concentration [^114XqAtQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) synthesized by the anterior pituitary gland, regulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, and is also subject to feedback regulation of thyroid hormone concentration. The guidelines of American and European thyroid associations have recommended using TSH level as the indicator to screen thyroid dysfunctions. The earliest changes in patients with primary thyroid diseases include alteration in TSH level. For instance, patients with subclinical thyroid dysfunctions are only show TSH level changes, characterized by TSH elevation in subclinical hypothyroidism and TSH reduction in subclinical hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, adverse maternal–fetal outcomes, and possible cardiovascular diseases. TSH is also the major indicator for deciding whether treatments should be initiated in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as for evaluating whether the intervention goal has been achieved. Therefore, accurately measuring TSH levels has critical clinical significance.

Previous studies have reported that TSH secretion and its blood level display a circadian rhythm. The relative amplitude (maximum absolute value of a periodically varying quantity) of TSH in one day can be as high as 36%. The variation of TSH during daytime is relatively small, but the food intake could influence the TSH level. However, there are no special guideline recommendations on the time of blood sampling for TSH concentration measurement, as well as fasting requirement. In addition, the sampling time and the fasting state in evaluating the reference range of thyroid hormone by laboratories are generally ignored in clinical practice. Analysis of clinical laboratory data has shown that blood samples were delivered from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm for TSH level measurement, and the distribution patterns of TSH concentrations measured at different times differ significantly. Our previous pilot studies (data not published) showed that the TSH level measured 2 h after breakfast (9:00 am), comparing with the fasting blood samples collected in the morning (7:00 am) was significantly reduced by about 30%, and there was a significant difference in the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism between the two sampling methods.

Due to the circadian rhythm of blood TSH levels, it is necessary to further investigate the difference blood TSH concentration between 7:00 am and 9:00 am after meal to determine whether it is influenced by the food intake or diurnal rhythm. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the influence of different food components on blood TSH levels. Therefore, this study explored the changing trend of blood TSH level in subjects after maintaining fasting state or after the intake of calories provided by different nutrients, compared with the morning fasting state.

Thyroid dysfunction screening — test interpretation and confirmation in asymptomatic adults indicates that accurate interpretation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is further complicated by measurement variability and conditions other than thyroid disease, and many professional groups recommend repeating thyroid function tests for confirmation of persistent dysfunction over 3- to 6-month intervals in asymptomatic persons before diagnosis or treatment unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^1141nsSW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of levothyroxine to treat subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial. We aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons with this condition.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was < 50 kg or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose adjustment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year (range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).

Results

The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. The mean (± SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40 ± 2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P < 0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2 ± 15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2 ± 14.4 in the levothyroxine group; between-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 2.1) or the Tiredness score (3.2 ± 17.7 and 3.8 ± 18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-outcome measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespecified as being of special interest.

Conclusions

Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. (Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660126 .).

### A longitudinal assessment of thyroid hormone concentrations in preterm infants younger than 30 weeks' gestation during the first 2 weeks of life and their relationship to outcome [^113Ahi29]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This trial examined the effects of triiodothyronine (T3) and hydrocortisone on lung disease. We present here the placebo data as this provides a natural history of thyroid hormone changes in this group of very preterm infants. We also examined the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and the outcome death and ventilator dependence at 2 weeks.

Methods

Plasma-free T3 (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total T3, total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured prospectively in preterm infants who were < 30 weeks' gestation during the first 14 days of life. The data were obtained from the placebo arm of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of T3 and hydrocortisone, called the THORN Trial.

Results

A total of 128 infants were recruited into the placebo group. The mean FT3 level at < 5 hours of age was 4.9 pmol/L and remained below this level. FT4 levels decreased from 15 pmol/L to 9.7 pmol/L at 7 days and then increased to 11.0 pmol/L by day 14. Total T3 and total T4 levels fell after 5 hours of age and reached a minimum on day 3. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels fell markedly from 9.2 mU/L to 1.8 mU/L at 72 hours and then increased to approximately 4 mU/L. We found that all thyroid hormones but particularly FT3 and FT4 hormones were highly significantly related to outcome. The lower the hormone levels, the worse the outcome (death or ventilator dependence at 2 weeks of age).

Conclusion

1) Thyroid hormone levels in preterm infants < 30 weeks were much lower than in term infants, 2) the postnatal surge of thyroid hormones normally seen at 24 to 48 hours of age in term infants did not occur in our group of preterm infant, and 3) low FT3 and FT4 levels are associated with higher mortality and severity of lung disease.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — risks of total thyroidectomy versus lobectomy: Total thyroidectomy carries significantly greater risk than thyroid lobectomy, with a meta-analysis showing higher pooled relative risk (RR) for complications including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (transient RR = 1.7, permanent RR = 1.9), hypocalcemia (transient RR = 10.7, permanent RR = 3.2), and hemorrhage/hematoma (RR = 2.6); surgeon experience likely influences risk, with higher volume surgeons having lower complication rates. Total thyroidectomy also increases the risk of postoperative clinically significant hypocalcemia, while lobectomy is associated with postoperative biochemical hypothyroidism estimated at 22% and clinical or overt hypothyroidism estimated at 4%; the risk of hypothyroidism after lobectomy increases with autoimmune thyroid disease or high normal/elevated TSH, and hypothyroidism is not an indication for thyroidectomy.

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^116N1bdo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study TRUST was published by Stott DJ and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Subclinical hypothyroidism and Hypothyroidism. In the TRUST study, the trial question was: what is the effect of levothyroxine in older patients with subclinical hypothyroidism? In the TRUST study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRUST study, the population was: 737 patients (396 female, 341 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients ≥ 65 years of age who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism, with thyrotropin level of 4.60–19.99 mlU/L and fT4 level within reference range. The key exclusion criteria were current prescription for levothyroxine, antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, or lithium, thyroid surgery or receipt of radioactive iodine within the previous 12 months, dementia, hospitalization for a major illness or an elective surgery within the previous 4 weeks, acute coronary syndrome within the previous 4 weeks, and terminal illness. In the TRUST study, the interventions were: n = 368 levothyroxine (starting dose of 50 mcg daily or 25 mcg if the body weight was < 50 kg or patient had coronary artery disease, with dose adjustment according to thyrotropin level) n = 369 placebo (mock dose adjustment). In the TRUST study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in change in Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 months (16.6 points vs. 16.7 points;). In the TRUST study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in change in Tiredness score at 12 months (3.8 points vs. 3.2 points; AD 0.4 points, 95% CI -2.1 to 2.9). In the TRUST study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in incidence of serious adverse events of special interest (AF, HF, fracture, or new diagnosis of osteoporosis). In the TRUST study, the conclusion was: in adult patients ≥ 65 years of age who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism, with thyrotropin level of 4.60–19.99 mlU/L and fT4 level within reference range, levothyroxine was not superior to placebo with respect to change in Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 months.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^116K4S2Y]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in reproductive-age women — definition, prevalence, and evidence scope are outlined as follows: The classic definition of SCH is a thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) level greater than the upper limit of the normal range (4.5–5.0 mIU/ L) with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, and with this definition the incidence of SCH in the reproductive-age population is approximately 4%–8%. There are also older data that suggest that inadequate treatment of SCH can lead to infertility, miscarriage, and adverse obstetrical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Debate persists about the definition of SCH and the decision of when to screen and treat, particularly for infertile women and women attempting pregnancy. Treatment recommendations for SCH vary between the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the Endocrine Society, the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and others, and the current understanding of effects on fertility and pregnancy is based mainly on retrospective studies with limited high-quality data, though consistent trends in the literature allow for the guidelines set forth in this document.

ATA thyroid and pregnancy guidelines — Data on pregnancy after treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) indicate no recurrence in disease-free women and progression in those with persistent disease: a study reported on 36 women who became pregnant between 1997 and 2006 with a median of 4.3 years after initial treatment, and although all had serum Tg testing, only 16 (44%) had ultrasound imaging before and after delivery; no recurrence was observed in 64 Brazilian women with suppressed Tg levels < 2 ng/mL and negative pre-pregnancy neck sonography but follow-up was limited to 6 months after delivery; using a disease-free definition of suppressed Tg < 0.9 ng/mL and negative neck ultrasound, 63 women were followed for a mean of 4.8 years, none of the 50 disease-free women had progression, whereas 6 of the 13 (46%) with persistent disease prepregnancy experienced progression, with metastatic cervical lymph nodes growing in 50% of those with known nodal disease and new nodal metastases in two of the seven women. Thus, pregnancy does not pose a risk for tumor recurrence in women without structural or biochemical disease present prior to the pregnancy, and women with an excellent response to therapy do not require additional monitoring during gestation.

Participants were 3996 U.S. individuals at least 65 yr old enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Subclinical hypothyroidism was detected at baseline in 459 individuals not taking thyroid medication.

Main Outcome Measure

Thyroid function was evaluated at 2 and 4 yr and initiation of thyroid medication annually. Results were stratified by baseline TSH, TPOAb status, age, and sex.

Results

Persistence of subclinical hypothyroidism was 56% at 2 and 4 yr. At 2 yr, resolution was more common with a TSH of 4.5–6.9 mU/liter (46 vs. 10% with TSH 7–9.9 mU/liter and 7% with TSH ≥ 10 mU/liter; P < 0.001) and with TPOAb negativity (48 vs. 15% for positive; P < 0.001). Higher TSH and TPOAb positivity were independently associated with lower likelihood of reversion to euthyroidism (P < 0.05). TSH of 10 mU/liter or higher was independently associated with progression to overt hypothyroidism (P < 0.05). Transitions between euthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism were common between 2 and 4 yr. Age and sex did not affect transitions.

Conclusions

Subclinical hypothyroidism persists for 4 yr in just over half of older individuals, with high rates of reversion to euthyroidism in individuals with lower TSH concentrations and TPOAb negativity. Future studies should examine the impact of transitions in thyroid status on clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (treatment targets), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to target the normal range of a third-generation TSH assay in nonpregnant patients with hypothyroidism. Consider targeting an ULN of 4.12 mIU/L in iodine-sufficient areas if an ULN for a third-generation TSH assay is not available, and a LLN of 0.45 mIU/L if a LLN is not available.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

### Normal limits for serum thyrotropin vary greatly depending on method [^112G78x2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels within populations do not follow Gaussian distribution, and normal limits are derived after mathematical normalization. The clinical relevance of these limits is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare upper and lower TSH limits by four data normalization methods with non-normalized data and assess their clinical relevance.

Design, Patients and Measurements

Results of blood samples taken by community physicians and stored in a computerized database were analysed after removing samples from patients with evidence of thyroid illness. TSH values were normalized by the Hoffmann and Tukey methods and each method with natural log transformation. Non-normalized data for TSH in the uppermost and lowermost percentile were also calculated. Clinical relevance was determined by alterations in thyroid hormone levels at, below and above the limits for each method.

Results

The maximal reduction from non-normalized data for the upper normal limit (UNL) was by the Hoffman method 43% = 3.1 mIU/l). The maximal increase for the lower normal limit (LNL) was also by the Hoffman method (708% = 0.81 mIU/l). There was very limited difference in average FT3 and FT4 between patients with TSH within, below or above the normal range for all methods.

Conclusions

Different normalization methods alter the normal limits greatly. However, in individuals without thyroid illness, thyroid hormone values are stable over a wide range of TSH levels including beyond the UNL for all methods. Indeed, there may be no true universal upper TSH cut-off level and clinical decision-making cannot rely on these calculated limits.

### Thyrotropin levels in a population with no clinical, autoantibody, or ultrasonographic evidence of thyroid disease: implications for the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism [^116ie3q5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The current debate regarding whether to decrease the upper limit for the TSH reference range to 2.5 microIU/ml has considerable potential impact on the diagnosis and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism worldwide.

Objective

We report an analysis of TSH distribution in a population with no evidence of thyroid disease, including a normal thyroid ultrasound.

Design

A subset of the Hanford Thyroid Disease Study cohort was used to examine the TSH distribution in a population having no evidence of thyroid disease, seronegative thyroid autoantibodies, no history of thyroid medications, and a normal thyroid ultrasound. The shape of the TSH distribution was compared with the Gaussian and lognormal distributions.

Setting

This study was performed in the general community.

Participants

Of 1861 Hanford Thyroid Disease Study participants with TSH measured by ELISA who also had thyroid peroxidase antibody measurements, 766 comprised the normal reference group 3 (NRG-3) with no evidence of thyroid disease, including no positive antibodies and normal thyroid ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure

TSH was measured.

Results

The TSH distribution in the NRG (NRG-3) was right skewed and followed an approximate lognormal distribution. The best estimates of the 97.5th percentile, the percentage above 2.5 microIU/ml, and the percentage above 3.0 microIU/ml for TSH by 3rd generation immunochemiluminometric assay are 4.1 microIU/ml, 20% and 10.2%, respectively.

Conclusion

These results indicate that the TSH reference range should be narrowed and support a value of approximately 4.0 as the upper-reference limit.

### Impact of thyroid hormone therapy on atherosclerosis in the elderly with subclinical hypothyroidism: a randomized trial [^115qCrAA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) has been associated with atherosclerosis, but no conclusive clinical trials assessing the levothyroxine impact on carotid atherosclerosis exist.

Objective

To assess the impact of treatment of SHypo with levothyroxine on carotid atherosclerosis.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial nested within the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Subclinical Hypothyroidism trial.

Participants

Participants aged ≥ 65 years with SHypo [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 4.60 to 19.99 mIU/L; free thyroxine level within reference range].

Intervention

Levothyroxine dose-titrated to achieve TSH normalization or placebo, including mock titrations.

Main Outcome Measures

Carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), maximum plaque thickness measured with ultrasound.

Results

One hundred eighty-five participants (mean age 74.1 years, 47% women, 96 randomized to levothyroxine) underwent carotid ultrasound. Overall mean TSH ± SD was 6.35 ± 1.95 mIU/L at baseline and decreased to 3.55 ± 2.14 mIU/L with levothyroxine compared with 5.29 ± 2.21 mIU/L with placebo (P < 0.001). After a median treatment of 18.4 months (interquartile range 12.2 to 30.0 months), mean CIMT was 0.85 ± 0.14 mm under levothyroxine and 0.82 ± 0.13 mm under placebo [between-group difference = 0.02 mm; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.06; P = 0.30]. The proportion of carotid plaque was similar (n = 135; 70.8% under levothyroxine and 75.3% under placebo; P = 0.46). Maximum carotid plaque thickness was 2.38 ± 0.92 mm under levothyroxine and 2.37 ± 0.91 mm under placebo (between-group difference -0.03; 95% CI, -0.34 to 0.29; P = 0.86). There were no significant interactions between levothyroxine treatment and mean CIMT, according to sex, baseline TSH (categories 4.6 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and ≥ 10 mIU/L), or established cardiovascular disease (all P for interaction ≥ 0.14).

Conclusion

Normalization of TSH with levothyroxine was associated with no difference in CIMT and carotid atherosclerosis in older persons with SHypo.

### Serum CA 19–9 and CA 72–4 levels in Hashimoto's thyroiditis: a prospective case-control study [^116wK1uB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

CA 19 − 9, a sialylated Lewis antigen, is recognized for its role as a tumor marker in gastrointestinal cancers. However, emerging evidence suggests it may also be involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. In vitro studies indicate that CA 19 − 9 can be expressed in non-cancerous cells, particularly epithelial cells, which may contribute to cellular adhesion and signaling pathways related to cell growth and differentiation. Additionally, research has shown that CA 19 − 9 levels may be elevated in conditions associated with tissue injury, such as increased cellular turnover or regenerative processes. This raises the possibility that elevated CA 19 − 9 levels in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may suggest a proliferative process in the thyroid or other tissues affected by hypothyroidism. Similarly, CA 72 − 4, a mucin-like glycoprotein, has been linked to various stages of cancer progression, particularly in gastric and ovarian cancers. However, it has also been proposed that CA 72 − 4 may regulate apoptosis and cell differentiation, especially in epithelial tissues. In patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where autoimmune-mediated damage to the thyroid can lead to compensatory tissue remodeling, elevated CA 72 − 4 levels may indicate this regenerative process rather than an inflammatory or malignant response.

This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the relatively small sample size may have limited the statistical power to detect subtle differences in CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 levels, thereby restricting the generalizability of the results. Second, the follow-up duration of six weeks was relatively short, which may not have been sufficient to capture the long-term biochemical effects of levothyroxine therapy or sustained changes in tumor marker levels. Third, not all patients achieved biochemical euthyroidism during this period, which may have introduced variability into the results. Fourth, the single-center design limits the external validity of the study and may reduce its applicability to broader populations. Despite these limitations, the study also has several strengths. Its prospective design enabled systematic evaluation of biochemical changes before and after treatment within the same cohort, thereby reducing potential biases. The application of rigorous and comprehensive exclusion criteria minimized confounding factors, enhancing the reliability of the results. Furthermore, the use of standardized laboratory methods improved the consistency and reproducibility of biochemical measurements. Importantly, by exploring tumor markers in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism, the study provides new insights into an underexplored area with potential clinical relevance, particularly for the interpretation of CA 19 − 9 and CA 72 − 4 levels in this patient population.

Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

Assisted reproduction — observational data on TSH and outcomes: In intrauterine insemination (IUI), LT4 treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism defined by TSH > 2.5 mU/L was associated with higher pregnancy rates, whereas treating overt hypothyroidism was associated with lower pregnancy rates, despite all treated patients having TSH < 2.5 at IUI; in a prospective cohort of 1477 women undergoing IUI, preconception TSH 0.4–4.99 mU/L was not associated with IUI parameters, pregnancy, or live birth per cycle. For in vitro fertilization (IVF), the majority of evidence suggests outcomes do not differ between TSH < 2.5 mU/L and TSH between 2.5 and 5 mU/L; one retrospective cohort of 164 IVF patients found higher clinical pregnancy with TSH ≤ 2.5 versus > 2.5 mU/L (22% vs. 9%, p = 0.045), whereas larger cohorts reported no differences comparing TSH ≤ 2.5 mU/L versus < 4.5 mU/L and when assessing subclinical hypothyroidism defined by TSH > 4.5 mU/L. Embryo quality studies likewise showed no differences across TSH strata, including 0.45–2.5 versus 2.5–4.5 mU/L, and in euploid blastocyst transfers with TSH 0.5–2.5 mU/L.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism and the risk of coronary heart disease and mortality [^113wCSHV]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Data regarding the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and cardiovascular disease outcomes are conflicting among large prospective cohort studies. This might reflect differences in participants' age, sex, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, or preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Objective

To assess the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and total mortality for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1950 to May 31, 2010) were searched without language restrictions for prospective cohort studies with baseline thyroid function and subsequent CHD events, CHD mortality, and total mortality. The reference lists of retrieved articles also were searched.

Data Extraction

Individual data on 55,287 participants with 542,494 person-years of follow-up between 1972 and 2007 were supplied from 11 prospective cohorts in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, and Japan. The risk of CHD events was examined in 25,977 participants from 7 cohorts with available data. Euthyroidism was defined as a TSH level of 0.50 to 4.49 mIU/L. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level of 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with normal thyroxine concentrations.

Results

Among 55,287 adults, 3450 had subclinical hypothyroidism (6.2%) and 51,837 had euthyroidism. During follow-up, 9664 participants died (2168 of CHD), and 4470 participants had CHD events (among 7 studies). The risk of CHD events and CHD mortality increased with higher TSH concentrations. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, the hazard ratio (HR) for CHD events was 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.18) for a TSH level of 4.5 to 6.9 mIU/L (20.3 vs 20.3/1000 person-years for participants with euthyroidism), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.96–1.43) for a TSH level of 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L (23.8/1000 person-years), and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.28–2.80) for a TSH level of 10 to 19.9 mIU/L (n = 70 events/235; 38.4/1000 person-years; P < .001 for trend). The corresponding HRs for CHD mortality were 1.09 (95% CI, 0.91–1.30; 5.3 vs 4.9/1000 person-years for participants with euthyroidism), 1.42 (95% CI, 1.03–1.95; 6.9/1000 person-years), and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.10–2.27, n = 28 deaths/333; 7.7/1000 person-years; p = 0.005 for trend). Total mortality was not increased among participants with subclinical hypothyroidism. Results were similar after further adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Risks did not significantly differ by age, sex, or preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of CHD events and CHD mortality in those with higher TSH levels, particularly in those with a TSH concentration of 10 mIU/L or greater.

### Different FT3 / TSH correlation in acquired and congenital hypothyroid patients reveals a different hypothalamic set-point [^112PyfJZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of T4 dose and thyroid hormone levels in CH and TP patients

Clinical and biochemical features patients are summarized in Table 1. Median serum TSH levels in CH group (1.5 µU/ml, IQR 0.9−2.1) were not different compared to TP group (1.2 µU/ml, IQR 0.6−2.4) and EU group (1.4 µU/ml, IQR 0.6−2.1). Serum FT4 levels were significantly higher in CH group (16.7 pmol/L, IQR 14.7−19.3) than EU group (13.5, IQR 11.6−15.4) (p < .05) but not significantly different than TP group (15.4 pmol/L, IQR 14.2−18.0). In contrast, serum FT3 levels were similar between CH and EU (4.5 pmol/L, IQR 4.2−4.9 and 4.5 pmol/L, IQR 3.9−5.0, respectively) groups but higher than TP (3.8 pmol/L, IQR 3.2−4.3) group (p < .05). FT3/FT4 ratio was higher in EU group (0.32, IQR 0.28−0.38) than CH patients (0.28, IQR 0.23−0.30, p < .05) and TP group (0.24, IQR 0.20−0.27, p < .05). Daily weight‐based‐T4 therapy was significantly higher in CH group than TP group (1.9 µg/day/kg, IQR 1.7−2.1 vs. 1.7 µg/day/kg, IQR 1.5−2.0 p = .03), despite the (not significantly) higher TSH level.

Clinical thyrotropin (TSH) measurement — Serum TSH measurement is the best test to screen for primary hypothyroidism in all age groups, but TSH measurement alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis or treatment of patients with central hypothyroidism. In acute and/or intercurrent illness, interpretation is not straightforward and should take into account other patient factors, and age, sex, reproductive status, medications, ethnicity, iodine intake, and biological variation, but not circadian or circannual rhythms, are important variables to consider when interpreting TSH values.

Thyroid nodules — thyrotropin and cytology considerations — Suppressed or low levels of thyrotropin (TSH) are associated with a decreased probability of malignancy, whereas increased levels of serum TSH, even when the levels are still within reference limits, are statistically associated with an increased risk of cancer in thyroid nodular disease; the clinical role of these epidemiologic findings is still controversial and is of little use in individual patient treatment. Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules in adults usually need no cytologic evaluation unless suspicious clinical findings are present.

Biochemical results in the study cohort

Additional file 1: Table S1 summarizes the biochemical investigations performed before initiating ICI therapy. The median creatinine level was 70 μmol/L (56–90), the median HbA1c level was 5.85% (5.4–6.9), the white blood cell count was 6.9 × 10³/L (5–9.3), the hemoglobin level was 11.42 g/dL, and the neutrophil count was 6.3 × 10³/L (3.7–53), with a median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of 3.28 (2.05–5.72). Thyroid function tests (TFTs) revealed a median thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 1.81 mIU/L (1.07–3.35), a free T3 level of 4.09 pmol/L, and a free T4 level of 14.9 pmol/L (12.9–16.71). The median morning cortisol level was 349.44 nmol/L, and the median adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was 9.3 pg/mL (5–131).

The post-ICI therapy biochemical results are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S2. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were newly positive in 7 out of 36 patients with available data, with 5.6% (2 out of 36) already positive pre-ICIs. The median values for TFTs were as follows: TSH 2.4 mIU/L (1.2–6.7), free T3 4.2 pmol/L (3.1–4.9), and free T4 14.4 pmol/L (11.9–16.6). The mean morning cortisol and median ACTH levels were 340 nmol/L ± 215.8 and 13.9 pg/mL (7.3–38.50), respectively. The median prolactin concentration was 284 mIU/L (203–484). Hypophysitis post-ICI was detected in only one patient via MRI. The median HbA1c and C-peptide levels were 5.9% (5.4–6.8) and 0.57 ng/mL (0.3–2.2), respectively. Additional file 1: Table S3 summarizes the cohort's biochemical data at the end of the study.

### Accurate interpretation of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy: should we continue to use published guidelines instead of population-based gestation-specific reference intervals for the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)? [^115XsTvA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding ATA 2017 based comparison in the T1a subgroup, a minimal level of agreement (κ = 0.34) was also observed for diagnosing hypothyroidism, similar to the level of agreement found with the previous ATA threshold (κ = 0.40). The discordance between the established and fixed cut-off values in the early first trimester indicates that implementing ATA 2017 criteria may increase the risk of undetected hypothyroid pregnant women while using ATA 2011 recommendation may lead to the misdiagnosis of healthy women as having hypothyroidism. However, high agreement found between ATA 2011 criteria and our estimated RI in the T1b subgroup suggests that previous recommended RIs may be more appropriate for the late first trimester. Gao et al. also reported that adopting ATA 2017 threshold in the first trimester might be a sub-optimal practice for pregnant Chinese women.

To guide all patients and clinicians, the 2017 ATA guideline updated the recommendation by reducing the LRL and the URL of TSH by approximately 0.4 mIU/L and 0.5 mIU/L, respectively, in the first trimester when local assessments are not available. Since the URL for TSH has approached 4.0–4.5 mIU/L concentrations from ~ 10 mIU/L over the past years, it was widely reduced by 0.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, corresponding to an URL of 4.0 mIU/L. This cut-off should be primarily implemented beginning from the second half of the first trimester, with a progressive increase in the succeeding trimesters. Therefore, we have used an URL of 5.1 mIU/L (URL of non-pregnant level reduced by 0.5 mIU/L) for the T1 a subgroup, corresponding to the early first trimester and 4.0 mIU/L for the T1 b subgroup, which represents the late first trimester, considering 2017 ATA criteria. However, when analyzing the 19 studies cited in the 2017 ATA guidelines, only five articles reported an URL of normal ≥ 4.0 mIU/L. The only one paper reported an upper limit of normal exceeding 3.5 mIU/L, out of the five most extensive reference studies, each comprising more than 5000 pregnant women.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^1161vUCh]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges in pregnancy — physiologic shifts and guidance: A downward shift of the TSH reference range occurs during pregnancy, with the lower limit decreased by about 0.1–0.2 mU/L and the upper limit decreased by about 0.5–1.0 mU/L, with the largest decrease in the first trimester attributable to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation. In women with very high hCG, suppression is frequent; in one study with hCG concentrations > 200,000 IU/L, TSH was suppressed (≤ 0.2 mU/L) in 67% of women and in 100% when hCG concentrations were > 400,000 IU/L. When local trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, the first-trimester lower reference range can be reduced by approximately 0.4 mU/L and the upper reference range reduced by approximately 0.5 mU/L; for a typical early pregnancy this corresponds to a TSH upper reference limit of 4.0 mU/L, generally applied beginning with the late first trimester (weeks 7–12) with a gradual return toward nonpregnant values thereafter. A small percentage of normal pregnancies may have undetectable TSH (< 0.01 mU/L).

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid function within the normal range, subclinical hypothyroidism, and the risk of atrial fibrillation [^116wk1Mh]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also associated with AF.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45 to 4.49 mIU/L, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L with free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The association of TSH levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined by using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 levels and incident AF.

Results

Of 30085 participants from 11 cohorts (278955 person-years of follow-up), 1958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 2574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–1.66, for the highest quartile versus the lowest quartile of fT4; P for trend ≤ 0.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but not TSH levels, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.

Question 109 — treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy loss: Retrospective data link LT4 to lower pregnancy loss, including LT4 treatment of TPOAb-positive women with TSH > 1 mIU/L reducing pregnancy loss from 16% to 0%, and a historical cohort showing higher loss rates when TSH was > 4.5 mIU/L (especially > 10 mIU/L) versus < 2.5 mIU/L. An RCT of euthyroid (TSH < 4.2 mIU/L) TPOAb-positive women reported reductions in pregnancy loss (deliveries from 22% to 7%) and miscarriages (from 14% to 5.3%), though LT4 started late in the first trimester (mean 10.3 weeks).

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Recommendations about thyroid screening, however, have been inconsistent. Currently, no organizations recommend routine universal screening. For example, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. Subclinical Hypothyroidism Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed.

The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12. 5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. In short, it seems reasonable to treat patients who have a TSH level that is consistently elevated above 10 μU per mL, especially if titers of antithyroid antibodies are increased.

Also, patients who complain of fatigue, dry skin, constipation, muscle cramps or other common symptoms of hypothyroidism may possibly benefit from treatment even if their TSH level is elevated only into the 5 to 10 μU per mL range. An algorithm summarizing this approach is presented in Figure 1.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^112wUhU4]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis TSH elevation indicates hypothyroidism. Low-end normal TSH is 0. 4 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 The upper-end normal range is from 4. 0 to
4. 5 mIU per L. 2, 5–7 FT 4 level is used to distinguish clinical from subclinical hypothyroidism. Routinely evaluating total T 3, total T 4, or FT 3 levels is not indicated. If the TSH level is within the normal reference range, other etiologies for the signs and symptoms that prompted testing should be sought. If a pituitary cause is suspected, an FT 4 level is obtained. If the FT 4 level is normal, further thyroid or pituitary evaluation is unnecessary. If the FT 4 level is low, the clinician should review medications the patient is taking, evaluate the pituitary gland, or consider euthyroid sick syndrome |-| If the TSH level is low, hyperthyroidism is possible. 18 If the TSH level is high, a serum FT 4 level should be obtained. A low FT 4 level indicates clinical hypothyroidism, specifically autoimmune hypothyroidism if the TPO antibody test result is elevated). Table 1 lists other causes. 1–4 An elevated FT 4 level may suggest a TSH-secreting tumor, and referral to endocrinology is warranted. An FT 4 level within the reference range indicates subclinical hypothyroidism. Rare other causes include adrenal insufficiency, drugs, post-nonthyroidal illness, or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. 7 More than 50% of patients older than 55 years with TSH levels of 5. 0 to
9.

9 mIU per L will normalize, whereas only 13% and 5% of patients normalize if the TSH level is greater than 10 mIU per L or greater than 15 mIU per L, respectively.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^111TPnZE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In 1998, the American College of Physicians published guidelines on screening for thyroid disease in patients seen by primary care physicians for reasons unrelated to thyroid disease. Screening can be useful to identify overt or subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone test is recommended as a screening test in women more than 50 years of age. If the TSH level is less than 0. 3 to
0. 4 μU per mL or greater than 10 μU per mL, determination of the free thyroxine level is recommended. Screening is not recommended in women less than age 50 or in men because the prevalence of unsuspected symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is low in these populations. Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease.

The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism. The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL. A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate.

The author notes that previous studies suggested that the addition of thyroid hormone to long-term methimazole or propylthiouracil therapy in patients with Graves' disease increased the likelihood of remission when antithyroid drug therapy was discontinued. More recently, several large randomized studies have failed to confirm that levothyroxine promotes remission in patients receiving antithyroid therapy.
