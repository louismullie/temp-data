## Question

Acute phase protien and other systemic respone to inflammation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the acute phase response and other systemic responses to inflammation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the acute phase response and its triggers. Then, I should verify the hepatic transcriptional programs and cytokine signaling that drive positive and negative acute phase proteins. Next, I will examine key positive and negative acute phase proteins and their functional roles. After that, I should review the systemic inflammatory response, including SIRS and organ-level consequences. I will then evaluate clinical biomarkers and their limitations, followed by disease-specific examples and the distinction between association and causality. Finally, I will consider therapeutic implications and synthesize a concise clinical takeaway, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate citations and self-checks throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and triggers of the acute phase response. The acute phase response is a coordinated systemic reaction to infection, tissue injury, or sterile inflammation, initiated when sentinel cells release proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which signal the liver to reprogram protein synthesis and alter circulating protein levels substantially, often by orders of magnitude in the case of positive acute phase proteins [^111inj9q]. Hold on, I should verify the temporal dynamics: CRP typically rises within 4–6 hours, peaks around 24–72 hours, and declines with resolution, which aligns with its clinical use for monitoring response, whereas albumin and other negative acute phase proteins fall due to hepatic reprioritization and altered synthesis, sometimes taking weeks to normalize after the insult resolves [^114Rhveo] [^114LpzTy].

> I need to check the hepatic transcriptional control mechanisms next. IL-6 drives hepatocyte STAT3 signaling to upregulate many positive acute phase genes, while IL-1β and TNF-α converge on NF-κB and C/EBPβ/AP-1 pathways to coordinate a broader transcriptional program, producing waves of mRNA and protein changes that include both proinflammatory and protective components [^111inj9q]. Wait, let me verify the negative acute phase regulation: reprioritization of hepatic protein synthesis and transcriptional repression contribute to decreased albumin, transferrin, and apolipoproteins during inflammation, which explains why low albumin tracks with severity even when nutrition is adequate [^113ZeEqt].

> Now, I will examine positive acute phase proteins and their functions, but I should confirm examples with mechanistic plausibility. CRP is a pentraxin that opsonizes pathogens and damaged cells, activates complement, and modulates innate immunity; its kinetics mirror disease activity and make it a practical biomarker across many settings, though it is not disease-specific [^114Rhveo] [^114pKM1Y]. Serum amyloid A (SAA) rises markedly and can remodel HDL, impairing its cardioprotective functions and potentially promoting proatherogenic phenotypes during inflammation, which is clinically relevant in chronic inflammatory states [^116R9U1N]. Complement components such as C3 and C4 are acute phase reactants that increase with systemic inflammation, though interpretation must consider both increased synthesis and consumption in liver disease and immune complex disorders [^113LKSen]. Fibrinogen increases and contributes to a procoagulant milieu during systemic inflammation, aligning with the frequent coagulopathy seen in sepsis and severe COVID-19 [^115FwcT2]. Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is produced at inflammatory sites and contributes to pathogen recognition and tissue repair, with emerging roles in cardiovascular and infectious disease contexts [^113FgDTR] [^113wbtM1].

> Next, I should review negative acute phase proteins and their clinical significance. Albumin falls due to reduced hepatic synthesis and transcapillary losses, correlating with severity and prognosis across critical illness, and its slow recovery reflects ongoing inflammation and catabolism rather than malnutrition alone, so I need to be cautious not to overinterpret low albumin as purely nutritional [^114LpzTy] [^113ZeEqt]. Transferrin and transthyretin (prealbumin) decline and can mislead nutrition assessment if inflammation is not accounted for, reinforcing the principle that visceral proteins are primarily inflammation markers during acute disease [^113ZeEqt]. Apolipoprotein M and other apolipoproteins decrease during inflammation, which may impair HDL function and contribute to dyslipidemia in inflammatory states, further linking inflammation to atherogenesis [^112eytuz] [^115YNsKP].

> I will now examine the systemic inflammatory response and its clinical manifestations. SIRS reflects a dysregulated host response to infectious or noninfectious insults, characterized by pro- and anti-inflammatory components, hemodynamic changes, endothelial activation, and potential progression to organ dysfunction, so I should confirm that SIRS is both a physiologic and pathologic state depending on magnitude and control [^115W91vu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: SIRS criteria are sensitive but nonspecific, and qSOFA correlates imperfectly with cytokine levels, underscoring the need to integrate biomarkers with clinical context rather than rely on any single score or test [^113AFr34]. The liver's metabolic reallocation during systemic inflammation diverts resources to acute phase protein synthesis, downregulates biotransformation, and contributes to cholestasis and jaundice in sepsis and ACLF, which can confound interpretation of liver tests during critical illness [^113JDCWe].

> Let me consider the clinical utility and limitations of biomarkers, and I should double-check that I am not overstating specificity. CRP is widely used for screening, monitoring, and prognosis, but it lacks specificity for infection versus sterile inflammation and performs best when interpreted serially and in clinical context; minor CRP elevations in the 3–10 mg/L range reflect low-grade systemic inflammation and should prompt a search for drivers rather than reflexive treatment [^114Rhveo] [^116sJTRY]. Procalcitonin improves specificity for bacterial infection in some settings but remains imperfect, and meta-analyses show variable performance, reinforcing that no single biomarker reliably distinguishes sepsis from SIRS or predicts outcome consistently [^111vTwGY] [^115K8y2A]. ESR is less sensitive early and lags behind CRP, so I should avoid relying on ESR for acute decision-making when CRP is available [^115jai1d].

> Next, I should review disease-specific examples to ensure clinical applicability. In COVID-19, CRP and IL-6 track severity and correlate with hyperinflammation, ARDS, and mortality, and serial CRP dynamics can inform escalation or de-escalation strategies, though they must be integrated with oxygenation, imaging, and coagulation parameters [^114V3kJh] [^1158RxQe]. In acute pancreatitis, CRP and IL-6 rise with severity, but timing matters and liver disease can blunt CRP, so early measurements may underestimate risk; combining biomarkers with clinical scores improves prognostication [^116J6Lep]. In rheumatoid arthritis, IL-6–driven CRP correlates with disease activity and the anemia of chronic disease via hepcidin, illustrating how acute phase proteins both mark and mediate systemic complications [^112nwM7j]. In COPD, baseline CRP and SAA are elevated and further increase during exacerbations, supporting the concept of a chronic systemic inflammatory phenotype with cardiovascular comorbidity [^115ioewv] [^112Ges2H].

> But wait, what if elevated CRP is a marker rather than a mediator of disease progression; I need to ensure I distinguish association from causality. Epidemiologic and Mendelian randomization data suggest CRP largely reflects upstream inflammatory drivers rather than directly causing atherosclerosis, although experimental studies show CRP can modulate immune and endothelial functions, so its role likely spans marker, mediator, and effector depending on context [^115kzt4g] [^112zofN2]. Statins reduce CRP independent of LDL lowering and improve outcomes in patients with elevated hsCRP, but whether CRP lowering per se is beneficial remains debated, so I should frame CRP as a risk enhancer and a therapeutic response biomarker rather than a primary causal target in most settings [^116EVoyT] [^111HJx2b].

> I should now consider therapeutic implications and targets, and I need to verify that I am not overgeneralizing. IL-6 blockade reduces acute phase responses and improves symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis and other IL-6–driven conditions, validating the cytokine-acute phase axis as clinically actionable [^112nwM7j]. Complement inhibition and neutrophil modulation are under exploration in hyperinflammatory states, and pentraxins such as CRP and PTX3 may be leveraged to enhance clearance or limit tissue damage, though translation remains early [^113FgDTR] [^114pKM1Y]. Nutrition support during severe inflammation has limited immediate impact on visceral protein recovery, so timing nutrition interventions to the resolution phase improves efficacy and avoids misattribution of failure to nutrition rather than inflammation [^114CfKiv] [^117RELtF].

> Let me synthesize a concise clinical takeaway, and I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. The acute phase response is a hepatic transcriptional program driven by IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α that upregulates positive acute phase proteins like CRP, SAA, complement, and fibrinogen while downregulating negative acute phase proteins such as albumin and transferrin, producing measurable changes that track disease activity and prognosis across diverse conditions [^111inj9q] [^113ZeEqt]. Clinically, CRP and related biomarkers are most informative when measured serially, interpreted alongside the history and exam, and integrated with organ-specific assessments, recognizing that they reflect but do not define the underlying driver of inflammation and that persistent elevation signals ongoing tissue injury or unresolved triggers requiring targeted evaluation and therapy [^114Rhveo] [^116sJTRY].

---

The acute phase response is a **rapid, systemic reaction** to infection, injury, or inflammation, coordinated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) that drive hepatic synthesis of acute phase proteins (APPs) [^111inj9q]. Positive APPs (CRP, SAA, fibrinogen, complement factors) rise within hours, aiding pathogen clearance, opsonization, and tissue repair, while negative APPs (albumin, transferrin) fall due to hepatic reprioritization [^113ZeEqt]. Clinically, CRP and SAA are key markers of inflammation and disease severity; persistent elevation indicates ongoing inflammation and worse outcomes [^1133aMSk] [^112aDHBZ]. The response also includes fever, leukocytosis, and metabolic shifts, and dysregulation can contribute to chronic disease and organ dysfunction [^116jhmBU] [^115y8KuM].

---

## Acute phase proteins (APPs)

APPs are classified as **positive or negative** based on their direction of change during inflammation [^113ZeEqt].

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Function** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive APPs | - C-reactive protein (CRP) <br/> - Serum amyloid A (SAA) <br/> - Fibrinogen <br/> - Complement components (C3, C4) <br/> - Haptoglobin <br/> - Ceruloplasmin | - Pathogen clearance <br/> - Opsonization <br/> - Complement activation <br/> - Coagulation <br/> - Iron sequestration |
| Negative APPs | - Albumin <br/> - Transferrin <br/> - Transthyretin (prealbumin) | - Transport proteins <br/> - Nutritional markers <br/> - Reduced synthesis during inflammation |

---

CRP rises within 4–6 hours, peaks at 24–72 hours, and returns to baseline with resolution; it is a **sensitive marker of inflammation and infection** [^114Rhveo]. SAA increases rapidly and is implicated in lipid metabolism and **amyloidosis** [^116R9U1N]. Fibrinogen supports coagulation and correlates with **cardiovascular risk** [^115FwcT2].

---

## Cytokines and signaling pathways

The acute phase response is primarily **regulated by cytokines**, with **IL-6 as the principal inducer** of hepatic APP synthesis via the JAK/STAT3 pathway [^111inj9q]. IL-1β and TNF-α amplify the response through NF-κB and MAPK pathways, coordinating a robust, rapid systemic reaction [^111inj9q].

---

## Clinical significance of APPs

APPs are **valuable biomarkers** for diagnosing, monitoring, and prognosticating inflammatory conditions:

- **CRP**: Widely used to detect and monitor inflammation, infection, and treatment response; elevated levels indicate active inflammation [^112AcW7J].
- **SAA**: Elevated in chronic inflammation and amyloidosis; useful in rheumatology and nephrology [^notfound].
- **Fibrinogen**: Associated with cardiovascular risk and coagulation disorders [^115FwcT2].

Persistent elevation of APPs indicates ongoing inflammation and is associated with **poor outcomes** in chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer [^112aDHBZ] [^1174kaNX].

---

## Systemic manifestations of acute phase response

The acute phase response includes several **systemic manifestations**:

- **Fever**: Elevated body temperature due to prostaglandin-mediated hypothalamic set-point alteration [^notfound].
- **Leukocytosis**: Increased white blood cell count, particularly neutrophils [^111inj9q].
- **Metabolic changes**: Hyperglycemia, increased protein catabolism, and altered lipid metabolism [^notfound].
- **Hematologic changes**: Anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytosis, and altered coagulation profile [^112nwM7j].

---

## Dysregulation and chronic inflammation

Dysregulated acute phase responses contribute to **chronic inflammatory diseases**, including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Chronic elevation of APPs, particularly CRP and fibrinogen, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and poor prognosis in chronic diseases [^114CtaH3] [^112aDHBZ].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Understanding the acute phase response has led to **targeted therapies**. IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. tocilizumab) are used in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, and anti-inflammatory agents, including statins and biologics, reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk [^112ELBN9].

---

The acute phase response is a coordinated systemic reaction to inflammation, characterized by altered protein synthesis and systemic manifestations. It is a **valuable clinical tool** for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating inflammatory conditions, and its dysregulation contributes to chronic disease progression [^116jhmBU].

### Differential expression of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A in different cell types in the lung tissue of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^111KV6Mn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with important extrapulmonary manifestations including cardiovascular disease, weight loss, skeletal muscle dysfunction, depression and osteoporosis. Although the pathobiology of these extra-pulmonary manifestations has not been fully determined, systemic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the majority of these manifestations. In fact, several authors have suggested that COPD is part of a chronic systemic inflammatory syndrome.

Patients with COPD display systemic inflammation, measured either as increased circulating cytokines, chemokines and acute-phase proteins or as abnormalities in circulating cells. Acute-phase reactants are among the most studied biomarkers. In particular, C-reactive protein (CRP) is related to an accelerated decline in lung function and many other clinically relevant outcomes. Serum amyloid A (SAA), the other major acute-phase reactant in humans, has also been shown to be elevated in COPD patients.

There has been considerable interest in identifying the nature of COPD-mediated systemic inflammation, as such knowledge may help predict clinical responses to therapy and identify new therapeutic targets. One important issue is identifying the origin of systemic inflammation, which is currently controversial. This would be a major advancement, and doing so could have an important diagnostic impact by identifying therapeutic targets to prevent disease progression to other organs, thereby preventing comorbidities. The current hypothesis holds that this inflammation is generated within the lung and produces an overflow (referred to in the literature as "spill-over") of inflammatory mediators into the bloodstream.

Previous studies have described how lung tissue can synthesize acute-phase biomarkers in healthy tissue as well as in animal or cell models. Additionally, our group has reported that, in addition to the liver, the lung can also synthesize CRP and SAA. Interestingly, de-novo synthesis of CRP and SAA is increased in patients with COPD compared to disease-free smokers ("resistant smokers"), and this synthesis is differentially expressed in whole tissue samples depending on the anatomical location, such as the bronchus or the parenchyma.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the cell types within lung tissue that express these biomarkers. We hypothesized that the expression of acute-phase reactants in lung tissue would differ with respect to the cell type used and would vary between COPD patients and healthy smokers. The objectives of this study were to characterize the gene expression of CRP and SAA in key lung cell types, including epithelial cells, macrophages and human lung fibroblasts, and to compare the gene expression profiles of COPD patients and healthy smokers.

### The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in the inflammatory response to local tissue injury [^115zWrHx]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The plasma levels of the plasminogen activator-inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) are consistently elevated in patients with sterile tissue injury, often accompanied by a systemic acute phase protein response. It remains unknown, however, whether and to what extent PAI-1 affects the host response to trauma.

Methods and Results

By using the well-established murine model of turpentine-induced tissue injury we compared local and systemic inflammatory responses in PAI-1 gene-deficient (PAI-1-/-) and normal wild-type (Wt) mice. Subcutaneous turpentine injection elicited strong increases in PAI-1 protein concentration in plasma and at the site of injury, but not in liver. PAI-1 mRNA was locally increased and expressed mainly by macrophages and endothelial cells. PAI-1 deficiency greatly enhanced the early influx of neutrophils to the site of inflammation, which was associated with increased edema and necrosis at 8 h after injection. Furthermore, PAI-1-/- mice showed a reduced early interleukin (IL)-6 induction with subsequently lower acute phase protein levels and a much slower recovery of body weight loss.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that PAI-1 is not merely a marker of tissue injury but plays a functional role in the local and systemic host response to trauma.

### Age as a modulator of inflammatory cardiovascular risk factors [^111JwcHy]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Levels of acute phase reactants are affected by age. The extent to which cardiovascular risk associated with aging is due to an increase in the inflammatory burden is not known. We assessed the relationship with age of inflammatory markers, representing (1) systemic (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid-A) and (2) vascular (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) and pentraxin-3) inflammation.

Methods and Results

We determined lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) mass and activity, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, serum amyloid-A, and pentraxin-3 levels and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in 336 whites and 224 African Americans. Levels of systemic inflammatory markers increased significantly with age in both ethnic groups (P < 0.05 for all), whereas trend patterns of vascular inflammatory markers did not change significantly with age for either group. In multivariate regression models adjusting for confounding variables, age remained independently associated with a composite Z score for systemic but not vascular inflammation (β = 0.250, P < 0.001, and β = 0.276, P < 0.001, for whites and African Americans, respectively).

Conclusions

We report an increase in the systemic but not vascular inflammatory burden with age. Levels of both categories of inflammatory markers with age were similar across ethnicity after adjustment for confounders. Our results underscore the importance of age in evaluating inflammatory markers to assess cardiovascular risk.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114LpzTy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Inflammation and atherosclerosis: role of C-reactive protein in risk assessment [^113ni3sa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation participates critically in atherosclerosis. Circulating levels of several inflammatory markers rise in individuals at risk for atherosclerotic events. In particular, elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific acute-phase reactant that is easily and reliably measured, has strong predictive power for cardiovascular events. Indeed, measurements of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) plasma levels add to both the prognostic information gleaned from assay of plasma lipid risk factors and the risk levels estimated by means of Framingham study-based criteria. Retrospective data suggest the hypothesis that hs-CRP plasma levels may be useful for guiding use of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals who appear to be at low risk according to traditional risk assessment. A large-scale, randomized clinical trial-Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER)-will test whether rosuvastatin therapy will reduce incident cardiovascular disease in subjects with elevated plasma hs-CRP concentrations who do not meet current criteria for initiation of lipid-lowering drug therapy. Such clinical trial data may provide an evidence base for the use of plasma CRP assay as an adjuvant guide to therapy to complement the established traditional risk factors such as plasma lipid levels. Thus, medical practitioners are ushering in an era in which the biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis will find its way into clinical application.

### Local and systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115ioewv]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence for systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins occur in stable disease, and COPD exacerbations are notably associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Although the course of inflammation is determined by the balance between pro- and antiinflammatory mediators, in COPD most attention has focused on the former. During exacerbation, however, upregulation of antiinflammatory markers occurs. The main causes of systemic inflammation in COPD remain to be elucidated, although systemic hypoxia is a candidate factor. Although a relationship between lung and systemic inflammation has been suggested, experimental evidence indicates no direct correlations in the regulation of inflammation in the pulmonary and systemic compartments. Longitudinal studies are needed to unravel the role of systemic inflammation in the course of COPD, to analyze the role of acute exacerbations on the chronicity of inflammation, and to evaluate the response of systemic inflammation to different interventions. Emphasis should be placed on the identification of signaling pathways induced and/or altered in skeletal muscle by inflammation, as muscle wasting is a prominent feature of chronic inflammatory disease conditions and contributes significantly to impaired physical functioning and health status in COPD.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^116mw7YP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### Inflammatory mediators in intra-abdominal sepsis or injury-a scoping review [^111tEFAb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is the expected immunologic response to both infection and traumatic injuries, which makes the distinction between infectious sepsis and sterile SIRS exceedingly difficult. Although animal studies suggest that mediators play an important role, the clinical use of mediators as biomarkers in discriminating SIRS from sepsis in intra-abdominal injury or sepsis is conflicting. Persistent elevation of CRP or PCT levels in blood appears to be correlated with septic complications. The role of IL-6 as a biomarker in intra-abdominal sepsis is controversial. Limited evidence suggests endogenous molecules may be candidate biomarkers of sepsis or injury. Importantly, peritoneal mediator levels cannot be proportionately reflected by the systemic levels. Victims subjected to trauma followed by infection show more excessive inflammatory response and organ damage than those to trauma only. To date, therapies targeting a specific inflammatory or protein mediator in abdominal sepsis have shown poor results. Interventions aiming to remove peritoneal fluid/mediators and improve outcomes are still investigational. Large sample size randomized controlled trails are desirable to identify the "ideal" biomarker(s) and understand the roles of mediators in intra-abdominal sepsis and injury.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^113ZeEqt]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Inflammation and visceral proteins — critical illness is characterized by severe acute inflammation, whereas chronic illness has a relatively lower but more prolonged or intermittent inflammatory state, and the acute-phase response in either condition changes serum protein concentrations via cytokines. Affected proteins are divided into 2 categories: positive acute-phase proteins that increase (including complement factors, proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and negative acute-phase proteins that decrease, including visceral proteins such as serum albumin, serum prealbumin (transthyretin), α2-macroglobulin, and transferrin. Early trauma and sepsis studies showed rises in positive acute-phase proteins and declines in negative acute-phase proteins. The decrease in visceral proteins has generally been attributed to hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis, though CRP has pleiotropic proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles and evidence suggests the fractional albumin synthesis rate in the plasma may actually be increased during the acute-phase response. Additionally, albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma.

### Anaemia and inflammation: what are the implications for the nephrologist? [^117UAXjz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by a high mortality rate, which is mainly caused by cardiovascular disease. In patients with ESRD, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased oxidative stress are common features and may contribute to the development of malnutrition, anaemia, resistance to recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) and atherosclerosis. The onset of inflammation is multi-factorial and is a predictor of poor outcome in ESRD. Although the inflammation may reflect the underlying cardiovascular disease, the acute-phase response may also contribute to both oxidative stress and progressive vascular injury. The acute-phase response in these patients may be influenced by a number of factors, and possibly the dialysis procedure itself. Inflammation and the acute-phase response interact with the haematopoietic system at several levels, resulting in reduced erythropoiesis, accelerated destruction of erythrocytes and blunting of the reactive increase in erythropoietin in response to reduced haemoglobin levels. In patients with ESRD, epoetin resistance has been linked with inflammation, which is often associated with a state of functional iron deficiency. Patients with ESRD are thought to have a reduced capacity in their control of oxidative stress and there is evidence that suggests that a relationship may exist between inflammation, oxidative stress and the treatment of anaemia with epoetin. Controlled trials are needed before evidence-based recommendations for the management of inflammation-induced anaemia and resistance to epoetin can be defined.

### Acute pancreatitis: current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^116J6Lep]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant produced in the liver in response to IL-6 and has been used in diagnosis, prognosis, and mortality prediction in patients with severe inflammation. Traditionally, CRP has been used in the clinic to monitor AP progression, where it has been reported to increase in circulation with disease progression. – However, conflicting evidence indicates that the timing of CRP measurement and quantitation of other serum markers (ie, IL-6) are critical to predicting disease outcomes. Furthermore, a recent retrospective analysis determined that CRP measurement at admission or at 48 hours does not predict the likelihood of developing complications from AP. In addition, liver disease may alter CRP production, which may be a significant factor in patients experiencing AP stemming from alcohol abuse.

Procalcitonin has been identified to be a key marker in circulation for patients experiencing severe bacterial infections and/or multiorgan failure. Measurement of this molecule has been shown to predict the risk for development of severe AP and infected pancreatic necrosis with a sensitivity of 0.72 and 0.80, respectively, and a specificity of 0.86 and 0.91, respectively. Synthesis of physiologic blood proteins (albumin, transferrin, and others) is downregulated in the acute phase response, and lower levels of circulating albumin throughout AP are predictive of organ failure and mortality. Despite these published studies surrounding the acute phase proteins and their clinical relevance, very few mechanistic studies have been published implicating these proteins, limiting the advancement of AP clinical trials.

Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and the Complement Cascade in AP

Early in the disease, an inflammatory injury will lead to leakage of prematurely activated pancreatic enzymes, further stimulating apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs recruit innate immune effector cells, generating an inflammatory response in the tissue. Paradoxically, apoptosis of acinar cells has shown to be somewhat protective in AP, which may be due to a reduction in DAMP release in response to apoptosis compared with necrotic cell death. – As necrosis and/or excessive autophagy of acinar cells occurs, contents within these cells are released into the environment, including several DAMPs: IL-33, high mobility group box 1, and ATP. All of these molecules are known activators of the innate immune system and have been proposed to be the critical molecules initiating disease in AP.

Outcomes of the inflammatory response

In the context of bacterial infection, the inflammatory response is complex and generally involves the innate and adaptive immune systems. The primary purpose of the inflammatory response to bacterial infection is to promote host resistance by reducing bacterial burden. When local defences are ineffective in containing infection, the immune system stimulates a systemic response to fight against the spreading microbe. For example, IL-6 and IL-1β (among others) induce the production of acute-phase response proteins, including CRP, serum amyloid proteins and complement proteins to stimulate bacterial clearance by phagocytes. In some cases, the early systemic inflammatory response to bacteria can be excessive and cause organ damage (a process called immunopathology) decreasing short-term survival. In the context of sterile inflammation, the primary purpose of the inflammatory response is to promote tissue repair (figure 1). The tissue-repair response can involve specialised components of the innate and adaptive immunity, but does not lead to adaptive immunity. In some cases, the sterile inflammatory response can be excessive and become systemic causing severe multiorgan damage.

The excessive inflammatory response to PAMPs or DAMPs can be due to host genetic factors. In the general population, in the context of infections, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to genes encoding molecules involved in the immune response have been shown to be associated with the risk of severe inflammation. For example, significant polymorphisms have been found in CD14 (encoding a cell surface receptor that contributes with TLR4 and MD2 to recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), TNF (encoding tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α), LTA (encoding lymphotoxin-α), TLRs (TLR1, TLR4, see table 5), TIRAP (encoding toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein, transducing TLR4 signalling), MIF (encoding macrophage migration inhibitory factor), SERPINB2 (encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 2), ADRB2 (encoding β-2 adrenergic receptor) (reviewed in).

The severity of infection can also be related to pathogens (Gram-negative infections being more severe than Gram-positive infections) or to the site of infection (intra-abdominal sites having the highest risk of death and urinary the lowest). However, the role of excessive inflammation in the higher severity of infections, depending on the pathogen or site of infection, is unclear.

### C-reactive protein in rheumatology: biology and genetics [^112zofN2]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Measurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is in widespread clinical use as a sensitive marker of inflammation. CRP has a role in the clearance of bacteria and of dying and altered cells, and might also have more complex immunomodulatory functions. Impaired clearance of apoptotic cells is important in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), raising the possibility that CRP dysregulation plays a part in this process. We review the available functional and genetic evidence supporting a role for CRP in the pathogenesis of SLE, but recognize that inconsistencies in the existing data mean that conclusions have to be interpreted with caution. More consistent is the evidence that the genetic variants influencing basal CRP level also influence the magnitude of the acute-phase rise in CRP level in active inflammation. Initial reports suggest that these genetic effects might be large enough to directly influence clinical decision-making processes that are based on an interpretation of CRP thresholds. This concept is explored further in this article, particularly in relation to the use of the CRP-based disease activity score in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, where a systematic under-scoring or over-scoring of disease activity could result from a failure to consider the genetic influences on CRP level.

### The acute phase reactant orosomucoid-2 directly promotes rheumatoid inflammation [^117KDyZK]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The acute phase reaction is a systemic reaction of organisms to disruptions in homeostasis such as infection, tissue injury, or inflammation. As a result, acute phase reactants are secreted in large amounts, predominantly in the liver. These reactants include serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, hemopexin, orosomucoid (ORM), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and cortisol –. Since most of these acute phase reactants can be rapidly secreted into the blood in response to infection or inflammation, they have been utilized as serum diagnostic markers to predict the activity and outcomes of chronic inflammatory diseases.

In recent years, evidence has emerged that some of these acute phase reactants are more than simple diagnostic markers. Studies have shown that these compounds can directly function as immune modulators. For example, the administration of CRP can reduce disease progression in lupus animal models. In contrast, CRP can promote the activation of synoviocytes in RA patients via the NF-κB pathway. SAA also exacerbates the severity of T H 17-dependent immune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis. Our group reported that SAA is directly involved in the destruction of bone and cartilage possibly by increasing synoviocyte hyperplasia and angiogenesis in addition to its role as a diagnostic marker in RA. Hemopexin, another acute phase reactant, has been demonstrated to be capable of negatively regulating the Th17 response and autoimmune disease. Together, these reports raise the possibility that acute phase proteins can play active roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, the involvement of acute phase proteins in chronic inflammatory diseases have not been globally or systematically analyzed.

### C-reactive protein comes of age [^114CtaH3]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death throughout the world despite advances in its detection and treatment. Commonly used risk algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to identify all affected individuals. Novel cardiovascular risk factors that identify these missed individuals would greatly improve overall care of patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, has emerged as a leading candidate to fulfill this role. Based on the results of several prospective epidemiologic studies, CRP has emerged as one of the most powerful predictors of cardiovascular disease. This marker provides valuable information to clinicians in various clinical settings, ranging from overt cardiovascular disease, stable angina, presenting acute coronary syndromes and peripheral vascular disease, to the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, CRP has been demonstrated to actively contribute to all stages of atherogenesis, participating in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic-plaque formation, plaque maturation, plaque destabilization and eventual rupture. Thus, it might also serve as a therapeutic target. It is our contention that the future will see much wider use of CRP and CRP-driven therapies in clinical medicine, improving our ability to identify and manage cardiovascular disease.

### Laboratory diagnosis of sepsis? No SIRS, not just yet [^115dkGek]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to maximize the benefit of prompt antimicrobial therapy and avoid the risk associated with inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents, patients with suspected sepsis must be rapidly differentiated from patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In combination with standard microbiological testing, a number of biomarkers have been recently evaluated for this purpose, and the performance characteristics of the most promising of these are reviewed.

### Systemic inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the role of exacerbations [^112Ges2H]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The systemic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are recognized, but our understanding of their etiology and importance is lacking largely due to the small number of systematic and longitudinal studies. Most of the systemic manifestations are likely the result of inflammatory processes. Serum biomarkers, such as various cytokines, adipokines, C-reactive protein, and coagulation factors, are elevated during exacerbations. Our understanding of the systemic manifestations can be greatly enhanced if we integrate what is known about the basic science of systemic mediators with the translational science of their role in COPD exacerbations. Many overlapping connections and promising avenues of future research come to light with such a viewpoint.

### Further evidence that high-density lipoprotein is a chameleon-like lipoprotein [^116R9U1N]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The work of Castrillo et al. demonstrated that a basic response of macrophages to either bacterial or viral infection is to significantly reduce cholesterol efflux. The changes in the HDL proteome induced by an acute phase response or systemic inflammation likely evolved to enhance this component of the innate immune system.

The studies by Zewinger et al. as reported in this issue of the Journal provide further evidence of the chameleon-like nature of HDL. In the absence of an acute phase response or systemic inflammation, the HDL proteome constitutes anti-inflammatory particles, but in the presence of an acute phase response or systemic inflammation the HDL proteome is remodelled to constitute particles that enhance the inflammatory response (Figure 1). This system likely evolved to provide protection against viral and bacterial infections at a time when humans did not live long enough to suffer from chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. The work of Zewinger et al. suggests that therapies that modulate this aspect of the innate immune system may have the potential to improve the outcomes of such chronic inflammatory diseases.

Figure 1
A schematic representation of the chameleon-like nature of HDL. In the non-inflammatory state, HDL contains little serum amyloid A (SAA) and promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophages, inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases nitric oxide (NO) production from endothelial cells. In the presence of an acute phase response or systemic inflammation the positive acute phase reactant SAA is produced by the liver and other tissues and associates with HDL. In the process of SAA associating with HDL, the HDL proteome is remodelled by reducing cardioprotective proteins associated with HDL. As a result, HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux is reduced, ROS production is stimulated and NO production is decreased, which leads to an enhancement of the inflammatory state.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^115K8y2A]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our literature review indicates that there are many biomarkers that can be used in sepsis, but none has sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be routinely employed in clinical practice. PCT and CRP have been most widely used, but even these have limited abilities to distinguish sepsis from other inflammatory conditions or to predict outcome. In view of the complexity of the sepsis response, it is unlikely that a single ideal biomarker will ever be found. A combination of several sepsis biomarkers may be more effective, but this requires further evaluation.

### The role of complement in the acute phase response after burns [^115w1DMJ]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Severe burns induce a complex systemic inflammatory response characterized by a typical prolonged acute phase response (APR) that starts approximately 4–8h after-burn and persists for months up to a year after the initial burn trauma. During this APR, acute phase proteins (APPs), including C-reactive protein (CRP) and complement (e.g. C3, C4 and C5) are released in the blood, resulting amongst others, in the recruitment and migration of inflammatory cells. Although the APR is necessary for proper wound healing, a prolonged APR can induce local tissue damage, hamper the healing process and cause negative systemic effects in several organs, including the heart, lungs, kidney and the central nervous system. In this review, we will discuss the role of the APR in burns with a specific focus on complement.

### Pentraxins in nephrology: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid P and pentraxin-3 [^114pKM1Y]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Every clinician uses C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a biomarker for systemic inflammation in acute disorders. Nephrologists also consider CRP levels as a predictor for overall mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. But what is the biological function of CRP? CRP is a member of the family of pentraxins, which are small pentameric innate immunity effector proteins. Pentraxins are absent or weakly expressed during homeostasis. However, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor induce CRP and serum amyloid P (SAP) in hepatocytes, whereas the long pentraxins, such as pentraxin (PTX)-3, are produced in peripheral tissues and monocytic phagocytes. Pentraxins opsonize pathogens or other particles such as dead cells, for their phagocytic clearance or induce pathogen killing in extracellular compartments. In this review, we discuss the immunoregulatory properties of the different members of the pentraxin family. We discuss the evolving evidence demonstrating their roles in acute and chronic forms of kidney disease and the significance of SAP and PTX3 as additional biomarkers of innate immune activation and systemic inflammation.

### The systemic inflammatory response syndrome [^115W91vu]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is the body's response to an infectious or noninfectious insult. Although the definition of SIRS refers to it as an "inflammatory" response, it actually has pro- and anti-inflammatory components. This review outlines the pathophysiology of SIRS and highlights potential targets for future therapeutic intervention in patients with this complex entity.

### Clinical implications of inflammation in patients with cirrhosis [^113JDCWe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent work has revealed that metabolic reallocation also occurs in systemic inflammation. Activated innate immune cells have a high metabolic demand, as demonstrated through blood metabolomic work in sepsis and ACLF, and circulating nutrients (fatty acids, amino acids, glucose) are redirected to such cells from peripheral organs. This results in reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate production in peripheral organs leading to dysfunction and failure (Figure 2).

The liver is a component of the innate immune system. PAMPs and proinflammatory cytokines induce increased hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins. Thus, the liver is also a site of vast energy-consuming anabolic metabolism in systemic inflammation. A reduction in negative acute-phase protein synthesis, such as transferrin and albumin, alongside the inhibition of hepatic biotransformation (enzymatic transformation of lipophilic molecules, such as bilirubin, into water soluble molecules) occurs in systemic inflammation to negate the increased energy used in positive acute-phase protein synthesis. In sepsis, proinflammatory cytokines inhibit hepatic biotransformation which results in hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. Together, this suggests that metabolic reallocation also occurs within the liver itself, resulting in deterioration in liver function.

The trigger leading to immune activation and immunopathology remains to be determined; however, 33% of ACLF cases occur in the presence of bacterial infection. Infecting bacteria release PAMPs, unique molecular structures that are recognized by host PRRs, such as TLRs, on the cell surface and NOD-like receptors present in the cytosol of the cell. PRRs then activate transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein 1, which sequentially stimulate the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory molecules, such as TNF-α and IL-6. PAMPs can also translocate from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation in the absence of overt bacterial infection, with resultant activation of the aforementioned inflammatory pathway. Bacterial overgrowth, impaired intestinal immune system function, and increased intestinal permeability have all been demonstrated in patients with AD who develop ACLF, substantiating this hypothesis.

In the absence of bacterial infection and/or bacterial translocation DAMPs, released by injured, dying, or dead cells may stimulate the systemic inflammation seen in ACLF by binding to specific PRRs. Necrosis and other inflammatory types of cell death, such as pyroptosis and necroptosis, are more common in cirrhosis increasing the release of DAMPs. Host genetic factors, such as single-nucleotide variants, may play a role in the inflammatory response of the host immune system to PAMPs and DAMPS.

### Crosstalk between inflammatory mediators and endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver diseases [^113dgPJK]. Cytokine (2019). Medium credibility.

An excessive inflammatory response is frequently associated with cellular dysfunction and cell death. The latter may cause single and multiple organ failure. The most susceptible organs are liver, lung, kidney, heart and intestine. This review will focus on the liver as a target organ for an excessive inflammatory response. It is commonly accepted that organ failure is caused by the action of inflammatory cytokines released in excess during the inflammatory response. It has been suggested that inflammation mediated liver failure is not due to an increased death rate of parenchymal cells, but due to an intracellular metabolic disorder. This metabolic disorder is associated with mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction during the acute phase response elicited by systemic inflammation. An overproduction of acute phase proteins in the liver as well as elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induce ER stress, triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR), which may initiate or aggravate inflammation. It is known that certain inflammatory mediators, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α induce ER stress. These findings suggest that ER stress and the subsequent UPR on the one hand, and the inflammatory response on the other create a kind of feed forward loop, which can be either beneficial (e.g., elimination of the pathogen and restoration of tissue homeostasis) or deleterious (e.g., excessive cell dysfunction and cell death). This review aims to unfurl the different pathways contributing to this loop and to highlight the relevance of UPR signaling (IRE1α, ATF6, and PERK) and mediators of the inflammatory response (NF-κB, STAT3, IL-1β, IL-6, TLR) which have a particular role as pathophysiological triggers in the liver.

### C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease: a critical review [^114TjJkV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Modestly elevated baseline concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase protein, are associated with the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in general populations, whilst the major acute phase response of CRP following myocardial infarction is associated with death and cardiac complications. The pathogenic and clinical significance of these associations is controversial. Here we critically review the evidence and describe large-scale epidemiological studies, novel experiments and possible specific therapies which will rigorously inform the debate. We distinguish between the potential pathogenicity of high acute phase circulating CRP concentrations in individuals with substantial tissue damage and modest but persistent increases in baseline values in generally healthy subjects.

### Acute pancreatitis: current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^1162pSTg]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

THE PROINFLAMMATORY RESPONSE TO AP

Several cytokines have been found to be upregulated in SAP patients, which are likely to contribute to inflammatory responses locally and systemically. Severity of AP is positively correlated with the intensity of inflammation, indicating that the development of therapeutics targeting inflammatory cytokines may inhibit disease progression. –

Inflammatory Cytokines of AP

Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in circulation in patients with SAP. Key molecules regulating cytokine cascade must be identified to aid in development of life-saving therapeutics in SAP patients.

Acute Phase Response in AP

The acute phase response is a broad term used to describe the reaction in an organism shortly after an insult. This response includes several proteins upregulated or downregulated in response to the proinflammatory cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6. – Pancreatic acinar cells produce TNF-α and its receptor and, through this signaling, mediate injury-induced cell death. However, previous research identified no differences in the levels of TNF-α in serum between patients who developed severe or mild AP. In addition, polymorphisms in the gene encoding TNF-α are not associated with an increase in AP susceptibility. Interleukin-1β levels have been shown to correlate with severity of AP; however, mechanistic studies of how IL-1β signaling may be driving disease are lacking. The primary induction of acute phase protein production is caused by IL-6, produced by macrophages. In a cerulein-induced mouse model of AP, IL-6 knockout mice displayed an increased survival rate, which was reversed when exogenous IL-6 was administered. In addition, this study proved that IL-6 signals through STAT3 in acinar cells to stimulate CXCL1 production, a neutrophil chemoattractant, to drive disease progression. These findings were recently further confirmed in a study that found that disease progression and inflammatory cytokine production are reduced via manipulation of upstream regulators of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis in vitro and in vivo. The early release of IL-6 provides an attractive marker of progression in AP; however, rapid IL-6 clearance and the cost of IL-6 quantitation provide major drawbacks for widespread use in the clinic. –

### Origin and physiological roles of inflammation [^116jhmBU]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Inflammation underlies a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Although the pathological aspects of many types of inflammation are well appreciated, their physiological functions are mostly unknown. The classic instigators of inflammation - infection and tissue injury - are at one end of a large range of adverse conditions that induce inflammation, and they trigger the recruitment of leukocytes and plasma proteins to the affected tissue site. Tissue stress or malfunction similarly induces an adaptive response, which is referred to here as para-inflammation. This response relies mainly on tissue-resident macrophages and is intermediate between the basal homeostatic state and a classic inflammatory response. Para-inflammation is probably responsible for the chronic inflammatory conditions that are associated with modern human diseases.

### Connecting the role of C-reactive protein and statins in cardiovascular disease [^112ELBN9]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The observation that almost half of all myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in persons without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has prompted the study of factors other than hyperlipidemia that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation plays a substantial role in plaque progression and rupture. Research interest has increasingly focused on biomarkers of inflammation as a means of predicting more accurately which patients are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical studies indicate that C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, independently predicts cardiovascular risk in healthy persons as well as in persons with established CVD and those with acute ischemia. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to reduce levels of CRP through mechanisms independent of their effects on lipid levels. Initial clinical studies also suggest that CRP levels may have utility in the targeting of statin therapy, particularly in primary prevention. These results need direct testing in large, prospective clinical trials to determine whether statin therapy will benefit persons without overt hyperlipidemia but with evidence of systemic inflammation. Confirmation of these preliminary findings, if incorporated into evidence-based guidelines, may profoundly change the approach to diagnosis and treatment of CVD.

### The combined impact of persistent infections and human genetic variation on C-reactive protein levels [^115esfCD]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation is a complex and necessary response of the immune system to harmful stimuli such as tissue injury, infection, or exposure to toxins. During the acute phase that is characterized by blood flow changes and increased blood vessel permeability, plasma proteins and leukocytes migrate from the circulation to the site of inflammation. This immediate protective response usually enables the elimination of the initial cause of the cell injury and the restoration of homeostasis. However, when the acute response fails to clear tissue damage, for example, because of prolonged exposure to stimuli, inflammation can become a chronic process. A number of common diseases are at least partly caused by chronic inflammation, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Thus, although inflammation plays an important role in human defense against aggression, it also contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple diseases of major public health importance.

Diagnostic tests are capable of detecting the presence and intensity of systemic inflammation. The most commonly used inflammatory biomarker is the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP). This ring-shaped protein is produced by hepatocytes upon stimulation by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a. Although CRP is commonly used as a sensitive indicator of inflammation, the factors influencing its baseline plasma levels are only partially understood. Circulating amounts of CRP are positively associated with age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking and inversely with male sex and physical activity. In addition, large-scale genomic analyses have found multiple associations with hs-CRP levels, mainly in the loci enriched in hepatic, immune, and metabolic pathways, such as CRP, LEPR, IL6R, GCKR, APOE, and HNF1A-AS1. Altogether, genetic variation explains up to 16% of the variance in plasma CRP levels.

To get a more comprehensive view of the factors influencing chronic inflammation in the general population, we used samples and data from the UK Biobank and the CoLaus|PsyCoLaus study to search for associations between baseline CRP levels and chronic infection by persistent/latent pathogens, after careful adjustment for all known demographic, clinical, and genomic influences. Indeed, some infectious agents causing long-term infections in humans have been shown to trigger some degree of local or systemic immune response, resulting in a chronic state of low-grade inflammation that may lead to deleterious health outcomes.

### Inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk: association or cause and effect? [^115kzt4g]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

With the current understanding that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, markers of the associated systemic inflammatory response have been extensively studied as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Recently the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed for risk assessment in individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease. The traditional view of inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, regards them as risk markers rather than risk factors. Either category of marker would serve a diagnostic role, monitor disease activity, and indicate the efficacy of therapy or changing prognosis. However a risk factor with a causal role would be a potential target for therapy. This review discusses the available evidence that argues for and against a causal role for inflammatory biomarkers, with specific reference to CRP, in the atherosclerotic process.

### Biomarkers for sepsis: more than just fever and leukocytosis-a narrative review [^1125Uckm]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

A biomarker describes a measurable indicator of a patient's clinical condition that can be measured accurately and reproducibly. Biomarkers offer utility for diagnosis, prognosis, early disease recognition, risk stratification, appropriate treatment (theranostics), and trial enrichment for patients with sepsis or suspected sepsis. In this narrative review, we aim to answer the question, "Do biomarkers in patients with sepsis or septic shock predict mortality, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or organ dysfunction?" We also discuss the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers associated with intestinal permeability, endothelial injury, organ dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, brain injury, and short and long-term mortality. For sepsis, a range of biomarkers is identified, including fluid phase pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), complement system, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, cell membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors. We also provide an overview of immune response biomarkers that can help identify or differentiate between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. However, significant work is needed to identify the optimal combinations of biomarkers that can augment diagnosis, treatment, and good patient outcomes.

### C-reactive protein and hypertension [^113dFn1e]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototypical acute-phase reactant, is one of the most widely known biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. Circulating levels of CRP are clinically used to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular events and to aide in the selection of therapies based on more accurate risk assessment in individuals who are at intermediate risk. This paper reviews the role of CRP in hypertension. In hypertensive individuals, CRP levels associate with vascular stiffness, atherosclerosis and the development of end-organ damage and cardiovascular events. Data suggest that some anti-hypertensive medications may lower CRP levels in a manner independent of their effect on blood pressure. In individuals who are normotensive at baseline, CRP levels have been shown in multiple cohorts to foretell the development of hypertension on follow-up. Whether genetic variability that influences circulating levels of CRP independent of environmental and behavioral factors can also be used in a similar manner to predict the change in blood pressure and development of hypertension is controversial. In addition to its role as a biomarker, experimental studies have unraveled an active direct participation of CRP in the development of endothelial dysfunction, vascular stiffness and elevated blood pressure. CRP has also been implicated as a mediator of vascular remodeling in response to injury and cardiac remodeling in response to pressure overload. Emerging data may reveal novel vascular inflammatory pathways and identify new targets for treatment of vascular pathology.

### C-reactive protein predicts outcome in COVID-19: is it also a therapeutic target? [^113UQF6d]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Following our original report of the predictive significance of CRP and serum amyloid A protein measurement in acute coronary syndrome, there was intense cardiological interest in CRP, producing much controversial, confusing, and misleading literature. The early observational epidemiology studies, based on a limited number of events despite large population sizes, exaggerated the significance of the association between increased baseline CRP values and cardiovascular disease risk. The conflation of association with causality popularized the idea that CRP was a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, not just a possible risk marker, and this misconception became widespread despite the general agreement that, for example, the cock crowing before dawn is not actually what causes the sun to rise. The misapprehension was strengthened by poorly conducted and uncontrolled experimental work purporting, falsely, to show that CRP is an inherently proinflammatory mediator of atherosclerosis; see, for example, Pepys.

In fact, the predictive association between baseline CRP and cardiovascular disease risk in general populations is modest. It is shared equally by other markers of inflammation such as fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, and white cell count, and reflects the fact that most of the proven causal risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, smoking, lack of exercise, low socioeconomic status, and chronic low grade inflammatory conditions, are all associated with low grade systemic inflammation and modestly increased baseline CRP values. Even the very limited clinical utility of CRP measurement for cardiovascular disease risk is likely to be outweighed if increased CRP values are used by cardiologists exclusively for this purpose and not considered in the whole-patient context. This risks missing serious underlying diseases. On the other hand, full investigation before CRP testing has been repeated, to ensure that a raised value is persistent, will often reveal nothing but will incur large costs and provoke much spurious anxiety. Clinical CRP testing must be done and interpreted properly.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^116y976p]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Serum CRP levels correlate with the severity of COVID-19 and mortality

Severe cases of COVID-19 develop a hyperinflammatory response, leading to a pathological dysfunction of innate host defense systems. Complications include cytokine release syndrome (i.e. cytokine storm) and multiple organ failure. Fundamental to all pathologies is tissue damage, which, when severe enough, leads to organ dysfunction and death. As CRP blood levels correlate with activation of the acute phase response, they represent a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess the degree of tissue damage ongoing in that patient at the time of measurement. Tan et al.reported significantly increased CRP levels in initial stages of COVID-19 disease, with levels correlated with the severity of disease and the degree of internal tissue pathologies as measured using CT technology. C-reactive protein levels that rapidly return to baseline are an index of resolving tissue damage as may occur with favorable patient responses to treatments. At the early stage of COVID-19, CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions. C-reactive protein levels could reflect disease severity and should be used as a key indicator for disease monitoring. Table 1 summarizes recent data highlighting the correlation between CRP levels and severity of COVID-19 infection.

### Dysregulation of complement and coagulation pathways: emerging mechanisms in the development of psychosis [^116QbPEK]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Complement and coagulation protein synthesis

In response to infection or injury, immune cells express inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, causing hepatocytes to secrete acute phase proteins, including the complement and coagulation proteins. The acute phase response to cytokine signaling induces profound changes in the plasma proteome. There is evidence of increased levels of IL-6 in schizophrenia patients, and other proinflammatory cytokines were observed to be increased in CHR individuals who later developed psychosis compared to those who did not, linking inflammatory cytokines to complement and coagulation protein expression. While the liver is the primary site of synthesis for acute phase proteins, extrahepatic synthesis of complement and coagulation components has been reported at serum‐restricted sites.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^111vTwGY]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients despite the use of modern antibiotics and resuscitation therapies. The septic response is an extremely complex chain of events involving inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes, humoral and cellular reactions and circulatory abnormalities. The diagnosis of sepsis and evaluation of its severity is complicated by the highly variable and non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms of sepsis. However, the early diagnosis and stratification of the severity of sepsis is very important, increasing the possibility of starting timely and specific treatment.

Biomarkers can have an important place in this process because they can indicate the presence or absence or severity of sepsis, and can differentiate bacterial from viral and fungal infection, and systemic sepsis from local infection. Other potential uses of biomarkers include roles in prognostication, guiding antibiotic therapy, evaluating the response to therapy and recovery from sepsis, differentiating Gram-positive from Gram-negative microorganisms as the cause of sepsis, predicting sepsis complications and the development of organ dysfunction (heart, kidneys, liver or multiple organ dysfunction). However, the exact role of biomarkers in the management of septic patients remains undefined. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been used for many years but its specificity has been challenged. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been proposed as a more specific and better prognostic marker than CRP, although its value has also been challenged. It remains difficult to differentiate sepsis from other non-infectious causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and there is a continuous search for better biomarkers of sepsis.

With this background in mind, we reviewed the literature on sepsis biomarkers that have been used in clinical or experimental studies to help better evaluate their utility.

### The relation between inflammatory biomarkers and drug pharmacokinetics in the critically ill patients: a scoping review [^113ro93D]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Inflammation, a complex biological response triggered by harmful stimuli, can escalate into a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in critically ill patients, impacting multiple organs and systems. This systemic inflammation, often observed in conditions such as sepsis, is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). These biomarkers serve as crucial indicators for the development of complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and can also be used to predict and monitor the progression of diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and delirium in the ICU.

Existing research has demonstrated that inflammation can trigger changes in a patient's physiological state that might change the drug pharmacokinetics. Recent studies in non-ICU wards have revealed a significant correlation between inflammatory status and drug PK. Numerous studies have demonstrated a significant association between inflammatory biomarkers and the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and membrane transporters, key components of drug metabolism and disposition. Given that inflammation is more prevalent and more intense among critically ill patients-often triggered by infections, surgeries, severe burns, trauma, or tumors -this relationship warrants closer examination in the critical care setting. The intensity of inflammation in the critically ill together with the frequent occurrence of organ failure renders extrapolating of these findings from non-ICU ward patients to critically ill patients uncertain.

Inflammatory biomarkers propose a promising approach for assessing severity of the inflammatory response, organ function and disease progression in greater detail. Understanding the intricate relationship between drug exposure and changes in biomarker dynamics is critical for advancing precision dosing strategies in critically ill populations. A deeper insight into this relationship is crucial, as it holds the potential to refine precision dosing strategies in critically ill patients thereby improving patient outcomes.

Thus, this review endeavors to synthesize the existing evidence regarding the relation between inflammatory biomarkers and pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients. The purposes of this study are to reveal how inflammation changes drug behavior in this vulnerable patient group, which may provide inspiration for future pharmacokinetic clinical trials in critically ill patients that ultimately improve patient outcomes in the future.

### Pentraxins, humoral innate immunity and tissue injury [^113FgDTR]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Tissue damage elicits an inflammatory response, which comprises the rapid synthesis of acute phase molecules. The early local response shapes the resolution of inflammation. Pentraxins are evolutionary conserved soluble pattern recognition receptors, produced in the liver (e.g. C-reactive protein) or at sites of inflammation (the long pentraxin PTX3). Pentraxins behave as flexible adaptors of innate cell functions, complement activation and clearance of cell and matrix debris, regulating tissue hyperplasia and scarring and limiting the risk of autoimmunity associated to unscheduled cell death in vivo.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^115E8bEe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The interplay among acute-phase proteins, infections and outcomes in patients with SE may be elucidated by recent findings, focusing on the interrelationships of systemic inflammatory reactions and epileptic activity. During acute inflammation, cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are released, which subsequently induce acute-phase responses. There is a growing body of evidence for the value of acute-phase proteins to predict mortality in the early phase of diseases in neurocritically ill patients.

Serum albumin, a negative acute-phase protein, has been shown to decrease by about 20% in inflammatory states. Low serum albumin has been identified as a predictor of death in acute ischemic stroke, underscoring the impact of acute inflammatory reactions in critically ill patients. The results of our univariable comparisons between survivors and non-survivors in the present study confirm our previous findings that low serum albumin is a predictor of mortality in SE. However, PCT was not included in our prior study. In our current multivariable model, including albumin, CRP, and PCT serum levels, albumin did not remain an independent predictor of death and a GOS of 1–3; these results are most likely explained by the fact that in our current multivariable model PCT was added as a new predictor, which overpowered the predictive value of albumin and CRP serum levels.

### Skin inflammation, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular disease in psoriasis… [^1174kaNX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does systemic inflammation play a role in the association between skin disease severity and cardiovascular disease in psoriasis. Findings In this cohort study including 769 patients, glycan biomarker of N-acetyl side chains of acute-phase proteins, a measure of systemic inflammation, mediated 17% of the association between the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index — a measure of skin disease severity — and subclinical atherosclerosis and 37% of the association between PASI and cardiovascular events. The indirect effect was statistically significant in both studies. Meaning Systemic inflammation may play a role in the association between skin disease severity and CVD in psoriasis. Importance Psoriasis is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.

Elucidating these mechanisms can help develop treatment strategies and enhance understanding of the link between peripheral inflammation, such as psoriatic skin lesions, and cardiovascular disease. Psoriasis skin disease severity was measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, and systemic inflammation was measured using glycan biomarker of N-acetyl side chains of acute-phase proteins. Mediation analysis was performed by evaluating the associations between exposure, mediator, and outcome in patients with first-tertile and third-tertile PASI scores when GlycA level was set at the level observed in patients with first-tertile PASI. In both studies, PASI was associated with GlycA level and CVD, and GlycA level was associated with CVD. The direct and indirect effects of PASI on NCB were estimated at 0. 94 and
0. 19, respectively.

The odds ratios for the direct and indirect effects of PASI on cardiovascular events were estimated at 1. 23 and

1. 16, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, skin disease severity measured using PASI was associated with systemic inflammation, and both PASI and systemic inflammation, measured using GlycA levels, were associated with CVD. The association between PASI and CVD may be mediated by systemic inflammation. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Recent advances in vascular inflammation: C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers [^117AHHmf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inflammatory vascular diseases are initiated and perpetuated by the interaction of immune cells with cells of the affected vessel wall. This is directed by a network of chemical messengers, which, in a state of vascular health, exist as balanced but opposing forces. Our understanding of this highly complex process has advanced significantly in the last several decades. The detection of vascular inflammation and monitoring of this activity have long been attempted in systemic vasculitis, and, more recently, in atherosclerosis. Markers of vascular inflammation used thus far have been of limited value; few provide both adequate sensitivity and specificity for any particular disease. New insights into the pathophysiology of vascular inflammation have identified other potential markers that may improve detection and monitoring of these conditions.

Recent Findings

Immunomodulatory mediators of the inflammatory cascade have been identified, and their roles are being defined. There are recent data that implicate various cytokines, proteases, adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins as participants in the generation of vascular inflammation.

Conclusion

The pursuit of highly sensitive and specific markers of vascular inflammation has produced a wealth of information that has been instrumental in advancing our comprehension of this complex process. Further studies will establish the role of these new markers in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of inflammatory vascular disease.

### Antibodies against acute phase proteins and their functions in the pathogenesis of disease: a collective profile of 25 different antibodies [^114WYyKg]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

The acute phase response is a defense system in which the innate immune response is activated following injury or infection. Positive and negative acute phase proteins (APPs) are crucial for protecting the host organism, as well as returning it to homeostatic levels, the first with elevated concentrations and the latter with decreased concentrations during the acute phase. Reports about the presence of antibodies against APPs are known, however their individual, as well as potentially collective, pathological or physiological roles are still emerging. Some of these autoantibodies are specifically connected with diseases (such as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and C3, C4 nephritic factors), while others have been reported as natural antibodies. The persistent presence (even if only minor) of autoantibodies in healthy blood donors indicates an overlapping category of autoantibodies, which could become pathogenic, depending on the autoantibody characteristics such as avidity, epitope specificity, changes in the microenvironment leading to different oxidative status and others. This review uses the novel approach of studying the overall autoantibody population against APPs, their functions and connections to diseases. The primary function of autoantibodies against APPs (anti-APPs) is thought to promote their clearance, however autoantibodies against negative APPs have also been found and applying the same role to those is doubtful. There is also the theory of consumption in the stage of inflammation, which could be relevant to anti-APPs. Reports about protective roles of autoantibodies are also emerging, showing lowered levels of antibodies in diseases, which could be interesting for therapeutic intervention.

### Emerging roles of the acute phase protein pentraxin-3 during central nervous system disorders [^113wbtM1]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2016). Low credibility.

Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is an acute phase protein (APP) and a member of the long pentraxin family that is recognised for its role in peripheral immunity and vascular inflammation in response to injury, infection and diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer and respiratory disease. Systemic levels of PTX3 are highly elevated in these conditions, and PTX3 is now recognised as a new biomarker of disease risk and progression. There is extensive evidence demonstrating that central nervous system (CNS) disorders are primarily characterised by central activation of innate immunity, as well as activation of a potent peripheral acute phase response (APR) that influences central inflammation and contributes to poor outcome. PTX3 has been recently recognised to play important roles in CNS disorders, having both detrimental and neuroprotective effects. The present review aims to give an up-to-date account of the emerging roles of PTX3 in CNS disorders, and to provide a critical comparison between peripheral and central actions of PTX3 in inflammatory diseases.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^113nYA88]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure–function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### Understanding the somatic consequences of depression: biological mechanisms and the role of depression symptom profile [^116bBXAK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Another possible mechanism linking metabolic dysregulation and depression may be represented by cerebrovascular damage associated with metabolic syndrome, which have been hypothesized to predispose people to depression, especially in late-life. Finally, other depression-related biological dysregulations described in this review may constitute shared underlying pathways to metabolic alterations. For instance, adipose tissue expresses a high density of glucocorticoid receptors, and their binding with cortisol activates lipoprotein lipase and inhibits lipid mobilization, leading to an accumulation of triglycerides. Similarly, sympathetic nervous system overactivation is connected to high blood pressure.

Immuno-inflammatory dysregulation

A consistent body of evidence indicates that depression is associated with dysregulated inflammation, an immune response that derives from activation of the innate immune system. The inflammatory mediators' network is represented by a bewildering array of molecules, the most prominent of which are proinflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) produced within innate immune cells in response to immunologic challenge. Other cytokines, known as anti-inflammatory, oppose this response by attenuating the production of proinflammatory cytokines (for example, IL-10) or by antagonizing their action at the receptor level (for example, IL-1RA). In turn, the actions of proinflammatory cytokines on peripheral cellular targets, such as hepatocytes, lead to the synthesis of acute phase proteins (for example, CRP) responsible for the systemic inflammatory response. The link between depression and inflammation was initially suggested by clinical findings showing that depression is accompanied by up-regulated inflammatory response, such as an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase reactive proteins. Systemic elevations of these molecules in the absence of infection or tissue injury are considered abnormal and increase the onset of, for example, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mortality. There is a strong interconnection between metabolic abnormalities and inflammation illustrated by the facts that abdominal fat tissue produces cytokines and these, subsequently, increase metabolic syndrome development.

### Investigation of the blood proteome in response to spinal cord injury in rodent models [^1146ncHk]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Studying the plasma proteome of rats following a complete injury demonstrated that up to 112 days after injury protein differences can be observed between SCI and sham injured animals. These proteins can provide an insight into the potential reparative and/or degenerative processes that continue longitudinally post-SCI. As with the contusion model, our pathway analyses have highlighted that changes within the blood occur in response to SCI, such as in the extrinsic prothrombin activation pathway and the coagulation system, and this model highlights that these may go on being implicated for a long period of time following injury. We have previously demonstrated that red blood cell (RBC) measures (RBCs, haematocrit and mean cell haemoglobin) in the blood of humans with SCI at 7 ± 4 days post-SCI correlate with initial AIS motor and sensory scores, confirming that systemic release of red blood cell measures may be indicative of injury severity.

Changes in acute phase response signalling were identified at both the sub-acute (14 day) and chronic (112 day) timepoints following complete injury and the acute (1 day) and sub-acute (7 day) timepoints following contusion injury, highlighting that changes in the acute phase response continue longitudinally post-SCI. Acute phase response signalling is the first systemic response to trauma, therefore it is unsurprising that in the case of SCI, this signalling pathway is activated. This signalling cascade is triggered by inflammatory cytokines which leads to drastically changed protein synthesis by the liver and resultant release of the acute phase proteins. Therefore this signalling pathway provides an attractive target for novel therapies, potentially by targeting upstream inflammatory cytokines using biologic therapies. Changes in this pathway, along with identified changes in LXR/RXR activation, add strength to our previous findings also highlighting the importance of considering the effect of SCI on other organ systems aside from the nervous system, such as the liver, in contributing to clinical outcome following SCI. In future studies, it would be interesting to assess whether differences in acute-phase response signalling in the different phases of injury exist between individuals with varying injury severities and/or who either do or do not show long-term neurological improvements.

### Biomarkers for sepsis: more than just fever and leukocytosis-a narrative review [^111UCr3g]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A biomarker describes a measurable indicator of biological status in normal and pathogenic processes. It may be helpful as a theranostic for identifying suitable patients for therapeutic intervention and titrating the degree and/or duration of intervention. A biomarker should be accurate and reproducible. In the ideal scenario, the biomarker (or combination of biomarkers) should offer both high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing a condition, but either alone may be adequate as a 'rule-in' or 'rule-out' test.

Sepsis represents a dysregulated immune response to infection that leads to organ dysfunction. Host response biomarkers play a critical role in diagnosis, early recognition of organ dysfunction, risk stratification, prognostication, and patient management, including antibiotic stewardship. Biomarkers may also be helpful for trial enrichment to identify suitable patients and/or risk categorization for an intervention. A wide range of biomarkers, measured by a host of different technologies, are being investigated to discriminate a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) rapidly, which is an excessive defensive body's response to a harmful stressor (for example, infection, trauma, surgery, acute inflammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or cancer) or early identification of infection-triggered organ dysfunction (sepsis). Also, the quick sepsis related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) is intended to raise suspicion of sepsis and encourage additional action; although, qSOFA is not a substitute for SIRS. These biomarkers include measurement of acute-phase proteins, cytokines, chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), endothelial cell markers, leukocyte surface markers, non-coding RNAs, miRNA, and soluble receptors, as well as metabolites and alterations in gene expression (transcriptomics). Biomarkers may help stratify septic patients into biological phenotypes, for example, hyperinflammatory versus immunosuppressive. Biomarkers can also be used to identify gut permeability, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, probability of hospital readmission, and longer-term outcomes.

### Persistent serum protein signatures define an inflammatory subcategory of long COVID [^114v3KSY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

New, recurrent, or prolonged symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID. A systematic review of 38 papers reported that one-third or more of surviving COVID-19 participants experienced at least one PASC symptom during the 2–5 months after the onset of acute infection. PASC symptoms are numerous and varied, impacting virtually every major organ system, and can last for weeks or months. Recent Delphi consensus criteria propose that PASC be defined as having at least 60 days of symptoms persisting for a minimum of 90 days post-symptom onset. However, the published literature is inconsistent, defining PASC as persistent symptoms for 30–120 days post-symptom onset –. Despite the large number of individuals affected, the lack of consensus diagnostic criteria or standardized outcome measures impede efforts to effectively group persons to establish clinical etiologies or to evaluate outcomes of therapeutic trials. There are a limited number of clearly defined and validated molecular markers of disease, or definitive diagnostic tests. To make matters more complicated, it is recognized that similar clinical symptoms could arise after acute infection regardless of whether they were caused by persistent inflammatory disease initiated by the viral immune response, unresolved organ or tissue damage, or delayed viral clearance. Identification of molecular features capable of mechanistically defining the heterogeneity of PASC could be transformative, allowing clinicians and researchers to better subset participants for clinical trials and highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Here, we use the Olink proteomics platform to analyze the serum proteome of 55 unvaccinated adults with PASC who were infected with the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2. We show that a subset of PASC patients have evidence of persistent inflammation. Among those with persistent inflammation, individuals with PASC, cluster into two groups: One, dominated by increased Interferon-γ, a signature of type II IFN-driven inflammation, NF-κB activation, and increased inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine receptors. The second, dominated by a signature of persistent neutrophil activation, NF-κB activation, and type I IFN-driven inflammation. The findings suggest that the identified inflammatory serum protein signature could be used to stratify patients for clinical trials of immunomodulatory drugs to identify individuals that may benefit most from treatment. The signature or the component proteins may also be useful biomarkers to evaluate therapeutic responses.

### Systemic inflammation impairs myelopoiesis and interferon type I responses in humans [^114uHYQR]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Systemic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of several diseases, such as sepsis and viral infections, including COVID-19, and contributes to 20% of global mortality –. Systemic inflammation is classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, often termed as 'cytokine storm', followed by a late immunosuppressive phasethat renders patients susceptible to secondary infections. This sustained refractory state of the immune system is associated with high late-onset mortality –. Despite the substantial burden on healthcare systems, unraveling the molecular mechanisms underpinning systemic inflammation-related pathogenicity is extremely difficult, as a result of extensive heterogeneity in terms of inflammation onset time, etiology, site of infection and underlying comorbidities. Mouse models of systemic inflammation are ubiquitously used and valuable, but suffer from important interspecies differences and poorly replicate the human inflammatory response, thereby limiting translatability.

The human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation, also known as experimental endotoxemia, is a tightly controlled systemic inflammation model in which healthy volunteers are injected with bacterial LPS intravenously to elicit transient but profound acute hyperinflammation, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase. Previous studies utilizing the experimental endotoxemia model primarily conducted transcriptomic analyses at the whole-blood level and focused on the hyperinflammatory phase, thereby limiting the ability to dissect unbiased cell-type-specific effects of systemic inflammation and examine the mechanistic underpinnings of the immunosuppressive phase.

In the present study, we combined massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cellular functional assays to characterize the hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive phases after LPS administration in peripheral blood and bone marrow leukocytes. Leveraging of publicly available large cohorts of patients with sepsis and COVID-19 indicated the clinical relevance of our comprehensive longitudinal dataset. Our results identified conserved gene expression programs, mainly in monocytes and T cells, during the acute LPS-induced hyperinflammatory phase, early sepsis and COVID-19. In the immunosuppressive phase, we observed a significant impairment of monocyte functionality and maturation accompanied by decreased interferon type I (IFN-I) signaling that could be restored by IFNβ treatment.

### The acute inflammatory response and its regulation… [^115y8KuM]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

In this situation, cytokines are detectable in the plasma, suggesting unregulated generation of these highly inflammatory peptides. 1 Under such conditions multiorgan failure often occurs. What remains to be determined is why, during sepsis, there is uncontrolled production of cytokines and how these cytokines may be involved in multiorgan failure. The inflammatory pathways in this particular model are very similar to events related to lung injury caused by ischemia, 3 by the presence of bacteria, 4 or by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. 5 These events trigger complement activation as well as activation of tissue macrophages. Activated macrophages generate the "early response cytokines, " TNF-α and IL-1. The entry of neutrophils into the alveolar compartment together with tissue-activated macrophages sets the stage for injury of both lung cells and matrix glycoproteins.

Injury is related to generation of oxidants by phagocytic cells and the release of proteases.
10. Those changes set the stage for the 26S proteosome to enzymatically cleave IκB. The liberated NF-κB complex can then translocate to the nucleus, engage DNA-promoter sequences, and cause transcriptional up-regulation of mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1, and ICAM-1. Details of the NF-κB pathway are especially relevant to understanding how the inflammatory system is regulated by certain interleukins. As described above, the experimental model of IgG immune complex–induced acute alveolitis is known to be self-regulated. After 4 hours, there is no further progression in the albumin leak, cessation in further neutrophil recruitment, and rapid disappearance of mediators such as TNF-α.

There is evidence that these inflammatory reactions also initiate the appearance of a series of regulatory cytokines that prevent continuation of the inflammatory response. These mediators cause expression of vascular adhesion molecules that facilitate the recruitment of blood leukocytes, especially neutrophils. Injury resulting from the inflammatory response is due to phagocytic cell production of oxidants and proteases. Central to generation of inflammatory mediators is activation in phagocytic cells of NF-κB.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^116EVoyT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Newer CV risk stratification strategies incorporating hs-CRP (e.g. Reynolds Risk Score) have also been shown to improve risk stratification better than algorithms incorporating only traditional risk factors. There is also evidence from several landmark statin trials that on-treatment hs-CRP levels predict the likelihood of CV events. Although there is increasing evidence that CRP may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the question of whether reduction in CRP levels and/or its associated downstream effects will provide novel therapeutic avenues to reduce CV risk requires further investigation.

CV diseases are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Recent efforts directed at primary prevention of atherosclerosis have significantly reduced the incidence of initial clinical presentation of atherosclerosis. It is well established that patients with known diabetes or other traditional CV risk factors have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, 15–20% of major CV events occur in patients with no major traditional CV risk factors. As a result, recent preventive efforts have been directed at finding newer, nontraditional, biomarkers to improve risk stratification, particularly in otherwise apparently low-risk individuals.

hs-CRP, previously considered to be an indicator of systemic inflammation, has recently received much attention in the scientific literature, not only as a potential marker of increased atherosclerotic risk, but also as a potential target of therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In this review, we discuss whether hs-CRP should indeed be a target for therapy in the prevention of CV disease as well as other potential clinical implications related to hs-CRP.

### Distinct patterns of vital sign and inflammatory marker responses in adults with suspected bloodstream infection [^116tARss]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Timely initiation of active antimicrobials is an important priority in sepsis, but blood cultures identify a pathogen in only up to 30–40% of bloodstream infections (BSI). Hence, most antimicrobials are started, and often continued, empirically. In this context, key questions include "how do I know my patient is responding to treatment?" and "when should I switch antibiotics?" as potentially not providing adequate treatment in some patients leads to more severe infections and higher mortality. Conversely, over use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, either initially or as escalation for inadequate response contributes risks increasing antimicrobial resistance and hence worse outcomes over the longer term.

Where blood cultures are negative or results not yet available, laboratory test results (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and white blood cell (WBC) counts) and vital signs (e.g. temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate) can guide treatment decisions. Scoring systems, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, can also provide insights into status and risk of deterioration. Among these, the role of serial CRP measurements in monitoring treatment response has been previously studied. Patterns of relative CRP change (i.e. ratio of measurements on day 4 or 5 to those at baseline) has been found to correlate with clinical outcomes. However, host responses are heterogeneous, both at presentation and throughout infections, due to factors such as the causative pathogens, sources of infection, and individual patient characteristics. The relationship between routinely collected clinical parameters and these factors has not been well described.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention in adults [^114uBeWh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition definitions and inflammatory context — diagnoses and biomarker interpretation are described as follows: diagnoses include "(1) starvation-related malnutrition, which is chronic starvation without inflammation, (2) chronic disease–related malnutrition, where inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and (3) acute disease or injury–related malnutrition, where inflammation is acute and severe", and "Inflammation and related compensatory mechanisms associated with disease or injury may cause anorexia and alterations in body composition and stress metabolism". For laboratory markers, "experts have advised that albumin and prealbumin not be used in isolation to assess nutrition status because they are fundamentally markers of inflammatory metabolism", while "Positive acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein are also potent predictors of morbidity and mortality and are elevated in the presence of inflammation".

### Infection and inflammation decrease apolipoprotein M expression [^115YNsKP]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Inflammation can produce abnormalities that could increase the risk for atherosclerosis including alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Apolipoprotein M is a recently described HDL-associated apoprotein expressed mainly in the liver and kidney with protective effects against atherosclerosis. In this study, we describe the regulation of apolipoprotein M during the acute phase response. Stimuli that produce systemic inflammation, LPS, zymosan, or turpentine, decrease apolipoprotein M mRNA levels in the liver and kidney. Treatment of Hep3B hepatoma cells with TNF or IL-1 also decreased apolipoprotein M mRNA levels. The decrease in apolipoprotein M mRNA leads to a decrease in apolipoprotein M secretion into the media in Hep3B cells and a decrease in mouse serum following LPS administration. Moreover, in humans with acute bacterial infections or chronic HIV infection, serum apolipoprotein M levels are decreased. Apolipoprotein M is a negative acute response protein that decreases during infection and inflammation. These results are consistent with the finding that infections and inflammatory disorders accompanied by systemic inflammation are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis.

### Sepsis biomarkers in unselected patients on admission to intensive or high-dependency care [^115xkibi]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a common reason for admission to intensive care and high dependency units and the incidence of sepsis continues to rise. The symptoms and signs of sepsis are highly variable and this makes clinical recognition and assessment of severity difficult. At key decision points, such as at the point of admission to high dependency care, doctors are confronted with conflicting pressures. On one hand there is a drive to minimise unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and on the other, there is compelling evidence that timely and specific administration of antibiotics saves lives. Biomarkers can inform decision making in this situation both by indicating the presence or absence of infection in a patient who has a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and as measures of severity or prognosis.

A recent review of the sepsis biomarker literature identified 178 biomarkers evaluated in 3,370 studies and yet only two have become widely used. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been in use for over 20 years but has poor specificity unless high cut-off levels are used. Procalcitonin (PCT) appears to be more specific for infection and, unlike CRP, its levels appear to reflect severity and prognosis. However, a recent meta-analysis challenged this and subsequent controlled trials of PCT-guided treatment of sepsis have produced conflicting results. There remains an urgent need for better markers of sepsis.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^114coeC1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has continued to extend over most of the world, infecting several millions of people and causing more than 250,000 deaths to date (, accessed on May 6, 2020). There has been an intense focus on technologies to diagnose infections by the virus and to assess the prevalence of the infection. Equally important, there has been an unprecedented effort to identify and develop drugs, vaccines, and technologies to treat and prevent further infections as well as to assess disease severity and reduce mortality in affected patients. The purpose of this article was to offer an insight into the potential use of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a diagnostic index of disease severity and a guide for therapeutic options in COVID-19–infected patients.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving acute inflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and multiple organ failure. Consistent blood markers in afflicted patients are normal to low white cell counts and elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels which, among its many activities, signal the liver to increase synthesis and secretion of CRP. –

C-reactive protein is a widely used diagnostic marker primarily used to assess ongoing inflammation. It is a key protein of the acute phase response, appears in blood within 6–10 hours of any tissue damaging event, has a plasma half-life of 19 hours, and is produced without a memory response. Although its appearance in blood is associated with ongoing inflammatory responses, it does not selectively accumulate into any tissue or organ even in patients known to have ongoing, prominent inflammation. Furthermore, its fractional catabolic rate is independent of its plasma concentration, indicating its rapidly changing blood concentration more nearly reflects on its synthesis rate and not its consumption rate.

### Prohibitin-1 is a dynamically regulated blood protein with cardioprotective effects in sepsis [^111ZmLg9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute phase reactants have been defined as proteins whose concentration in the blood change from baseline (up or down) by > 25% during an inflammatory response. While it may be premature to call PHB1 a bona fide acute phase reactant at this point, it is clear that PHB1 fits these criteria as shown in Figure 1. The principal source of acute phase reactants during sepsis is the liver, and, while we have not definitively shown that liver is the only source of circulating PHB1, it is clear from Figure 3 that hepatocytes dramatically ramp up PHB1 expression and secretion in response to lipopolysaccharide, and PHB1 secretion, but not expression, is regulated by Nrf2. Acute phase proteins have diverse actions in the host, ranging from coordination of both pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory responses, to recruitment of innate immune cells and regulation of vascular permeability and hemostasis. Some of these proteins possess both pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory effects, depending on dose and time. An example of this is CRP (C‐reactive protein), which is essential for coordinating clearance of foreign pathogens and activation of the complement system. However, the overproduction of CRP in transgenic mice can also be anti‐inflammatory and protective in models of septic shock. This is thought to be due in large part to the inhibiting effect of CRP and its degradation products on neutrophil activation and extravasation. Whether circulating PHB1 is having a similar effect on complement and neutrophils remains to be determined, since recent studies on PHBs in the innate immune system have focused solely on the intracellular signaling roles of these proteins, ignoring their role in the circulation.

### Systemic inflammatory response to exhaustive exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113EDwcj]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation may be present in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exercise is known to elicit an inflammatory response. We hypothesized that the systemic inflammatory response to exercise might be exaggerated in COPD patients compared to healthy subjects. Sixteen COPD patients and 11 healthy subjects performed a maximal incremental bicycle test. Before and at maximal exercise arterial blood samples were taken to determine circulating catecholamines, (subsets of) leukocytes, acute phase proteins, creatine kinase and myoglobin. At rest, increased levels of norepinephrine and systemic inflammation were present in COPD. The response of catecholamines to exercise was lower in COPD patients (P < 0.01), which in part was due to the lower maximal exercise capacity of these patients (P < 0.01). Exercise-induced leukocytosis showed similar responses in both groups, but occurred at higher levels in COPD. Although patients had increased levels of CRP at rest (P < 0.001), exercise did not affect acute phase proteins. No systemic signs of muscle damage were found. The present study shows that COPD patients are exposed to systemic inflammation that is intensified by exhaustive exercise. The inflammatory response in COPD is not exaggerated compared to healthy subjects but occurs at a higher level and is observed at lower external workload.

### Biomarkers of sepsis [^112AG7JL]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A complex network of biological mediators underlies the clinical syndrome of sepsis. The nonspecific physiologic criteria of sepsis syndrome or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome do not adequately identify patients who might benefit from either conventional anti-infective therapies or from novel therapies that target specific mediators of sepsis. Validated biomarkers of sepsis may improve diagnosis and therapeutic decision making for these high-risk patients.

Objectives

To develop a methodologic framework for the identification and validation of biomarkers of sepsis.

Methods

A small group meeting of experts in clinical epidemiology, biomarker development, and sepsis clinical trials; selective narrative review of the biomarker literature.

Results

The utility of a biomarker is a function of the degree to which it adds value to the available clinical information in the domains of screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of the response to therapy. We identified needs for greater standardization of biomarker methodologies, greater methodologic rigor in biomarker studies, wider integration of biomarkers into clinical studies (in particular, early phase studies), and increased collaboration among investigators, pharmaceutical industry, biomarker industry, and regulatory agencies.

Conclusions

Biomarkers promise to transform sepsis from a physiologic syndrome to a group of distinct biochemical disorders. This transformation could aid therapeutic decision making, and hence improve the prognosis for patients with sepsis, but will require an unprecedented degree of systematic investigation and collaboration.

### Sequential C-reactive protein measurements in patients with serious infections: does it help? [^117Rowvf]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation traditionally used as a complementary tool to support the clinical diagnosis and as a marker of severity of disease. CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by cytokines and its serum levels increase markedly within hours after the onset of infection, inflammation or tissue injury. Dynamic serial measurement of CRP has been widely used to help therapeutic decision-making. Decreasing plasma concentrations of this biomarker have been used as an indicator for resolution of infection or sepsis.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^114CfKiv]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Inflammation and malnutrition classification — identifying the presence and severity of inflammation is crucial to characterizing and assessing malnutrition, and with the vast majority of nutrition screening and assessment tools, characterization of disease burden or inflammation is considered a foundational criterion to appropriately assess and diagnose malnutrition. Of the 3 etiologic types of malnutrition proposed by The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) consensus characteristics for the identification of adult malnutrition, malnutrition related to both acute and chronic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation, whereas starvation-related malnutrition is not, and inflammation is also recognized as a key component in the definition of illness-related pediatric malnutrition. Hospitalized patients with severe inflammatory responses (defined as C-reactive protein [CRP] > 100 mg/L) did not demonstrate a strong, measurable response to nutrition support in a large randomized controlled trial.

### Development and validation of a novel molecular biomarker diagnostic test for the early detection of sepsis [^117VksWQ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) is an overwhelming whole body reaction that may have an infectious or non-infectious aetiology and is described in association with critical conditions that include, but are not limited to, pancreatitis, ischemia, trauma and severe tissue injury, including that encountered in patients having major surgery. Major open surgery is a controlled form of physical insult that results in varying degrees of systemic inflammation. To date, it has been reported that the occurrence of SIRS following cardiac bypass surgery, is common, as well as being a major cause of postoperative complications including death. In particular, Michalopoulos and colleagues observed that within the immediate 12 hours following Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery, 100% of their study population (n = 2,615) had clinical signs and symptoms consistent with SIRS. This SIRS response is also known to occur post-operatively following other types of major procedures; however, only in cardiac surgical patients has this uniformity of response been demonstrated in the intensive care setting.

### What does minor elevation of C-reactive protein signify? [^116sJTRY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Reports of the predictive value of minor elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (between 3 and 10 mg/L) for atherosclerotic events have generated considerable interest, as well as a degree of controversy and confusion. CRP concentrations in this range are found in about one third of the American population. To better understand the mechanisms underlying minor elevation of CRP, we have surveyed its reported associations with a variety of states and conditions. It has become clear that even minimal environmental irritants and inflammatory stimuli elicit a minor CRP response. Minor CRP elevation has been found associated with a number of genetic polymorphisms, with membership in different demographic and socioeconomic groups, with a variety of dietary patterns and with many medical conditions that are not apparently inflammatory. Finally, minor CRP elevation bears negative prognostic implications for many conditions, particularly age-related diseases, and predicts mortality in both diseased and apparently healthy individuals. In sum, minor CRP elevation is associated with a great many diverse conditions, some of which are, or may prove to be, causal. Many of these reported associations imply a mild degree of tissue stress or injury, suggesting the hypothesis that the presence of distressed cells, rather than a resulting inflammatory response, is commonly the stimulus for CRP production.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome after surgery: mechanisms and protection [^114BE3K7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

The immune system is an evolutionary hallmark of higher organisms that defends the host against invading pathogens and exogenous infections. This defense includes the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection and the initiation of an inflammatory response to contain and eliminate pathogens. However, an inflammatory response may also be triggered by noninfectious stimuli such as major surgery, and, in case of an overshooting, still not comprehensively understood reaction, lead to tissue destruction and organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, in some cases, the immune system may not effectively distinguish between stimuli elicited by major surgery, which ideally should only require a modest inflammatory response, and those elicited by trauma or pathogenic infection. Surgical procedures thus represent a potential trigger for systemic inflammation that causes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx damage, activation of neutrophils, and ultimately tissue and multisystem organ destruction. In this review, we discuss and summarize currently available mechanistic knowledge on surgery-associated systemic inflammation, demarcation toward other inflammatory complications, and possible therapeutic options. These options depend on uncovering the underlying mechanisms and could include pharmacologic agents, remote ischemic preconditioning protocols, cytokine blockade or clearance, and optimization of surgical procedures, anesthetic regimens, and perioperative inflammatory diagnostic assessment. Currently, a large gap between basic science and clinically confirmed data exists due to a limited evidence base of translational studies. We thus summarize important steps toward the understanding of the precise time- and space-regulated processes in systemic perioperative inflammation.

### Decreased plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein M in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndromes [^112eytuz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The low plasma concentrations of apoM during sepsis are either the result of decreased transcription of the apoM gene or of the shortened half-life of apoM-containing lipoproteins. ApoM is expressed in the liver and kidney. Systemic inflammation induced by injection of LPS, zymosan, or turpentine into mice results in decreased apoM mRNA levels in both liver and kidney. Moreover, addition of TNF or IL-1 to Hep3B hepatoma cell cultures decreases apoM mRNA levels. These results are consistent with the conclusion that apoM is a negative acute-phase protein, the expression of which decreases during inflammatory conditions. The apoM gene transcription is under the control of multiple transcription factors. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), and Forkhead box A2 increase the expression of the apoM gene. In this context, it is interesting to note that HNF-1α is downregulated by LPS during the acute-phase response. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that members of the AP-1 family of proinflammatory transcription factors (c-Jun and JunB) compete with HNF-1α for binding to the same regulatory region in the apoM promotor. Increased c-Jun and JunB levels during the acute-phase response thus mediate decreased apoM gene transcription and synthesis of apoM. Similar mechanisms account for the decrease in apoA-II and possibly other apolipoproteins during the acute-phase response. Taken together, this suggests that the decrease in apoM levels during acute-phase reactions is mostly explained by decreased transcription of the apoM gene, in analogy to the actions of the other negative acute-phase apolipoproteins.

Acute-phase proteins are used clinically as markers of disease severity and as prognostic factors. Negative acute-phase proteins can be used in a similar manner, even though this is less commonly the case. Several studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of decrease of lipid and apolipoprotein levels has a predictive prognostic value in sepsis. Thus, very low levels of cholesterol fractions (HDL, LDL, and total), apoAI, apoC1, and CETP have been associated with poor survival. The pronounced decrease in apoM levels in patients with severe sepsis, and also in those with SIRS without infection, suggests that apoM may be a useful marker for severity of disease and prognosis. In the present study, the mortality rate was low, and the power of the study was not sufficient to elucidate the predictive power of apoM plasma concentrations.

### Synergistic gene expression during the acute phase response is characterized by transcription factor assisted loading [^111inj9q]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The systemic inflammatory response to pathogen infection, local tissue injury or other trauma is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These cytokines initiate the acute phase response (APR) which is characterized by fever, changes in hormone secretion and increased white blood cell production. The liver plays a major role in this systemic response by production of acute phase proteins (APP), defined as plasma proteins whose expression significantly changes during inflammation. APPs are thought to curtail pathogens and minimize tissue damage by several ways including inhibition of bacterial proteinases, modulation of iron homeostasis, increased activity of the complement system and elevation of pathogen recognition receptors –. Although mostly associated with acute inflammation and bacterial infection, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF signaling pathways in the liver also play a significant role in disorders involving chronic inflammation such as obesity, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), viral hepatitis and fibrosis –.

The increase in hepatocyte-produced APP plasma levels can reach up to 30,000 fold in some cases. Such a massive increase is heavily reliant on transcriptional regulation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upon binding to the IL-6 receptor, IL-6 elicits a chain of events whereby receptor-bound glycoprotein 130 activates Janus kinase 1 which, in turn, phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). This leads to oligomerization of STAT3, nuclear import, binding to STAT response elements in DNA and regulation of transcription. Several knock out models point to a key role of the IL-6-STAT3 pathway in APR gene regulation –.

Although the upstream components of the IL-1β and the TNF pathways are different, they both converge to regulate gene transcription by two main routes. First, IL-1β- or TNF-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway results in activation of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Second, these cytokines potently activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors (TFs). The nuclear import and activation of NF-κB is achieved by cytokine-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB. As with STAT3, the three IL-1β- and TNF-activated TFs were shown to play central roles in the hepatic APR.

### The role of C-reactive protein as an inflammatory marker in gastrointestinal diseases [^116gxDMn]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that is produced in large amounts by hepatocytes, upon stimulation by the cytokines interleukin-6, tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, during an acute-phase response. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and, in gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis, its levels correlate well with clinical disease activity. In contrast to its use as a marker in Crohn's disease, however, CRP is a less reliable marker of inflammation and disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis, except perhaps for severe, extensive colitis. The increased production of CRP after an acute-phase stimulus, such as active gut inflammation, might explain why strong anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibodies and other biologic agents, work particularly well in patients with increased levels of CRP. CRP is also useful as a laboratory marker to predict prognosis and relapse in patients with Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis. Elevated CRP levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and are a marker of poor prognosis, indicating more advanced disease and, possibly, reduced survival. An important question that remains is how often CRP levels should be measured. Until there are more data, the use of CRP and of other biomarkers should be seen as an additional tool that aids clinical observation and physical examination, but that cannot replace it.

### C-reactive protein predicts outcome in COVID-19: is it also a therapeutic target? [^114V3kJh]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Reviewing the CRP field in 1981and again in 2003, I was able to show the range of clinical applications of CRP measurements and to hypothesize about a pathophysiological role for CRP (Graphical Abstract). Sensitive quantitative clinical measurement of CRP has three different roles: (i) as a sensitive screening test for an active inflammatory or tissue-damaging process; (ii) to monitor the activity, extent, and response to treatment of any disease process that triggers an acute phase response; and (iii) among the small number of disease processes, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and leukaemia, that themselves stimulate little or no acute phase response, CRP is a very sensitive and useful marker of intercurrent microbial infection. The exemplary study of CRP in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by Smilowitz et al. in this issue of the European Heart Journal illustrates the value of CRP for monitoring and prognosis in a most challenging clinical situation (Graphical Abstract).

The universal application of their actual CRP values is underpinned by the robust standardization of clinical CRP assays. The automation of clinical chemistry CRP immunoassays in the early 1980s, and resulting major expansion of CRP testing, had mandated robust reference standards. The World Health Organization therefore invited me to create and validate the International Standard for Human C-reactive protein, 85/506, on which gold standard all commercial clinical CRP assays have subsequently been based. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine and the European Union secondary serum standards were also constructed using CRP that I isolated.

The major acute phase response of CRP in COVID-19 was predictable, based on the known behaviour of CRP in general and particularly in severe viral respiratory infections. From the outset, CRP values were found to reflect the severity of COVID-19 and to predict outcome, as reported in many, mostly small, series published worldwide. However, the present report by Smilowitz et al. is distinguished by its large scale, its analysis in relation to more of the major clinical consequences of severe COVID-19, its highlighting of the additive value with D-dimer measurements, and its robust demonstration of prognostic significance. All of these crucial insights will increase in importance as new and effective therapeutic interventions become available, whether directly antiviral or targeting host responses.

### Using acute-phase reactants to inform the development of instruments for the updated psoriatic arthritis core outcome measurement set [^113jsxkP]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Systemic inflammationˆ is assessed through measurement of acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). With few exceptions, most randomized controlled trials (RCT) have assessed acute-phase reactants (CRP and ESR) as part of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response criteria. As part of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA)-Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) working group, we performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the performance of inflammatory biomarkers in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed and Embase was performed. The search included peer-reviewed articles and scientific meeting abstracts about RCT and longitudinal observational studies that assessed systemic inflammation using acute-phase reactants in PsA. Studies were assessed following the components of the OMERACT filter including construct validity, responsiveness, and predictive validity.

Results

There were 2764 articles retrieved, and 71 articles were included for this systematic review. Twenty-eight articles reported CRP and/or ESR separately, and the remaining articles reported CRP and/or ESR as part of the ACR response criteria. Studies assessing OMERACT responsiveness provided conflicting reports. Inflammatory biomarkers had construct validity for more active disease. Evidence suggests that an elevation of ESR predicts cardiovascular outcomes.

Conclusion

Data regarding assessment of systemic inflammation using acute-phase reactants (CRP and ESR) are limited. There is only weak evidence to support normalization of these biomarkers in predicting good clinical outcomes/remission criteria. The predictive value for cardiovascular outcomes was generally good. Further studies to assess systemic inflammation in PsA using acute-phase reactants and other laboratory biomarkers are needed.

### Human metabolic response to systemic inflammation: assessment of the concordance between experimental endotoxemia and clinical cases of sepsis / SIRS [^115TvZ3u]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is defined as the combination of an infection with multiple features of 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome' (SIRS) and is one of the oldest and most enigmatic conditions in medicine. There are more than a million cases of sepsis per year in the United States and it is estimated that there are 19 million cases per year worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the cost of hospitalization is in the order of $15 billion, with an anticipated further increase in the future. Despite several decades of intensive research and efforts to bring new therapies to the bedside, the number of cases and sepsis-associated deaths are still soaring. Current treatment guidelines include cardiorespiratory resuscitation and non-specific protocols aimed at mitigating immediate threats of uncontrolled infection. A significant barrier to progress is the perceived inadequacy of experimental models that can reproduce the pathophysiology of the disease in humans.

Biomarkers of systemic chronic inflammation

The canonical role of the immune system is to orchestrate an organism's defense against infections. The acute phase response begins when sentinel cells of the innate immune system detect invaders or tissue damage, releasing cytokines locally and into the bloodstream. This signals the recruitment of immune cells and prompts the liver to produce acute phase proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein, complement, and coagulation molecules). Cytokines also communicate the threat to other organs, including the brain, triggering energy-conserving adaptive responses. If necessary, the innate immune system activates the adaptive immune system to produce antibodies. Once the threat is resolved, pro-inflammatory molecules are replaced by anti-inflammatory ones, promoting tissue repair.

Systemic chronic inflammation is a low-grade, persistent inflammatory state that can arise from prolonged exposure to xenobiotics, psychological stress, or other immune triggers, coupled with a failure to resolve inflammation. Unlike acute inflammation, it involves subtle changes in cytokines, complement, coagulation factors, C-reactive protein, and related molecules with both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles. Systemic chronic inflammation becomes more common and severe with aging and is linked to conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Molecular hallmarks of systemic chronic inflammation in schizophrenia include elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukins (interleukin-1B, interleukin-6, interleukin-8), and tumor necrosis factor, and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin10, interleukin-1 receptor agonist and soluble interleukin-2 receptor) –. Meta-analysis also found c-reactive protein elevations in schizophrenia. Cytokine levels vary across the disease course, with interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma elevated in acute but not chronic schizophrenia, while interleukin-4, interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma were lower in chronic schizophrenia. Alterations of the coagulation system in schizophrenia point towards a pro-coagulant phenotype, including higher prevalence of protein S deficiency, lower tissue plasminogen activator activity, and increased D-dimer levels.

Evidence of systemic chronic inflammation is found at the onset of psychosis. Meta-analyses reported increased blood levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interleukin-17 and interferon gamma relative to controls –. In addition, meta-analysis also found that interleukins-1B, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor levels were positively correlated with severity of negative symptoms. Additional studies have found alterations in various complement factors – and coagulation system moleculesin early schizophrenia compared to controls, consistent with systemic chronic inflammation.

### Relationship of granulocyte colony stimulating factor with other acute phase reactants in man [^116Pev1D]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

The non-specific acute phase response in mice is associated with increased resistance to bacterial infection, which is critically mediated by granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), but the behaviour of G-CSF in the human acute phase response is not known. Cardiothoracic surgery is a powerful acute phase stimulus and we show here that this procedure caused increased production of G-CSF, in addition to increases in the circulating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the acute phase plasma proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA). Values of G-CSF correlated positively with IL-6 concentrations and circulating neutrophil counts, but not with CRP values. These results confirm that G-CSF is a physiological component of the acute phase response in humans that shares some of the same regulatory controls as IL-6, but its downstream effects are on neutrophils, not hepatic acute phase protein synthesis. Our observations are compatible with a protective role against bacterial infection for G-CSF in the human acute phase response, and support investigation of the prophylactic use of G-CSF in at-risk patients.

### Value of C-reactive protein measurements in children… [^114C3hAV]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Serum C-reactive protein concentrations closely follow the course of the acute-phase response to inflammation or tissue necrosis and theoretically provide a barometer for many disease processes. This polysaccharide fraction precipitated from. Streptococcus pneumoniae is present in acutely ill patients and disappears as the patients recover. C-reactive protein has been detected in bacterial, viral and other infections, as well as in noninfectious diseases such as acute myocardial infarction, rheumatic disorders and malignancies. Synthesis of acute-phase proteins occurs in hepatocytes modulated by cytokines. In vitro studies suggest that C-reactive protein activates neutrophils, inhibits platelet aggregation, potentially facilitates cell-mediated cytotoxic reactions against cells infected with microbes and stimulates monocyte-macrophage tumoricidal activity.

Jaye and Waites conducted a study to determine the clinical utility of C-reactive protein measurements in children, especially compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate determination. Healthy persons generally have C-reactive protein levels no higher than 10 mg per L. In patients with invasive acute bacterial infections, the C-reactive protein level tends to range from 150 to 350 mg per L. In patients with viral infections, the C-reactive protein value is usually much lower, less than 20 to 40 mg per L. The utility of C-reactive protein determinations in diagnosing gastrointestinal and respiratory infections is still being evaluated. Serial C-reactive protein determinations have been shown to be useful in monitoring resolution of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. C-reactive protein values do not appear to be useful in identifying children with acute appendicitis or perforation.

Studies of C-reactive protein values in autoimmune and rheumatologic diseases demonstrate better correlation than erythrocyte sedimentation rate with severity of clinical disease activity. The authors conclude that serial C-reactive protein measurements appear to be most useful in monitoring patient response to therapy after the primary diagnosis of invasive, infectious or inflammatory disease, and in monitoring patients after major surgical procedures and patients with serious burns. A secondary rise in C-reactive protein value during therapy or after surgery may indicate an inflammatory or infectious complication. Although several advantages are apparent in using C-reactive protein values rather than the erythrocyte sedimentation rate to monitor therapy, insufficient information currently supports using C-reactive protein values alone to make management decisions or to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.

### How well does qSOFA correspond to underlying systemic inflammatory response? [^113AFr34]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Need for prompt recognition and management of sepsis recently led to the introduction of qSOFA score. However, its association with underlying host inflammatory response remains unclear, while previous studies have challenged its performance in non - intensive care unit (ICU) patients comparing to previously used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Between June 2016 and April 2017, we performed a prospective observational study in the medical ward of a tertiary hospital to explore the relation of qSOFA ≥ 2 and < 2 to underlying inflammatory response, as this is mirrored in levels of serum pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators i.e. IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α. A total of 100 consecutive patients were finally included in this study. Comparable levels [(pg/ml) median (IQR)] of IL-6 [200 (53–200) vs 65.1 (17.3–200)], IL-10 [7 (2.3–170.6) vs 2.3 (2.3–27.7)], and TNF-α [4 (4–46.1) vs 46.06 (4–227.2)] were noted between group of patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 or < 2. Nevertheless, prognosis was worse in patients with qSOFA ≥ 2 showing longer length of stay [10 (7–25) vs 5 (3–7) days, p = .03] and lower recovery rates (41 vs 93%, p < .0001). Our results underline the need for prompt management of critically ill patients in presence of systemic inflammatory response regardless of qSOFA score, partly reflecting its low sensitivity comparing to previously used SIRS criteria.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and long-term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage [^111aUK2G]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, especially complications such as post-ICH infections during hospitalization contribute to disability and death. However, limited evidence exists regarding the influence of noninfectious systemic inflammation. Experimental studies suggest that ICH induces a cytokine-driven acute-phase inflammation, which may lead to secondary brain damage and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

SIRS is frequently observed in patients with vascular diseases. In ICH, approximately 20% of patients develop SIRS during hospital stay, and a correlation between SIRS and stroke severity has been suggested. Recent stroke research has focused on systemic and local inflammatory responses as novel therapeutic target (NCT03338998), yet the association of SIRS with functional long-term outcomes after ICH remains undetermined. The present study aimed at investigating associations of SIRS with long-term functional outcome and contributing factors after ICH.

### Inflammatory risk factors, biomarkers and associated therapy in ischaemic stroke [^115UtQJr]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Proinflammatory conditions, including acute and chronic infections, have been associated with an increased risk of stroke. The risk of stroke is increased by both the acute and chronic phases of a wide spectrum of proinflammatory conditions, suggesting that the association is related to activation of the inflammatory response rather than the condition itself. Different inflammatory mechanisms probably influence the risk of different stroke subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by observations that high levels of various immune system markers and acute phase reactants in otherwise healthy individuals have also been associated with ischaemic stroke subtypes. C-reactive protein, IL-6 and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 are some of the inflammatory markers that have been associated with stroke risk and prognosis. Multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated that these markers are associated with the risk of stroke, but the value of these markers in a clinical setting has not yet been proven. Further research is needed to determine whether immune system modulators can lower the risk of stroke in individuals with elevated concentrations of inflammatory markers. Here, we review the association between infection, systemic inflammation, and ischaemic stroke, and discuss the currently recommended preventive methods to decrease the risk of stroke associated with systemic inflammation.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^114j53gp]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Biomarkers can be useful for identifying or ruling out sepsis, identifying patients who may benefit from specific therapies or assessing the response to therapy.

Methods

We used an electronic search of the PubMed database using the key words "sepsis" and "biomarker" to identify clinical and experimental studies which evaluated a biomarker in sepsis.

Results

The search retrieved 3370 references covering 178 different biomarkers.

Conclusions

Many biomarkers have been evaluated for use in sepsis. Most of the biomarkers had been tested clinically, primarily as prognostic markers in sepsis; relatively few have been used for diagnosis. None has sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be routinely employed in clinical practice. PCT and CRP have been most widely used, but even these have limited ability to distinguish sepsis from other inflammatory conditions or to predict outcome.

Pathophysiology of systemic inflammation in ACLF

Systemic inflammation is a hallmark of ACLF; white cell count and plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-8 are higher in patients with ACLF than in those without. Currently, there is no mouse model of ACLF, this is why results obtained in translational studies performed in patients are important to consider. Before commenting on inflammation in the context of ACLF, it is important to have in mind some general information on the inflammatory process.

General principles of the inflammatory response

The inflammatory response develops when inducers of inflammation are recognised by sensors that engage effectors of the response.

Inducers of inflammation

Inducers of inflammation are either exogenous or endogenous. Among exogenous inducers, only microbial inducers will be discussed because the others have been already reviewedand are beyond the scope of ACLF.

### C-reactive protein gene polymorphisms, C-reactive protein blood levels, and cardiovascular disease risk [^114YSW8A]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a blood marker of inflammation and a hallmark of the acute-phase response, has been shown to be a powerful and specific predictor of cardiovascular event risk in populations of otherwise healthy persons. Here we review what is known about CRP gene polymorphisms, discuss how these might affect the epidemiology of CRP and our understanding of CRP's contribution to cardiovascular disease, and examine their potential clinical usefulness. Evidence shows that certain subtle variations in the CRP gene sequence, mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms, predictably and strongly influence the blood level of CRP. Some of these variations are associated with clinical correlates of cardiovascular disease. If future studies can establish with certainty that CRP influences cardiovascular biology, then CRP gene profiling could have clinical utility.

### Systemic pro-inflammatory response identifies patients with cancer with adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection: the onCovid inflammatory score [^1158RxQe]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel Betacoronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, that has resulted in over 104 million cases and more than two million deaths globally as of February 3, 2021.COVID-19, the resulting disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by a myriad of symptoms and systemic complications. Defining symptoms according to WHO guidelines include fever, cough, and dyspnea, alongside a number of non-specific constitutional symptoms. Complications are similarly varied and system-wide: complicated COVID-19 involves acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, septic shock, and acute kidney and cardiac injuries.

Evolving clinical experience in the management of SARS-CoV-2 has confirmed that lethality from COVID-19 is related not only to the cytopathic effect of the virus but also to the host's response to infection, which leads to end-organ damage and mortality through ignition of a sustained systemic inflammatory response. Patients with severe COVID-19 display heightened blood levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, implicating the innate immune response in COVID-19 progression. Assessment of inflammatory status at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis may lend itself as a bedside prognostic marker and novel immunological domain for therapeutic targets.

### Cancer and systemic inflammation: treat the tumour and treat the host [^112aDHBZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of the systemic inflammatory response

Although activation of the systemic inflammatory response involves many organ systems, the usual clinical laboratory measures of the magnitude of activation are circulating white cells and acute phase proteins. Over the last decade it has become clear that such measurements of an elevated systemic inflammatory response are consistently associated with poor outcome independent of tumour stage. In particular, white cell counts such as neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts and acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein and albumin and their combinations, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) respectively have been reported repeatedly to have prognostic value. For example, over the last decade, more than 120 studies (> 60 000 patients) have examined the clinical utility of the NLR and/or the GPS to predict patient outcomes in a variety of cancers. Taken together, these systemic inflammation-based scores can be considered to represent an upregulation of the innate immune/inflammatory responses. Irrespective of this, these comprehensive and compelling data have resulted in calls for such systemic inflammation-based prognostic scores to be routinely incorporated into clinical care to improve treatment allocation and the design of randomised clinical trials.

### Mediators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the role of recombinant activated protein C in sepsis syndrome [^114tsavB]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, the host's response to infection involves a series of cascading events that mobilize a series of mediators involving the immune system, complement, and the coagulation cascade. Although the initial focus of mediators is to limit infection, this cascade may run amok and cause the development of hypotension, vascular instability, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, leading to morbidity and mortality in the host. Several therapeutic trials have focused on the modulation of these mediators, but use of recombinant human activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis is the only one that has shown a benefit in clinical trials.

### Don't order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate to look for… [^115jai1d]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein is a more sensitive and specific reflection of the acute phase of inflammation than is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In the first 24 hours of a disease process, the C-reactive protein will be elevated, whereas the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be normal. If the source of inflammation is removed, the C-reactive protein will return to normal within a day or so, whereas the erythrocyte sedimentation rate will remain elevated for several days until excess fibrinogen is removed from the serum.

### How to use: C-reactive protein [^112AcW7J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that increases 4–6 h after an inflammatory trigger and peaks at 36–50 h. Levels decrease rapidly with the resolution of inflammation. CRP is generally highly elevated in invasive bacterial infections and is often used as a marker of inflammation. A single CRP level is neither sensitive nor specific enough to identify all children with serious bacterial infection. However, a raised CRP does suggest serious bacterial infection and should suggest further assessment is needed. CRP levels that fail to decrease, or continue to rise, after 48 h of antibiotic therapy suggest treatment failure. In infants with suspected neonatal sepsis, two CRP measurements 24 h apart that are < 10 mg/l are useful in excluding sepsis.

The level of complement proteins in plasma is determined by the balance between synthesis and consumption. Both the native components and their activation markers must be quantified in order to determine the causality. Cirrhosis, liver failure, and starvation will normally result in decreased levels of most soluble complement proteins. Decreased levels of C3 and C4 can also be found in chronic active hepatitis of any origin without liver failure, where synthesis is maintained but the levels are depressed due to simultaneous activation and thus consumption. 9 This is accompanied by increased levels of activation markers. Additionally, several complement proteins, including C3 and C4, are acute‐phase reactants that will increase by up to 50% in response to systemic inflammation. 10 Thus, the level of a component can be within the normal range despite pathophysiological changes, such as increased production and ongoing consumption.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease: a resolute belief or an elusive link? [^111HJx2b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) events is well established. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has received the most attention for its use in screening and risk reclassification and as a predictor of clinical response to statin therapy. Although CRP is involved in the immunologic process that triggers vascular remodeling and plaque deposition and is associated with increased CV disease (CVD) risk, definitive randomized evidence for its role as a causative factor in atherothrombosis is lacking. Whether measurement of hsCRP levels provides consistent, clinically meaningful incremental predictive value in risk prediction and reclassification beyond conventional factors remains debated. Despite publication of guidelines on the use of hsCRP in CVD risk prediction by several leading professional organizations, there is a lack of clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical use of hsCRP. This article reviews 4 distinct points from the literature to better understand the current state and application of hsCRP in clinical practice: 1) the biology of hsCRP and its role in atherosclerosis; 2) the epidemiological association of hsCRP with CVD; 3) the quality of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk; and 4) the use of hsCRP as a tool to initiate or tailor statin therapy. Furthermore, we highlight recommendations from societies and important considerations when using hsCRP to guide treatment decisions in the primary prevention setting.

### Inflammatory and immune responses to surgery and their clinical impact [^116a9hPb]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe current understanding of the local and systemic immune responses to surgery and their impact on clinical outcomes, predictive biomarkers, and potential treatment strategies.

Background

Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of life-threatening inflammatory complications that include infection, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or sepsis. Although improvements in surgical technique and peri-operative care have resulted in reduction in the rates of these complications, they remain high, especially in patients undergoing complex abdominal procedures. There are currently no drugs licensed specifically for the treatment of sepsis nor is it possible to identify those at highest risk, which would allow pre-emptive therapy that may improve outcomes.

Conclusions

Local immune responses to surgery lead to systemic pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases that are temporally related and proportionate in magnitude. Improved understanding of these mechanisms has implications for clinical study design and has led to the emergence of novel biomarkers such as Toll-like receptor expression. These can be used to stratify patient care pathways to maximize the benefit from current therapies or to select the right target at the right phase of illness for future drug development.

### C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammatory bowel disease [^112tsF9V]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The production of CRP occurs almost exclusively in the liver by the hepatocytes as part of the acute phase response upon stimulation by IL-6, TNF-alphaand IL-1-betaoriginating at the site of inflammation. Its short half-life makes CRP a valuable marker to detect and follow up disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). In contrast, ulcerative colitis has only a modest to absent CRP response despite active inflammation, and the reason for this is unknown. In CD, serum levels of CRP correlate well with disease activity and with other markers of inflammation as the CDAI, serum amyloid, IL-6 and faecal calprotectin. CRP is a valuable marker for predicting the outcome of certain diseases as coronary heart disease and haematological malignancies. An increased CRP (> 45 mg/L) in patients with IBD predicts with a high certainty the need for colectomy and this by reflecting severe ongoing and uncontrollable inflammation in the gut. Finally, trials with anti-TNF and anti-adhesion molecules have shown that a high CRP predicts better response to these drugs. However, whether we need to include CRP as an inclusion criterion for future trials with biologicals is still a matter of debate.

### Gut-liver crosstalk in sepsis-induced liver injury [^114BU3vx]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection leading to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Sepsis-induced liver injury is recognized as a powerful independent predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit. During systemic infections, the liver regulates immune defenses via bacterial clearance, production of acute-phase proteins (APPs) and cytokines, and metabolic adaptation to inflammation. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and impaired bacterial clearance and disrupted metabolic products can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis and disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Changes in the gut microbiota play crucial roles in liver injury during sepsis. Bacterial translocation and resulting intestinal inflammation lead to a systemic inflammatory response and acute liver injury. The gut-liver crosstalk is a potential target for therapeutic interventions. This review analyzes the underlying mechanisms for the gut-liver crosstalk in sepsis-induced liver injury.

### Diagnostic implications of C-reactive protein… [^114Rhveo]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

An elevated level of C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein, is one of many downstream indicators of inflammation. Physiologically, CRP enhances cell-mediated immunity by promoting phagocytosis, accelerating chemotaxis, and activating platelets. The purposes of this article are to review the clinical data implicating serum CRP level as a systemic marker of focal inflammation and to explore serum CRP level as a reflection of the inflammatory component of atherogenesis. Systemic inflammation is associated with leukocyte-mediated endothelial dysfunction. 1 Proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and glucocorticoid hormones are elaborated and stimulate hepatocytes to synthesize a wide array of acute phase proteins. 2, 3 A dominant acute phase protein in mammals, C. Rapidly synthesized acute phase proteins support host defenses by neutralizing offending antigens, controlling tissue damage, and promoting tissue repair.

C-reactive protein acts as an opsonin for invading bacteria and circulating immune complexes. 6 C-reactive protein may also activate the complement cascade and scavenge chromatin after cellular necrosis. 7 These functions promote phagocytosis, accelerate chemotaxis, and activate circulating platelets. Ultimately, CRP accelerates the clearance of microbial debris from the circulation and enhances cell-mediated immunity. Plasma levels of CRP can be detected as early as 4 hours after injury and peak between 24 and 72 hours after injury. 8, 9 The purposes of this article are to review the clinical data implicating CRP level as a systemic marker of focal inflammation, to explore CRP level as an indicator of the endovascular inflammation that leads to atherogenesis, and to examine anti-inflammatory strategies against atherosclerosis. Levels were determined every 4 hours following admission and the operating surgeon was blinded to all but initial values.

The sensitivity of CRP level in predicting appendicitis was 60% on admission and increased to 100% by the fourth draw. Conversely, white blood cell counts exhibited a sensitivity of 95% on admission, but dropped to 75% by the fourth draw. Multiple studies17, 18 confirm that an elevated CRP level serves as a systemic marker of focal inflammation and infection. Sanmuganathan and colleagues61 recommend preventative aspirin therapy only in patients with a coronary event risk of at least 1. 5% per year.

### Biomarkers of acute lung injury: worth their salt? [^114zMEgV]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Model systems for biomarker development

An alternative approach to examining clinical samples is to test the validity of existing or novel candidate biomarkers using models systems, in which the signal-to-noise ratio is likely to be more favorable and the time course of the biomarker's response can be more precisely determined (Figure 2). For this purpose, we believe that human models are likely to be more useful than animal models, despite the undoubted contribution of the latter to our understanding of the syndrome's pathogenesis. For example, at the most basic level comparative proteomic analysis between BAL fluid from a patient and a mouse model of ALI identified only 21 homologous proteins.

Figure 2
ALI biomarkers: Ventilator Induced Lung Injury experimental models and observational clinical studies. High tidal volume ventilation (tidal volume in excess of 10 ml/kg predicted body weight) may be used to induce lung injury in experimental models (left) but, through the overspill of inflammatory mediators into the circulation (biotrauma), multiple-organ dysfunction may follow. Biomarkers may be assayed directly from the lungs (black), from the circulation (red) or as indices of dysfunction related to other organs (green). In clinical studies (right), injured lungs are susceptible to damage even when gold standard mechanical ventilation (tidal volume 6 ml/kg predicted body weight) is used. However, in the presence of existing lung injury several processes are likely to be concurrent, both affecting the lungs directly (inflammation, tissue injury, coagulation, fibrosis) and indirectly from other affected organs (sepsis). Hence, the relationship between any biomarker and ventilator settings is likely to be obscured by multiple unknowns. BAL bronchoalveolar lavage, SIRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome, MODS multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

### Genome-wide response of the human hep3B hepatoma cell to proinflammatory cytokines, from transcription to translation [^1169QD3N]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Given the unknown timing of the onset of an acute systemic inflammation in humans, the fine tuning of cascades and pathways involved in the associated hepatocyte response cannot be appraised in vivo. Therefore, the authors used a genome-wide and kinetic analysis in the human Hep3B hepatoma cell line challenged with a conditioned medium from bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. A complete coverage of the liver transcriptome disclosed 648 mRNAs whose change in abundance allowed for their clustering in mRNA subsets with an early, intermediate, or late regulation. The contribution of transcription, stability, or translation was appraised with genome-wide studies of the changes in nuclear primary transcripts, mRNA decay, or polysome-associated mRNAs. A predominance of mRNAs with decreased stability and the fact that translation alone controls a significant number of acute phase-associated proteins are prominent findings. Transcription and stability act independently or, more rarely, cooperate or even counteract in a gene-by-gene manner, which results in a unidirectional change in mRNA abundance. Waves of mRNAs for groups of functionally related proteins are up- or downregulated in an ordered fashion. This includes an early regulation of transcription-associated proteins, an intermediate repression of detoxication and metabolism proteins, and finally an enhanced translation and transport of a number of membranous or secreted proteins along with an enhanced protein degradation. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive and simultaneous overview of events in the human hepatocyte during the inflammatory acute phase.

### Inflammation in acute ischemic stroke and its relevance to stroke critical care [^116SQTwR]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombolysis heralded a new era of acute intervention for ischemic stroke, accompanied by an increasing need for comprehensive acute critical care support. There remains the prospect of novel cerebral protection strategies. Cerebral ischemia initiates a complex cascade of events at genomic, molecular, and cellular levels, and inflammation is important in this cascade, both in the CNS and in the periphery. Closely linked events are induction of a classic acute phase protein response, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and rise in body temperature, all of which appear to importantly influence the outcome. Thrombolysis aside, various therapeutic strategies have been trialed without success recently, primarily directed at influencing neuronal activity and survival directly. Inflammation itself offers an attractive target, mainly because of its potential to exacerbate the spread of damage to the ischemic penumbra. A promising novel therapeutic approach is the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), which limits the action of the cytokine IL-1, a pivotal mediator in the pathophysiology of acute neurodegeneration. Critical care has much to offer some patients after acute ischemic stroke, including the delivery of acute interventions, often with very short therapeutic time windows, physiological support, and the management of complications. We discuss inflammation and its mediators in acute ischemic stroke, the systemic stress, and acute phase protein responses to acute ischemic stroke, how inflammation is relevant in deteriorating ischemic stroke, the impact of physiological variables, and both current and emerging interventions for acute ischemic stroke.

### Rationale of basic and cellular mechanisms considered in updating the staging system for diabetic retinal disease [^113X9sNK]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

CRP

C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein that is synthesized in the liver or adipose tissue in response to an injury or infection. In clinical practice, the levels of CRP in blood have been measured for diagnosis of inflammatory diseases. A recent meta-analysis has shown that the blood CRP levels in patients with PDR are significantly higher than those in patients with NPDR. However, the significance of using CRP as a biomarker is limited in part because of not being specific to DR. In combination with other biomarkers to assess general inflammation and which patient subgroup could benefit from a targeted anti-inflammatory drug, CRP and high-reactive CRP, potentially in combination with other factors, might have value.

Gap Analysis

Many of the described factors are being considered as targets for treatment. Some are general indicators of inflammation, such as CRP. However, further work into systemic predictive, prognostic, or diagnostic biomarkers for greater inflammation associated with DRD, and related treatment responses or their combinations, may be valuable. In addition, aqueous samples have associated VEGF, several inflammatory markers, MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8, with DME or PDR and suggested aqueous factors as predictors of DME development. Additional studies into systemic and local inflammation biomarkers are warranted including earlier disease stages of DRD. Another aspect for consideration is the bioanalytical capabilities to reliably measure the above-mentioned analytes with the required level of validation and compliance in clinical studies and as diagnostic tests.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^117RELtF]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Nutrition efficacy during acute inflammation — Nutrition efficacy is an even more challenging parameter to measure. While in a state of acute inflammation, changes in muscle mass and function can be reflected by effective wound healing and resolution of edema. Improvements in muscle strength and endurance may be measured. However, meaningful gains in muscle mass are unlikely in the acutely inflamed state; only after inflammation subsides are such patients typically able to achieve these gains.

### Acute lung injury induced by whole gastric fluid: hepatic acute phase response contributes to increase lung antiprotease protection [^115FwcT2]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Biology of the acute phase response

The systemic inflammatory response is a collection of coordinated physiologic changes initiated during early stages of inflammation as part of the early innate defense, triggered by a variety of stimuli with the goal of achieving homeostasis. A prominent feature of this response is synthesis of several proteins mainly by the liver, under the control of cytokines originating at the site of injury, referred to as the liver acute phase response (APR). Changes in blood during the hepatic APR have been studied in rodents in response to stimuli not affecting the lung primarily, such as LPS and turpentine administration and exposition to thermal injury, and a number of APPs have been shown to participate. With these stimuli, the rodent APR starts a few hours after the insult, reaches a peak 24–48 h later and is back to baseline values at day 7. In general, it is assumed that elevation of APPs in blood have beneficial effects based largely on the known function of each of the individual proteins involved and on logical speculations as to how these might be useful in inflammation. However, in the last few years, some negative implications of the hepatic APR have also been proposed, since the increase in blood of proteins with pro-coagulant effects such as fibrinogen, in relation to lung inflammation induced by urban air pollution and cigarette smoking, has been implicated in adverse cardiovascular effects. In addition, this response has been implicated in the progression of lung damage in patients with COPD. Unfortunately, studies relating cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during episodes of increased air pollution have focused only on C-reactive protein and APPs with pro-coagulant effects and have not evaluated the full spectrum of proteins that are known to be co-expressed, among them several antiproteases that can reach the lung improving its defense properties.

### C-reactive protein as a potential signpost to trained immunity [^1133aMSk]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been more than 30 years since markers of systemic inflammation (measured by the acute phase proteins: C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A) have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes — initially in patients with acute coronary syndromesand subsequently in apparently healthy men. Significantly, the precise "drivers" of this subclinical inflammation are still not clear.

It seems plausible that the levels of these nonspecific markers of inflammation, which are released by the liver, reflect a cumulative "inflammatory load", components of which also drive pathogenic processes relevant to atherosclerosis in parallel. In support of this notion, adverse outcomes pertain across a range of rheumatological and autoimmune diseases, and the precise nature of chronic inflammation seems to matter little. Processes of inflammation within the walls of arteries contribute to the manifestations of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but these (sometimes small, focal) lesions seem more likely to be responding to systemic proinflammatory cues than driving the systemic inflammatory response that is reflected by elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). In other words, systemic drivers of processes of inflammation probably serve to activate cells in the atherosclerotic plaque, as they do elsewhere. This interpretation is supported by events, such as experimental myocardial infarction, that drive inflammation and accelerate atherosclerosis.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

The role of IL-6 in the development of systemic symptoms of RA

Acute-phase response

The acute-phase response, one of the body's first reactions to injury, is characterized by a number of systemic changes. These include the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alterations in the level of acute-phase proteins in the plasma. Acute-phase proteins are produced in the liver and are classed as either positive or negative, depending on whether their concentrations increase during inflammation (e.g. CRP and TIMPs) or decrease (e.g. apolipoprotein A1 and transferrin). IL-6 is a principal stimulator of acute-phase protein synthesis through hepatocyte stimulation. In patients with RA, serum IL-6 levels correlate with CRP levels. As IL-6 is easily measured in biological fluids, it can be used as a biomarker of inflammation and disease activity (Fig. 3).

F. 3
The systemic effects of IL-6. Systemically, IL-6 actions include stimulation of acute-phase proteins and hepatocyte proliferation in the liver, induction of anaemia and effects on lipids and lipid metabolism, impairment of HPA axis and osteoporosis.

Anaemia of chronic inflammation

Anaemia is the most common systemic manifestation of RA. Defined as haemoglobin (Hb) levels < 13 g/dl in men and < 12 g/dl in women, anaemia is present in more than a third of RA patients and in a quarter of patients within the first year of disease. Patients with RA and anaemia have more severe physical disability compared with non-anaemic patients (Hb > 14 g/dl).

The peptide hepcidin is produced by hepatocytes and regulates iron metabolism by preventing iron transport and the release of iron from macrophages. In vitro, IL-6 stimulation of human hepatoma cells induced hepcidin expression. In wild-type mice, turpentine stimulation of the inflammatory response resulted in marked increase in liver hepcidin expression accompanied by a decrease in serum iron, whereas in IL-6 knock-out mice, hepcidin levels were below baseline levels and iron levels increased slightly. Moreover, IL-6 infusion resulted in a rapid 7.5-fold increase in hepcidin secretion in healthy volunteers. Thus, the IL-6–hepcidin axis has a vital role in the anaemia of inflammation observed in many RA patients.
