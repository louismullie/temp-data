## Question

treatment of acute prostatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of acute prostatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and gauging severity. Then, I should determine outpatient versus inpatient empiric antibiotics and appropriate durations. Next, I will incorporate fluoroquinolone stewardship and resistance thresholds. After that, I should address supportive care and early reassessment. Then, I need to evaluate for abscess and special populations like the immunocompromised. Finally, I will plan culture-directed adjustments, disposition, and secondary prevention while noting key caveats such as avoiding prostatic massage and overuse of fluoroquinolones.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and assess severity before anything else, and wait, let me verify that I am not missing mimics like cystitis or urethritis because ABP typically presents with acute pelvic/perineal pain, dysuria, frequency, retention, and systemic symptoms, and on exam the prostate is often tender, enlarged, and boggy but vigorous massage is contraindicated due to bacteremia risk; I should obtain urinalysis and urine culture in all suspected cases to identify the pathogen and susceptibilities, consider additional labs if severe, and decide on hospitalization if the patient is systemically ill, unable to void, cannot tolerate oral intake, or has risk factors for resistance or is immunocompromised such as diabetes or cirrhosis [^115Hi2sa] [^1121WTtG].

> Now, for systemically well patients who can urinate and take oral medications, I need to choose outpatient therapy and hold on, I should verify duration and agent choice: fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin have been used for 2 to 4 weeks given their prostatic penetration, with some primary care guidance allowing a 2-week course and extension to 4 weeks based on response; alternatively, if STI coverage is warranted or local guidance supports, ceftriaxone followed by doxycycline may be used, but I must plan to adjust once culture results return and reassess at 48–72 hours [^116t7Lvw] [^111Pghud] [^115Hi2sa].

> For patients who are more ill or require admission, I should initiate intravenous therapy and let me check regimen options again: a third-generation cephalosporin alone or combined with an aminoglycoside, a broad-spectrum penicillin with a β-lactamase inhibitor, or ampicillin plus a high-dose aminoglycoside are all acceptable empiric choices aligned with systemic UTI recommendations; once afebrile and clinically improving, I should transition to an appropriate oral agent to complete a total 2–4 week course, verifying culture guidance before stepping down [^115DaMTs] [^111GMx2L] [^111Pghud] [^113Vvw95].

> Wait, I almost defaulted to empiric ciprofloxacin for everyone, but I should not jump to conclusions because stewardship matters; I need to avoid empiric fluoroquinolones in patients coming from urology departments, in those with prior fluoroquinolone exposure within 6 months, or where local resistance is 10% or higher, and only consider ciprofloxacin if resistance is below 10% and there are contraindications to β-lactams or aminoglycosides, while remembering to broaden for Pseudomonas risk when clinically indicated and to narrow promptly when susceptibilities return [^114MzWq2] [^1156L46R] [^114jsZRM].

> I will now address supportive care and I should double-check symptomatic measures: provide analgesics and antipyretics, ensure hydration, encourage rest during the febrile phase, and consider an α-blocker if the patient has prominent voiding symptoms such as slow stream or hesitancy, while planning a reassessment within 48–72 hours to ensure defervescence and symptomatic improvement, with escalation and imaging if not improving [^115Hi2sa].

> Next, I should review complications, and hold on, I should verify when to image for a prostatic abscess: risk increases with symptom duration beyond 7 days, diabetes, voiding disturbance, or failure to respond to appropriate antibiotics; I should obtain CT or transrectal ultrasound if high risk or if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, and if an abscess of 20 mm or larger is found, I need to consider transurethral drainage while extending antibiotic duration given the typically longer clinical course in abscess cases [^114gP3Ap] [^115rdaYp].

> Let me consider special populations, and I need to ensure I do not miss immunocompromised hosts where atypical organisms can occur and progression to sepsis can be faster; in these patients, broader empiric coverage and closer monitoring are warranted, with early culture-directed adjustments once microbiology clarifies the pathogen and susceptibilities [^1121WTtG].

> I will now examine culture-directed optimization, and hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm prostatic penetration characteristics before finalizing therapy: antibiotics with good lipid solubility, lower protein binding, suitable pKa, and small molecular size penetrate the prostate better, so after susceptibilities result, I should preferentially select agents with proven intraprostatic activity and align the total duration to the clinical trajectory and resolution benchmarks [^112kJYMo].

> Regarding disposition and prevention, I should confirm discharge readiness only when the patient is afebrile for 24–48 hours, clinically stable, tolerating oral intake, voiding spontaneously, and reliable for follow-up; on follow-up after antibiotics, most patients improve within 2–4 weeks, and if symptoms recur I should evaluate for chronic bacterial prostatitis or CP/CPPS and address any underlying urologic abnormalities or complicating factors to reduce recurrence risk [^115Hi2sa] [^1121WTtG] [^116G8rrS].

> Finally, a few key caveats need emphasis, and let me verify each: prostatic massage is contraindicated in ABP because of bacteremia risk, asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment, chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a separate entity that warrants a multimodal approach rather than prolonged empiric antibiotics, and antibiotic stewardship — especially cautious fluoroquinolone use — is essential to mitigate resistance while preserving efficacy for those who truly need these agents [^115Hi2sa] [^116TmCeL] [^114MzWq2].

---

Acute prostatitis is managed with **empiric IV antibiotics** for severe or systemic illness [^115DaMTs], then tailored to culture results [^111Pghud], and **2–4 weeks total therapy** to prevent chronic infection [^111GMx2L] [^113Vvw95]. Hospitalize if **septic**, unable to tolerate oral intake, or with **urinary retention** [^115Hi2sa]; use alpha-blockers for voiding symptoms [^113RoUkU] and NSAIDs for pain [^115Hi2sa]. If a prostatic abscess is suspected or symptoms persist, **obtain imaging and drain if needed** [^114gP3Ap]. Monitor for progression to chronic prostatitis and adjust therapy based on response and cultures [^1121WTtG].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: Fever, chills, malaise [^115Hi2sa], dysuria, frequency, urgency, pelvic/perineal pain, and possible urinary retention [^111Pghud].

- **Physical examination**: Digital rectal exam reveals a tender, enlarged, boggy prostate [^115Hi2sa]; avoid vigorous massage to prevent bacteremia.

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain urinalysis and urine culture to identify pathogens and guide therapy [^115Hi2sa].

- **Imaging**: Not routine; use TRUS or CT [^116Lh5A3] if abscess is suspected or symptoms persist despite therapy [^114gP3Ap].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should **cover common uropathogens** [^111Pghud], particularly gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) [^113Vvw95].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimens** |
|-|-|
| Severe/systemic illness | - IV amoxicillin + aminoglycoside <br/> - IV second-generation cephalosporin + aminoglycoside <br/> - IV third-generation cephalosporin [^115DaMTs] |
| Non-severe illness | - Oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) [^111GMx2L] |

---

Note: Avoid empiric **fluoroquinolones** [^114MzWq2] when local resistance is > 10%, there has been recent fluoroquinolone use, or in urology department patients [^1156L46R].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

- **Uncomplicated cases**: 2 weeks [^113Vvw95] of antibiotics targeting uropathogens [^111Pghud].

- **Complicated cases**: 2–4 weeks, especially with abscess or persistent symptoms [^113Vvw95].

- **Chronic bacterial prostatitis**: 4–6 weeks of fluoroquinolones [^115Jx5p6] [^111RBcCu].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Alpha-blockers**: Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, or silodosin for significant voiding symptoms (slow flow, hesitancy) [^117AjVKM].

- **NSAIDs**: Short-term use for pain and inflammation [^112QTNUa] [^116XoVeq].

- **Supportive care**: Hydration, rest, and analgesics [^115Hi2sa].

---

## Management of complications

Prostatic abscess should be suspected in patients with persistent fever, pain, or bacteremia; confirm with **imaging (TRUS or CT) [^114gP3Ap] and drain if needed** [^114DwjGi]. Urinary retention should be managed by avoiding **indwelling catheters**; use **suprapubic catheterization** if necessary [^115Hi2sa].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Reassess clinically to track symptom resolution and adjust therapy according to culture results [^111Pghud]. Repeat **urine cultures** to confirm eradication [^115Hi2sa], and obtain **imaging** if symptoms persist or if complications are suspected [^116Lh5A3].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Address underlying factors by treating **urologic abnormalities** and other contributing factors [^116G8rrS]. Patient education should emphasize **adherence**, hygiene, and prompt **symptom reporting**.

---

## Prognosis

Favorable outcomes are expected for most patients with appropriate therapy; however, the **risk of chronicity** remains, as inadequate treatment or complications can lead to chronic bacterial prostatitis [^1121WTtG].

---

Acute prostatitis requires prompt diagnosis, empiric antibiotics, and supportive care, with therapy tailored to cultures and clinical response; **early intervention** prevents chronic infection and complications [^116JAzQg].

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: Diagnosis and management [^115Hi2sa]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is an acute infection of the prostate gland that causes pelvic pain and urinary tract symptoms, such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary retention. It may lead to systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, and malaise. Although the true incidence is unknown, acute bacterial prostatitis is estimated to comprise approximately 10% of all cases of prostatitis. Most infections are community-acquired, but some occur after transurethral manipulation procedures, such as urethral catheterization and cystoscopy, or following a transrectal prostate biopsy.

The physical examination should include abdominal, genital, and digital rectal examinations to assess for a tender, enlarged, or boggy prostate. Diagnosis is predominantly made based on history and physical examination but may be aided by urinalysis. Urine cultures should be obtained in all patients who are suspected of having acute bacterial prostatitis to determine the responsible bacteria and its antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Additional laboratory studies can be obtained based on risk factors and severity of illness. Radiography is typically unnecessary.

Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics and supportive measures. Hospitalization and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be considered in patients who are systemically ill, unable to voluntarily urinate, unable to tolerate oral intake, or have risk factors for antibiotic resistance. Typical antibiotic regimens include ceftriaxone and doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin, among others.

### Acute and chronic prostatitis [^116TmCeL]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common clinical syndrome classified into four categories: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic prostatitis. Bacterial prostatitis (acute and chronic) is primarily diagnosed with history and microbiologic studies, although physical examination can be helpful to localize infection within the genitourinary system. Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics, and the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.

### Common questions about chronic prostatitis [^113nudkf]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP):

- **Definition**: CBP is caused by a chronic bacterial infection of the prostate gland, characterized by recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs) caused by the same bacterial strain, pelvic pain, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

- **Pathophysiology**: CBP is primarily associated with chronic bacterial infections commonly involving E. coli and enterococci.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include pain, which may be poorly localized (pelvis, genitalia, lower back, or hypogastrium), and LUTS, such as weak stream, straining, hesitancy, urgency, frequency, and dysuria.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CBP is not associated with increased mortality.

- **Results: Literature search and study selection**: In total, the search yielded 4752 articles. Following abstract screening and full-text reviews, 25 randomised controlled trials involving 3514 patients with CP/CPPS were included (see Figure 1). Overall, the studies were conducted between 1999 and 2019. For the analysis, we compared 18 monotherapies, six combination therapies, and placebo. Fourteen (56%) of the 25 studies compared the positive drugs with placebo treatments. Fifteen (60%) of the 25 studies were multi-center studies. The mean age of patients with CP/CPPS was 40.3 years (SD 11.4). The median treatment duration was 12 weeks (IQR 6–14). In six (24%) of the 25 studies, the participants were randomly assigned to three or more groups. In 9 (36%), 11 (44%), and 6 (24%) of 25 studies, patients were recruited from Asia, North America, and Europe, respectively, while two (8%) studies were cross-continental. Nine (36%) of the 25 studies received funding from pharmaceutical companies. The baseline characteristics and risk of bias assessment of the included studies are summarized in eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement.

### Acute and chronic prostatitis [^113XPEsg]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic bacterial prostatitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend initiating fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy in patients with CBP due to their spectrum of activity against uropathogens, high oral bioavailability, and ability to penetrate prostatic tissue.

### Chronic prostatitis: Epidemiology and role of infection [^11226JWW]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

We review the epidemiology of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and the role of infectious agents, emphasizing critical data necessary to define research issues. The epidemiologic literature is limited, but the worldwide prevalence appears to be in the range of 2% to 10%, indicating that CP/CPPS represents an important international health problem. Recent molecular studies have documented bacterial DNA sequences in prostate tissue from CP/CPPS patients. These data suggest that colonization and/or infection occurs in the prostates of many patients with CP/CPPS. Further molecular research is needed to define the role of bacteria in the etiology of CP/CPPS.

### Current challenges in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis [^114jsZRM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Serious urinary tract infections (UTIs) and acute bacterial prostatitis in adults cause significant morbidity and economic burden. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, although rare in urological practice, can be challenging to treat under certain circumstances. In this paper, we review the bacterial etiologies and resistance patterns found in adults with serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis and discuss considerations for selecting optimal antimicrobial therapy.

The role of fluoroquinolones as targeted therapy for serious UTIs is highlighted. The use of effective antimicrobial therapy is the foundation of managing serious UTIs and bacterial prostatitis. Selection of the optimal antimicrobial agent must consider patient-specific factors, infection characteristics (e.g. severity, community- versus institutional- or hospital-acquired, need for intravenous agent, UTI, prostatitis), local resistance patterns, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, and cost.

Fluoroquinolones are among the alternatives for empirical antibiotic treatment of serious UTIs and acute bacterial prostatitis. For serious UTIs, the activity of the antimicrobial agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa needs to be considered. In chronic bacterial prostatitis, fluoroquinolones are the first choice due to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties at the site of infection. Targeted antimicrobial therapy — emphasizing the correct antibacterial spectrum and dosage — provides significant benefits, such as reduced morbidity and associated costs, and reduced emergence of resistance.

### Treatment of bacterial prostatitis [^112kJYMo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is characterized by voiding symptoms and genitourinary pain and is sometimes associated with sexual dysfunction. Up to 25% of men receive a diagnosis of prostatitis in their lifetime, but less than 10% have a proven bacterial infection.

The causes and treatment of nonbacterial prostatitis are largely unknown, but bacterial prostatitis is caused by infection with uropathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli, although infection is sometimes due to gram-positive and atypical microorganisms. Acute bacterial prostatitis is easily diagnosed by abrupt urogenital and often systemic symptoms, along with bacteriuria, and treated by systemic antibiotic therapy.

Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by prolonged or relapsing bacteriuria; diagnosis traditionally requires comparing urinary specimens obtained before and after prostatic massage. Treating chronic bacterial prostatitis requires prolonged therapy with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate, i.e. one with high lipid solubility, a low degree of ionization, high dissociation constant, low protein binding, and small molecular size. We review recent pharmacological and clinical data on treating bacterial prostatitis.

### Failure of a monotherapy strategy for difficult chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^117ADSYR]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

We determined the effect of a best evidence-based monotherapeutic strategy for patients diagnosed with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) referred to a specialized prostatitis clinic.

Patients with CP/CPPS were referred by urologists after failure of prescribed therapy for evaluation and treatment at Queen's University prostatitis research clinic. These patients were extensively evaluated, aggressively treated following a standardized treatment algorithm, and followed for 1 year using a validated prostatitis-specific symptom and quality of life instrument, the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). All patients underwent a standardized protocol for CP/CPPS, which included a history, physical examination, standard 4-glass test, urethral swab and semen for microscopy and culture, uroflowmetry, and residual urine determination. Treatment followed a best evidence-based strategy with a standardized monotherapy-based algorithm.

A total of 100 consecutive patients with CP/CPPS (average age 42.2 years, range 20 to 70, and average symptom duration 6.5 years, range 0.5 to 39) had 1-year follow-up after initial evaluation. Patients were prescribed treatment based on documentation of "failed", "successful", and "never tried" therapies according to a standardized treatment algorithm. Patients treated successfully were continued on the prescribed therapy. For those in whom the initially prescribed therapy failed, therapy was discontinued and new therapy was instituted based on the algorithm.

### New treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^117TJ535]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common condition among men of a wide age range, with detrimental effects on quality of life. The etiology, pathogenesis, and optimal treatment of CP/CPPS remain unknown, although progress has been made in these domains in recent years. A wide variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies have been studied in clinical trials, but most have shown limited efficacy in symptom alleviation.

CP/CPPS is increasingly viewed as a condition that involves variable degrees of neuropathic pain. Medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, memantine, and tricyclic antidepressants are often used in other neuropathic pain conditions and, therefore, are considered potential treatments for CP/CPPS. Few studies of these agents in patients with CP/CPPS have been reported, but future clinical trials should help to determine their utility and to characterize the pathogenetic mechanisms of pain in CP/CPPS.

Combining treatment trials with biomarker, genomic, and imaging studies, in addition to epidemiologic and symptom-based assessments, will maximize the ability to probe disease etiology and pathogenesis, as well as identify effective treatment.

### How I manage bacterial prostatitis [^112ospsy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial prostatitis is a highly prevalent infection responsible for significant morbidity among men. The diagnosis and treatment for bacterial prostatitis remain complicated. The difficulty in diagnosis is in part owing to the paucity of high-quality evidence that guides a clinician's interpretation of patients' history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Treatment is challenging due to the few antimicrobials capable of prostate penetration, growing antimicrobial resistance limiting effective treatment options, and the high risk of recurrence.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to provide a useful resource for clinicians in effectively diagnosing and managing acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) and chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).

- **Sources**: A PubMed literature search on prostatitis was performed with no restrictions on publication date.

- **Content**: The epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment for ABP and CBP are explored using a clinical vignette as relevant context.

- **Implications**: Bacterial prostatitis can be diagnosed through a focused history and microbiological investigations. The Meares-Stamey 4-glass test or modified 2-glass test can help confirm the diagnosis if uncertainty exists. Typical uropathogens are common contributors to bacterial prostatitis, but there is growing interest in exploring the role atypical and traditional non-pathogenic organisms may have. Fluoroquinolones remain first-line therapy, followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or doxycycline if the pathogen is susceptible. Fosfomycin has emerged as a repurposed option, but further exploration of its use is necessary.

### Overview summary statement. Diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) [^113dEFXL]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Members of the Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) met in a one-day symposium to review recent findings and debate unresolved issues in the diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). The meeting focused on producing an overview summary statement that would, as nearly as possible, represent the consensus views of the attendees.

Participants agreed that a history, physical examination, and urinalysis/urine culture are mandatory for the evaluation of all patients presenting with CP/CPPS, with other assessments categorized as recommended or optional, depending on the history and physical findings. Observations and suggestions regarding first- and second-line therapies are also offered, with the recognition that randomized, placebo-controlled trials to guide selection of therapies for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis are currently lacking.

### Acute and chronic infectious prostatitis in older adults [^116vSSTN]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis are clinically significant entities that can be difficult to diagnose and appropriately treat. Herein, we review when to suspect these clinical conditions, how to diagnose them, and how to effectively treat them based on the extant literature. Our aim was to equip the practicing clinician with the ability to proficiently diagnose and manage acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, particularly in older patients.

### Bacterial prostatitis [^112eRCMd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide the infectious disease community with a urologic perspective on bacterial prostatitis. The article briefly reviews the categorization of prostatitis by type and distills new findings on bacterial prostatitis from the past year. It also highlights key points from the established literature.

- **Recent findings**: Cross-sectional prostate imaging is becoming more common and may lead to more incidental diagnoses of acute bacterial prostatitis. As drug resistance remains problematic in this condition, the reemergence of older antibiotics, such as fosfomycin, has proven beneficial. With regard to chronic bacterial prostatitis, no clear clinical risk factors emerged in a large epidemiological study. However, bacterial biofilm formation has been associated with more severe cases. Surgery has a limited role in bacterial prostatitis and should be reserved for draining a prostatic abscess or removing infected prostatic stones.

In summary, prostatitis remains a common and bothersome clinical condition. Antibiotic therapy continues to be the basis of treatment for both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Further research into improving prostatitis treatment is indicated.

### Physical activity of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome not satisfied with conventional treatments — could it represent a valid option? The physical activity and male pelvic pain trial: a double-blind, randomized study [^114w5kxQ]. The Journal of Urology (2007). High credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a major healthcare burden. Affected patient quality of life is poor, and currently, no investigated treatments have significant long-term benefit. We performed a preliminary investigation of the role of physical activity and its effects on select patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Materials and methods**: Between 2002 and 2004, we recruited a volunteer sample of 231 eligible males, aged 20 to 50 years, with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome who were unresponsive to conventional treatments and free of any contraindication for moderate intensity physical exercise. This group was screened and, if in accordance with study inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients were randomized into two groups. Participants were randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise group (52) and the placebo/stretching and motion exercises group (51). Main outcome measures were the Italian version of the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, Beck Depression Inventory, State Anxiety Inventory-Y, and a pain intensity visual analog scale administered at baseline, and at 6 and 18 weeks.

- **Results**: At 18 weeks, 36 subjects (75%) in the aerobic exercise group vs. 40 (81.63%) in the placebo/stretching and motion exercises group completed the 18-week program and evaluation. Differences between the two groups were found in total National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, pain and quality of life impact subscales, and pain visual analog score (ANCOVA p = 0.006, 0.0009, 0.02 and 0.003, respectively).

### Low quality of life in men with chronic prostatitis-like symptoms [^112aXyNm]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Chronic prostatitis (CP) is not rare, and it has a strong negative impact on quality of life (QOL). A simple, improved tool to assist in diagnosing CP should be developed. These results also provide strong evidence of the need to continue developing treatments for CP.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^116nNHga]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder characterized by pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to assess CP/CPPS symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified studies, abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses, and rated the quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods.

- **Main results**: We included 38 unique studies with 3,290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.
	- **Acupuncture**: (three studies, 204 participants) Based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture probably leads to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with a sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score).

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^114gP3Ap]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for abscess formation in acute bacterial prostatitis and to compare treatment outcomes between the abscess group and the non-abscess group.

- **Methods**: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. All patients suspected of having an acute prostatic infection underwent computed tomography or transrectal ultrasonography to discriminate acute prostatic abscesses from acute prostatitis without abscess formation.

- **Results**: A total of 31 prostate abscesses were reviewed among 142 patients with acute prostatitis. Univariate analysis revealed that symptom duration, diabetes mellitus, and voiding disturbance were predisposing factors for abscess formation in acute prostatitis. However, diabetes mellitus was not related to prostate abscess in multivariate analysis. Patients with abscesses ≥ 20 mm who underwent transurethral resection had a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment than did those who did not have surgery. Regardless of surgical treatment, both the length of hospital stay and antibiotic treatment were longer in patients with prostatic abscesses than they were in those without abscesses. However, the incidence of septic shock was not different between the two groups. A wide spectrum of microorganisms was responsible for prostate abscesses. In contrast, Escherichia coli was the predominant organism responsible for acute prostatitis without abscess.

- **Conclusion**: Imaging studies should be considered for accurate diagnosis and effective management of acute bacterial prostatitis to prevent or accurately treat prostatic abscesses.

### Oral pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113XFxwC]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) refers to the presence of bothersome pelvic pain symptoms without an identifiable cause in men. It is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioral, sexual, or emotional consequences, as well as symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract, sexual, or bowel dysfunction. CP/CPPS affects 2–16% of adult men, making it one of the most common urological diseases among this population. Several therapeutic agents have been routinely used in efforts to treat this condition.

The pharmacological management of CP/CPPS usually includes α-blockers, antibiotic therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, 5-α-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapy. Recently, agents such as pregabalin, pentosan polysulphate, diazepam, baclofen, zafirlukast, tanezumab, and allopurinol have been tested on a small group of patients with CP/CPPS via clinical trials. Although there are many treatment options for CP/CPPS, the efficacy of these treatments remains questionable.

Some might argue that the use of oral medications for the treatment of CP/CPPS has already been extensively reported. The largest National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored randomized controlled trials did not support the use of alfuzosin or tamsulosin, which are two commonly used α-blockers in clinical practice, nor the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, either alone or in combination with tamsulosin. It is noteworthy that some systematic reviews have found that certain grouped drugs (e.g. all α-blockers) or the combination of grouped drugs are more efficacious than placebos or individual treatments.

### Excessive antibiotic use in men with prostatitis [^113g28ZD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Prostatitis accounts for 2 million outpatient visits annually. The majority of prostatitis cases fit the definition of chronic pelvic pain syndrome, for which routine antibiotic use is not indicated.

- **Methods**: Inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy datasets from the Veterans Health Administration were used to quantify the magnitude of antibiotic use attributable to chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Specifically, men with a diagnosis of infectious/acute prostatitis or a urinary tract infection were excluded, and the remaining men with a diagnosis of prostatitis were defined as having chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Results**: The annual prevalence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome was 0.5%. Prescriptions for fluoroquinolone antibiotics were filled in 49% of men with a diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain syndrome compared with 5% in men without chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome were more than 7 times more likely to receive a fluoroquinolone prescription, independent of age, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. Increased use of other antibiotics also was observed. High use was similar in men with either infectious/acute prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: Despite evidence that antibiotics are not effective in the majority of men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome, they were prescribed in 69% of men with this diagnosis. Some increased use is probably due to uncontrolled confounding by comorbid conditions or inaccurate diagnostic coding. However, a 7-fold higher rate of fluoroquinolone usage suggests that strategies to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use are needed.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo effect in clinical trials on chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^112QjMWk]. The Prostate (2022). Low credibility.

It is a common practice to control the efficacy of pharmacological treatments with a placebo group; however, placebo itself may affect subjective and even objective results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the placebo effect on symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) to improve future clinical trials.

- **Methods**: A search in three databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials on the treatment of CP/CPPS published until April 2021. The primary outcome was the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Qmax, PVR, IPSS, and prostate volume.

- **Results**: A total of 3502 studies were identified. Placebo arms of 42 articles (5512 patients, median 31 patients) were included in the systematic review. The systematic review identified positive changes in the primary endpoint. A meta-analysis of 10 articles found that NIH-CPSI total score results were significantly influenced by placebo, with a mean difference of -4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -6.31, -2.09). Mean differences for NIH-CPSI pain domain, urinary domain, and quality of life domain were -2.31 (95% CI: -3.4, -1.21), -1.12 (95% CI: -1.62, -0.62), and -1.67 (95% CI: -2.38, -0.96) respectively; all with p < 0.001. For the objective indicator Qmax, three articles were included in the meta-analysis, showing a mean change from baseline of 0.68 (95% CI: -0.85, 2.22, p = 0.38). The systematic review showed no significant changes in pain, measured by VAS or other scores, IPSS, and PVR.

- **Conclusions**: Placebo significantly affected the subjective parameters.

### Prostatitis: A review [^113Vvw95]. JAMA (2025). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is defined as infection, inflammation, or pain of the prostate gland and affects approximately 9.3% of men in their lifetime.

- **Observations**: Acute bacterial prostatitis consists of a urinary tract infection (UTI) that includes infection of the prostate, typically associated with fever or chills and caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, or Pseudomonas, in 80% to 97% of cases. First-line therapy for acute prostatitis is broad-spectrum intravenous or oral antibiotics, such as intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, or oral ciprofloxacin, with a 92% to 97% success rate when prescribed for 2 to 4 weeks for individuals with febrile UTI and acute prostatitis. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is defined as a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate, typically presenting as recurrent UTIs from the same strain. Up to 74% of chronic bacterial prostatitis diagnoses are due to gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli. First-line therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis is a minimum 4-week course of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) presents as pelvic pain or discomfort for at least 3 months and is associated with urinary symptoms, such as urinary frequency. CP/CPPS is diagnosed when evaluation, including history and physical examination, urine culture, and postvoid residual measurement, does not identify other causes for the symptoms, such as infection, cancer, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index is often used to assess and manage this condition.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^115rdaYp]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

One previous report described that approximately 6% of prostatic abscesses develop in patients during the follow-up period after acute prostatitis. However, prostatic abscesses are often found in patients who do not improve with initial antibiotic therapy. Therefore, without routine imaging studies, a prostate abscess present initially may be missed rather than developing from acute prostatitis during the follow-up period.

In our 111 cases of confirmed acute prostatitis without abscess, abscess formation was not identified during the treatment period. Routine imaging studies such as CT or TRUS should be considered in cases of acute prostatitis for this reason, especially in patients with long-term symptom duration and voiding disturbances. Such imaging will allow physicians to anticipate a treatment method for an abscess, since these abscesses may require drainage. Ludwig et al. found that fluctuation during the digital rectal exam was present in 83.3% of prostate abscesses. The group agreed that additional imaging is necessary to avoid missing a diagnosis of a prostate abscess.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: Part II treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^116t2iZE]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

This guideline covers the evaluation and treatment of men who present to a clinician with a complaint of chronic pelvic pain. It is part II of a three-part series focusing on the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). A challenge for clinicians treating these patients is the necessity to address symptoms and etiologies outside of the usual urologic evaluation. Consequently, recommended treatment utilizes a multimodal/multidisciplinary approach that is highlighted through discussion of referral to other specialists and allied health professionals while continuing to manage urologic symptoms. For discussion of patient evaluation and treatment of chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP), refer to parts I and III of this series.

- **Materials and methods**: The systematic review that informs the guideline statements was based on searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 6, 2023), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through May 2023), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through May 2023). An updated search was conducted in June 2024.

- **Results**: The Chronic Pelvic Pain Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements to provide guidance for the treatment of patients with CP/CPPS, which may include lifestyle modification, behavioral therapy, pharmacologic and phytotherapeutic options, and procedural intervention.

- **Conclusions**: We usually think of pain in response to tissue injury that resolves with healing. We now know that pain can also derive from neurologic origins. Effective treatment of CP/CPPS will require better insights into the nature of chronic pain and its varied sources.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: two different sub-categories according to a previous manipulation of the lower urinary tract [^117PFjph]. World Journal of Urology (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bacterial prostatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an uncommon infection of the prostate gland due to bacteria, usually with severe presentation.

- **Pathophysiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis is an infection of the prostate gland, typically caused by common urinary tract pathogens. The bacteria usually enter the prostate from the urethra, triggering an inflammatory response within the gland. This inflammation can lead to swelling and discomfort in the prostate and surrounding areas.

- **Epidemiology**: Acute bacterial prostatitis constitutes nearly 10% of prostatitis diagnoses, predominantly affecting individuals aged 20–40 and those over 70 years.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute bacterial prostatitis often present with a range of symptoms. These can include fever, chills, and malaise, as well as urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Some patients may also experience pelvic or perineal pain, and in severe cases, there may be blood in the urine. In some instances, patients may present with symptoms of urosepsis, such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute bacterial prostatitis is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves antibiotics.

### Oral pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114emGn1]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) are empirically used; however, the quantitative comparative effectiveness and safety of multiple pharmacological treatments are lacking.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 22, 2022. Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more oral pharmacological treatments for patients with CP/CPPS were included. Title, abstract, and full-text screening were independently performed by four reviewers. Primary outcomes were efficacy (the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index [NIH — CPSI] total score, pain score, urinary score, and quality of life score [QoL]) and safety (adverse events). This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020184106.

- **Findings**: 25 studies (3514 patients) assessed 26 treatments. Low to very low-quality evidence indicated that doxazosin (mean difference [MD], –11.4, 95% credible interval [CrI], –17.5 to –5.1) and the doxazosin, ibuprofen, and thiocolchicoside combination (MD, –11.6, CrI, –18.1 to –5.3) were significantly more effective than placebo in the NIH — CPSI total score. Other NIH — CPSI relative outcomes (pain, urinary, and QoL scores) showed a similar pattern. Low and very low-quality evidence suggested that combination treatment including doxazosin, ibuprofen, and thiocolchicoside (odds ratios [OR], 3.2, CrI, 0.5 to 19.3) and the tamsulosin and dapoxetine combination (OR, 6.0, CrI, 0.7 to 67.3) caused more adverse events.

### Prostatic artery embolization is safe and effective for medically recalcitrant radiation-induced prostatitis [^113W574h]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health categorizes prostatitis into four entities based on acuity and etiology. Types I and II are acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, respectively. Types III and IV are nonbacterial, with the presence or absence of symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of chronic prostatitis is 1.8% to 8.2%, with a range of urinary and sexual symptoms. Type III, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), represents 90% of all prostatitis cases and results from an inciting agent causing prostatic damage and pelvic floor pain. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a predisposing factor.

Radiation therapy (RT) remains a mainstay of definitive therapy for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Management of chronic genitourinary (GU) toxicity from RT is challenging, with ≥ grade 3 GU toxicities reaching 33%. Men with larger prostates have higher rates of chronic GU toxicity, with CP/CPPS occurring in patients receiving a high central urethral dose. Treatment is challenging and focuses on the clearance of underlying infection, pain control, and alleviating LUTS. However, the clinical efficacy of medical management is variable, and the effectiveness of emerging therapies like prostatic artery embolization (PAE) for CP/CPPS should be investigated.

PAE has been used successfully to significantly reduce symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia. We report a case series of patients who had PAE for refractory CP/CPPS after RT.

### Prostatitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^117UiJHL]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Prostatitis ranges from a straightforward clinical entity in its acute form to a complex, debilitating condition when chronic. It is often a source of frustration for the treating physician and patient.

There are four classifications of prostatitis: acute bacterial, chronic bacterial, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic. Diagnosis of acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis is primarily based on history, physical examination, urine culture, and urine specimen testing pre- and post-prostatic massage.

The differential diagnosis of prostatitis includes acute cystitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract stones, bladder cancer, prostatic abscess, enterovesical fistula, and foreign body within the urinary tract. The mainstay of therapy is an antimicrobial regimen.

- **Chronic pelvic pain syndrome**: This is a more challenging entity, in part because its pathology is poorly understood. Diagnosis is often based on exclusion of other urologic conditions (e.g. voiding dysfunction, bladder cancer) in association with its presentation. Commonly used medications include antimicrobials, alpha blockers, and anti-inflammatory agents, but the effectiveness of these agents has not been supported in clinical trials. Small studies provide limited support for the use of nonpharmacologic modalities.

Asymptomatic prostatitis is an incidental finding in a patient being evaluated for other urologic problems.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis: Two different sub-categories according to a previous manipulation of the lower urinary tract [^114Q67FE]. World Journal of Urology (2006). High credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a disease that can be associated with various conditions and symptoms, including:

- **Urinary symptoms**: phimosis, increased urine protein, urinary tract infections (UTIs), positive urine culture, urinary hesitancy, urinary urgency, positive urine nitrites, dysuria, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying

- **Prostatic and sexual symptoms**: prostatic tenderness, prostatic fluctuance, painful ejaculation, hematospermia, penile pain

- **Gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms**: nausea, fever, altered mental status, chills, vomiting, malaise

- **Surgical and procedural history**: transurethral surgery, cystoscopy, insertion of a urinary catheter, prostate biopsy

- **Specific medical conditions**: sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), epididymitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), orchitis, urethral stricture, urethritis

- **Pain**: suprapubic tenderness, scrotal pain, suprapubic pain, rectal pain, pelvic pain

- **Urinary function**: urinary retention, urinary straining, urinary frequency, weak urine stream

- **Laboratory findings**: increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), increased blood neutrophil count, increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP), increased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pyuria, positive urine leukocyte esterase, hematuria

- **Complications and other signs**: prostatic abscess, sepsis, an enlarged prostate, painful bowel movements

### Bacteria in the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome: molecular approaches to critical research questions [^114eF2Kz]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

There is a pressing need to determine the causes and consequences of, and optimal therapy for, the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Purpose**: New data suggest that bacterial infection may be critical in some patients. We examined the rationale for and technical approaches to hypothesis-driven studies of bacteria in the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

- **Results**: The first hypothesis was that patients with the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome have prostatic bacteria that distinguish them from controls. In pilot studies, patients with inflamed expressed prostatic secretions were more likely to have bacterial DNAs, such as 16S ribosomal DNAs. Goals are to clone, sequence, and compare ribosomal DNAs from patients and controls to determine which bacteria are most specific to the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and which should be targeted in clinical trials. The second hypothesis was that bacterial viability correlates with the severity of the chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Quantitative assays for bacterial elongation factor messenger RNA (tufA messenger RNA) provide tools to correlate bacterial viability with patient characteristics, provide insights into the potential value of antimicrobial therapy, and identify characteristics that distinguish patients most likely to respond. The third hypothesis was that patients with prostatic bacteria have similar bacteria in expressed prostatic secretions or on seminal fluid analysis and, furthermore, these bacteria differ.

### New developments in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^113A1XAF]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

To describe recent advancements in the diagnosis and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), recent findings indicate that symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis/CPPS tend to cluster into two groups. One group exhibits primarily pelvic or localized disease, while the other presents with more systemic symptoms. Several other chronic pain conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome, can be associated with chronic prostatitis/CPPS. Markers of neurologic inflammation and autoimmune disease show parallel changes in symptoms following treatment.

Treatment options have expanded to include new alpha-blockers, psychological intervention, and prostate-directed therapy. Additionally, areas such as acupuncture and pelvic floor physical therapy/myofascial release have garnered increased attention recently and appear to be promising options for these patients. Future therapies could involve antibodies targeting mediators of neurogenic inflammation and potentially addressing bacteria in the bowel.

The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis/CPPS must encompass conditions that traditionally fall outside the scope of urologic practice but are crucial for the effective care of men experiencing chronic pelvic pain. Treatment is most effective when utilizing multiple simultaneous therapies that address the various aspects of the condition.

### Prostatitis: The last frontier [^111B4AQu]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Prostatitis, often considered the neglected third disease after benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer, represents the last frontier of prostate disease. Innovative new research and clinical initiatives have revived urologists' interest in this difficult and frustrating condition. **New funding initiatives**: Industry interest and powerful patient lobby groups have propelled this long-neglected syndrome back onto the urologic agenda.

- **Current knowledge**: Presented here is an inventory of what is and is not known about prostatitis. It is based on a review of the literature, undisputed facts, solid hypotheses, and common sense. The text also offers a series of personal challenges to the urologic community.

As we enter the twenty-first century, it is imperative to develop a rational management strategy for patients who present with symptoms of prostatitis.

### Oral pharmacological treatments for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111zdhkQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The first NMA for CP/CPPS concluded that α-blockers, antibiotics, and combinations of them appear to achieve the greatest improvement in NIH-CPSI total scores compared with placebo, and anti-inflammatories also have a lesser but measurable benefit on CP/CPPS clinical symptoms. In terms of mechanism of included pharmacological treatment, α-blockers reduce the autonomic sympathetic tone in the bladder neck and prostate, which may relieve urinary symptoms of CP/CPPS. Antibiotics are empirically used although no bacterial cause can be identified among patients with CP/CPPS. Anti-inflammatories could decrease inflammatory-mediated pain of CP/CPPS. 5-α-reductase inhibitors reduce the production of dihydrotestosterone and prostate size, which may reduce pain and urinary symptoms. Neuromodulators reduce neural sensitization and consequently relieve the neuropathic pain involving areas outside the prostate or pelvic area. Phytomedicine may have anti-inflammatory effects, reducing pelvic pain and impaired voiding.

The study extends the findings of previous studies that synthesized individual drugs into grouped drugs. Although grouped drugs, such as different α-blockers, have similar action mechanisms (e.g. α-blockade), they are very different in terms of α-receptor selectivity and side effects. The clinical practice guidelines recommend some grouped drugs, such as antibiotics, α-blockers, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, for the treatment of CP/CPPS. However, clinicians require more evidence to make patient-specific choices. In this study, we included the most commonly used oral treatments.

### Antimicrobial therapy for bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis [^112oqsyk]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy is the standard of care for the unusual man with true chronic bacterial prostatitis but does not have much of a role in the treatment of men with nonbacterial prostatitis. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics given for 2 to 4 weeks will cure about 70% of chronic bacterial infections of the prostate. If this treatment fails, the symptomatic manifestations of the infections can almost always be eliminated with suppressive antimicrobial therapy using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, or nitrofurantoin.

### The etiology and management of acute prostatitis [^1121WTtG]. Nature Reviews Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial prostatitis is a common and clinically important genitourinary disorder. Patient populations who are at especially high risk of acute prostatitis include those with diabetes, cirrhosis, and suppressed immune systems. The cause is usually an ascending infection, but bacteria can also be introduced during a transrectal prostate biopsy. Clinical presentation ranges from mild lower urinary tract symptoms to full sepsis. The causative organisms are usually similar to those that cause other common genitourinary infections and include Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Oral or intravenous antibiotics are usually effective for curing the infection, and progression to chronic bacterial prostatitis is, therefore, uncommon. Immunosuppressed patients require special consideration, as bacterial prostatitis in these patients can be caused by atypical infecting organisms and might, therefore, require additional therapies. A lack of response to standard therapy can lead to complications such as a prostatic abscess or fistula.

### Prostatitis revisited: new definitions, new approaches [^111bDaXw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Prostatitis syndromes represent an important healthcare problem resulting in considerable morbidity and expenditure of healthcare resources. The comparison of the traditional and consensus classification schemes demonstrates no changes in the traditional categories of acute bacterial prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Examining only the EPS results in the diagnosis of half of the patients with inflammatory CP/CPPS. An optimal diagnostic strategy requires the evaluation of the VB3 and SFA in addition to the traditional EPS examination. Such precision is necessary for research studies; however, whether such precision is important clinically remains unproved.

The new interest in optimal evaluation and characterization of patients with chronic prostatitis and related conditions has resulted in important research initiatives examining the etiology and optimal treatment for this large group of patients.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^114DwjGi]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Regardless of the surgical procedure, the presence of a prostatic abscess did not increase the risk of septic shock during treatment. In our experience, patients with prostate abscesses require long-term antibiotic treatment and potentially surgery depending on abscess size. However, abscess formation may not exert an influence on the prognosis, such as septic shock or death, under the assumption that they were treated appropriately.

The vast majority of acute prostatitis cases were infected by gram-negative bacteria. Regardless of the presence of an abscess, the selection of empirical antibiotics with cefoxitin, cefotaxime, or ciprofloxacin would be appropriate in patients with acute prostatitis who have not undergone urological procedures in Korea. Nevertheless, clinicians should be ready to adjust the antibiotic regimen according to susceptibility data, especially in the case of prostate abscesses. This is because unexpected microorganisms are more likely to be isolated in acute prostatitis with abscess than in those without abscess.

This study has limitations. It is a retrospective, multi-centre chart review in design, which has potential biases associated with it. Designing a randomised control trial comparing treatment outcomes in two groups of equally matched patients with prostatic abscess is not feasible given the rarity and severity of the disease, and the heterogeneity of management for this condition throughout the urological community.

### Prostatitis [^116yUBYf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prostatitis is a common condition that accounts for a significant number of visits to both the emergency department and the urologist. The precise pathogenic mechanism of prostatitis is not known; however, the most prevalent theory is that reflux of urine from the urethra into the intraprostatic ducts promotes ascending infection and leads to chemical or bacterial prostatitis.

Treatment is challenging because many antimicrobial agents do not effectively diffuse into prostatic tissue, and many cases of prostatitis are not found to have an infectious etiology. Prostatitis can be divided into different classifications, which range from acute severe infections to chronic indolent infections and chronic pain syndromes. The differentiation and management of these entities can be difficult. This article seeks to clarify the different infections and provide a rational approach to treatment and disposition of these patients.

### Primary care physician practices in the diagnosis, treatment and management of men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome [^114PXYna]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To describe practice patterns of primary care physicians (PCPs) for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), we surveyed 556 PCPs in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles (RR = 52%). Only 62% reported ever seeing a patient like the one described in the vignette. In all, 16% were 'not at all' familiar with CP/CPPS, and 48% were 'not at all' familiar with the National Institutes of Health classification scheme. PCPs reported practice patterns regarding CP/CPPS, which are not supported by evidence. Although studies suggest that CP/CPPS is common, many PCPs reported little or no familiarity, important knowledge deficits, and limited experience in managing men with this syndrome.

### Acute bacterial prostatitis and abscess formation [^111GL2Dv]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

In general, abscesses form due to an inflammatory process that arises from an infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a prostate abscess develops from a prostatic infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports comparing acute prostatitis with and without abscesses. Prostate abscess is a rare condition, with only a few reports of its diagnosis and treatment described over several decades. Several groups have suggested that indwelling catheters, infravesical obstruction, instrumentation of the lower urinary tract, diabetes mellitus (DM), liver disease, and prostate biopsy are predisposing factors for prostate abscess. These risk factors are considered reasonable but are not yet supported by evidence.

Patients with a prostate abscess must be monitored closely, as they may experience a high mortality rate if adequate, proper, and timely treatment does not occur. However, compared to acute prostatitis without an abscess, outcomes of acute prostatitis with an abscess remain unclear. Here, we present data from 142 acute bacterial prostatic infections and compare acute bacterial prostatitis with and without abscess.
