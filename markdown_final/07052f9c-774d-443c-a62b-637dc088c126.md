## Question

thyroid panel testing indications for thyroid nodules

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for thyroid panel testing in patients with thyroid nodules. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which laboratories constitute the "thyroid panel" in guideline-based nodule evaluation. Then, I should verify which tests are universally recommended versus conditionally indicated. Next, I will review special scenarios like calcitonin and parathyroid testing, and clarify the role of thyroglobulin. After that, I need to consider the implications of abnormal TSH for imaging and biopsy decisions. Finally, I will integrate a concise, risk-stratified algorithm and ensure consistency with major guidelines from ATA, AACE/ACE/AME, ETA, and NCCN, including the evidence strength where possible.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of the "thyroid panel" for nodule evaluation. In this context, it should include at minimum serum TSH and, if TSH is abnormal, free T4 with or without total T3, and anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies when TSH is elevated, which is consistently recommended across ATA, AACE/ACE/AME, ETA, and AAFP guidance, and supported by primary care and endocrine society consensus statements [^116Z1Hqg] [^113n1g4j] [^115DBpf7] [^113pHpMM] [^116cF3op].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought a "full thyroid panel" might include thyroglobulin, but wait, I should verify whether Tg is part of initial nodule workup, and I need to correct that assumption because routine serum thyroglobulin is not recommended in the initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule and should be reserved for postsurgical follow-up and select scenarios, not for diagnosis or initial risk stratification of nodules [^112GmLSE] [^113zpjp4].

> I will now examine the indication for calcitonin, since it often causes confusion. I should double-check the strength of recommendations because multiple guidelines converge on not recommending routine basal calcitonin screening for all nodules, though selective use can be considered in patients with suspicious ultrasound features, indeterminate cytology, or family/medical history suggesting medullary thyroid carcinoma, with thresholds such as > 50–100 pg/mL raising strong concern for MTC and supporting surgical planning and, when available, calcitonin FNA washout in modest elevations, noting that NCCN and AACE/ACE/AME allow selective consideration while ATA issues a no-routine-screening stance [^114ziuX6] [^113AMbQw] [^1113c7T9] [^112xehVq].

> Next, I should review when parathyroid studies are warranted. If a nodular lesion has imaging features suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma or if hyperparathyroidism is suspected, then serum calcium and intact PTH are indicated, so I need to ensure I don't conflate thyroid and parathyroid workups even though they are anatomically adjacent [^1124evaJ].

> Let me think about the downstream implications of TSH results. If TSH is suppressed, I should confirm that a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated to determine if the nodule is hyperfunctioning, because hyperfunctioning nodules have a very low malignancy risk and typically obviate the need for FNA, whereas nonfunctioning nodules follow standard ultrasound-based FNA criteria, so I should verify that sequence before discussing biopsy thresholds [^116Dmdi7] [^114Axijg] [^112fdxjj].

> I should confirm antibody testing indications. Anti-TPO antibodies are recommended when TSH is elevated to evaluate for autoimmune thyroiditis, and anti-TG antibodies may be added when chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is suspected and anti-TPO is normal, so I need to check that we're not ordering antibodies reflexively in euthyroid patients with isolated nodules absent clinical suspicion of autoimmunity [^115DBpf7] [^114cociS] [^113n1g4j].

> Now, I will synthesize the universal initial evaluation. For any patient with a thyroid nodule, obtain serum TSH, and if TSH is suppressed add free T4 and total T3 and proceed to a radionuclide uptake scan to assess for autonomously functioning tissue, while if TSH is elevated add free T4 and anti-TPO antibodies, and if anti-TPO is normal but suspicion for thyroiditis persists, consider anti-TG, ensuring we do not add unnecessary tests in euthyroid patients without red flags [^116Z1Hqg] [^116Dmdi7] [^113n1g4j] [^116cF3op].

> Next, I should review the conditional or selective tests. Calcitonin is not routine but may be considered in nodules with high-suspicion sonographic features, indeterminate cytology with concerning features, family history of MTC or MEN2, or RET variant carriers, with preoperative calcitonin or FNA washout helping triage to total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection when markedly elevated, while remembering that modest elevations can occur in C-cell hyperplasia or renal insufficiency, so I need to ensure pretest probability and context are aligned before ordering it [^114ziuX6] [^1113c7T9] [^115hYRTZ] [^112xehVq].

> I should confirm the role of thyroglobulin outside of postsurgical surveillance. Tg is a cancer surveillance marker after total thyroidectomy and/or radioactive iodine and is not part of the initial diagnostic workup of a nodule, so ordering it upfront would be inappropriate and could confound interpretation in the presence of residual thyroid tissue [^112GmLSE] [^113zpjp4] [^112haJW7].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with TSH for all nodules, branch to free T4 and total T3 if TSH is low and proceed to uptake imaging to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that do not require FNA, and if TSH is high add free T4 and anti-TPO antibodies to evaluate hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis, reserving calcitonin for selected high-risk scenarios and avoiding routine Tg in the diagnostic phase, which aligns with ATA, AACE/ACE/AME, ETA, and AAFP guidance [^116Z1Hqg] [^113n1g4j] [^113pHpMM] [^116cF3op].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence is transparent. Most recommendations for TSH-based initial testing are strong with low to moderate quality evidence, calcitonin screening receives no routine endorsement due to insufficient evidence and cost-effectiveness concerns, and Tg is explicitly discouraged in the initial evaluation, so counseling should reflect these gradations and local practice patterns while individualizing decisions to patient risk and preferences [^115vYWPY] [^114ziuX6] [^112GmLSE].

Thyroid panel testing is indicated for all patients with thyroid nodules to assess function and guide management [^116Z1Hqg]. The **essential test is serum TSH** [^113n1g4j]; if TSH is suppressed, add free T4 and total T3, and obtain a radionuclide scan to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that rarely harbor malignancy and typically do not require FNA [^116Dmdi7] [^112fdxjj]. If TSH is elevated, measure free T4 and anti-TPO antibodies to evaluate for hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^115DBpf7]. Routine calcitonin is not recommended [^112xehVq] but may be considered in patients with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer or suspicious ultrasound features [^1113c7T9]. Thyroglobulin is not indicated in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules [^112GmLSE].

## Indications for thyroid panel testing in thyroid nodules

Thyroid panel testing is indicated to **assess thyroid function**, identify hyper- or hypothyroidism, and guide further diagnostic and management decisions [^113pHpMM]. The following tests are recommended:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum TSH | All patients with thyroid nodules | Essential initial test to assess thyroid function and guide further evaluation [^116Z1Hqg] [^113pHpMM] |
| Free T4 and total T3 | Suppressed TSH | Identify hyperthyroidism and determine if nodule is hyperfunctioning [^112fdxjj] |
| Anti-TPO antibodies | Elevated TSH | Evaluate for Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^115DBpf7] |
| Calcitonin | - Family history of medullary thyroid cancer <br/> - Suspicious ultrasound features | Optional test to screen for medullary thyroid cancer [^114ziuX6] [^1113c7T9] |
| Thyroglobulin | Not indicated initially | Not recommended for initial evaluation of thyroid nodules [^112GmLSE] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines** on thyroid panel testing for thyroid nodules:

- **American Thyroid Association (ATA)**: Recommends serum TSH measurement for all patients with thyroid nodules. If TSH is suppressed, free T4 and total T3 should be measured, and a radionuclide thyroid scan should be performed to assess nodule function [^116Z1Hqg] [^116Dmdi7].

- **European Thyroid Association (ETA)**: Recommends thyroid function testing (TSH, free T4, and anti-TPO antibodies) in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules [^113pHpMM].

- **American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)**: Recommends serum TSH measurement in patients with thyroid nodules, with additional testing (free T4, anti-TPO antibodies) if TSH is abnormal [^116N7Dmj] [^115DBpf7].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal thyroid panel results

Abnormal thyroid panel results have **important clinical implications**:

- **Suppressed TSH**: Indicates hyperthyroidism, often due to a hyperfunctioning nodule. Hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, and cytologic evaluation is generally not required [^116Dmdi7] [^112fdxjj].

- **Elevated TSH**: Indicates hypothyroidism, often due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This information guides medical management and may influence surgical decisions if surgery is indicated [^113n1g4j].

- **Normal TSH**: Indicates euthyroidism, and further evaluation with ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy may be indicated based on nodule size and ultrasound characteristics [^112PYsD4].

---

## Limitations and controversies

While thyroid panel testing is generally recommended, some **limitations and controversies** exist:

- **Calcitonin testing**: Routine calcitonin measurement is controversial due to cost, false positives, and limited availability of confirmatory tests. It is not universally recommended but may be considered in selected patients [^114ziuX6] [^112xehVq].

- **Thyroglobulin testing**: Not recommended in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules due to limited diagnostic utility and potential for false positives [^112GmLSE].

---

Thyroid panel testing is indicated for all patients with thyroid nodules, primarily to assess thyroid function and guide further diagnostic and management decisions. The **essential test is serum TSH**, with additional tests (free T4, total T3, anti-TPO antibodies) indicated based on TSH results and clinical context.

Objective

To describe the evolution and clinical utility of molecular testing for thyroid nodules and cancer achieved over the last 2 decades.

Methods

Scientific reports on thyroid cancer genetics and molecular diagnostics in thyroid nodules.

Results

Over the last 2 decades, our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of thyroid cancer has dramatically expanded, such that most thyroid cancers now have known gene driver events. This knowledge provides the basis for establishing and further improving molecular tests for thyroid nodules and cancer and for the introduction of new entities such as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features. The progress with molecular tests for thyroid nodules started in the 1990s from demonstrating feasibility of detecting various molecular alterations in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material collected from thyroid nodules. It was followed by the introduction of the first single-gene mutational markers, such as BRAF, and a small mutational panel into clinical practice in the mid 2000s. Currently, several more advanced molecular tests are available for clinical use. They are based on multiple molecular markers and have increasing impact on the clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules.

Conclusion

The evolution of molecular tests for thyroid nodules followed the discovery of various diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers of thyroid cancer that can be applied to thyroid FNA samples to inform more individualized management of these patients.

Biochemical incomplete response — abnormal thyroglobulin (Tg) values in the absence of localizable disease is described for patients who "have persistently abnormal suppressed and/ or stimulated Tg values or rising anti-Tg antibodies without structural evidence of disease", with prior thresholds where "nonstimulated Tg values of > 1 ng/mL or TSH-stimulated Tg values of > 10 ng/mL" were used after total thyroidectomy and RAI ablation. This outcome "is seen in 11%–19% of ATA low-risk patients, 21%–22% of ATA intermediate-risk patients, and 16%–18% of ATA high-risk patients". Prognosis is favorable: "as many as 56%–68%" have "no evidence of disease at final follow-up", "19%–27% continue to have persistently abnormal Tg values without structural correlate", and "only 8%–17%" develop structural disease "over 5–10 years follow-up", with "No deaths have been reported in patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy followed for up to 10 years".

### A clinical algorithm for fine-needle aspiration molecular testing effectively guides the appropriate extent of initial thyroidectomy [^112uUqpx]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether a clinical algorithm using routine cytological molecular testing (MT) promotes initial total thyroidectomy (TT) for clinically significant thyroid cancer (sTC) and/or correctly limits surgery to lobectomy when appropriate.

Background

Either TT or lobectomy is often needed to diagnose differentiated thyroid cancer. Determining the correct extent of initial thyroidectomy is challenging.

Methods

After implementing an algorithm for prospective MT of in-house fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens, we conducted a single-institution cohort study of all patients (N = 671) with nonmalignant cytology who had thyroidectomy between October 2010 and March 2012, cytological diagnosis using 2008 Bethesda criteria, and 1 or more indications for thyroidectomy by 2009 American Thyroid Association guidelines. sTC was defined by histological differentiated thyroid cancer of 1 cm or more and/or lymph node metastasis. Cohort 2 patients did not have MT or had unevaluable results. In cohort 1, MT for a multigene mutation panel was performed for nonbenign cytology, and positive MT results indicated initial TT.

Results

MT guidance was associated with a higher incidence of sTC after TT (P = 0.006) and a lower rate of sTC after lobectomy (P = 0.03). Without MT results, patients with indeterminate (follicular lesion of undetermined significance/follicular or oncocytic neoplasm) cytology who received initial lobectomy were 2.5 times more likely to require 2-stage surgery for histological sTC (P < 0.001). In the 501 patients with non-sTC for whom lobectomy was the appropriate extent of surgery, lobectomy was correctly performed more often with routine preoperative MT (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy MT for BRAF, RAS, PAX8-PPARγ, and RET-PTC expedites optimal initial surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer, facilitating succinct definitive management for patients with thyroid nodules.

Figure 1.
Alluvial flow diagram showing simulated management and outcomes for 1000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The distributions of ultrasound (US)-defined risk classes, US-defined fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. US risk-stratification is that recommended by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines. Nodules not classifiable with the ATA system are included in the intermediate-suspicion category. Nondiagnostic nodules with very-low-suspicion or low-suspicion US findings can be managed with US surveillance, but repeat FNAB is indicated for those with intermediate- or high-suspicion US findings: in this diagram, all are shown as undergoing repeat biopsy. Bethesda II nodules require repeat biopsy only if the US-based risk class increases during surveillance (frequency: ~15% over 5 years of follow-up). The false-negative rate is less than 3% (e.g. sampling error; for high-suspicion nodules with Bethesda II cytology, repeat biopsy is suggested). For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing (regardless of other possible options). The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%. For high-suspicion nodules classified as benign by molecular testing, repeat biopsy is indicated. All Bethesda V and VI nodules are referred for surgery. Expected malignancy rates are 80% and 99%, respectively.

### European perspective on 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: proceedings of an interactive international symposium [^115nC7qE]. Thyroid (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are highly influential practice recommendations. The latest revision appeared in 2015 ("ATA 2015"). These guidelines were developed predominantly by North American experts. European experts frequently have different perspectives, given epidemiological, technological/methodological, practice organization, and medicolegal differences between the respective regions.

Summary

Divergent viewpoints were the focus of an invited symposium organized by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine involving 17 European thyroidologists, four ATA Guidelines Taskforce members, and an audience of 200 international experts. The group discussed the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules, surgery and the role of pathology, radioiodine (RAI) therapy (RAIT), the assessment of initial therapy and dynamic risk stratification, and the treatment of persistent disease, recurrences, and advanced thyroid cancer. The dialogue resulted in this position paper contrasting European and ATA 2015 perspectives on key issues. One difference pertains to the permissiveness of ATA 2015 regarding lobectomy for primary tumors ≤ 4cm. European panelists cited preclusion of RAIT, potential need for completion thyroidectomy, frequent inability to avoid chronic thyroid hormone replacement, and limitations of supportive evidence as arguments against widely applying lobectomy. Significant divergence involved ATA 2015's guidance regarding RAIT. European panelists favored wider use of postoperative RAIT than does ATA 2015. Rationales included the modality's association with favorable patient outcomes and generally limited toxicity, and lack of high-quality evidence supporting withholding RAIT. Additionally, European panelists favored recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) in more settings than does ATA 2015, citing avoidance of hypothyroid morbidity and quality-of-life impairment, without apparent sacrifice in oncologic outcomes. Based on clinical evidence plus theoretical advantages, European experts advocated dosimetric versus fixed-activity RAIT approaches for advanced DTC. European panelists noted that the ATA 2015 risk-stratification system requires information sometimes unavailable in everyday practice. ATA 2015 recommendations regarding RAI-refractory DTC should consider potential palliative benefits of RAIT in patients who also have RAI-susceptible lesions.

Conclusions

European panelists suggested modifications to approximately one-third of ATA 2015 recommendations. Varying European and ATA 2015 perspectives can stimulate analysis and discussion of the literature and performance of primary research to resolve discrepant recommendations and potentially improve patient outcomes.

AUS/FLUS cytology — Recommendation 15 states that for nodules with atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) cytology, investigations such as repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or molecular testing may be used to supplement malignancy risk assessment in lieu of proceeding directly with surveillance or diagnostic surgery, and informed patient preference and feasibility should be considered in clinical decision-making (Weak recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If repeat FNA cytology, molecular testing, or both are not performed or inconclusive, either surveillance or diagnostic surgical excision may be performed for an AUS/FLUS thyroid nodule, depending on clinical risk factors, sonographic pattern, and patient preference (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114yxYFR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is high — up to 60% as documented by high-resolution ultrasonography — but very few of these lesions ultimately prove to be malignant (about 5%). Although epidemiological studies suggest a small but real increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer, likely stemming from exposure to environmental risk factors, the growing number of thyroid cancer diagnoses is largely attributable to the increasingly widespread use of diagnostic imaging technology and medical surveillance, together with improved access to health care in general, all of which favor the discovery of small, subclinical thyroid nodules and small papillary thyroid cancers. These considerations have raised concern over the costs and potential morbidity associated with the short- and long-term management of patients with thyroid nodules, which includes periodic outpatient visits and cervical ultrasound examinations, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), genomic testing, and, in some indeterminate cases, diagnostic thyroid lobectomy. On the whole, there is a clearly perceived need for a more refined, tailored, and careful approach to the management of these highly prevalent lesions. Similar considerations can be extended to that amount of nodules that are proven to be malignant, but have a low-risk phenotype, and can be safely managed through more conservative surgery or even active surveillance programs. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently recommended practices for the initial workup and subsequent management of patients with thyroid nodules.

### Evidence-based evaluation of the thyroid nodule [^114cy7Rx]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most current literature on thyroid nodule evaluation, with particular attention to the problem of the incidentally identified thyroid nodule. Although traditional risk factors for thyroid cancer, such as age, gender, and familial syndromes, are still important, the manner in which a thyroid nodule comes to attention is of great importance these days when considering how to proceed in a workup. Most thyroid nodules today are discovered through radiologic imaging tests performed for other reasons. This article covers the key considerations that are vital in balancing the risks and benefits of thyroid nodule workup and treatment.

### American Thyroid Association statement on surgical application of molecular profiling for thyroid nodules: current impact on perioperative decision making [^111PV9Tq]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recent advances in research on thyroid carcinogenesis have yielded applications of diagnostic molecular biomarkers and profiling panels in the management of thyroid nodules. The specific utility of these novel, clinically available molecular tests is becoming widely appreciated, especially in perioperative decision making by the surgeon regarding the need for surgery and the extent of initial resection.

Methods

A task force was convened by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association and was charged with writing this article.

Results/Conclusions

This review covers the clinical scenarios by cytologic category for which the thyroid surgeon may find molecular profiling results useful, particularly for cases with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration cytology. Distinct strengths of each ancillary test are highlighted to convey the current status of this evolving field, which has already demonstrated the potential to streamline decision making and reduce unnecessary surgery, with the accompanying benefits. However, the performance of any diagnostic test, that is, its positive predictive value and negative predictive value, are exquisitely influenced by the prevalence of cancer in that cytologic category, which is known to vary widely at different medical centers. Thus, it is crucial for the clinician to know the prevalence of malignancy within each indeterminate cytologic category, at one's own institution. Without this information, the performance of the diagnostic tests discussed below may vary substantially.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — ancillary testing for indeterminate cytology states that no single cytochemical or genetic marker is specific or sensitive enough to rule out malignancy with certainty; immunohistochemical and molecular markers may be considered together with cytologic subcategories and data from ultrasound (US), elastography, or other imaging techniques to obtain additional information; in selected cases such as neck masses suspicious for lymph node metastasis from thyroid cancer or enlarged parathyroid glands, hormone measurement in the needle washouts increases fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnostic accuracy, and recommendations must take into account available local expertise, the clinical setting, and patient preference.

Genomic Test Helps Identify Thyroid Nodules That Don't Require Surgery, by NCI Staff A new study has found that a test that measures genomic changes in tissue samples taken from the thyroid can help identify which patients likely need diagnostic surgery for thyroid cancer and which do not. When a suspicious small growth or lump is found in the thyroid, doctors perform a fine-needle biopsy so that the cells can be examined by a pathologist. But up to one-third of the time, pathologists can't determine from the appearance of the cells whether the nodule is cancerous, explained the study's lead investigator, Yuri Nikiforov, M. D. Ph. D., of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Typically, people with indeterminate results go on to diagnostic surgery — the removal of the thyroid lobe that harbors the nodule. But most of these nodules turn out not to be cancer.

So researchers have long been interested in developing molecular tests to assess indeterminate biopsy samples. The genomic test used in this new study was able to accurately identify indeterminate biopsy samples that, after surgery, were found to be benign, the researchers reported November 8 in JAMA Oncology. The test is one of several genomic classifiers for thyroid nodules that are starting to be used in the United States. The goal of developing this type of genetic test "is to safely prevent unnecessary surgeries, " Dr. Nikiforov said. Aiming to Avoid Overtreatment The incidence of thyroid cancer has been rising steeply over the last few decades, though this rise appears to have tapered off in the last few years. Researchers think that much of this rise is due to the increased use of imaging procedures in the head and neck area to diagnose other conditions. Imaging can pick up thyroid nodules that don't cause symptoms and never would have been found by feeling the neck.

This rise in incidence has led to concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of thyroid nodules — the detection and treatment of nodules that would never have caused a medical problem. To try to address the rise in diagnostic thyroid surgeries, Dr. Nikiforov and his colleagues developed the ThyroSeq Genomic Classifier test. The test measures changes in 112 genes that have been linked to thyroid cancer. These changes include mutations, gene fusions, changes in copy number, and alterations in gene expression. The test generates a score based on how strongly each change found in a given tumor is associated with thyroid cancer. The cutoff for identifying a nodule as benign or cancerous was defined in a previous study by the team. For the new study, the researchers recruited 232 people who were already scheduled to undergo diagnostic surgery following an indeterminate thyroid biopsy.

After surgery, pathology results from the removed nodule were compared with the results from the genomic classifier test, which had been performed before surgery. Comparable Results to Pathology Traditional pathology reports on the surgically removed nodules determined that, out of 257 nodules, 72% were benign, 24% were malignant, and 4% were a type of borderline malignancy that should be surgically removed. Overall, the ThyroSeq test carried out on the biopsy samples taken before surgery classified 61% of the nodules as benign and 39% as cancerous. ThyroSeq correctly identified 94% of the nodules that were shown to be cancerous after surgery. The test performed about as well in all subtypes of thyroid cancer found in the study, including rare Hurthle cell neoplasms. Of the 152 biopsy samples that were classified as benign by ThyroSeq, 3% turned out to be false-negative results: that is, the nodules were actually cancerous.

American Thyroid Association diagnostic test recommendation framework — strong and weak recommendations are paired with evidence quality descriptors and explicit interpretations for use in adult thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. For a strong recommendation with high- or moderate-quality evidence, "Implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances without reservation". For a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence, "Implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances, but the utilization of the test may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available". For a weak recommendation, "Alternative options may be equally reasonable". When evidence is insufficient, "Insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against routinely offering the diagnostic test". Evidence quality definitions indicate that high-quality evidence comes from "Evidence from one or more well-designed nonrandomized diagnostic accuracy studies… or systematic reviews/meta-analyses of such observational studies… with no concern about internal validity or external generalizability of the results", whereas moderate- and low-quality evidence reflect "possible limitations causing minor concern" or "one or more important limitations causing serious concern" about validity or generalizability.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnostic evaluation based on thyroid cancer risk assessment [^114Fch8i]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common and can be detected by sensitive imaging in more than 60% of the general population. They are often identified in patients without symptoms who are undergoing evaluation for other medical complaints. Indiscriminate evaluation of thyroid nodules with thyroid biopsy could cause a harmful epidemic of diagnoses of thyroid cancer, but inadequate selection of thyroid nodules for biopsy can lead to missed diagnoses of clinically relevant thyroid cancer. Recent clinical guidelines advocate a more conservative approach in the evaluation of thyroid nodules based on risk assessment for thyroid cancer, as determined by clinical and ultrasound features to guide the need for biopsy. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that for patients with indeterminate thyroid biopsy results, a combined assessment including the initial ultrasound risk stratification or other ancillary testing (molecular markers, second opinion on thyroid cytology) can further clarify the risk of thyroid cancer and the management strategies. This review summarizes the clinical importance of adequate evaluation of thyroid nodules, focuses on the clinical evidence for diagnostic tests that can clarify the risk of thyroid cancer, and highlights the importance of considering the patient's values and preferences when deciding on management strategies in the setting of uncertainty about the risk of thyroid cancer.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^114UX13N]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most prevalent cancer of thyroid and is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States. The practice guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) for DTC management in adult patients (previously combined with thyroid nodules) were published initially in 1996, with subsequent revisions based on advances in the field. The goal of this update is to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, and those involved in health policy with rigorous, comprehensive, and contemporary guidelines to assist in the management of adult patients with DTC, emphasizing the patient journey beginning with a thyroid cancer diagnosis. Methods: The questions addressed were based, in part, on prior versions of the guidelines, with input from a larger, more diverse complement of stakeholders. The panel included members from multiple specialties involved in thyroid cancer care, including a patient advocate and an expert in systematic reviews/meta-analyses/guidelines who educated and supported task force members. The panel conducted systematic literature reviews to inform the recommendations and commissioned two additional systematic reviews. Published English-language articles were eligible for inclusion, with a final search date of July 1, 2024. A modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used for critical appraisal of evidence and determining the quality of data. The guidelines panel had editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of task force members were pre-vetted, regularly updated, communicated with task force members, and assessed and managed by ATA leadership and the Clinical Practice Guidelines and Statements Committee. Results: These revised guidelines begin with the initial cancer diagnosis and continue with recommendations for staging and risk assessment, initial treatment decisions, assessment of treatment responses, monitoring approaches, diagnostic testing, and subsequent therapies based on the strength of evidence for response and consideration of side effects and outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes and identified areas of need for additional high-quality research are highlighted. Conclusions: These revised evidence-based recommendations inform clinical decision-making in the management of DTC that reflect the changing science and optimize the evidence-based clinical care of patients throughout their journey with DTC. Critical areas of need for additional research are highlighted.

Thyroid ultrasound is used to identify and characterize thyroid nodules, and is not part of the routine evaluation of abnormal thyroid function tests unless the patient also has a large goiter or a lumpy thyroid. Incidentally discovered thyroid nodules are common. Overzealous use of ultrasound will frequently identify nodules, which are unrelated to the abnormal thyroid function, and may divert the clinical evaluation to assess the nodules, rather than the thyroid dysfunction. Imaging may be needed in thyrotoxic patients; when needed, a thyroid scan, not an ultrasound, is used to assess the etiology of the thyrotoxicosis and the possibility of focal autonomy in a thyroid nodule.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### The impact of molecular testing on the surgical management of patients with thyroid nodules [^114dr6SB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of molecular tests as an adjunct to FNA diagnosis of thyroid nodules has been increasing. However, the true impact of these tests on surgical practice has not been demonstrated. This study examines the usefulness of molecular testing on surgical management decisions in patients referred for thyroid surgery at a tertiary care center.

Methods

Clinical information was collected from patients who presented to Johns Hopkins Hospital for surgical consultation regarding a thyroid nodule and who underwent molecular testing between August 2009 and March 2013. Tests included an RNA-based gene expression classifier, a DNA-based somatic mutation panel, BRAF, NRAS, and/or RET/PTC translocation. A surgical management algorithm was created by consensus of four thyroid surgeons. Postsurgical pathology analysis in each case was then used to judge the appropriateness of the surgical decision-making and the usefulness of preoperative molecular testing, in guiding surgical planning.

Results

Of 114 patients assessed by preoperative molecular testing, 87 (72%) underwent surgery. Surgical management was altered in nine (10%) patients on the basis of molecular testing. Of these, surgical management change was appropriate, relative to the postoperative pathology analysis, for three patients and inappropriate for six patients.

Conclusions

In this study, molecular testing of thyroid nodule did not alter the surgical management of the majority of patients with thyroid nodules. These results indicate that molecular testing may be overused in patients for whom the results would not change surgical management. Furthermore, our data question the usefulness of the molecular tests examined in guiding preoperative surgical decision-making.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management [^116ZnosJ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

American Thyroid Association diagnostic test grading — Strong recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result clearly outweighs risks and burden of testing or vice versa". For patients, "In the case of an accurate test for which benefits outweigh risks/burden, most would want the diagnostic to be offered (with appropriate counseling)" and, when risks/burden outweigh benefits, "most patients should not expect the test to be offered". For clinicians, "most patients should be offered the diagnostic test (and provided relevant counseling)" and if harms outweigh benefits "the rationale against the test should, for the particular clinical situation, be explained". For policymakers, "availability of the diagnostic test should be adopted in health policy" and if harms predominate "some restrictions on circumstances for test use may need to be considered". Weak recommendation is when "Knowledge of the diagnostic test result is closely balanced with risks and burden of testing"; patient decisions vary by circumstances, clinicians note "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients" and counseling "should include a discussion of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties related to testing (as applicable), as well as the implications of the test result", and "The decision to perform the test should include consideration of the patients' values, preferences, feasibility, and the specific circumstances", while policymakers state "Policymaking decisions on the availability of the test will require discussion and stakeholder involvement". No recommendation applies when "Balance of knowledge of the diagnostic test result cannot be determined", and then "Decisions on the use of the test based on evidence from scientific studies cannot be made".

Diagnostic test appraisal scope and development — "Frequently in these guidelines, the accuracy of the diagnosis of thyroid cancer (relative to a histologic gold standard) was the diagnostic outcome unless otherwise specified", and "prognostic, disease staging, or risk stratification studies were also included in the grading scheme of diagnostic studies". The panel noted that "the ACP Guideline Grading System is not designed for this purpose", and "We reviewed a number of appraisal systems for diagnostic tests, but some of the complexity and the time-consuming nature of some systems limited their feasibility for implementation in our group (27–31)". Consequently, "We drafted, revised, and piloted the use of a newly developed diagnostic test appraisal system that was acceptable to panel members", and for such systems "the implication for use would be on the part of the clinician, in reporting results in the medical record and communicating them to the patient (at the applicable time point in disease or follow-up trajectory), as opposed to offering a specific choice of staging/risk stratification system to the patient".

### Molecular profiling of thyroid nodules-are these findings meaningful, or merely measurable? a review [^111KWekX]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Advances in genomic technologies have facilitated the development of sophisticated molecular diagnostic tests for thyroid nodules, in the hopes of better risk stratifying nodules with indeterminate cytopathologic diagnosis. It is unclear whether the widespread, or reflexive, use of these tests will improve outcomes for patients with thyroid nodules.

Observations

Thyroid nodules are a common and essentially normal finding. Even cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules have a very low probability (approximately 1%) of representing clinically aggressive cancers and an even lower probability (approximately 0.1%) of representing lethal cancers. Therefore, most indeterminate thyroid nodules are low risk. Even if some will eventually require surgery, many can initially be kept under surveillance rather than requiring immediate surgery. Clinical and radiographic features can be helpful in risk stratifying these nodules. Molecular assays are marketed as tools to improve risk stratification for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. However, the performance of these tests varies markedly across different practice settings, and the predictive value of these tests in real world practice may be lower than the numbers provided on laboratory reports. It is unclear whether these assays improve patient outcomes, such as survival or quality of life, or substantially reduce the number of thyroid surgeries performed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Because of variable performance, unclear benefit to patients, and questionable cost-effectiveness, clinical practice guidelines in the US and Europe currently do not recommend the universal, reflexive use of molecular assays for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. These tests might offer value when used in selected scenarios, although this is not well understood. Future research should address whether the routine use of these molecular diagnostic tests leads to superior patient survival or quality-of-life outcomes compared with management based on clinical and radiographic criteria.

However, routine measurement of basal serum calcitonin is not recommended by the NCCN Panel for evaluating nodular thyroid disease because of the expense of screening all nodules for few MTC cases, the lack of confirmatory pentagastrin stimulation testing, and the resulting need for thyroidectomy in some benign cases; the American Thyroid Association (ATA) is equivocal about routine calcitonin measurement.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

### Determining patient preferences for indeterminate thyroid nodules: observation, surgery or molecular tests [^111BiSve]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gene-expression classifiers (GEC) and genetic mutation panels (GMP) have been shown to improve preoperative diagnostic evaluations of indeterminate thyroid nodules. Despite the improvement, uncertainty regarding the proper management exists. Patient preferences may better inform the management of these indeterminate thyroid nodules.

Methods

Hypothetical scenarios were administered to two groups of patients: those with previous FNA-confirmed indeterminate thyroid nodules (Group A, n = 50) and those presenting to a general otolaryngology clinic for other reasons (Group B, n = 50). We evaluated patient preferences for surgery, observation and the use of molecular tests while varying the risk of malignancy, cost and diagnostic properties of the tests.

Results

The mean threshold for choosing surgery over observation was a 38.6% risk of malignancy on FNA. When offered either GEC, GMP or both (with their inherent imperfect diagnostic properties) in addition to the indeterminate FNA, 85.0% of respondents picked at least one of the molecular tests over either observation or surgery if the test(s) were free of charge. However, only 51.7% of respondents chose at least one of the tests when asked to pay the current cost of the test(s) (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, sex, the presence of an indeterminate FNA diagnosis and income level significantly predicted the desire to proceed with a molecular test above standard management.

Conclusion

Patient preferences for thyroid nodule management are dependent on the risk of malignancy, prognosis of cancer and costs. Patients prefer molecular tests over standard management with indeterminate thyroid nodules, but the costs of the test(s) reduce the desire.

NCCN Thyroid carcinoma — indeterminate thyroid nodule cytology and molecular diagnostics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of molecular diagnostic testing for these indeterminate groups, and modern genomic classifiers for oncocytic carcinoma have shown promise with sensitivity values ranging from 88.9% to 92.9% and specificity values ranging from 58.8% to 69.3% for detecting oncocytic carcinoma. Molecular diagnostic testing may include multigene assays or individual mutational analysis, and molecular markers are beneficial for making decisions about targeted therapy options for advanced disease and for informing eligibility for some clinical trials. Patients can be followed with nodule surveillance if the application of a specific molecular diagnostic test (with clinical and ultrasound features) results in a predicted risk of malignancy comparable to cytologically benign FNAs (approximately ≤ 5%), but because published studies have focused primarily on adults, the diagnostic utility of molecular diagnostics in pediatric patients remains to be defined.

Discussion

Although FNA is a well-validated and sensitive diagnostic test, 20–30% of results fall into an indeterminate category, which leads to diagnostic thyroid surgery. Unfortunately, many diagnostic lobectomies are required for what is determined to be benign disease, whereas for other patients, a second definitive surgery is needed when thyroid cancer is diagnosed after lobectomy. As we and others have previously shown, improved preoperative risk stratification has been achieved by use of molecular markers identified to be commonly associated with thyroid cancer; by using a variety of testing techniques and markers, we now know that preoperative detection of an associated genetic alteration is 85–99% predictive of thyroid cancer. However, with the implementation of any new and potentially costly testing, analysis to determine comparative efficacy is important to demonstrate.

Our study found that although the use of the described molecular panel added a distributed cost of $104 per patient, use of the molecular marker panel resulted in an approximately 20% reduction in diagnostic lobectomy use (MT 9.7 vs. 11.6%) and a corresponding increase in initial TT use (MT 18.2 vs. 16.1%). Furthermore, improvements in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were also observed with use of molecular testing hypothetically resulting in an increase in the number of true-positive cases (two of 10,000) and a decrease in the number of false positives (107 of 10,000). We believe that the observed sensitivity and specificity changes were small precisely because the model used the current standards of care under the ATA guidelines, instead of using a potentially amended care algorithm. In our current clinical practice, patients with FLUS and FN still undergo diagnostic surgery even with negative molecular testing results. In short, this hypothetical model demonstrates that the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with FLUS and FN results is facilitated by molecular testing, with cost savings in part due to small improvements in test performance but predominantly due to reduction in the number of unnecessary operations.

Molecular testing — When molecular testing should be considered: to complement not replace cytologic evaluation, the results are expected to influence clinical management, and as a general rule, not recommended in nodules with established benign or malignant cytologic characteristics. For cytologically indeterminate nodules, cytopathology expertise, patient characteristics, and prevalence of malignancy within the population being tested impact the negative predictive values (NPVs).

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

For cytologically benign nodules, the panel notes that repeat US-guided FNA "would be a reasonable alternative to molecular testing"; MT-positive benign nodules "should be managed by initial oncologic thyroidectomy", and MT-negative benign nodules "should be managed nonoperatively, unless other clinical reasons for surgery are present".

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^112PYsD4]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

Follow-up examinations: what to look for

Fig. 1 shows the simulated management strategies and outcomes of 1000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The overall management pathway is based on the US-risk stratification of the target lesions and the cytology assessment (if any). These scenarios do not include symptomatic thyroid nodules that are already candidates for resection regardless of their sonographic features. In these cases, a biopsy might be performed to clarify the best surgical approach, but the results would not change the indication for surgery itself. The distributions of US-defined risk classes, US-defined FNAB indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing, although other options are offered. However, if these alternative approaches, guided by clinical and US data, had been used, it is unlikely that the final number of resected nodules and their malignancy rate would be significantly different from those shown in Fig. 1. The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

BRAF mutations confer close to 100% probability of malignancy; reported BRAF testing performance includes sensitivity 36% (10 of 28) and specificity 100% (24 of 24) in one study and sensitivity 45.5% (15 of 33) and specificity 85.7% (12 of 14) in another, while a seven-gene panel yields sensitivity 50%–68%, specificity 86%–96%, PPV 80%–95%, and NPV 72%–75%.

Importance

Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing, and when fine-needle aspiration biopsy results are cytologically indeterminate, the diagnosis is often still established only after thyroidectomy. Molecular marker testing may be helpful in guiding patient-oriented and tailored management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.

Objective

To summarize available data on the use of molecular testing to improve the diagnosis and prognostication of thyroid cancer.

Evidence Review

A MEDLINE review was conducted using the primary search terms molecular, thyroid cancer, thyroid nodule, and gene expression classifier in search strings. Articles were restricted to those published between January 1, 2010, and June 1, 2015, inclusive of adult humans, and reported in the English language only.

Findings

Of 867 titles screened, 67 articles were further identified for review of the full text. The 2 most studied molecular marker testing techniques for indeterminate thyroid nodules include gene expression classifier analysis and evaluation for somatic mutations or rearrangements that are commonly found in thyroid cancer (7-gene panel). Nodules with benign results on gene expression classifier analysis can be associated with less than a 5% risk of cancer and may be observed, while nodules with positive results on the 7-gene panel may have a higher risk of cancer (80%-100%) and definitive surgery can be recommended. However, cancer prevalence and geographic variations in histologic subtypes may affect accuracy and clinical applicability of both tests. Molecular marker tests such as ThyroSeq version 2.1 are more comprehensive, but they need further validation. Preoperative risk stratification using molecular markers also may be used to better define the optimal extent of thyroidectomy for patients with thyroid cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Molecular markers potentially can augment the diagnostic specificity of fine-needle aspiration biopsy to better differentiate cytologically indeterminate nodules that can be safely observed from cytologically indeterminate nodules that may be associated with differentiated thyroid cancer. Long-term follow-up data are still needed; in the end, patient preference regarding the relative risks and benefits of molecular testing is at the crux of decision making.

### A clinically applicable molecular classification of oncocytic cell thyroid nodules [^114FRXjn]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the increased use of imaging techniques for indications unrelated to the thyroid, thyroid nodules are detected in up to 65% of the general population. This includes FDG-positive thyroid incidentalomas, which are found in approximately 2% of FDG-PET/CT scans with an approximate 31% malignancy rate. The exact number of oncocytic cell lesions among these incidentalomas is unknown but may be substantial due to the pronounced FDG-positivity in these nodules. In our screened patient population, 11 of 48 (23%) presented with a PET/CT thyroid incidentaloma. Six of 11 (55%) patients did not undergo surgery, most frequently due to (oncological) comorbidities that were the indication for the FDG-PET/CT. In patients with considerable comorbidities, molecular testing including CNA–LOH analysis may aid the considerations and risks of withholding surgery.

The main limitation of our study is its retrospective design, potentially causing bias. Selection bias may have resulted in a nonrepresentative patient cohort if CNA–LOH analysis and/or thyroid surgery were only selectively performed. Moreover, some of the included patients were consultations from community hospitals, specifically referred to our hospital for CNA–LOH analysis. In addition, the relatively small sample size of our cohort limited further statistical analysis of the observed CNA patterns in relation to clinical and histopathological characteristics. The current study was not designed to assess the diagnostic performance of the GWLOH panel. Larger, prospective validation studies are desired to explicate the CNA-appurtenant risk stratification of OCN and assess (preoperative) diagnostic accuracy parameters of CNA–LOH analysis, including differences in test performance between cytological and histopathological tissue specimens. Such cohorts could also include a wider range of neoplastic or non-neoplastic thyroid and parathyroid disorders that present with oncocytic changes to confirm the absence of OCN-characteristic CNA in these diagnoses. Validation studies from our study group are currently in progress, including molecular diagnostics of the prospective EfFECTS trial cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02208544) and a separate prospective trial on preoperative risk stratification of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules using molecular diagnostics. Both include non-oncocytic and oncocytic nodules.

Indeterminate thyroid nodules — evaluation and ancillary testing should integrate clinical and imaging data rather than rely solely on cytology; interdisciplinary consultation is recommended. Immunocytochemical analyses may improve cytologic diagnostic accuracy but do not have a consistent predictive value for malignancy and should be restricted to specialized centers. Determination of somatic mutations has been proposed, and a panel of mutations may decrease the risk of overlooking malignancy to about 5% in mutation-negative patients. Gene expression classifiers (GECs) have been reported with high negative predictive value (NPV) in indeterminate nodules, but both the NPV and positive predictive value (PPV) of the Afirma GEC may vary significantly from what was previously reported.

High-risk indeterminate thyroid nodules (follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm [FN/SFN], Thy 3, or TIR 3B) — the expected risk of malignancy is about 15 to 30%. Repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is not generally recommended for follicular neoplasm, and FNA may be repeated only in cases with "atypical cells"; core needle biopsy (CNB) may be considered, but its use is not recommended. Surgical excision with histologic examination should be performed in most cases, though a multidisciplinary team may consider close clinical follow-up without immediate diagnostic surgery in patients with favorable clinical and US features or immunohistochemical markers. Molecular testing may be considered, if available, but molecular analyses do not provide a conclusive diagnosis; in a cohort of 31 indeterminate nodules, a gene expression classifier (GEC) showed a 56% PPV and 75% NPV, and mutation panels may provide a diagnosis of malignancy in 20 to 40% of FN cases. Patients with follicular thyroid lesions are preferentially treated with diagnostic thyroid lobectomy and isthmectomy; total thyroidectomy may be performed based on clinical setting and patient factors, and frozen sections are usually not useful. It should be considered that patients with indeterminate cytologic and histologic characteristics without surgery generally have an overall good prognosis.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

Serum calcitonin measurement — Recommendation 4: The panel cannot recommend either for or against routine measurement of serum calcitonin in patients with thyroid nodules (No recommendation, Insufficient evidence). Based on cost-effective analysis, the task force cannot recommend for or against the routine measurement of serum calcitonin as a screening test, although agreement was not uniform; however, serum calcitonin may be considered in the subgroup of patients in whom an elevated calcitonin may change the diagnostic or surgical approach. If the unstimulated serum calcitonin determination has been obtained and the level is greater than 50–100 pg/mL, a diagnosis of MTC is common, and calcitonin measurement from a thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration (FNA) washout may be helpful in patients with a modestly elevated basal serum calcitonin (20–100 pg/mL).
