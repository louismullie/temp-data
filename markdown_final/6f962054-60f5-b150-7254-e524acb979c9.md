## Question

For how long enoxaparin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long enoxaparin should be given across different indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and indication because duration is indication-specific. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled durations for prophylaxis versus treatment. Next, I will review special populations and scenarios that modify duration, such as renal impairment, obesity, and perioperative bridging. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, indication-based summary and double-check that each duration aligns with the cited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that drive duration: prophylaxis after surgery or during acute medical illness, treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, acute coronary syndromes including STEMI and unstable angina/NSTEMI, and perioperative bridging for interruption of vitamin K antagonists. I need to ensure I anchor each to the correct guideline or label so I don't overgeneralize.

> For prophylaxis after abdominal surgery, I should confirm the labeled duration. The FDA recommends 40 mg subcutaneously once daily, starting 2 hours preoperatively, and continuing for 7 to 10 days, which matches the clinical trial basis cited in the label, so I should keep that 7–10 day window intact [^acf36cb5] [^9af5e09f].

> For prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement, I need to check both the standard and extended durations. The usual course is 30 mg every 12 hours for 7 to 10 days, but for hip replacement, extending to 40 mg once daily for up to 3 weeks is an option supported by the label, so I should present both the standard 7–10 days and the extended 3-week regimen for hip arthroplasty [^acf36cb5] [^d81f98a4] [^a57e8b9a].

> For acutely ill medical patients with severely restricted mobility, I should confirm the typical duration. The FDA indicates 40 mg once daily for 6 to 11 days, which aligns with the EXCLAIM program's 10 ± 4 day standard course and the subsequent extended versus placebo comparison, so I will cite both the label and the trial framework to be precise [^acf36cb5] [^297715cb] [^f1d26213].

> Now, for treatment of acute DVT with or without PE, I need to ensure I capture the minimum and the practical endpoint. The labeled regimen is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily for a minimum of 5 days and until the INR is therapeutic (≥ 2.0) for at least 24 hours, with the average duration around 7 days in trials; I should also note that outpatient DVT without PE is commonly managed with 1 mg/kg twice daily, again for at least 5 days and until therapeutic oral anticoagulation is achieved [^acf36cb5] [^4feacbc8] [^d0ae745a] [^852e2be1].

> For unstable angina or non–Q-wave MI, I should double-check the duration. The FDA recommends enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours with aspirin for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical stabilization, with the usual duration 2 to 8 days, so I will keep that 2–8 day range and emphasize the "until stabilization" principle [^acf36cb5] [^905352e1] [^1947fdb2].

> For acute STEMI, I need to verify both the dosing and duration. The regimen includes a 30 mg IV bolus plus 1 mg/kg subcutaneously, then 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, typically continued for 8 days or until hospital discharge, with EXTRACT-TIMI 25 informing the 8-day target and contemporary guidelines endorsing enoxaparin as an alternative to UFH in fibrinolysis and PCI contexts, which supports the 8-day duration in practice [^acf36cb5] [^80e9d7f7] [^eb01c102].

> For perioperative bridging when interrupting vitamin K antagonists, I should confirm the time course. Therapeutic-dose enoxaparin is commonly used for about 8–10 days around the procedure, stopping roughly 24 hours pre-op and resuming post-op once hemostasis allows, with continuation until the INR is therapeutic again; ACCP guidance supports therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging for high-risk scenarios and emphasizes minimizing bleeding risk during this window [^4b651739] [^a9ee215a] [^5107ef79] [^1e724cd4].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations that modify duration or dosing. In severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), accumulation increases and dose adjustments are recommended; while labels provide adjustment tables, some trauma and critical care guidance advises avoiding enoxaparin altogether in ESRD or using UFH instead, so I need to flag that duration may be shortened or alternatives chosen when renal function is poor and anti-Xa monitoring becomes important if LMWH is still used [^acf36cb5] [^1a4bf8f5] [^01ab431e]. In obesity, standard prophylaxis may be underdosed; many centers use 40 mg twice daily for prophylaxis in morbid obesity, and for treatment, weight-based dosing with consideration of anti-Xa monitoring is reasonable, which can indirectly influence duration if under-anticoagulation is corrected and therapy is prolonged to standard endpoints [^45c6b37c] [^4b5b5d91] [^7590d888]. In pregnancy, prophylactic dosing is commonly 40 mg once daily, with therapeutic dosing 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and anti-Xa targets guiding adjustments, and postpartum prophylaxis may continue 6–8 weeks, which extends the "duration" concept beyond the nonpregnant paradigms [^0550cf1c] [^67fd4f53].

> But wait, what if someone asks about extended prophylaxis in medical patients after discharge. I should confirm that routine extension beyond hospitalization is not broadly indicated. The APEX program tested extended betrixaban after a standard enoxaparin course and showed mixed signals, and in ischemic stroke subgroups, extended enoxaparin reduced VTE but increased bleeding; similarly, apixaban extended prophylaxis did not outperform short-course enoxaparin and increased bleeding, so I should caution against routine extension unless a specific high-risk indication exists and bleeding risk is acceptable [^f1d26213] [^23bf282b] [^2313e968].

> Let me synthesize a concise, indication-based answer, and I will double-check each line against the sources as I go. Abdominal surgery prophylaxis: 7–10 days. Hip/knee replacement prophylaxis: 7–10 days, with hip replacement optionally extended to 3 weeks. Acutely ill medical patients: 6–11 days. Acute DVT/PE treatment: minimum 5 days and until INR is therapeutic for ≥ 24 hours, averaging about 7 days. Unstable angina/NSTEMI: 2–8 days, at least until stabilization. STEMI: 8 days or until discharge. Perioperative VKA bridging: about 8–10 days around the procedure until INR recovery. I should confirm that each of these aligns with the FDA label or pivotal trials, which they do [^acf36cb5] [^4feacbc8] [^80e9d7f7] [^4b651739].

Enoxaparin duration varies by indication: **5–8 days** for acute DVT/PE (minimum 5 days and until INR ≥ 2 for 24 hours) [^acf36cb5] [^4feacbc8], **7–10 days** for postoperative prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement or abdominal surgery [^acf36cb5] [^9af5e09f], and **6–11 days** for acutely ill medical patients [^acf36cb5] [^297715cb]. For STEMI, continue **until hospital discharge or 8 days** [^acf36cb5] [^80e9d7f7]; for unstable angina/NSTEMI, treat until clinical stabilization (usually 2–8 days) [^acf36cb5] [^905352e1]. In pregnancy, prophylaxis is often continued for 6–8 weeks postpartum [^0550cf1c] [^67fd4f53]. Duration may be extended for high-risk patients or shortened if bleeding risk rises; always individualize based on renal function, weight, and bleeding risk [^56502b1d] [^8ef16ee6].

## Indication-specific duration of enoxaparin therapy

| **Indication** | **Standard duration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute DVT/PE (treatment) | 5–8 days (minimum 5 days and until INR ≥ 2 for 24 hours) | - Average 7 days [^acf36cb5] [^4feacbc8] <br/> - Extend if INR not therapeutic [^acf36cb5] |
| Postoperative prophylaxis (hip/knee replacement, abdominal surgery) | 7–10 days | - Extend to 3 weeks for hip replacement if high risk [^acf36cb5] [^d81f98a4] <br/> - Shorten if bleeding risk increases [^56502b1d] |
| Acutely ill medical patients | 6–11 days | - Extend if immobility persists [^acf36cb5] [^297715cb] <br/> - Shorten if bleeding risk increases [^56502b1d] |
| STEMI | Until hospital discharge or 8 days | - Continue if clinically indicated [^acf36cb5] [^80e9d7f7] <br/> - Stop if bleeding occurs [^36890424] |
| Unstable angina/NSTEMI | Until clinical stabilization (usually 2–8 days) | - Extend if instability persists [^acf36cb5] [^905352e1] <br/> - Stop if bleeding occurs [^36890424] |
| Pregnancy (prophylaxis) | 6–8 weeks postpartum | - Adjust dose for weight/renal function [^0550cf1c] [^67fd4f53] <br/> - Monitor anti-Xa if therapeutic dosing [^0550cf1c] |

## Factors influencing duration of enoxaparin therapy

Several factors influence **duration**:

- **Renal function**: Adjust dose and consider anti-Xa monitoring if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^acf36cb5] [^8eb67647].
- **Body weight**: Consider higher prophylactic doses in obesity (e.g. 40 mg BID) [^45c6b37c] [^4b5b5d91].
- **Bleeding risk**: Shorten or stop therapy if bleeding risk increases [^56502b1d] [^8ef16ee6].
- **Clinical stability**: Extend therapy if instability persists (e.g. ongoing ischemia, immobility) [^acf36cb5] [^905352e1].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration recommendations

- **DVT/PE**: Enoxaparin is noninferior to UFH for initial treatment; average duration is 7 days [^c0ded2d9] [^4feacbc8].
- **Postoperative prophylaxis**: 7–10 days reduces VTE; extending to 3 weeks after hip replacement further reduces risk [^acf36cb5] [^d81f98a4].
- **Acutely ill medical patients**: 6–11 days reduces VTE; extended prophylaxis may reduce events but increase bleeding [^acf36cb5] [^f1d26213] [^23bf282b].
- **STEMI**: 8 days or until discharge reduces ischemic events versus UFH [^acf36cb5] [^80e9d7f7] [^eb01c102].
- **Unstable angina/NSTEMI**: 2–8 days reduces ischemic events [^acf36cb5] [^905352e1].

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged enoxaparin therapy

Prolonged therapy can **reduce thrombotic events** but **increase bleeding**; balance risks and benefits individually [^56502b1d] [^8ef16ee6].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment during therapy

- **Platelet counts**: Monitor for HIT [^acf36cb5] [^4bbe5e3d].
- **Anti-Xa levels**: Consider in renal impairment, obesity, or pregnancy [^5f9e5811] [^0550cf1c].
- **Bleeding signs**: Assess regularly and adjust therapy as needed [^acf36cb5] [^8eb67647].

---

Enoxaparin duration is **indication-specific**, typically 5–10 days, with extensions for high-risk patients and adjustments for renal function, weight, and bleeding risk. Individualize therapy and monitor closely to optimize outcomes.

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] .

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] .

A dose of enoxaparin sodium of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (±3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] .

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium). Continue enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] .

Key messages

• doses of 40 mg QD and 30 mg BID enoxaparin yield sub-therapeutic levels of anti-Xa in critically ill patients.

• a dose of 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin is more likely to achieve a target anti-Xa range of 0.1 to 0.4 U/ml.

• thromboprophylactic studies with clinical endpoints should be vigorously pursued.

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)] .

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer enoxaparin sodium between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of enoxaparin sodium therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

2.3	Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^891f6e94]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

• The present study seems to suggest inadequate dosage as one of the possible mechanisms for the high failure rate of enoxaparin in ICU patients.

• 60 mg, or 1.5 times the standard dose, resulted in the best peak aFXa levels.

• Further trials using 60 mg daily, with clinical end points, are needed.

5.1	Increased Risk of Hemorrhage

Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Interactions (7)] .

To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of enoxaparin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of enoxaparin is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.

Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of enoxaparin sodium. Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided. Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second enoxaparin dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal. Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent enoxaparin sodium dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of enoxaparin is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of enoxaparin sodium (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

### Therapeutic enoxaparin dosing in obesity [^7590d888]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

This review provides a picture of heterogeneous therapeutic enoxaparin dosing strategies and attainment of AFXa target ranges. As a result, it is unable to provide specific recommendations regarding dosing, efficacy or safety in the obese population, and can only provide cautious guidance. Owing to the weak level of evidence, it may be appropriate to reduce the therapeutic dosage of enoxaparin in morbidly obese patients (BMI >40 kg/m 2), and it may be appropriate to monitor AFXa levels to guide dose adjustment in obese and morbidly obese patients (BMI >30 kg/m 2). An individual participant data review or a large prospective study could provide additional information to define an appropriate enoxaparin dosing regimen in this population.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^4b651739]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging—management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of once-daily dose of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal lower limb deep-vein thrombosis [^0e25ecf6]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin, rather than a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is more convenient and allows for home care in some patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens for the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT.

Methods

201 patients with proximal lower limb DVT from 13 centers in Brazil were randomized in an open manner to receive either enoxaparin [1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) OD] or intravenous (i.v.) UFH (adjusted to aPTT 1.5-2.5 times control) for 5-10 days. All patients also received warfarin (INR 2-3) for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent DVT (confirmed by venography or ultrasonography), and safety endpoints included bleeding and serious adverse events. The rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) was also collected. Hospitalization was at the physician's discretion.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between groups. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH (3 versus 7 days). In addition, 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, whereas all of the patients receiving UFH were hospitalized. The treatment duration was slightly longer with enoxaparin (8 versus 7 days). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of recurrent DVT with enoxaparin versus UFH, and similar safety.

Conclusions

A once-daily regimen of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous is at least as effective and safe as conventional treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Peri‑procedural interruption/bridging—when procedures require interruption of OAC for longer than 48 h in high-risk patients, enoxaparin may be administered subcutaneously although the efficacy of this strategy is uncertain; bridging is often considered in patients with mechanical heart valves or recent stroke/venous thromboembolism (<3 months); pharmacodynamic data suggest that enoxaparin might be a better option than unfractionated heparin; such ‘bridging’ therapies may be associated with an excess bleeding risk; and when NOACs are used, timing of any bridging therapy should be tailored based on renal function and the pharmacokinetics of the specific NOAC.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: executive summary. A statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine [^c1bb9642]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage—low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) general management and enoxaparin dosing emphasize discontinuation, reversal for therapeutic dosing, slow IV protamine administration, and time-based dosing. We recommend discontinuing LMWH when intracranial hemorrhage is present or suspected (Good Practice statement) and we recommend reversing LMWH in patients with intracranial hemorrhage receiving therapeutic doses of LMWH (Strong recommendation, moderate evidence). We recommend protamine administration by slow IV injection over a period of about 10 minutes according to the following dosing. For enoxaparin: If enoxaparin was given within 8 hours, protamine sulfate should be administered at a dose of 1 mg per 1 mg of enoxaparin administered (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg). If enoxaparin was given within 8–12 hours, a dose of 0.5 mg of protamine per 1 mg of enoxaparin should be administered. After 3–5 half-lives have elapsed, protamine is probably not needed (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

### 2022 international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer, including patients with COVID-19 [^fdcab4c4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer-associated thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, initiation/treatment phase, ITAC 2022 guidelines recommend to administer LMWH for the initial treatment of established VTE in patients with cancer and a CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min.
Administer LMWH once daily unless a twice-per-day regimen is required because of the patient's characteristics, such as the risk of bleeding or moderate renal failure, or the need for technical intervention, such as surgery or changing regimen. Use only enoxaparin 1 mg/kg when a twice-per-day regimen is required.

### Enoxaparin followed by once-weekly idrabiotaparinux versus enoxaparin plus warfarin for patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism: a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial [^ee9796f0]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of pulmonary embolism with low-molecular-weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, is not ideal. We aimed to assess non-inferiority of idrabiotaparinux, a reversible longlasting indirect inhibitor of activated factor X, to warfarin in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

Methods

In our randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults with objectively documented acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism attending 291 centres in 37 countries. We excluded patients who were pregnant, had active bleeding, kidney failure, or malignant hypertension, or were at high risk of death, bleeding, or adverse reactions to study drugs. We randomly allocated patients to receive 5-10 days' enoxaparin 1·0 mg/kg twice daily followed by subcutaneous idrabiotaparinux (starting dose 3·0 mg) or adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0-3·0); regimens lasted 3 months or 6 months dependent on clinical presentation. Block randomisation was done with a central interactive computerised system, stratified by study centre and intended treatment duration. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism at 99 days after randomisation. We estimated the odds ratio and 95% CI with a Mantel-Haenzsel χ(2) analysis (non-inferiority margin 2·0) in the intention-to-treat population. The main safety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding (major or non-major) in all patients at day 99. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00345618.

Findings

Between Aug 1, 2006, and Jan 31, 2010, we enrolled 3202 patients aged 18-96 years. 34 (2%) of 1599 patients randomly allocated to receive enoxaparin-idrabiotaparinux and 43 (3%) of 1603 patients randomly allocated to receive enoxaparin-warfarin had recurrent venous thromboembolism (odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·50-1·25; p(non-inferiority)=0·0001). 72 (5%) of 1599 patients in the enoxaparin-idrabiotaparinux group and 106 (7%) of 1603 patients in the enoxaparin-warfarin group had clinically relevant bleeding (0·67, 0·49-0·91; p(superiority)=0·0098). We noted similar differences in outcomes in those patients treated to 6 months.

Interpretation

Idrabiotaparinux could provide an attractive alternative to warfarin for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism, and seems to be associated with reduced bleeding.

### Use of enoxaparin in end-stage renal disease [^01ab431e]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Enoxaparin has become the treatment of choice for various thromboembolic diseases. In most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prophylactic dosage of enoxaparin does not appear to be associated with an increased bleeding risk and can be used without the need for monitoring and adjustment of regimens. Empirical dose adjustment and biological monitoring seem to be necessary along with therapeutic doses. Anti-factor Xa poorly predicts the degree of anticoagulation in ESRD patients given enoxaparin.

Enoxaparin-to-UFH switching during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—safety considerations note increased complications when patients given subcutaneous enoxaparin are switched to UFH, attributed in part to stacking at the time of PCI even when heparin is administered as long as 10 hours after the last enoxaparin dose, and it is preferable to avoid UFH if enoxaparin was given in the previous 12 hours to reduce bleeding risk.

### Enoxaparin dosing at extremes of weight: literature review and dosing recommendations [^45c6b37c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on both thromboprophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with enoxaparin in low- and high-body-weight patients and to make dosing and monitoring recommendations in these patient populations.

Data Sources

A search using PubMed was conducted (1995 to January 2018) using the following key words: enoxaparin, body weight, AND thromboprophylaxis, or AND treatment. Additional references were identified from a review of citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies included examined the effect of body weight and/or body mass index (BMI) on VTE, bleeding, enoxaparin dosing, and/or anti-Xa concentrations for thromboprophylaxis and treatment-dose enoxaparin. Studies in pediatric and pregnant patients were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Optimal enoxaparin dosing strategies for VTE prophylaxis and treatment for patients at extremes of weight have not yet been elucidated by clinical trials; however, data suggest that standard dosing regimens may not be appropriate in these patients. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a thorough discussion on both thromboprophylaxis and treatment of VTE with enoxaparin in low- and high-body-weight patients. It includes dosing recommendations to guide clinicians caring for these patient populations.

Conclusions

Patients at extremes of weight require special consideration to determine appropriate enoxaparin doses. Specifically, low-body-weight patients may benefit from 30 mg subcutaneously daily for VTE prophylaxis, and standard weight-based dosing for VTE treatment. Conversely, in patients with BMIs ≥40 kg/m 2 , 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily is recommended, with consideration for higher doses in patients with BMIs ≥50 kg/m 2 .

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients [^23bf282b]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of prolonging prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients beyond hospital discharge remain uncertain. We hypothesized that extended prophylaxis with apixaban would be safe and more effective than short-term prophylaxis with enoxaparin.

Methods

In this double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned acutely ill patients who had congestive heart failure or respiratory failure or other medical disorders and at least one additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism and who were hospitalized with an expected stay of at least 3 days to receive apixaban, administered orally at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for 30 days, or enoxaparin, administered subcutaneously at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 6 to 14 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the 30-day composite of death related to venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, or asymptomatic proximal-leg deep-vein thrombosis, as detected with the use of systematic bilateral compression ultrasonography on day 30. The primary safety outcome was bleeding. All efficacy and safety outcomes were independently adjudicated.

Results

A total of 6528 subjects underwent randomization, 4495 of whom could be evaluated for the primary efficacy outcome--2211 in the apixaban group and 2284 in the enoxaparin group. Among the patients who could be evaluated, 2.71% in the apixaban group (60 patients) and 3.06% in the enoxaparin group (70 patients) met the criteria for the primary efficacy outcome (relative risk with apixaban, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 1.23; P=0.44). By day 30, major bleeding had occurred in 0.47% of the patients in the apixaban group (15 of 3184 patients) and in 0.19% of the patients in the enoxaparin group (6 of 3217 patients) (relative risk, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.02 to 7.24; P=0.04).

Conclusions

In medically ill patients, an extended course of thromboprophylaxis with apixaban was not superior to a shorter course with enoxaparin. Apixaban was associated with significantly more major bleeding events than was enoxaparin. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00457002.).

### Rapid enoxaparin adjustment for childhood thrombosis / thromboprophylaxis [^d3cb9f37]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Enoxaparin dosing in children is imperfect and strategies to optimize initial therapy for patients at high-thrombotic risk would be of clinical benefit. This study looked at using peak-post-first-enoxaparin-dose anti-Xa to guide subsequent enoxaparin dose and timing of administration in children deemed high-thrombotic risk. Fourteen patients (seven aged <3 months, seven children/adolescents) were identified and reviewed retrospectively. All patients were commenced on a therapeutic enoxaparin dose within ≤20 h with average time to therapeutic anti-Xa of 15.4 h (range 4-34 h) for neonates/infants and 10.8 h (range 4-24 h) for children/adolescents. No patient had supratherapeutic anti-Xa or thrombotic/bleeding events. Further studies are needed to validate this approach.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^003f316d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) [^77663de3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of enoxaparin sodium IV (also known as Lovenox): 
- Decreased platelet count: maintain a high level of suspicion, as thrombocytopenia can occur with the use of enoxaparin.
- Gasping syndrome: use caution in infants, as enoxaparin sodium vials contain benzyl alcohol preservative.
- Hemorrhage: use caution in patients undergoing PCI. If manual compression is used at the puncture site after PCI, remove the sheath 6 hours after the last enoxaparin dose. Administer the next scheduled dose no sooner than 6-8 hours after sheath removal.
- Hemorrhage: use caution in patients with bleeding disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction, or hemorrhage.
- Hemorrhage: use extreme caution in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, including bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative or angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, recent brain, spinal, or ophthalmologic surgery, or concomitant use of platelet inhibitors.
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as enoxaparin may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis.
- Prosthetic valve thrombosis: use caution for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, as the risk of thromboembolism is higher in this population. Obtain frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-factor Xa levels and adjust the dosage.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3266a872]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized heart failure—Class 1, Level B-R recommendation with dosing options and risk duration. In patients hospitalized with HF, prophylaxis for VTE is recommended to prevent venous thromboembolic disease. Trials and observational data note that this risk may extend for up to 2 years after hospitalization but is greatest in the first 30 days. For patients admitted specifically for decompensated HF and with adequate renal function (creatinine clearance, >30 mL/min), randomized trials suggest that enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily, unfractionated heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 8 or 12 hours, or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily will radiographically reduce demonstrable venous thrombosis; effects on mortality or clinically significant pulmonary embolism are unclear. For obese patients, a higher dose of enoxaparin 60 mg once daily achieved target range of thromboprophylaxis without increased bleeding.

### Individualized compared with conventional dosing of enoxaparin [^877ad8e2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare an individualized dosing regimen for enoxaparin to conventional dosing. Patients in the individualized arm were initially dosed according to weight: patients <100 kg using total body weight; patients >/=100 kg using lean body weight. Doses were adjusted at 48 h according to renal function. Patients in the conventional arm received enoxaparin according to current practice. Dose-individualized patients had fewer bleeding events (primary end point; relative risk (RR)=0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.01-0.89, P=0.03) and composite bleeding and bruising events (secondary end point; RR=0.30, 95% CI=0.12-0.71, P=0.003) than those who received conventional dosing. In both arms of the study, there were no recurrent thromboembolic events during treatment and no deaths had occurred at 30 days. Dose individualization of enoxaparin significantly reduces the prevalence of bleeding and bruising events, without apparent loss in effectiveness.

### Excessive anticoagulation in patients with mild renal insufficiency receiving long-term therapeutic enoxaparin [^05cf32fb]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, are increasingly being used for treatment of venous thromboembolism. We describe two patients who received therapeutic enoxaparin for several months. Although their serum creatinine values were normal, both had mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 60-70 ml/min), and both accumulated the drug abnormally and experienced clinical bleeding. These results suggest that patients receiving enoxaparin (or other low-molecular-weight heparins) in therapeutic doses for periods of more than 4 weeks should be considered for laboratory monitoring to avoid bleeding.

### Enoxaparin for primary thromboprophylaxis in symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 (OVID): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^1abb703c]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a viral prothrombotic respiratory infection. Heparins exert antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects, and might have antiviral properties. We aimed to investigate whether thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin would prevent untoward hospitalisation and death in symptomatic, but clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19.

Methods

OVID was a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial and was done at eight centres in Switzerland and Germany. Outpatients aged 50 years or older with acute COVID-19 were eligible if they presented with respiratory symptoms or body temperature higher than 37·5°C. Eligible participants underwent block-stratified randomisation (by age group 50-70 vs >70 years and by study centre) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily for 14 days versus standard of care (no thromboprophylaxis). The primary outcome was a composite of any untoward hospitalisation and all-cause death within 30 days of randomisation. Analysis of the efficacy outcomes was done in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04400799) and has been completed.

Findings

At the predefined formal interim analysis for efficacy (50% of total study population), the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended early termination of the trial on the basis of predefined statistical criteria having considered the very low probability of showing superiority of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin for the primary outcome under the initial study design assumptions. Between Aug 15, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, from 3319 participants prescreened, 472 were included in the intention-to-treat population and randomly assigned to receive enoxaparin (n=234) or standard of care (n=238). The median age was 57 years (IQR 53-62) and 217 (46%) were women. The 30-day risk of the primary outcome was similar in participants allocated to receive enoxaparin and in controls (8 [3%] of 234 vs 8 [3%] of 238; adjusted relative risk 0·98; 95% CI 0·37-2·56; p=0·96). All hospitalisations were related to COVID-19. No deaths were reported during the study. No major bleeding events were recorded. Eight serious adverse events were recorded in the enoxaparin group versus nine in the control group.

Interpretation

These findings suggest thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin does not reduce early hospitalisations and deaths among outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. Futility of the treatment under the initial study design assumptions could not be conclusively assessed owing to under-representation of older patients and consequent low event rates.

### Optimal dosing of prophylactic enoxaparin after surgical procedures: results of the double-blind, randomized, controlled FIxed or variable enoxaparin (FIVE) trial [^5b38be36]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The accepted "one-size-fits-all" dose strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin may not optimize the medication's risks and benefits after surgical procedures. The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration.

Methods

The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa <0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa >0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding.

Results

In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively).

Conclusion

Weight-based administration showed superior pharmacokinetics for avoidance of underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation in postoperative patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^9a1a5891]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)—perioperative management based on procedure bleed risk is outlined, including timing for resumption and optional post-procedure prophylaxis. DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures, and 48-72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures; in selected patients at high risk for VTE, low-dose anticoagulants such as enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin, 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48-72 hours post-procedure. This figure pertains to patients receiving a DOAC and provides guidance on whether to interrupt DOAC therapy perioperatively and how to interrupt based on surgical/procedural bleed risk in the pre- and postoperative period.

### Generic enoxaparin questions and answers (...) [^8da0282a]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1. What is enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is available as an injectable medicine that helps prevent blood clots in the legs and other parts of the body. If these blood clots are not prevented, they can travel to the lungs and cause serious complications and even death. After a patient has surgery, such as hip or knee replacement or in some cases abdominal surgery, enoxaparin is often used for several days to up to a month to prevent blood clots. This medicine is also used to prevent blood clots in patients confined to bed and also for patients experiencing chest pain and heart attacks. Enoxaparin belongs to a class of drugs known as “low molecular weight heparin”, which is different than heparin, another drug that helps to prevent blood clots.
2. What is the difference between LMWH and heparin. LMWH and heparin are both used to prevent blood from clotting inside the body, but are used in different situations.
- Heparin, sometimes called “standard heparin, ” is available as a liquid solution injected directly into the blood and only given to hospitalized patients, for instance, to prevent blood clots during surgery. Because patients vary widely in their response to heparin sodium, laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant activity is needed to adjust the dose of heparin and monitor its effect in the hospital. FDA has determined that none of these brand products can be used interchangeably with one another. This means that when a doctor writes a prescription for one of these brand products, a pharmacist should not substitute another brand product when filling the prescription without checking with the physician. FDA has approved two generic versions of Lovenox. FDA has determined that approved generic enoxaparin can be substituted for Lovenox.

FDA scientists established a scientific approach for demonstrating active ingredient sameness that takes into consideration the complexity of enoxaparin. This scientific approach is reflected in five criteria, which involve the physical and chemical characteristics of enoxaparin, the nature of the heparin material and the chemical process used to break up heparin chains into smaller pieces, the nature and arrangement of components that constitute enoxaparin, certain laboratory measurements of the product’s anticoagulant activity, and certain aspects of the drug’s effect in humans.

### Protamine sulfate for the reversal of enoxaparin associated hemorrhage beyond 12 H [^5b800e00]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend protamine sulfate for reversal of enoxaparin associated bleeds dependent on the time from last administration and dose of enoxaparin. We present a case of a hemodynamically unstable patient with an enoxaparin induced abdominal wall hematoma/hemorrhage and the previous enoxaparin administration 21.5 h prior to presentation with a therapeutic anti-Xa assay (0.8 IU/mL) upon assessment in the emergency department. Along with resuscitative efforts, an interdisciplinary team collaborated to administer protamine sulfate 50 mg intravenous once (0.5 mg per 1 mg of enoxaparin) to reverse the therapeutic anticoagulation. Our case demonstrates the importance of monitoring renal function and the potential for accumulation of enoxaparin in patients with renal dysfunction leading to prolonged therapeutic anti-Xa assays. With the availability of anti-Xa assays, future reversal recommendations of enoxaparin associated bleeds using protamine sulfate should include the initial anti-Xa assay as a guide for the dosing regimen.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism [^8ef16ee6]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

In principle, the answer to this question is obvious: "as long as the risk of continued therapy is outweighed by the benefit." In practice, determining an individual patient's risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) without warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is difficult. However, there are many factors (both intrinsic and environmental) that can alter the risk of VTE recurrence. This paper will discuss evidence and considerations (including the issue of bleeding risk) that may be relevant to decisions about duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with VTE.

### Comparison of fatal or irreversible events with extended-duration betrixaban versus standard dose enoxaparin in acutely ill medical patients: an APEX trial substudy [^2313e968]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Assessment of net clinical outcome, the combined impact of efficacy and safety data, is a commonly requested evaluation on the part of healthcare providers, payers, and regulators. The decision to administer an agent is a binary decision (either yes or no), and safety and efficacy in making such a decision must both be considered simultaneously. In many analyses, reversible bleeding events with no permanent sequelae are combined with intracranial hemorrhage and fatal bleeding, which cause irreversible harm. Some analyses rely on a time‐to‐first bleeding event methodology. In such analyses, if the first event is minor, it may obscure the clinical impact of a later event associated with fatal or irreversible harm. As a relevant precedent, the Food and Drug Administration approved prasugrel based on its reduction of fatal and irreversible events related to either ischemia end points for efficacy or bleeding for safety and published their method to focus on fatal and irreversible events. 3 Based on this important precedent, we adopted a similar approach. The present study assessed outcomes during a relatively short period of ≈ 2 months. If similar risk reductions were maintained over a longer duration of follow‐up, greater absolute risk reductions may have been observed.

This post hoc analysis of APEX demonstrates that extended‐duration betrixaban is associated with a significant reduction in fatal or irreversible events as compared with standard‐duration enoxaparin. The benefit begins to emerge during the period of parenteral therapy and increases through the period of active treatment at 35 to 42 days as well as the entire duration of follow‐up at 77 days. Based on the data from all randomized patients, one would need to treat 65 patients with betrixaban to prevent 1 fatal or irreversible event as compared with enoxaparin. In general, a number needed to treat <100 is considered compelling in clinical practice.

In a traditional net clinical outcomes analysis where efficacy events (including reversible and nonfatal efficacy events such as a positive compression ultrasound for asymptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism) are combined with major bleeding events (many of which are reversible and nonfatal), there is also a benefit in favor of betrixaban. 2 Because major bleeding was not increased with betrixaban, the net benefit associated with the drug is predominantly driven by its improved efficacy. However, a numeric but not significant excess of intracranial hemorrhages in the enoxaparin strategy helped drive the net clinical outcome in favor of betrixaban.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^28cb45f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in a multicenter, open-label, parallel group study, patients with acute proximal DVT were randomized to enoxaparin sodium or heparin. Patients who could not receive outpatient therapy were excluded from entering the study. Outpatient exclusion criteria included the following: inability to receive outpatient heparin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions or potential for non-compliance and inability to attend follow-up visits as an outpatient because of geographic inaccessibility. Eligible patients could be treated in the hospital, but ONLY enoxaparin sodium patients were permitted to go home on therapy (72%). A total of 501 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 96 years (mean age 57.8 years) with 60.5% men and 39.5% women. Patients were randomized to either enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously or heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion administered to achieve an aPTT of 60 to 85 seconds (in-patient treatment). All patients also received warfarin sodium as described in the previous study. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days. Enoxaparin sodium was equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 22).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^a9ee215a]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging—definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35-0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

The initial enoxaparin dose for trauma patients with a normal creatine clearance may also be based on weight. Options include 0.5 mg/kg twice daily,, 0.6 mg/kg twice daily,or 30 mg for 50 to 60 kg patients, 40 mg for 61 to 99 kg patients, and 50 mg for patients greater than 100 kg.Patients who are initiated on higher doses of enoxaparin based upon weight should be monitored by anti-Xa levels because of the fluctuations in creatinine clearance after trauma that might lead to changes in the enoxaparin dose.

Although enoxaparin is preferable to heparin for pharmacologic prophylaxis, some institutions continue to dose unfractionated heparin at 5,000 U three times daily based in part on a randomized trial that suggested that this regimen might be noninferior and cost-effective compared with 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily.This practice should be reconsidered as the trial was underpowered because of an assumed DVT rate of 44% for unfractionated heparin versus 31% for enoxaparin, and a 10% noninferiority margin for the power calculation. The actual difference in the VTE rate was 3.1%, which favored enoxaparin without reaching significance (unfractionated heparin, 8.2% vs. enoxaparin, 5.1%; p = 0.2). In addition, the study was not powered to detect a difference in the rate of PE or HIT, both of which impact the complication rate and health care costs. More recently, 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily was established as superior to 5000 U of unfractionated heparin three times daily at the prevention of VTE and PE.

Unstable Angina and Non-Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with enoxaparin sodium injection for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium injection is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin-specific or non-fibrin specific), administer enoxaparin sodium injection between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of enoxaparin sodium injection therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last enoxaparin sodium injection subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last enoxaparin sodium injection subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

2.3 Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily compared with intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [^c0ded2d9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins administered subcutaneously once or twice daily have been reported to be as safe and efficacious as intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolic disease.

Objective

To determine whether subcutaneous enoxaparin administered once or twice daily is as effective as continuously infused unfractionated heparin in acute symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

Design

Randomized, controlled, partially blinded equivalence trial.

Setting

74 hospitals in 16 countries.

Patients

900 patients with symptomatic lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, including 287 (32%) with confirmed pulmonary embolism.

Interventions

Initial therapy with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin at fixed dosages of 1.0 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily. Long-term oral anticoagulation was started in all patients within 72 hours of randomization.

Measurements

Clinical end points assessed during a 3-month follow-up period.

Results

Equivalent efficacy was seen in the heparin group and both enoxaparin groups. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism recurred in 12 of 290 patients receiving unfractionated heparin (4.1%), 13 of 298 patients receiving once-daily enoxaparin (4.4%), and 9 of 312 patients receiving twice-daily enoxaparin (2.9%). Compared with unfractionated heparin, the treatment difference was 0.2% (95% CI, -3.04% to 3.49%) for once-daily enoxaparin and -1.2% (CI, -4.2% to 1.7%) for twice-daily enoxaparin. Incidence of major hemorrhage did not differ among the three treatment groups. Major hemorrhage occurred in 6 of 290 patients (2.1%) in the unfractionated heparin group, 5 of 298 patients (1.7%) in the once-daily enoxaparin group, and 4 of 312 patients (1.3%) in the twice-daily enoxaparin group.

Conclusions

Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily is as effective and safe as dose-adjusted, continuously infused unfractionated heparin in the prevention of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^a1870e67]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Primary results

Unblinding occurred on 1 October 2012. For patients with 1 mg/kg QD the mean administered dose of enoxaparin was 75 mg. Repeated measures modelling revealed that anti-Xa levels differed in a linear fashion with the dose of enoxaparin administered, and the time at which the blood samples were drawn. On the first day of enoxaparin administration, doses of 40 mg QD and 40 mg BID yielded similar mean peak anti-Xa of 0.20 IU/ml and 0.17 IU/ml respectively, while a dose of 30 mg BID resulted in much lower levels of anti-Xa (0.08 IU/ml). Patients receiving 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin achieved near steady-state levels from day 1 of administration with mean peak anti-Xa levels of 0.34 IU/ml (Figure 2). Steady-state anti-Xa was achieved for all doses of enoxaparin at day 3. At steady state, mean peak anti-Xa levels of 0.13 IU/ml and 0.15 IU/ml were achieved with doses of 40 mg QD and 30 mg BID respectively. This increased significantly to 0.33 IU/ml and 0.40 IU/ml for doses of 40 mg BID and 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin respectively. The anti-Xa response profiles were thus significantly different over the 3 days between the four treatment allocation groups (P <0.0001). Patients maintained anti-Xa levels within a target range of 0.1 to 0.4 IU/ml for: 33.3% (40 mg QD), 41.7% (30 mg BID), 83% (1 mg/kg QD) and 91.7% (40 mg BID) of the study period (Figure 3). There were no adverse effects.

H

After deciding to start pharmacologic prophylaxis, the specific anticoagulant and initial dose should be determined for each patient. Enoxaparin is the recommended choice for most trauma patients with higher doses now considered the standard of care.

The preferred agent for pharmacologic prophylaxis is the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin because of its increased bioavailability, longer plasma-half life, and more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics compared with unfractionated heparin. Enoxaparin interacts less with platelets, which may reduce bleeding complications compared with unfractionated heparin; has a lower incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); and does not have the associated osteoporosis observed with heparin treatment.

When choosing the initial dose, 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily should be considered the standard for most trauma patients, as 30 mg twice daily frequently results in inadequate pharmacologic prophylaxis. – Therefore, patients 18 to 65 years with weight of more than 50 kg and a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mg/dL should be started on 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily, as this dose is safe and reduces the VTE rate. – Patients who are older than 65 years, weigh less than 50 kg, or who have a creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mg/dL should continue to receive initial dosing at 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily.

Dosing regimen for anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients—evidence is observational and methodologically limited: there were no studies comparing specific prophylaxis regimens; one retrospective ICU study reported reduced mortality with prophylactic heparin doses (most were on 40-60 mg enoxaparin per day), but for all comers there was no mortality difference related to heparin prophylaxis. In a single-center cohort of 2,773 patients, of whom 786 (28%) received therapeutic anticoagulation, in-hospital mortality was similar between anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated patients (22.5% vs 22.8%), while among mechanically ventilated patients mortality was lower with anticoagulation (29%, median survival of 21 days) than without (63%, median survival of 9 days). The risk of major bleeding was 3% vs 1.9% and the median duration of anticoagulation was 3 days; the guideline states this study should not inform patient management due to its limitations and notes that all identified studies are observational with select populations, making definitive interpretation difficult.

### Dosing of enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in obese patients [^4b5b5d91]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the appropriate dosing of enoxaparin as a venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized obese patients.

Data Sources

Literature articles were accessed through MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 33) searches using the terms enoxaparin, obesity, and thromboprophylaxis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles that involved human subjects and were published in the English language, evaluating the appropriate dose of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized, obese patients were included.

Data Synthesis

Appropriate enoxaparin dosing for thromboprophylaxis in adult patients is 40 mg subcutaneously daily or 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily. Although obesity is considered one of the risk factors for thromboembolism, morbidly obese patients were excluded from most clinical trials; therefore, the appropriate enoxaparin preventive dose is not clear in this population. In recent years, the appropriate dose of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in obese patients has been evaluated in 3 clinical studies. All studies enrolled patients with various risk factors for thromboembolism and evaluated different enoxaparin dosing regimens. End point analyses were all based on anti-Xa levels.

Conclusions

Due to a lack of well-designed prospective, randomized control studies, varying doses of enoxaparin are used for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized, obese patients. All doses studied were monitored using anti-Xa levels. Patient follow-up was of short duration in all studies and did not show long-term effectiveness of enoxaparin. Prospective, randomized controlled studies are warranted to show efficacy and safety of one dosage regimen over another.

Unfractionated Heparin for Renal Failure

Quantifying the risk and benefit of the type and initial dose of pharmacologic prophylaxis for each patient is a challenge best determined by the trauma team at bedside. As noted, 40 mg of enoxaparin twice daily is the recommended initial pharmacologic prophylaxis for most trauma patients. Detailing every indication where an alternative therapeutic or dose may be indicated is outside the scope of these guidelines; several are described below.

In the presence of end-stage renal disease or a creatinine clearance of <30 mg/dL, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin at 5000 U every 8 hours may be initiated.Because enoxaparin is excreted by the kidneys, its administration to patients with renal failure may lead to increased bleeding complications and should be avoided.Enoxaparin has not been Food and Drug Administration approved for use in dialysis patients. Providing lower enoxaparin doses in the setting of a creatinine clearance of <30 mg/dL while closely monitoring anti-Xa levels may be possible in the future, but additional research is necessary before this recommendation can be made. In most other settings, enoxaparin is preferable to unfractionated heparin, as enoxaparin leads to lower VTE rates without increased bleeding complications.

Brain and Spine Trauma

For TBI patients, enoxaparin is associated with less VTE and higher survival than unfractionated heparin with no difference in the progression of brain lesions, regardless if the dose was delivered in less than 24 hours after admission, between 24 to 48 hours, or after 48 hours.Similarly, those patients with spine trauma should preferentially receive early enoxaparin. Patients with brain and spine trauma should be initiated on 30 mg of enoxaparin twice daily and considered for dose adjustment by anti-Xa level.

### Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^8f2a4156]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about fibrinolytic, antiplatelet, and antithrombin treatment for acute ST-segment elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of < or = 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend that all undergo rapid evaluation for reperfusion (primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or fibrinolytic) therapy and have a reperfusion strategy implemented promptly after contact with the health-care system (Grade 1A). For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of < or = 12 h in duration and persistent STE, we recommend administration of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over no fibrinolytic therapy (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration < or = 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase or tenecteplase over streptokinase (both Grade 1A). We recommend aspirin over no aspirin therapy followed by indefinite therapy (Grade 1A); we also recommend clopidogrel in addition to aspirin for up to 28 days (Grade 1A). In addition to aspirin and other antiplatelet therapies, we recommend the use of antithrombin therapy (eg, unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, or fondaparinux) over no antithrombin therapy (Grade 1A), including for those patients receiving fibrinolysis (and regardless of which lytic agent is administered), primary PCI, or patients not receiving reperfusion therapy.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^51b2c1ab]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Geerts et al. determined the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients not receiving prophylaxis to be in the range of 10-80%. The critically ill patient is especially predisposed to thromboembolism, possessing many inherent risk factors: cardiac failure, trauma, sepsis, cancer, increasing age, and obesity [-]. The acquisition of others, for example: respiratory support with decreased mobility and invasive monitoring, further tips the scale in favor of thrombosis during the ICU stay. Thus, these patients should undergo routine assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The use of routine thromboprophylaxis will probably be justified in most.

Discerning DVT in critically ill patients is difficult. The history and physical examination are often of little use, and thus, these patients are vulnerable to a delay in diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are often used as a safe and effective means of prophylaxis [-] against VTE in medical and surgical patients. However, the efficacy of LMWHs in critically ill patients is less certain.

The antithrombotic activity of LMWHs is often determined by aFXa assay, despite several studies finding no direct correlation between aFXa activity and clinical outcome. Mayr concluded that the European standard daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin was ineffective in ICU patients to achieve the recommended, albeit unproven, aFXa levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml. Thus, existing guidelines in other patient populations should not be directly applied to critical care patients without further study.

Most intensive care physicians widely acknowledge the need for evidence-based guidelines for antithromboembolic prophylaxis in this patient population and lament the dearth of research on VTE in critical care patients. This study aims to establish the optimal dose of enoxaparin for ICU patients.

### Enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^021031b6]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Low-molecular-weight heparins have been compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, a comparison of their efficacy in the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism (PE) has not been studied. We estimated the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH in patients with proximal DVT with/without symptomatic PE using a meta-analysis of individual data from randomized controlled trials.

Design and Setting

Randomized controlled trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, abstracts from international meetings on venous thromboembolism (VTE), previous meta-analyses, and trial data provided by the sponsor.

Participants

For inclusion, randomized controlled trials had to be properly randomized; include patients with objectively diagnosed DVT; compare enoxaparin twice daily with UFH; use objective methods to assess recurrent symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and death at 3 months; and include blind evaluation of clinical events.

Measurements

A meta-analysis was performed using the logarithm of the relative risk (RR) method. Enoxaparin in DVT treatment with/without symptomatic PE was considered noninferior to UFH for preventing VTE at 3 months if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the RR (enoxaparin/UFH) was lower than a prespecified noninferiority margin (1.61). No increase in major bleeding or mortality should be observed.

Results

The meta-analysis included individual data from three randomized controlled trials (749 patients and 754 patients in the enoxaparin and UFH groups, respectively). The observed RR (enoxaparin/UFH) of VTE was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.26) for the intention-to-treat population (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.13; for per-protocol analysis). Results did not differ for patients with clinical PE (235 patients; RR, 0.84) and without clinical PE (1,268 patients; RR, 0.71), with a nonsignificant heterogeneity test between groups (p = 0.76). A trend in favor of enoxaparin was observed for reduced mortality and major bleeding.

Conclusions

The efficacy and safety of enoxaparin vs UFH for DVT treatment is not modified by the presence of symptomatic PE.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^1372970f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas LMWH, especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over UFH because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
4) Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of “enhanced” or “intermediate” prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence).
5) In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
6) If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with IPC devices or GCS for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).

How should clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19–related VTE be managed in LMICs?

Rationale.

Management of VTE requires timely diagnosis, knowledge of risk factors for both thrombosis and bleeding, safe administration of medications, and ability to monitor, when indicated. Clinical suspicion for PE should arise if a patient develops a sudden deterioration of oxygenation, respiratory distress, or hypotension disproportional to pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. According to COVID-19 clinical management guidelines from the WHO,NIH,and various societies,, patients with suspected or confirmed VTE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as would be indicated in those without COVID-19. The optimal approach to managing VTE related to COVID-19 in LMICs remains unknown.

### Enoxaparin for symptomatic COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting: an individual patient level analysis of the OVID and ETHIC trials [^fd21c3bd]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antithrombotic treatment may improve the disease course in non-critically ill, symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients.

Methods

We performed an individual patient-level analysis of the OVID and ETHIC randomized controlled trials, which compared enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis for either 14 (OVID) or 21 days (ETHIC) vs. no thromboprophylaxis for outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one additional risk factor. The primary efficacy outcome included all-cause hospitalization and all-cause death within 30 days from randomization. Both studies were prematurely stopped for futility. Secondary efficacy outcomes were major symptomatic venous thromboembolic events, arterial cardiovascular events, or their composite occurring within 30 days from randomization. The same outcomes were assessed over a 90-day follow-up. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (ISTH criteria).

Results

A total of 691 patients were randomized: 339 to receive enoxaparin and 352 to the control group. Over 30-day follow-up, the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6.0 % of patients in the enoxaparin group vs. 5.8 % of controls for a risk ratio (RR) of 1.05 (95%CI 0.57-1.92). The incidence of major symptomatic venous thromboembolic events and arterial cardiovascular events was 0.9 % vs. 1.8 %, respectively (RR 0.52; 95%CI 0.13-2.06). Most cardiovascular thromboembolic events were represented by symptomatic venous thromboembolic events, occurring in 0.6 % vs. 1.5 % of patients, respectively. A similar distribution of outcomes between the treatment groups was observed over 90 days. No major bleeding occurred in the enoxaparin group vs. one (0.3 %) in the control group.

Conclusions

We found no evidence for the clinical benefit of early administration of enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19. These results should be interpreted taking into consideration the relatively low occurrence of events.

### Enoxaparin is associated with lower rates of mortality than unfractionated heparin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^37323feb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Based upon the findings from these previous studies, we hypothesize that hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered Enoxaparin may have better clinical outcomes compared to patients administered unfractionated Heparin. The availability of clinical covariates and outcomes of patients administered these medications at Mayo Clinic sites and associated health systems enables us to evaluate this hypothesis. Here, we present a comparison of the patient outcomes in terms of mortality status, ICU admission and the durations of stay in ICU and hospital in severe COVID-19 patients that were administered unfractionated Heparin vs. Enoxaparin. We use propensity score matching to construct matched cohorts for comparison which are balanced across a range of clinical covariates, including: demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support. More details on the study design, propensity score matching, curation of clinical covariates, and statistical analyses are provided in the Methods section. We summarize the findings from the study and discuss the results in the Results and Discussion sections, respectively.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^8eb67647]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (Bolus) Injection Technique

Use the multiple-dose vial for intravenous injections. Administer enoxaparin sodium through an intravenous line. Do not mix or coadminister enoxaparin sodium with other medications. Flush the intravenous access device with a sufficient volume of saline or dextrose solution prior to and following the intravenous bolus administration of enoxaparin sodium to prevent mixing of drugs. Enoxaparin sodium is compatible with normal saline solution (0.9%) or 5% dextrose in water.

2.6	Monitoring for Safety

During therapy monitor complete blood counts including platelets and stool occult blood.

Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

If during enoxaparin sodium therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^7b0153af]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study illustrates the inadequacy of the current standard doses of enoxaparin 40 mg QD (Europe) or 30 mg BID (North America) to yield target therapeutic range anti-Xa in critically ill patients weighing 50 to 90 kg.

It also demonstrates a clear relationship between anti-Xa levels and the dose of enoxaparin, with higher doses yielding better peak anti-Xa levels. Higher doses also allowed the establishment of near steady-state levels from the first day of enoxaparin administration.

The dual risks of VTE and bleeding, coupled with an overwhelming tendency to exclude patients with AKI continues to complicate the establishment of a strategy for thromboprophylaxis in this patient population. A weight-based dose yielded the best anti-Xa levels without an accompanying risk of bioaccumulation, and may thus be more appropriate, convenient and effective. A new study using 1 mg/kg QD enoxaparin has recently been approved by the Danish Ministry of Health. It will be conducted in AKI patients upon commencing continuous veno-venous haemofiltration, and will have clinical endpoints such as the occurrence of VTE and bleeding, length of stay, number of ventilator-free days, and mortality.

### Fondaparinux or enoxaparin for the initial treatment of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^f9770d68]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard initial therapies for deep venous thrombosis are low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a dose-ranging study of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, fondaparinux had efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin).

Objective

To evaluate whether fondaparinux has efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin in patients with deep venous thrombosis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

154 centers worldwide.

Patients

2205 patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Intervention

Fondaparinux, 7.5 mg (5.0 mg in patients weighing <50 kg and 10.0 mg in patients weighing >100 kg) subcutaneously once daily, or enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously twice daily for at least 5 days and until vitamin K antagonists induced an international normalized ratio greater than 2.0.

Measurements

The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic complications. The main safety outcomes were major bleeding during initial treatment and death. An independent, blinded committee adjudicated all outcomes.

Results

43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin (absolute difference, -0.15 percentage point [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.5 percentage points]). Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively.

Limitations

Follow-up was incomplete in 0.4% of fondaparinux-treated patients and 1.0% of enoxaparin-treated patients.

Conclusions

Once-daily subcutaneous fondaparinux was at least as effective (not inferior) and safe as twice-daily, body weight-adjusted enoxaparin in the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

### The design and rationale for the acute medically ill venous thromboembolism prevention with extended duration betrixaban (APEX) study [^4e56a684]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials have identified a population of acute medically ill patients who remain at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) beyond the standard duration of therapy and hospital discharge. The aim of the APEX study is to determine whether extended administration of oral betrixaban (35-42 days) is superior to a standard short course of prophylaxis with subcutaneous enoxaparin (10 ± 4 days followed by placebo) in patients with known risk factors for post-discharge VTE. Patients initially are randomized to receive either betrixaban or enoxaparin (and matching placebo) in a double dummy design. Following a standard duration period of enoxaparin treatment (with placebo tablets) or betrixaban (with placebo injections), patients receive only betrixaban (or alternative matching placebo). Patients are considered for enrollment if they are older than 40 years, have a specified medical illness, and restricted mobility. They must also meet the APEX criteria for increased VTE risk (aged ≥75 years, baseline D-Dimer ≥2× upper the limit of "normal", or 2 additional ancillary risk factors for VTE). The primary efficacy end point is the composite of asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, non-fatal (pulmonary embolus) pulmonary embolism, or VTE-related death through day 35. The primary safety outcome is the occurrence of major bleeding. We hypothesize that extended duration betrixaban VTE prophylaxis will be safe and more effective than standard short duration enoxaparin in preventing VTE in acute medically ill patients with known risk factors for post hospital discharge VTE.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 197: inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy [^0550cf1c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin—Anticoagulation regimen definitions in pregnancy outline dosing for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH): prophylactic LMWH options include enoxaparin, 40 mg SC once daily; dalteparin, 5,000 units SC once daily; tinzaparin, 4,500 units SC once daily; and nadroparin 2,850 units SC once daily. Intermediate-dose LMWH is enoxaparin 40 mg SC every 12 hours or dalteparin 5,000 units SC every 12 hours. Adjusted-dose (therapeutic) LMWH regimens include enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg every 12 hours; dalteparin, 200 units/kg once daily; tinzaparin, 175 units/kg once daily; and dalteparin, 100 units/kg every 12 hours, with a target anti-Xa level in the therapeutic range of 0.6–1.0 units/ mL 4 hours after last injection for twice-daily regimens, and slightly higher doses may be needed for a once-daily regimen. Prophylactic UFH is UFH, 5,000–7,500 units SC every 12 hours in first trimester; UFH, 7,500–10,000 units SC every 12 hours in the second trimester; and UFH, 10,000 units SC every 12 hours in the third trimester, unless the aPTT is elevated. Adjusted-dose (therapeutic) UFH is UFH, 10,000 units or more SC every 12 hours in doses adjusted to target aPTT in the therapeutic range (1.5–2.5 × control) 6 hours after injection. Postpartum anticoagulation may include prophylactic, intermediate, or adjusted dose LMWH for 6–8 weeks, and oral anticoagulants may be considered postpartum based upon planned duration of therapy, lactation, and patient preference; surveillance consists of clinical vigilance with objective investigation of symptoms and VTE risk assessment prepregnancy or early in pregnancy, repeated if complications develop, particularly those necessitating hospitalization/prolonged immobility. Footnotes specify that at extremes of body weight, modification of dose may be required and that adjusted-dose regimens are also referred to as weight-adjusted, full treatment dose.

### Randomized double-blind safety study of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes treated with tirofiban and aspirin: the ACUTE II study. the antithrombotic combination using tirofiban and enoxaparin [^82943be2]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In comparison with treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and aspirin (ASA), both tirofiban administered with UFH and ASA, and enoxaparin plus ASA have shown superiority in reducing cardiac ischemic events in patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Replacing UFH with enoxaparin when tirofiban is administered to patients may offer further therapeutic benefit, but could also increase bleeding.

Objective

Our objective was to provide estimates of the frequency of bleeding complications, as defined by means of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction(TIMI) group, and collect data on clinical efficacy of the combination of tirofiban with enoxaparin plus ASA.

Methods

Five hundred twenty-five patients with UA/NSTEMI were treated with tirofiban coadministered with ASA and randomized to receive either UFH (n = 210) or enoxaparin (n = 315). Therapy was administered for 24 to 96 hours. Bleeding incidences were assessed until 24 hours after trial therapy was discontinued; other clinical outcomes were assessed for as long as 30 days.

Results

The total bleeding rate (TIMI major + minor + loss-no-site) for the UFH group versus the enoxaparin group was 4.8% vs 3.5% (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, CI 0.6-3.4). The TIMI major and minor bleeding rates for the UFH versus the enoxaparin groups were 1.0% versus 0.3% (OR 3.0, CI 0.3-33.8) and 4.3% versus 2.5% (OR 1.7, CI 0.7-4.6). There was an increase in nuisance cutaneous and oral bleeds (<50 mL of blood loss) in the enoxaparin group. Death or myocardial infarction occurred with similar frequency in the 2 groups (9.0% vs 9.2%). However, refractory ischemia requiring urgent revascularization and rehospitalization because of unstable angina occurred more frequently in the UFH group (4.3% vs 0.6% and 7.1% vs 1.6%, respectively).

Conclusions

Combination therapy with tirofiban plus enoxaparin appears safe, relative to therapy with tirofiban plus UFH.

### Adding intravenous unfractionated heparin to standard enoxaparin causes excessive anticoagulation not detected by activated clotting time: results of the STACK-on to ENOXaparin (STACKENOX) study [^0fed30ab]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The STACKENOX study assessed the cumulative anticoagulation effect of administering stack-on intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) to subjects already receiving enoxaparin.

Methods

Seventy-two healthy subjects aged 40 to 60 years received subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 2.5 days (steady state) and were randomized to receive a 70 IU/kg intravenous UFH bolus 4, 6, or 10 hours after the final enoxaparin dose. Anticoagulation levels were assessed in subjects receiving enoxaparin alone and after the UFH bolus by monitoring activated clotting time (ACT), anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, and thrombin generation (endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]).

Results

After the final enoxaparin dose, ETP levels decreased by 40%; anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities increased, as expected; and ACT levels did not indicate any anticoagulation effect. Stack-on UFH at 4, 6, or 10 hours after the last enoxaparin dose significantly increased anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities (P < .0001) to well above accepted therapeutic levels and resulted in total inhibition of thrombin generation for > or =2 hours; ACT levels remained within the range commonly observed in subjects receiving UFH.

Conclusions

The administration of stack-on UFH to subjects already receiving recommended enoxaparin dosing may result in over-anticoagulation, and should be avoided. Activated clotting time assessment did not detect the over-anticoagulation resulting from co-administration of enoxaparin and UFH.

14.4 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium injection 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium injection 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium injection regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Use of enoxaparin for anticoagulation therapy (...) [^64a414e6]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Patients maintained on warfarin may occasionally need to stop anticoagulant therapy during invasive procedures. Generally, this is accomplished by initiating therapy with unfractionated heparin once the International Normalized Ratio becomes subtherapeutic. Both forms of heparin require monitoring and adjustments to reach a therapeutic level. Spandorfer and associates enrolled adults in the study who were receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy for mechanical heart valves, atrial fibrillation and risk factors for stroke, deep venous thrombosis within the past month or known hypercoagulable state with a history of life-threatening thrombosis. Patients were required to have undergone major surgery or an invasive procedure that was considered to be of moderate or high bleeding risk and therefore had to discontinue warfarin therapy.

Patients or caretakers received instruction about subcutaneous injections, and enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, was started at a dosage of 1 mg per kg every 12 hours approximately 36 hours after warfarin therapy was discontinued. Enoxaparin was withheld 12 to 18 hours before the procedure and restarted at the same dosage level and frequency after the procedure, once hemostasis was achieved. The patient's usual dosage of warfarin was restarted after the procedure, and enoxaparin was discontinued once the INR reached therapeutic levels. Patients received anticoagulation therapy on an outpatient basis unless hospitalization was required. Of the 20 participating patients, none developed bleeding or thrombotic complications during the procedure. Three patients developed postprocedure soft tissue bleeding complications. Fourteen patients reported little or no difficulty injecting themselves with enoxaparin twice daily.

Sixteen patients stated a preference for home anticoagulation regulation rather than hospitalization for intravenous heparin therapy. The authors conclude that enoxaparin, like other low-molecular-weight heparins, can be given subcutaneously and has a predictable anticoagulation effect that obviates the need for monitoring. The dosage of enoxaparin used in this study was high and may be most beneficial in patients undergoing a procedure that has relatively lower risk of bleeding. A lower dosage of enoxaparin may be appropriate in patients having more risky surgery. Further studies are needed to compare different regimens of enoxaparin in different settings and to evaluate the benefit of reduced hospitalization.

### Enoxaparin for outpatients with COVID-19: 90-day results from the randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multinational, phase III OVID trial [^b11e4695]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The benefits of early thromboprophylaxis in symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients remain unclear. We present the 90-day results from the randomised, open-label, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, multinational OVID phase III trial.

Methods

Outpatients aged 50 years or older with acute symptomatic COVID-19 were randomised to receive enoxaparin 40 mg for 14 days once daily vs. standard of care (no thromboprophylaxis). The primary outcome was the composite of untoward hospitalisation and all-cause death within 30 days from randomisation. Secondary outcomes included arterial and venous major cardiovascular events, as well as the primary outcome within 90 days from randomisation. The study was prematurely terminated based on statistical criteria after the predefined interim analysis of 30-day data, which has been previously published. In the present analysis, we present the final, 90-day data from OVID and we additionally investigate the impact of thromboprophylaxis on the resolution of symptoms.

Results

Of the 472 patients included in the intention-to-treat population, 234 were randomised to receive enoxaparin and 238 no thromboprophylaxis. The median age was 57 (Q1-Q3: 53-62) years and 217 (46 %) were women. The 90-day primary outcome occurred in 11 (4.7 %) patients of the enoxaparin arm and in 11 (4.6 %) controls (adjusted relative risk 1.00; 95 % CI: 0.44-2.25): 3 events per group occurred after day 30. The 90-day incidence of cardiovascular events was 0.9 % in the enoxaparin arm vs. 1.7 % in controls (relative risk 0.51; 95 % CI: 0.09-2.75). Individual symptoms improved progressively within 90 days with no difference between groups. At 90 days, 42 (17.9 %) patients in the enoxaparin arm and 40 (16.8 %) controls had persistent respiratory symptoms.

Conclusions

In adult community patients with COVID-19, early thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin did not improve the course of COVID-19 neither in terms of hospitalisation and death nor considering COVID-19-related symptoms.

Rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban was the first oral factor Xa inhibitor available for the management of VTEand the only DOAC to be evaluated in separate DVT (EINSTEIN-DVT) and PE (EINSTEIN-PE) trials. In the EINSTEIN-DVT trial, 3449 patients presenting with DVT without PE were randomized in an open-label fashion to rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily for 21 days followed by 20 mg once daily or conventional therapy with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours and a VKA (INR = 2.0-3.0). The treatment duration could have been 3, 6, or 12 months and was left to the discretion of the investigator but was defined at the time of enrollment; 3 months (12% of patients in both treatment groups), 6 months (63%), and 12 months (25%). The study design and outcomes of the EINSTEIN-PE trial were identical; however, the 4833 patients had to present with symptomatic PE with or without DVT. The intended durations of study treatment in both arms were 3 months (5%), 6 months (57%), and 12 months (37%). Patients randomized to conventional therapy received enoxaparin for a median of 8 days in both trials.

In the EINSTEIN-DVT trial, the occurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed recurrent VTE (primary efficacy end point) was found to be noninferior between rivaroxaban and conventional therapy (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.44-1.04; P < 0.001).Patients receiving rivaroxaban demonstrated a numerical decrease in major bleeding and a numerical increase in CRNM bleeding, providing an 8.1% rate of major and CRNM bleeding (primary safety outcome) for both groups (Table 3). The combination of the primary efficacy end point and major bleeding, defined as net clinical benefit, was significantly improved with rivaroxaban compared with conventional therapy (2.9% vs 4.2%; P = 0.03).

### Venous thromboembolism risk in ischemic stroke patients receiving extended-duration enoxaparin prophylaxis: results from the EXCLAIM study [^f1d26213]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The optimal duration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acute stroke patients is unknown. This subanalysis of the Extended Prophylaxis for Venous ThromboEmbolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients With Prolonged Immobilization (EXCLAIM) study investigated extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin, compared with placebo following standard-duration enoxaparin, in ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

Acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced mobility received open-label enoxaparin 40 mg for 10±4 days, and they were then randomized to double-blind enoxaparin 40 mg daily or placebo for further 28±4 days. Venous thromboembolism incidence (symptomatic/asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, symptomatic/fatal pulmonary embolism) up to day 28 after randomization and major bleeding rates up to 48 h after the last dose of study treatment were reported.

Results

In total, 389 of 5963 (6.5%) randomized patients had ischemic stroke: 198 received extended-duration prophylaxis and 191 placebo. Extended-duration prophylaxis reduced venous thromboembolism incidence versus placebo (2.4% versus 8.0%; absolute risk difference, -5.6%; 95% CI, -10.5% to -0.7%), but it was associated with an increase in major bleeding (1.5% versus 0% in enoxaparin and placebo groups; absolute risk difference, +1.5%; 95% CI, -0.2% to 3.2%).

Conclusions

Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin was associated with reduced venous thromboembolism risk and increased major bleeding in the subgroup of patients with ischemic stroke in the EXCLAIM study.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: balancing benefits and harms on the long term [^56502b1d]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is effectively treated with anticoagulant therapy. After an initial treatment phase, extended treatment is effective to prevent recurrence after a first event but this is at the expense of a continued risk of bleeding. Ideally, patients at a high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding continue anticoagulant therapy, and for those at low risk of recurrence the duration of treatment can be limited. Identifying these patients, however, is difficult. Duration of treatment after a first VTE provoked by a transient risk factor should be limited to 3 months. Although guidelines suggest extended treatment for all patients after unprovoked VTE unless bleeding risk is high, we emphasize that the long-term risks of recurrent VTE off anticoagulation are uncertain whereas the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy increases with age. In the absence of evidence of replaced mortality or improved quality of life with extended anticoagulant treatment, we suggest a limited duration for most patients after a first VTE. Extended treatment can be considered, based mainly on patient preference.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring and anti-Xa targets—coagulation monitoring is not generally necessary, though some authorities suggest monitoring in obese patients and in those with renal insufficiency, and monitoring may also be advisable when treatment doses are given during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial comparing monitored and unmonitored dalteparin therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed no benefit of monitoring; monitoring is thus not recommended for the majority of patients, and if monitoring is required, the anti-Xa level is the recommended test. For treatment of VTE, a conservative peak anti-Xa level with twice-daily enoxaparin or nadroparin is 0.6 to 1.0 units/mL, and the target range for peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 h after dosing with once-daily enoxaparin is likely to be above 1.0 units/mL, whereas it is 0.85 units/mL with tinzaparin and 1.3 units/mL and 1.05 units/mL with nadroparin and dalteparin, respectively.

Table 2—LMWH dosing regimens in pregnancy list prophylactic LMWH options: Enoxaparin, 40 mg SC once daily; Dalteparin, 5,000 units SC once daily; Tinzaparin, 4,500 units SC once daily; and Nadroparin, 2,850 units SC once daily. Intermediate-dose LMWH includes Enoxaparin, 40 mg SC every 12 hours, and Dalteparin, 5,000 units SC every 12 hours. Adjusted-dose (therapeutic) LMWH options include Enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg every 12 hours; Dalteparin, 200 units/kg once daily or 100 units/kg every 12 hours; and Tinzaparin, 175 units/kg once daily. Target an anti-Xa level in the therapeutic range of 0.6–1.0 units/mL 4 hours after last injection for twice-daily regimen; slightly higher doses may be needed for a once-daily regimen. Although at extremes of body weight, modification of dose may be required, and adjusted-dose therapy is also referred to as weight adjusted, full treatment dose.

IV enoxaparin—use and pharmacokinetics in children note that IV enoxaparin has been used in a small number of pediatric studies, including patients who are critically ill and those with significant soft tissue edema or burns. When administered as an infusion over 30 minutes, peak anti-FXa levels were similar to those reported with SQ administration, and the clearance of the drug has not been carefully studied with IV administration.

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^3de2aef7]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are predisposed to thromboembolism. Routine prophylactic anticoagulation is widely recommended. Low-molecular-weight heparins, such as enoxaparin, are increasingly used because of predictable pharmacokinetics. This study aims to determine the subcutaneous (SC) dose of enoxaparin that would give the best anti-factor Xa levels in ICU patients.

Methods

The 72 patients admitted to a mixed ICU at Odense University Hospital (OUH) in Denmark were randomised into four groups to receive 40, 50, 60, or 70 mg SC enoxaparin for a period of 24 hours. Anti-factor Xa activity (aFXa) was measured before, and at 4, 12, and 24 hours after administration. An AFXa level between 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml was considered evidence of effective antithrombotic activity.

Results

Median peak (4 hours after administration), aFXa levels increased significantly with an increase in enoxaparin dose, from 0.13 IU/ml at 40 mg, to 0.14 IU/ml at 50 mg, 0.27 IU/ml at 60 mg, and 0.29 IU/ml at 70 mg (P = 0.002). At 12 hours after administration, median aFXa levels were still within therapeutic range for those patients who received 60 mg (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Our study confirmed that a standard dose of 40 mg enoxaparin yielded subtherapeutic levels of aFXa in critically ill patients. Higher doses resulted in better peak aFXa levels, with a ceiling effect observed at 60 mg. The present study seems to suggest inadequate dosage as one of the possible mechanisms for the higher failure rate of enoxaparin in ICU patients.

Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) reversal in intracranial hemorrhage—We recommend discontinuing LMWH when intracranial hemorrhage is present or suspected and recommend reversing LMWH in patients with intracranial hemorrhage receiving therapeutic doses of LMWH. Protamine administration by slow intravenous injection over a period of about 10 min is advised for enoxaparin: If enoxaparin was given within 8 h, protamine sulfate should be administered at 1 mg per 1 mg of enoxaparin (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg); if given within 8–12 h, 0.5 mg of protamine per 1 mg of enoxaparin should be administered, and after 3–5 half-lives have elapsed, protamine is probably not needed. If life-threatening bleeding persists or in renal insufficiency, we suggest redosing protamine (0.5 mg of protamine per 100 anti-Xa units or per 1 mg of enoxaparin). If protamine is contraindicated, we suggest considering recombinant Factor VIIa (90 mcg/kg IV). For prophylactic dosing, we recommend against the reversal of LMWH in patients with intracranial hemorrhage receiving prophylactic dosing of LMWH.
