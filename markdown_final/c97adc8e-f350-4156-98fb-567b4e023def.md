## Question

4 year old with chronic cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a 4-year-old with chronic cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the chronicity threshold and why it matters. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and examination that distinguish specific from non-specific cough. Next, I will review first-line investigations and their limitations in a 4-year-old. After that, I need to consider the most likely etiologies in this age group and map them to management pathways, including wet cough versus dry cough algorithms. Finally, I should ensure safety netting, follow-up intervals, and red flags are addressed, while double-checking areas where adult approaches might tempt us but are inappropriate for children.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why it drives the workup. In children, chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting more than 4 weeks, which differs from the adult threshold of 8 weeks; this matters because many pediatric coughs are post-viral and self-limited, and using a 4-week cutoff helps avoid unnecessary testing while catching persistent disease early [^115g2Tzt] [^112kmsV6]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: up to 10% of children can cough for 20–25 days after a URTI, so the 4-week mark balances over-investigation against missed pathology, and importantly, a meaningful proportion of children with cough persisting beyond 4 weeks harbor serious disease, justifying structured evaluation [^114jsK6t] [^112kmsV6].

> Next, I should review the history with a focus on cough characteristics and associated features that signal "specific cough". I need to check whether the cough is wet or dry, because a wet/productive cough strongly predicts a specific cause such as protracted bacterial bronchitis, whereas a dry cough without pointers is more likely non-specific and may resolve spontaneously. However, hold on, I should verify parental reporting reliability, as parents misclassify wet versus dry cough in about a quarter of cases, so I must reconcile caregiver descriptions with exam findings and, if needed, video examples or objective assessment [^113dD3d4] [^115LzTvv] [^115gNUYN]. I should confirm timing (day versus night, seasonal pattern), triggers (exercise, cold air, allergens, feeding), associated symptoms (fever, wheeze, stridor, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, recurrent pneumonia), exposures (ETS, pets, daycare), and immunization status, especially pertussis, because these features shape pretest probabilities and testing choices [^115g2Tzt] [^114jsK6t].

> On examination, I will now examine for systemic and pulmonary "cough pointers". Let me think about growth parameters, digital clubbing, chest wall deformity, and signs of chronic suppurative disease. On lung exam I should listen for wheeze, crackles, stridor, and focal findings that suggest localized disease. I should also inspect the ears, nose, and throat for upper airway contributors and remember that Arnold's ear-cough reflex is rare but worth checking with otoscopy and gentle tragal stimulation if cough is refractory and unexplained [^111ZkiFT] [^114cnZ27]. Hold on, I should verify that the absence of all specific pointers substantially lowers the likelihood of serious disease, supporting a watchful waiting approach in truly non-specific presentations [^113dYv4e].

> For initial investigations in a 4-year-old, I need to ensure I order the right tests and avoid unnecessary ones. Chest radiography is first-line because it is specific and can reveal unsuspected disease; spirometry is generally not feasible at age 4 unless the child is unusually cooperative, so I should not over-rely on it here, though I can consider it if the child can perform it reliably with pediatric coaching; beyond these, I should avoid routine labs, allergy testing, CT, or bronchoscopy unless specific pointers emerge, given radiation risks and low yield [^115d6NZV] [^111xzP1t] [^115cKEwH]. Wait, I should double-check that both CXR and spirometry, when abnormal, carry high positive likelihood ratios for specific cough, reinforcing their selective but strategic use [^115d6NZV].

> Let me consider the most likely etiologies in a 4-year-old with chronic cough. Post-infectious cough is common after viral URIs and can persist beyond 4 weeks, but I should not anchor on this without reassessment; protracted bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in children under 6 and is diagnosed clinically when a wet cough resolves with appropriate antibiotics in the absence of other pointers; asthma and cough-variant asthma are important considerations, especially with exercise or nocturnal symptoms; upper airway cough syndrome is less common under 6 but should be considered with nasal congestion or post-tussive swallowing; GERD is an uncommon isolated cause in children and should not be treated empirically without GI symptoms; pertussis remains in the differential if paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, or known exposure are present; less common but serious entities include foreign body aspiration, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and immunodeficiency, which I must keep in mind when red flags are present [^114jsK6t] [^112U5MLm] [^114Jz5tR] [^116Z9sAm] [^116xcRkQ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said GERD is common like in adults, but I should correct that — pediatric data show GERD is not a frequent isolated cause of chronic cough and empiric acid suppression without GI features is discouraged [^114ewgqm] [^116upLpz].

> If the cough is wet or productive, I should treat as protracted bacterial bronchitis with a 2-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate targeting common pathogens, then extend to a total of 4 weeks if cough persists, and if still wet after 4 weeks, escalate to flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and consider chest CT to evaluate for bronchiectasis or other suppurative lung disease. I need to ensure I document resolution with antibiotics to secure the PBB diagnosis and avoid premature closure [^112U5MLm] [^117JYCEn] [^112uAAFd]. Hold on, I should verify that this staged antibiotic approach is evidence-based and avoids unnecessary imaging early on, which aligns with CHEST recommendations [^112U5MLm] [^117JYCEn].

> If the cough is dry and there are no specific pointers, I should adopt a watchful waiting approach with reassessment in 2–4 weeks, while addressing environmental exposures such as tobacco smoke and setting expectations. If asthma features are present (nocturnal cough, exercise-induced symptoms, eczema/allergy history), a time-limited trial of inhaled corticosteroids at 400 mcg/day budesonide equivalent for 2–4 weeks is reasonable, but I must re-evaluate and stop ICS if there is no response, recognizing the potential for spontaneous resolution or a period effect. I should avoid escalating ICS in non-responders and avoid labeling the child as asthmatic without corroborating features or objective testing when feasible [^113nbx4p] [^11225YWP] [^113u5sxd]. Let me reconsider the role of spirometry here — at age 4 it is often not feasible, so clinical response and careful reassessment guide decisions, and I should plan to wean and stop ICS if no sustained benefit is observed [^114czxSk] [^11225YWP].

> I should confirm that empiric therapies outside these pathways are discouraged. Antibiotics should not be used for dry, non-specific cough; anti-reflux therapy should not be started without GI symptoms; and over-the-counter cough and cold medications are not recommended for children under 4 years due to lack of benefit and potential harm, so I need to counsel caregivers clearly and document shared decision-making [^116Z9sAm] [^112HKPwG] [^114WR9cu]. But wait, what if the family is using homeopathic remedies? I should advise that these are not FDA-approved and have been associated with serious adverse events in young children, reinforcing avoidance in this age group [^114WR9cu].

> Next, I should review safety netting and follow-up. If following a watchful waiting approach, I need to ensure reassessment within 2–4 weeks to detect emerging specific pointers. If cough persists beyond 4 weeks of appropriate therapy or new red flags appear, I should expedite referral to pediatric pulmonology and consider advanced diagnostics such as bronchoscopy or CT, balancing radiation risks in young children. Throughout, I should assess the impact of cough on the child and family, address expectations, and use validated tools where available to track outcomes [^113nbx4p] [^115cKEwH] [^112fkXU5] [^114JVFAZ]. Hold on, I should verify that early use of structured pathways improves outcomes; indeed, randomized and cohort data show faster resolution and better quality of life with pediatric-specific algorithms, supporting this systematic approach [^113ngNDA] [^112auaCX].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have not overlooked special contexts. After bronchiolitis, chronic cough should be managed per pediatric algorithms and not treated with asthma medications or hypertonic saline unless there is separate evidence of asthma. If pertussis is suspected based on exposure or characteristic features, I should test and treat appropriately. And if, after a comprehensive evaluation, the cough remains unexplained and exhibits tic-like features (suppressible, distractible, absent during sleep), I should consider tic cough and manage accordingly [^114eAVAV] [^1143FvUM] [^111xzP1t] [^116FQVEc]. I should double-check that I have screened for environmental and social determinants, because mitigating tobacco exposure and aligning expectations can materially improve outcomes even when the cough is self-limited [^116Zz2be].

A 4-year-old with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) [^115g2Tzt] should be evaluated with a **focused history and exam** to identify specific pointers (wet cough, wheeze, growth issues, exposures) [^113dD3d4] and a **chest radiograph** [^115d6NZV]; spirometry is not reliable at this age. Common causes include **protracted bacterial bronchitis** (treat with 2–4 weeks of amoxicillin–clavulanate) [^112U5MLm] [^117JYCEn], asthma (trial ICS if features present) [^11225YWP] [^111P2Hpn], upper airway cough syndrome, GERD (treat only if GI symptoms) [^116Z9sAm], and post-infectious cough [^114jsK6t]. Avoid routine antibiotics for dry cough [^111mhqRu], and reserve CT or bronchoscopy for persistent wet cough after 4 weeks of antibiotics or if red flags appear [^117JYCEn] [^115cKEwH]. Reassess in 2–4 weeks [^113nbx4p]; refer to pediatric pulmonology if unresolved or if serious disease is suspected [^114dv855].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Chronic cough in children is defined as a **daily cough lasting more than 4 weeks** [^115g2Tzt]. It is common and often benign, but persistent cough can indicate serious underlying disease, so a systematic evaluation is essential [^112kmsV6].

---

## Common etiologies in 4-year-old children

The most common causes of chronic cough in this age group include:

| **Etiology** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) | Wet/productive cough, no other specific pointers | - Clinical diagnosis <br/> - Confirmed by response to antibiotics [^112U5MLm] |
| Asthma | - Dry cough <br/> - Wheeze <br/> - Exercise-induced symptoms | - Clinical features <br/> - Trial of ICS [^11225YWP] [^111P2Hpn] |
| Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) | - Nasal congestion <br/> - Postnasal drip <br/> - Throat clearing | - Clinical features <br/> - Response to intranasal steroids/antihistamines [^notfound] |
| Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) | - Reflux symptoms <br/> - Feeding difficulties | - Clinical features <br/> - Trial of acid suppression if symptoms present [^116Z9sAm] |
| Post-infectious cough | - Follows recent URI <br/> - Gradually resolving | - Clinical history <br/> - Watchful waiting [^113u5sxd] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is recommended:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify specific cough pointers (wet cough, wheeze, growth issues, exposures) [^111ZkiFT].
- **Chest radiograph**: Initial test to exclude structural abnormalities or infection [^115d6NZV].
- **Spirometry**: Not routinely feasible in 4-year-olds; consider if older and cooperative [^114czxSk].
- **Laboratory tests**: Only if clinically indicated (e.g. pertussis, TB, immune deficiency) [^111xzP1t].

---

## Management strategies

Management should be **etiology-based**:

- **Protracted bacterial bronchitis**: Amoxicillin–clavulanate for 2–4 weeks; if cough persists, extend to 4 weeks and consider bronchoscopy [^117X1XZS] [^117JYCEn].
- **Asthma**: Trial of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 2–4 weeks; reassess and discontinue if no response [^11225YWP] [^111P2Hpn].
- **UACS**: Intranasal steroids, antihistamines, and saline rinses [^117X1XZS].
- **GERD**: Acid suppression only if GI symptoms present [^116Z9sAm].
- **Post-infectious cough**: Supportive care and watchful waiting [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- Hemoptysis
- Digital clubbing
- Failure to thrive
- Recurrent pneumonia
- Severe respiratory distress
- Foreign body aspiration

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Most children improve with **targeted therapy**, but persistent cough after 4 weeks of appropriate treatment warrants further evaluation and specialist referral [^114dv855].

---

## Parental education and counseling

Parents should be educated about the **chronic cough definition**, common causes, expected course, and the risks of overuse of cough medications. Emphasize adherence to prescribed therapy and follow-up [^112fkXU5].

---

A 4-year-old with chronic cough should have a **focused evaluation** to identify the cause, with management tailored to the underlying etiology. Most cases resolve with targeted therapy, but persistent cough requires further investigation and specialist referral [^115d6NZV].

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112WQSuS]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or GER disease (GERD) causes chronic cough in children is controversial. Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format, we undertook four systematic reviews. For children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease: (1) who do not have gastrointestinal GER symptoms, should empirical treatment for GERD be used? (2) with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, does treatment for GERD resolve the cough? (3) with or without gastrointestinal GER symptoms, what GER-based therapies should be used and for how long? (4) if GERD is suspected as the cause, what investigations and diagnostic criteria best determine GERD as the cause of the cough?

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus.

Results

Few randomized controlled trials addressed the first two questions and none addressed the other two. The single meta-analysis (two randomized controlled trials) showed no significant difference between the groups (any intervention for GERD vs placebo for cough resolution; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; p = 0.78). Proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. Qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

Conclusions

The panelists endorsed that: (1) treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD; and (2) pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations.

### Chronic cough in children… [^113r4vTU]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Chronic cough in the pediatric otolaryngology setting differs from the typical presentation in the primary care setting. The top 3 causes encountered by the practicing otolaryngologist in a pediatric patient are infection, airway hyperreactivity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If initial otolaryngologic treatment fails, chest radiography and early pulmonary consult are recommended. Chronic cough affects all age groups and is a common complaint in the pediatric otolaryngologist's practice. The differential diagnosis is extensive. Within the pediatric population, chronic cough is defined as a cough that lasts longer than 4 weeks. Visits to primary care physicians' offices with cough as the presenting complaint are estimated to be 30 million per year in the United States and account for up to 40% of patient volume in pulmonary practices.

1–3 Review of literature has shown that the typical conditions that cause chronic cough seen by an otolaryngologist differ from those seen by a primary care physician.
4. From 2008 to 2012, there were 58 pediatric patients with a cough of duration greater than 4 weeks for whom follow-up information was available. The mean age of the patients was 5. 1 years. The average cough duration at the time of presentation was 17. 7 weeks. Seventeen of the patients had a wet cough, while the rest had a dry cough. The most common cause of chronic cough was found to be infection. The diagnosis of an infectious cause was made after eliminating other causes and confirming that patient's history and examination findings were consistent with infection.

The most common infectious processes were upper respiratory tract infection and/or UACS, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infection. In our study, chronic cough was resolved for most patients when their underlying condition was addressed. In patients for whom initial therapy failed, most had pertinent findings on chest radiographs and were referred to a pulmonologist, and all were ultimately diagnosed with asthma. Therefore, we would advocate an early referral to a pulmonologist and evaluation with chest radiography if improvement is not seen within 4 weeks of initiation of treatment.

### Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116TqsqE]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review relevant literature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methodology

The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, review articles, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched and reviewed by a single author. The date of the last comprehensive search was December 5, 2003, and that of the Cochrane database was November 7, 2004. The authors' own databases and expertise identified additional articles.

Results/Conclusions

Pediatric chronic cough (ie, cough in children aged < 15 years) is defined as a daily cough lasting for > 4 weeks. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of URTIs in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough (ie, cough associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem) and nonspecific cough (ie, dry cough in the absence of an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology). The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology. A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are a general guideline only, do not substitute for sound clinical judgment, and are not intended to be used as a protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness. Children (aged < 15 years) with cough should be managed according to child-specific guidelines, which differ from those for adults as the etiologic factors and treatments for children are sometimes different from those for adults. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology, and there is no evidence for using medications for the symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, it is imperative that the children are followed up and therapy with the medications stopped if there is no effect on the cough within an expected time frame. An evaluation of the time to response is important. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences and parental expectations should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough often impacts the quality of life of both children and parents, and the exploration of parental expectations and fears is often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^115gNUYN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

Does the quality of cough reported by parents of children with chronic cough provide a reliable indication of the nature of a child's cough?
The use of terms such as 'wet' and 'dry' to characterise a cough is very subjective, and parental descriptions frequently do not reflect the clinician's view.
Eliciting information regarding the characteristics of a child's chronic cough is one of the key components of the history when formulating a presumptive diagnosis, but clinicians should not rely solely on the accuracy of the parent's assessment of whether the cough is 'dry' or wet'.

Figure 3 — Approach to a child aged ≤ 14 years with chronic specific cough outlines assessment for "Symptoms/signs of asthma and/or reversible airway obstruction?" with an asthma pathway to "Reassess in 2–4 wks", and for a wet/productive cough a management pathway to "Treat as PBB with 2 wks antibiotics", "Repeat 2 wk course if wet cough persists", and if "Persistent wet cough after 4 wks of antibiotics", to "Consider early consultation with pediatric pulmonologist for assessment and/or assess risk factors for"; the algorithm also advises, "In all, evaluate Tobacco smoke and other pollutants" and "Child's activity, parental expectations and concerns". For clarity, PBB is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB).

Heightened cough sensitivity testing in children — limited diagnostic value: "A study based on 100 children with chronic cough and 100 control subjects also supported the absence of 'cough hypersensitive syndrome' in children", and an updated summary "suggests that tests for cough sensitivity are currently non-diagnostic and of limited use for research purposes".

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112kmsV6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and initial threshold: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Because cough can spontaneously resolve within 4 weeks, the guideline does not advocate using medications or investigating all children at the 4-week timepoint other than with simple tests such as spirometry and a chest radiograph. Supporting the need for careful assessment, a serious potentially progressive underlying respiratory illness was documented in 18% of 346 children in a multicenter study using a cough algorithm, and new serious chronic lung disease was found in up to 30.8% of children with acute cough persisting > 4 weeks at a specialist hospital.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^116dLZ8T]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Children with chronic cough — key questions define the pediatric scope and targets: KQ1 asks, in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), whether the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes; KQ2 asks, in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), whether the cough or testing algorithm should differ depending on the duration and/or severity; KQ3 asks, in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), whether the cough or testing algorithm should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history; KQ4 asks, in children aged ≤ 14 years, what testing or tests should be routinely done in clinical practice when evaluating chronic cough of at least 4 weeks' duration; and KQ5 asks, when evaluating children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (of at least 4 weeks' duration), what is the role of pulmonary function studies and bronchial provocation in clinical practice.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^1125pDsC]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic cough should avoid exposure to irritants that can trigger cough, and those who smoke should stop smoking. Patients who develop chronic cough in association with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy should be switched to an agent from another drug class. If cough persists, a chest radiograph should be ordered to rule out malignancy and other serious conditions. Postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the most likely causes of chronic cough in adults. If postnasal drip syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. Pulmonary function testing with a methacholine challenge is the preferred test for confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Gastroesophageal reflux disease usually is diagnosed based on the symptoms and after a trial of therapy. If the cause of chronic cough remains unclear, high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the chest, bronchoscopy, and referral to a pulmonary specialist may be indicated. The approach to diagnosing chronic cough in immunocompromised patients and children is similar to the approach in immunocompetent adults. However, a CD4+ cell count can help determine the potential for opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the most common causes of chronic cough in children. Foreign body aspiration should be considered in young children. Congenital conditions, cystic fibrosis, and immune disorders are possible diagnoses in children with chronic cough and recurrent infection.

### Chronic cough in children [^113uXYCn]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Chronic cough is a common complaint among pediatric patients, but little information exists on the types of diagnoses in these patients and therapeutic outcomes.

Objective

To characterize pediatric patients with chronic cough presenting to otolaryngology clinics, identify common causes and treatments, and evaluate therapeutic outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective analysis, all medical records for pediatric patients seen at 2 otolaryngology clinics at a single tertiary care academic medical center from January 2009 through June 2013 were searched for relevant diagnostic codes. Patients younger than 18 years presenting with chronic cough (cough of > 4 weeks' duration) were selected for study; 58 patients met the inclusion criteria and were selected for analysis.

Interventions

Each patient was evaluated by the clinician via history, physical examination, and various tests and procedures, depending on the individual case, including flexible laryngoscopy, imaging tests, and/or airway evaluations. Each patient underwent treatment based on the working diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included final diagnosis, response to treatment (as indicated by resolution of cough after initial therapy), and diagnostic workup undergone.

Results

Among the 58 included patients, the 3 most common diagnoses were related to infection (n = 23; 34%), airway hyperreactivity (n = 14; 24%), or gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 14; 24%). Initial response to treatment was observed in 83% of patients (n = 48), while the remaining 17% (n = 10) required further evaluation. All 10 patients for whom initial treatment failed (100%) had a diagnosis involving airway hyperreactivity (P < .001). In addition, chest radiography was more likely to be ordered (odds ratio [OR], 16.4; 95% CI, 1.91–140.8; p = 0.002) and to contain pertinent positive findings (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 1.15–142.6; p = 0.04) in patients for whom treatment failed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Chronic cough in the pediatric otolaryngology setting differs from the typical presentation in the primary care setting. The top 3 causes encountered by the practicing otolaryngologist in a pediatric patient are infection, airway hyperreactivity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. If initial otolaryngologic treatment fails, chest radiography and early pulmonary consult are recommended.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111mhqRu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking).

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Evaluation of chronic cough in children [^115ZrdFC]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic cough in children is among the problems that lead to frequent consultations with a doctor. In this study, we attempted to research the reasons for chronic cough by an evaluation method using the guidelines that were suggested for children by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) in 2006. We studied 108 children between 6 and 14 years of age who had a cough that lasted for > 4 weeks. The patients were reevaluated during the second to fourth weeks, and until either the cough terminated or resolved. Twenty-five percent of the patients received diagnoses of asthma and asthma-like symptoms, 23.4% received diagnoses of protracted bronchitis, 20.3% received diagnoses of upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), and 4.6% received diagnoses of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Asthma and asthma-like symptoms, protracted bronchitis, and UACS were detected in order of frequency as the reason for chronic cough in children. We concluded that the 2006 ACCP guidelines for the management of chronic cough in children are effective and can be successfully utilized in a nonaffluent study setting.

### Yardstick for managing cough, part 2: in children [^111U7Anr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nationwide statistics in the United States and Australia reveal that cough of undifferentiated duration is the most common complaint for which patients of all ages seek medical care in the ambulatory setting. Management of chronic cough is one of the most common reasons for new patient visits to respiratory specialists. Because symptomatic cough is such a common problem and so much has been learned about how to diagnose and treat cough of all durations but especially chronic cough, this 2-part yardstick has been written to review in a practical way the evidence-based guidelines most of which have been developed from high-quality systematic reviews on how best to manage cough of all durations in adults, adolescents, and children. Chronic cough in children is often benign and self-limiting. Using established and validated protocols and specific pointers (clues in history, findings on examination) can aid the clinician in identifying causes when present and improve outcomes. In this manuscript, part 2 of the 2-part series, we provide evidence-based, expert opinion recommendations on the management of chronic cough in the pediatric patient (< 14 years of age).

Guideline development methods — pediatric scope and GRADE approach were prespecified: for the CHEST cough guidelines, it was a priori determined that the age cut-off for pediatric and adult components was 14 years; the ACCP has adopted the GRADE framework (The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation), which separates the process of rating the quality of evidence from that of determining the strength of recommendation; searches for the systematic reviews were undertaken externally by librarians from the University of Massachusetts Medical School and were undertaken between February 28, 2015 and August 14, 2015 using a priori established protocol for each KQ; when there was insufficient evidence for diagnosis and management recommendations, the panel heavily placed great emphasis on patient values, preferences, ease and cost of tests, and availability of potential therapies.

### Cough. 2: chronic cough in children [^113AD1fs]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a common problem in childhood. Viral infections are the most prevalent cause, but other rarer disorders should be excluded whenever cough appears unusually severe and/or frequent, and when there is evidence of failure to thrive and growth retardation. The younger the child, the more the need to exclude underlying disease at an early stage. Passive smoking is an important contributor to chronic cough in children. Chronic productive cough with purulent sputum is always reason for concern in children and is not common as a symptom of asthma. More or less specific diagnoses in children include cystic fibrosis, aspirated foreign body, congenital anatomic abnormalities and primary ciliary dyskinesia.

### Cough-variant asthma: a review of clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathophysiology [^1171qkfh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is among the most common symptoms prompting medical care. Cough-variant asthma (CVA) is an asthma subset where cough is the primary symptom, without wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea. It is an important cause of chronic cough, estimated to account for 25% to 42% of cases, but likely underdiagnosed due to delayed recognition and pitfalls of diagnostic testing. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and delay its progression to more typical asthma. This review details the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of CVA and contrasts it with classic asthma and other causes of chronic cough.

### The development of chronic cough in children following presentation to a tertiary paediatric emergency department with acute respiratory illness: study protocol for a prospective cohort study [^1161tutS]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory illness (ARI) a leading cause of cough in children accounts for a substantial proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cough in children is one of the most common reasons for medical encounters both in Australia and internationally. In the UK, 30% of all paediatric primary care encounters are due to respiratory illnesses, with cough as a symptom accounting for over 8% of all medical presentations. In the United States, cough as a symptom is the 4th leading reason for emergency department (ED) attendance across all ages, accounting for 3% of all presentations. In a UK study designed to test the repeatability of a parent-completed respiratory questionnaire, one third of parents with young children reported cough in the absence of a cold whilst one in five parents reported cough at night.

Cough in children is symptomatic of a broad range of respiratory illnesses and infections ranging from mild and transient upper respiratory tract infections to serious chronic disease. In some children acute cough can lead to chronic cough (defined as cough lasting > 4 weeks), which may be the sole presenting symptom of an underlying respiratory illness. Parents of children with chronic cough typically seek five or more medical consultations prior to referral to respiratory specialists. Despite chronic cough in children accounting for substantial direct and indirect costs for health service providers, patients and their families, it remains an under-recognised and inadequately researched cause of morbidity in children.

One of the constructs in the assessment of chronic cough in children is cough quality which includes dry and wet cough. Chronic wet cough is a key symptom of protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) and bronchiectasis in children and if left untreated may progress to irreversible lung injury and chronic lung disease. PBB is clinically defined as the presence of an isolated chronic wet cough in the absence of pointers suggestive of alternative causes that resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment. CSLD is a clinical syndrome of chronic endobronchial suppuration characterised by a chronic wet cough with or without evidence of bronchiectasis on a chest high-resolution computed tomography (cHRCT) scan whereas, bronchiectasis refers to CSLD with the presence of radiological features. Whether these conditions are different or reflect severity as part of a spectrum is yet to be determined.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any other specific cough pointers and whose cough resolves within 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics targeted to local antibiotic sensitivities, we recommend that the diagnosis of PBB be made.

Otogenic causes — Arnold's ear-cough reflex in children has a prevalence similar to healthy children, whereas in adults it is higher; overall, the reflex is present in approximately 2.3% to 4.2% of people (bilateral in 0.3%-2%), it can be elicited by palpation of the postero-inferior or antero-inferior ear canal wall or by insertion of a cotton-tip applicator 3 to 5 mm for 2 to 3 seconds, and because of this reflex the ears should always be examined and any foreign material removed, although it is a very rare cause of childhood chronic cough.

### The development of chronic cough in children following presentation to a tertiary paediatric emergency department with acute respiratory illness: study protocol for a prospective cohort study [^112SbjPE]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory illness, a leading cause of cough in children, accounts for a substantial proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. In some children acute cough progresses to chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration), impacting on morbidity and decreasing quality of life. Despite the importance of chronic cough as a cause of substantial childhood morbidity and associated economic, family and social costs, data on the prevalence, predictors, aetiology and natural history of the symptom are scarce. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children presenting to a tertiary paediatric emergency department.

Methods/design

A prospective cohort study of children aged < 15 years attending the Royal Children's Hospital Emergency Department, Brisbane, for a respiratory illness that includes parent reported cough (wet or dry) as a symptom. The primary objective is to determine the prevalence and predictors of chronic cough (≥ 4 weeks duration) post presentation with acute respiratory illness. Demographic, epidemiological, risk factor, microbiological and clinical data are completed at enrolment. Subjects complete daily cough dairies and weekly follow-up contacts for 28(± 3) days to ascertain cough persistence. Children who continue to cough for 28 days post enrolment are referred to a paediatric respiratory physician for review. Primary analysis will be the proportion of children with persistent cough at day 28(± 3). Multivariate analyses will be performed to evaluate variables independently associated with chronic cough at day 28(± 3).

Discussion

Our protocol will be the first to comprehensively describe the natural history, epidemiology, aetiology and outcomes of cough during and after acute respiratory illness in children. The results will contribute to studies leading to the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines to improve the early detection and management of chronic cough in children during and after acute respiratory illness.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111KPPSk]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤ 12–18years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤ 10–21years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5days to < 6weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^112trKFm]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

Indeed, reviews report coughing as one of the most common reasons for consultation in routine paediatric and family practice. The majority of children experience 5 to 8 episodes of one week of cough throughout the year. However, these studies are mostly based on secondary/tertiary care data or are population-based. Age influences the development of the respiratory system in general, which explains the change of prevalences over lifetime, and distinctive age-related patterns, as shown in our study, with the lowest cough prevalences mainly in studies on older children (51.2% of children aged 15 to 19 years). This is in accordance with the guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians, who set the cut-off age for applying adult protocols at 14 years of age.

The distinction between acute, subacute and chronic cough differs from what is applied in adults. The US and Australian-New Zealand guidelines define acute cough in children to last < 2 weeks, subacute cough 2–4 weeks and chronic cough > 4 weeks. This is based on the natural course of upper RTI in children differing from the course in adults (< 3 weeks, 3–8 weeks and > 8 weeks). Triaging patients according the duration of cough is the first step in the diagnostic process, which is why aetiological data for both acute and chronic cough are required. However, the categorizations in the identified studies differed from those suggested in the cough guidelines, which limits the impact of these studies for guideline development or validation.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111nAZNM]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms to general practitioners. The objective of this article is to collate the pediatric components of the CHEST chronic cough guidelines that have recently updated the 2006 guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methods

We reviewed all current CHEST Expert Cough Panel's statements and extracted recommendations and suggestions relating to children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration). Additionally, we undertook systematic reviews to update other sections we considered relevant and important.

Results

The eight recent CHEST guidelines relevant to children, based on systematic reviews, reported some high-quality evidence in the management of chronic cough in children (eg, use of algorithms and management of wet/productive cough using appropriate antibiotics). However, much evidence is still inadequate, particularly in the management of non-specific cough in the community.

Conclusions

The recommendations and suggestions related to the management of chronic cough in the pediatric age group have been based upon high-quality systematic reviews and are summarized in this article. Compared to the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of the management of chronic cough in children. However, further studies particularly in primary health care are required.

### Etiologies of chronic cough in pediatric cohorts: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116jUgfY]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is no published systematic review on the etiologies of chronic cough or the relationship between OSA and chronic cough in children aged ≤ 14 years. We thus undertook a systematic review based on key questions (KQs) using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format. The KQs follow: Among children with chronic (> 4 weeks) cough (KQ 1) are the common etiologies different from those in adults? (KQ 2) Are the common etiologies age or setting dependent, or both? (KQ 3) Is OSA a cause of chronic cough in children?

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus.

Results

Combining KQs 1 and 2, we found moderate-level evidence from 10 prospective studies that the etiologies of cough in children are different from those in adults and are setting dependent. Data from three studies found that common etiologies of cough in young children were different from those in older children. However, data relating sleep abnormalities to chronic cough in children were found only in case studies.

Conclusions

There is moderate-quality evidence that common etiologies of chronic cough in children are different from those in adults and are dependent on age and setting. As there are few data relating OSA and chronic cough in children, the panel suggested that these children should be managed in accordance with pediatric sleep guidelines.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115d6NZV]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST pediatric chronic cough — recommendations for children aged ≤ 14 years emphasize guideline-based evaluation and initial testing. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms (Grade 1B), we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough (Grade 1A), we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough (Grade 1A), and we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β₂ agonist) be undertaken (Grade 1B). Although spirometry and chest radiograph (CXR) are suggested, neither are sensitive but both are specific, with a study of 326 children demonstrating an infinite positive likelihood ratio for both tests.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^115GsoSY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with chronic cough (i.e., of more than eight weeks' duration) should include a focused history and physical examination, and in most patients, chest radiography. Patients who are taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should switch to a medication from another drug class. The most common causes of chronic cough in adults are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, alone or in combination. If upper airway cough syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed based on clinical response to empiric therapy with inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Empiric treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease should be initiated in lieu of testing for patients with chronic cough and reflux symptoms. Patients should avoid exposure to cough-evoking irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography, and referral to a pulmonologist may be indicated if the cause of chronic cough is not identified. In children, a cough lasting longer than four weeks is considered chronic. The most common causes in children are respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Evaluation of children with chronic cough should include chest radiography and spirometry.

Pediatric-specific chronic cough pathways — recommendation and supporting evidence: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms (Grade 1B). The systematic review found high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of children-specific cough management protocols improves clinical outcomes, and when data were available, findings from randomized controlled trials were consistent with those derived from cohort studies.

### Utility of signs and symptoms of chronic cough in predicting specific cause in children [^111wbe87]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Paediatricians rely on cough descriptors to direct them to the level of investigations needed for a child presenting with chronic cough, yet there is a lack of published data to support this approach. A study was undertaken to evaluate (1) whether historical cough pointers can predict which children have a specific cause for their cough and (2) the usefulness of chest radiography and spirometry as standard investigations in children with chronic cough.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of children referred to a tertiary hospital with a cough lasting > 3 weeks between June 2002 and July 2004. All included children completed a detailed history and examination using a standardised data collection sheet and followed a pathway of investigation until a diagnosis was made.

Results

In 100 consecutively recruited children of median age 2.8 years, the best predictor of specific cough observed was a moist cough at the time of consultation with an odds ratio (OR) of 9.34 (95% CI 3.49 to 25.03). Chest examination or chest radiographic abnormalities were also predictive with OR 3.60 (95% CI 1.31 to 9.90) and 3.16 (95% CI 1.32 to 7.62), respectively. The most significant historical pointer for predicting a specific cause of the cough was a parental history of moist cough (sensitivity 96%, specificity 26%, positive predictive value 74%).

Conclusions

The most useful clinical marker in predicting specific cough is the presence of a daily moist cough. Both chest examination and chest radiographic abnormalities are also useful in predicting whether children have a specific cause of their cough.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to the management of chronic cough in a child [^112VUo9V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Coughing is a primary pulmonary defence mechanism that enhances clearance of secretions and particles from the airways and protects against aspiration of foreign materials. Coughing may affect 30% of children at any given time (1). Many are healthy children but some may have serious underlying disease. Childhood cough accounts for a large number of consultations and 80% of families who are referred to a paediatric respiratory clinic for chronic cough have sought medical advice five times or more (2). The majority of childhood coughs are secondary to an acute respiratory tract infection and will improve once the infection resolves, usually within 1 to 3 weeks. With pre-school children who may experience between 6 and 10 respiratory infections a year differentiating acute recurrent cough from chronic cough is key (Table 1). Chronic cough can significantly impact a family's quality of life, as it affects the child's sleep, school attendance and play. Parents experience distress and anxiety, worrying that the cough may lead to long-term chest damage or even death (3). This article aims to guide clinicians through the assessment of the child with a chronic cough. It will discuss identifying causes, use of first line investigations, initiating appropriate management and addressing parental anxiety and exacerbating factors (4,5).

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^116eiaDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

For evidence-based decision making, primary care physicians need to have specific and reliable information on the pre-test probabilities of underlying diseases and a symptom's course. We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies in primary care, following three research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care physicians? (2) What are the underlying aetiologies of cough and the respective frequencies? (3) What is the prognosis of children with cough?

Methods

Following a pre-defined algorithm and independent double reviewer ratings we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. All quantitative original research articles in English, French or German were included if they focused on unselected study populations of children consulting a primary care physician for cough. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis in subgroups, if justifiable in terms of heterogeneity.

Results

We identified 14 eligible studies on prevalence, five on aetiology and one on prognosis. Prevalence estimates varied between 4.7 and 23.3% of all reasons for an encounter, or up to estimates of 60% when related to patients or consultations. Cough in children is more frequent than in adults, with lowest prevalences in adolescents and in summer. Acute cough is mostly caused by upper respiratory tract infections (62.4%) and bronchitis (33.3%); subacute or chronic cough by recurrent respiratory tract infection (27.7%), asthma (up to 50.4% in cough persisting more than 3weeks), and pertussis (37.2%). Potentially serious diseases like croup, pneumonia or tuberculosis are scarce. In children with subacute and chronic cough the total duration of cough ranged from 24 to 192days. About 62.3% of children suffering from prolonged cough are still coughing two months after the beginning of symptoms.

Conclusion

Cough is one of the most frequent reasons for an encounter in primary care. Our findings fit in with current guideline recommendations supporting a thoughtful wait-and-see approach in acute cough and a special awareness in chronic cough of the possibility of asthma and pertussis. Further evidence of aetiological pre-test probabilities is needed to assess the diagnostic gain based on patient history and clinical signs for differential diagnoses of cough in children.

Imaging risk considerations in pediatric chronic cough note that radiation risk from CT should be weighed carefully: "children have 10 times increased risk compared to middle aged adults" and "For a single CT examination of 200 mA, lifetime attributable cancer mortality risk is 1 in 1000 to 2500 for a 2.5-year-old child". Accordingly, chest and sinus CTs "should rarely be performed unless other symptoms are present and ideally with prior consultation with a pediatric respiratory specialist".

CHEST guideline — chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children: In children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease, a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in cough resolution between any intervention for GERD and placebo (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; p = 0.78), and proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. The panelists endorsed that treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD and that pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations; qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and general approach: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration. For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms, we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough, and we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^113US1kb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cough is not standardized across the world. International experts use a variety of different guidelines, and have diverse opinions on how to define aspects of pediatric cough. Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. From an international perspective, there is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances. However, the development of such guidelines will require data gaps to be filled. In particular, clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of current acute cough therapies, and to better characterize subpopulations of pediatric patients with cough.

Pediatric chronic cough — trial of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS): If a trial of asthma therapy is warranted, we suggest using 400 μg/day equivalent of budesonide or beclomethasone, with reassessment in 2 to 4 weeks and noting that older studies reported cough related to asthma completely resolved by 2 to 7 days. Cough unresponsive to ICS should not be treated with increased doses of ICS, and if the cough resolves on ICS, the child should be re-evaluated off asthma treatment because resolution may reflect spontaneous resolution or a transient effect responsive to ICS use.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1139mcDM]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Using management algorithms or pathways potentially improves clinical outcomes. We undertook systematic reviews to examine various aspects in the generic approach (use of cough algorithms and tests) to the management of chronic cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on key questions (KQs) using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format.

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for the systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain the final grading.

Results

Combining data from systematic reviews addressing five KQs, we found high-quality evidence that a systematic approach to the management of chronic cough improves clinical outcomes. Although there was evidence from several pathways, the highest evidence was from the use of the CHEST approach. However, there was no or little evidence to address some of the KQs posed.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes, and cough management or testing algorithms should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. A chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-β₂ agonist) should be undertaken. Other tests should not be routinely performed and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (eg, tests for tuberculosis when the child has been exposed).

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^1157yY16]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Background

Cough is a very common and troublesome symptom in childhood and can lead to much parental anxiety. By far the most common cause of an acute cough is a self-limiting acute respiratory viral infection. Chronic cough, defined variously as a cough persisting more than 3, 6 and 8 weeks, is less common than recurrent acute cough but is responsible for significant levels of morbidity in affected children and their families. Epidemiological studies suggest that there is a substantial, and frequently unrecognised, burden of morbidity attributable to chronic cough in childhood, with prevalence in many studies of around 10%, although much higher levels of productive cough have been reported. Despite this relatively high prevalence, chronic cough has received very little attention over the past two decades when compared with the number of publications relating to 'asthma', which has, depending on the method of ascertainment, a similar prevalence. Diagnosing the cause of chronic cough can be challenging and is generally dependent on clinical assessment and response to treatment as there are few non-invasive 'diagnostic' tests.

Recommendations regarding cough history include enquiring about the timing and nature of the cough. Coughs are often described as 'wet'/'moist' or 'dry', and it has been stated that a moist cough is most likely due to suppurative lung disease, and a loose, rattling cough suggests excess secretions or exudates in the larger airways. Others have questioned this interpretation, suggesting that the term moist cough is subjective and carries no physiological significance. One study attempting to objectively explore this issue found that a clinician and/or parental report of a wet cough was reasonably predictive of secretions within the airways being noted on bronchoscopy, with a sensitivity and specificity of around 0.75. The converse was not true with secretions being present in a significant number who appeared to have a dry cough. This study was undertaken in patients attending for a bronchoscopy and had therefore been reviewed by the respiratory team prior to the assessment. The same group found that the most reliable predictor of there being a specific treatable cause was the presence of a wet cough with a sensitivity of 96% but a specificity of 24%. It should be noted that both studies were undertaken in a secondary care setting.

Wet cough and PBB — management when cough persists: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any other specific cough pointers (eg, coughing with feeding, digital clubbing), when the wet cough persists after 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we recommend treatment with an additional 2 weeks of the appropriate antibiotic(s) (Grade 1C); when the wet cough persists after 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we suggest that further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and sensitivities with or without chest CT) be undertaken (Grade 2B).

11 Physical findings may include swollen turbinates and direct visualization of postnasal drainage and cobblestoning of the posterior pharynx. If a specific cause is identified, therapy should be started; otherwise, initial treatment includes a decongestant combined with a first-generation antihistamine. Intranasal corticosteroids, saline nasal rinses, nasal anticholinergics, and antihistamines are also reasonable options. After counseling the patient about potential triggers, treatment usually includes an inhaled bronchodilator and high-dose inhaled corticosteroid. A leukotriene receptor antagonist can also be useful. Symptoms should resolve within one to two weeks after starting treatment. 15–17 For severe or refractory cough, a five- to 10-day course of prednisone, 40 to 60 mg, or equivalent oral corticosteroid can be considered if asthma is strongly suspected. 4, 13.

Chronic Cough in Children Chronic cough in children younger than 15 years is defined as cough lasting more than four weeks. 8 Chest radiography and spirometry should be considered initially in age-appropriate patients. 8 A watch-wait-review approach consisting of parental reassurance and observation for one to two weeks may be used in patients with a nonspecific cough. 8, 42. The most common causes of chronic cough in children six to 14 years of age are asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and UACS. 4, 6, 42 Protracted bacterial bronchitis is characterized by isolated chronic cough, wet/moist cough, resolution of cough with antibiotic treatment, and absence of findings suggestive of an alternative cause. Treatment consists of a two-week course of an appropriate antibiotic, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate. 43, 44. UACS is rare in children younger than six years, and antihistamines and decongestants are not recommended.

44 GERD does not seem to be as common in children, and empiric proton pump inhibitors are not recommended in the absence of a specific diagnosis. 8 Exposure to tobacco smoke, pets, and environmental irritants should be minimized. Pertussis can be considered but is usually associated with other symptoms, such as a "whoop" sound, apnea, low-grade fever, or vomiting. Less common causes, such as foreign body aspiration, congenital conditions, cystic fibrosis, and immune disorders, should also be considered.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

The approach when using a chronic cough algorithm is dependent on the presence of cough characteristics, clinical history, physical examination, chest radiograph (CXR) and spirometry findings. Spirometry can usually be reliably performed in children aged > 6 years and in some children > 3 years if trained pediatric personnel are utilized.

Pertussis testing in children with cough — study eligibility and indications are summarized as follows: although several studies evaluated the prevalence of recent B pertussis infection in children with cough, these did not fulfill the systematic review's inclusion criteria of cough duration; the studies reported a mean cough duration of > 4 weeks and the inclusion criteria for both studies was > 2 weeks. Nevertheless, these primary care studies suggested that appropriate tests to evaluate for recent pertussis infection should be undertaken when clinically appropriate, with the most appropriate test (culture, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic analysis) dependent on the child's age and duration of symptoms, and the 2006 ACCP guideline advocated that testing for recent B pertussis infection be undertaken when clinically suspected (eg, contact, posttussive vomiting, whoop).

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^112rYbW8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

For evidence-based decision making, primary care physicians need to have specific and reliable information on the pre-test probabilities of underlying diseases and a symptom's course. We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies in primary care, following three research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care physicians? (2) What are the underlying aetiologies of cough and the respective frequencies? (3) What is the prognosis of children with cough?

Methods

Following a pre-defined algorithm and independent double reviewer ratings we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. All quantitative original research articles in English, French or German were included if they focused on unselected study populations of children consulting a primary care physician for cough. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis in subgroups, if justifiable in terms of heterogeneity.

Results

We identified 14 eligible studies on prevalence, five on aetiology and one on prognosis. Prevalence estimates varied between 4.7 and 23.3% of all reasons for an encounter, or up to estimates of 60% when related to patients or consultations. Cough in children is more frequent than in adults, with lowest prevalences in adolescents and in summer. Acute cough is mostly caused by upper respiratory tract infections (62.4%) and bronchitis (33.3%); subacute or chronic cough by recurrent respiratory tract infection (27.7%), asthma (up to 50.4% in cough persisting more than 3 weeks), and pertussis (37.2%). Potentially serious diseases like croup, pneumonia or tuberculosis are scarce. In children with subacute and chronic cough the total duration of cough ranged from 24 to 192 days. About 62.3% of children suffering from prolonged cough are still coughing two months after the beginning of symptoms.

Conclusion

Cough is one of the most frequent reasons for an encounter in primary care. Our findings fit in with current guideline recommendations supporting a thoughtful wait-and-see approach in acute cough and a special awareness in chronic cough of the possibility of asthma and pertussis. Further evidence of aetiological pre-test probabilities is needed to assess the diagnostic gain based on patient history and clinical signs for differential diagnoses of cough in children.

### Otolaryngologic management of chronic cough in school-aged children: a review [^116xcRkQ]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The causes of pediatric chronic cough are numerous and span across several medical subspecialties. In addition to the vast array of underlying causes, there are also several different ways to approach and evaluate chronic cough. Given the frequency with which children present to otolaryngology clinics with this problem, a review of common otolaryngologic causes and an algorithm for evaluation and treatment can be beneficial.

Observations

The primary 3 causes of pediatric chronic cough presenting to an otolaryngologist include infectious causes, reflux, and airway hyperreactivity. In these cases and other instances of specific cough, treatment should be directed at the underlying cause-which may include supportive care, antibiotics, antireflux medication, bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or other intervention. Patients with nonspecific cough should be treated according to pediatric-specific cough algorithms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Appropriate workup and treatment of chronic cough can lead to higher cure rates, shorter cough duration, and improved quality of life for both patients and caregivers. A systematic approach using cough algorithms can help otolaryngologists effectively manage this common yet complex problem.

### Chronic cough in children [^115yjhEg]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic cough has been variably defined as a cough lasting longer than 3, 4 or 8 weeks. Many post viral or pertussis like illnesses are associated with prolonged coughing that resolves over time. Management involves first trying to make a diagnosis and identify the presence of any underlying condition. Targeted treatments can then be employed. Trials of treatments are often used to make a diagnosis. Because natural resolution of cough is so common any trial of treatment to confirm a diagnosis should be time limited and the treatment only restarted if the coughing returns. Only a small proportion of children with an isolated non-specific dry cough have asthma and care is needed not to over diagnose asthma. Children with chronic wet cough may have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) that responds to a full course of antibiotics. Children with PBB failing to respond to treatment or with specific pointers should be investigated for specific causes of suppurative lung disease.

### Children with chronic cough: when is watchful waiting appropriate? development of likelihood ratios for assessing children with chronic cough [^113dYv4e]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is associated with poor quality of life and may signify a serious underlying disease. Differentiating nonspecific cough (when watchful waiting can be safely undertaken) from specific cough (treatment and further investigations are beneficial) would be clinically useful. In 326 children, we aimed to (1) determine how well cough pointers (used in guidelines) differentiate specific from nonspecific cough and (2) describe the clinical profile of children whose cough resolved without medications (spontaneous resolution).

Methods

A dataset from a multicenter study involving children newly referred for chronic cough (median duration, 3–4 months) was used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of cough pointers (symptoms, signs, and simple investigations [chest radiography, spirometry]) recommended in guidelines.

Results

The pretest probability of specific cough was 88%. The absence of false-positive results meant that most pointers had strongly positive LRs. The most sensitive pointer (wet cough) had a positive LR of 26.2 (95% CI, 3.8–181.5). Although the absence of other individual pointers did not change the pretest probability much (negative LR close to 1), the absence of all pointers had a strongly negative LR of 0 (95% CI, 0–0.03). Children in the resolved spontaneously group were significantly more likely to be older, to be non-Indigenous, and to have a dry cough and a normal chest radiograph.

Conclusions

Children with chronic dry cough without any cough pointers can be safely managed using the watchful waiting approach. The high pretest probability and high positive LRs of cough pointers support the use of individual cough pointers to identify high risk of specific cough in pediatric chronic cough guidelines.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116Zz2be]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — etiology-based management, empiric trials, research methods, and contextual factors: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend basing the management on the etiology of the cough, and an empirical approach aimed at treating upper airway cough syndrome due to a rhinosinus condition, gastroesophageal reflux disease and/or asthma should not be used unless other features consistent with these conditions are present. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that if an empirical trial is used based on features consistent with a hypothesized diagnosis, the trial should be of a defined limited duration in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized diagnosis. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that clinical studies aimed at evaluating cough etiologies use validated cough outcomes, use a-priori defined response and diagnosis, and take into account the period effect, and undertake a period of follow-up. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest that exacerbating factors such as environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be determined and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated, and we suggest that parental (and when appropriate the child's) expectations be determined, and their specific concerns sought and addressed.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management [^113jzXcQ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although chronic cough in adults (cough lasting longer than eight weeks) can be caused by many etiologies, four conditions account for most cases: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Patients should be evaluated clinically (with spirometry, if indicated), and empiric treatment should be initiated. Other potential causes include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, environmental triggers, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Chest radiography can rule out concerning infectious, inflammatory, and malignant thoracic conditions. Patients with refractory chronic cough may warrant referral to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist in addition to a trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, and/or speech therapy. In children, cough is considered chronic if present for more than four weeks. In children six to 14 years of age, it is most commonly caused by asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and upper airway cough syndrome. Evaluation should focus initially on these etiologies, with targeted treatment and monitoring for resolution.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zUR3b]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made.

Results

Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some, but not all, aspects of the management of chronic wet cough in specialist settings. However, further studies (particularly in primary health) are required.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113u5sxd]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough algorithm — child aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (daily cough of > 4 weeks duration) begins with "Examine and evaluate" for "Presence of 'specific cough pointers'", "Cough characteristics", chest radiograph, and "Spirometry (if > 3–6 years old†) abnormal?"; then "Evaluate" exposures and concerns and, if "Non-specific cough (dry cough and no cough pointers)", proceed to "Watch, wait, and review". If cough persists, "Discuss options with parents" and choose either a "Watch, wait, and review approach" with "Review in 2 wks Cough resolving?" or initiate "ICS (400 μg/day budesonide equivalent)" and "Review in 2–4 wks Cough resolving?"; if improving on ICS, designate "Asthma or asthma-like" and "Review in 2–4 wks; cease ICS if no other features of asthma; consider 'period effect'", otherwise "Cease ICS" and "Review points 1–2" while reassessing for "Specific cough pointers present?

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116eygE4]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST pediatric chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — recommendations: For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease, we recommend that treatment(s) for GERD should NOT be used when there are no clinical features of gastroesophageal reflux such as recurrent regurgitation, dystonic neck posturing in infants, or heartburn/epigastric pain in older children (Grade 1B). For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease but who have symptoms and signs or tests consistent with gastroesophageal pathological reflux, we recommend that they be treated for GERD in accordance to evidence-based GERD-specific guidelines (Grade 1B). For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease but who have symptoms and signs or tests consistent with gastroesophageal pathological reflux, we recommend that acid suppressive therapy should not be used solely for their chronic cough (Grade 1C). For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) who do not have an underlying lung disease but with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, we suggest that they be treated for GERD in accordance to evidence-based GERD-specific guidelines for 4–8 weeks and their response reevaluated (Ungraded Consensus–based Statement). For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) and without an underlying disease, if GERD is suspected as the cause based on GER symptoms, we suggest following the GERD guidelines for investigating children suspected for GERD (Ungraded Consensus–based Statement). The agent used for the "trial of treatment" approach is dependent on the child's age, feeding regimen, and symptoms; PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists should not be used for longer than 4 to 8 weeks without further evaluation; and in most situations, endoscopy is suggested before pHmetry or pH-MII.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1139hkdW]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to diagnosis of unexplained chronic cough, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to define unexplained chronic cough as a cough that persists > 8 weeks, remains unexplained after investigation, and persists despite supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines in adult patients with chronic cough.

### Should you give kids medicine for coughs and colds? [^114WR9cu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, some cough and cold medicines can have serious side effects, such as slowed breathing, which can be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children. For those reasons, it's important to know when your child needs medication, which treatments are recommended, and when to do without medicine. These days, cold and cough symptoms can be especially worrisome, because they could be symptoms of COVID-19, the flu, or other potentially serious illness. If you are concerned about COVID-19, talk to your child's health care provider. Giving Children Cough and Cold Medicines Over-the-counter medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms. The FDA doesn't recommend OTC medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 because they could cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products to state: "Do not use in children under 4 years of age".

There are no FDA-approved homeopathic products, and homeopathic products sold in the U. S. have not met the FDA's requirements for safety and effectiveness. The FDA is not aware of any proven benefits of these products and urges you not to give homeopathic cough and cold medicine to children younger than 4. In certain instances, children younger than 4 who took these products have experienced serious side effects, some of which required hospitalization, including:

- Seizure, allergic reaction, and difficulty breathing.
- Low blood potassium and low blood sugar, which may result in headache, crankiness, drowsiness, and weakness. These serious side effects occurred soon after children took a homeopathic cough and cold product; however, it is not always possible to know whether a reported side effect was caused by a medicine.
- A fever of 100. 4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in an infant 2 months or younger.
- A fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in children at any age.
- Blue lips.
- Labored breathing, including nostrils widening with each breath; wheezing; fast breathing; the ribs showing with each breath; or shortness of breath.
- Severe headache.
- Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration.
- Excessive crankiness or sleepiness.
- Persistent ear pain.
- If the child is getting worse.

### Cough in children: when does it matter? [^114m8yE5]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a common presenting symptom to paediatricians and paediatric respiratory physicians. The causes of chronic cough in childhood are significantly different from those in adults, and a different approach to diagnosis and management is needed. In most cases cause can be identified or a satisfactory label given. This review will cover the approach to cough in children and cover some specific causes of troublesome cough not discussed elsewhere in this mini-symposium.

GERD and pediatric chronic cough — evidence scope and potential harms: Unlike in adults, GERD is not commonly identified as the cause of pediatric chronic cough, and in children, there is little current convincing evidence that GER is a common cause of isolated chronic cough (ie, without GI-related GERD symptoms); the report also notes that there are a wide array of possible interventions for GERD and some of these may result in more potential harm than benefit (eg, surgery and proton pump inhibitors).

### Clinical pathways for chronic cough in children [^113ngNDA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic cough (a cough lasting longer than four weeks) is a common problem internationally. Chronic cough has associated economic costs and is distressing to the child and to parents; ignoring cough may lead to delayed diagnosis and progression of serious underlying respiratory disease. Clinical guidelines have been shown to lead to efficient and effective patient care and can facilitate clinical decision making. Cough guidelines have been designed to facilitate the management of chronic cough. However, treatment recommendations vary, and specific clinical pathways for the treatment of chronic cough in children are important, as causes of and treatments for cough vary significantly from those in adults. Therefore, systematic evaluation of the use of evidence-based clinical pathways for the management of chronic cough in children would be beneficial for clinical practice and for patient care. Use of a management algorithm can improve clinical outcomes; such management guidelines can be found in the guidelines for cough provided by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of using a clinical pathway in the management of children with chronic cough.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles were searched. The latest search was conducted in January 2014.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of parallel-group design comparing use versus non-use of a clinical pathway for treatment of chronic cough in children (< 18 years of age).

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction in duplicate.

Main Results

One study was included in the review. This multi-centre trial was based in five Australian hospitals and recruited 272 children with chronic cough. Children were randomly assigned to early (two weeks) or delayed (six weeks) referral to respiratory specialists who used a cough management pathway. When an intention-to-treat analysis was performed, clinical failure at six weeks post randomisation (defined as < 75% improvement in cough score, or total resolution for fewer than three consecutive days) was significantly less in the early pathway arm compared with the control arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.58). These results indicate that one additional child will be cured for every five children treated via the cough pathway (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5, 95% CI 3 to 9) at six weeks. Cough-specific parent-reported quality of life scores were significantly better in the early-pathway group; the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.01). Duration of cough post randomisation was significantly shorter in the intervention group (early-pathway arm) compared with the control group (delayed-pathway arm) (MD -2.70 weeks, 95% CI -4.26 to -1.14).

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that using a clinical algorithm for the management of children with chronic cough in hospital outpatient settings is more effective than providing wait-list care. Futher high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to perform ongoing evaluation of cough management pathways in general practitioner and other primary care settings.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^1161vzrb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, comprising a literature review together with expert opinion obtained via an online survey, has highlighted a number of issues relating to the global management of pediatric cough. In particular, while there are numerous regional guidelines for the management of pediatric cough (16 were listed in the survey), there is no established international guideline for acute or chronic pediatric cough.

There is also a lack of consensus as to what defines a pediatric patient in relation to cough. In guidelines, 'pediatric' refers to patients aged up to 12–18 years, and among the international experts, 'pediatric' could refer to patients aged up to 10–21 years. The age of patients is an important consideration in their management as it determines whether pediatric or adult guidelines are used, impacting pediatric-specific issues and risk–benefit ratios. For example, whereas respiratory function tests are standard investigations in adults, data generated from such tests may be unreliable in young children. The optimal management of cough may also vary between babies, toddlers, and older children due to differing cough etiologies with age; a point that is not fully addressed by current guidelines. Furthermore, while all guidelines separated pediatric cough into acute and chronic, there were discrepancies in the duration of cough used to define these terms. Acute cough definitions ranged from < 2–3 weeks in guidelines and from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks among experts; the equivalent definitions for chronic cough were > 4–8 weeks and > 2–8 weeks. Since acute and chronic cough are managed differently, these varying definitions mean that pediatric patients in different regions will receive differing standards of care for cough.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111xzP1t]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — diagnostic testing in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough — states "we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance to the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (Grade 1B.)" and "we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement)".

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Aerodigestive approach to pediatric chronic cough [^117643PU]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined as cough lasting more than 4 weeks in children aged 14 years or older. Normal children, without pathophysiology, can cough up to more than 30 times a day. When cough occurs pathologically, it is often more often and can be divided into specific and nonspecific cough types. Inputs from otolaryngology, pulmonary medicine, and gastroenterology, along with other specialties in an aerodigestive team setting, allow a team approach to consider a wide variety of causes of cough and coordinate diagnostic procedures with treatment.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^115LzTvv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic cough in childhood is common and causes much parental anxiety. Eliciting a diagnosis can be difficult as it is a non-specific symptom indicating airways inflammation and this may be due to a variety of aetiologies. A key part of assessment is obtaining an accurate cough history. It has previously been shown that parental reporting of 'wheeze' is frequently inaccurate. This study aimed to determine whether parental reporting of the quality of a child's cough is likely to be accurate.

Methods

Parents of 48 'new' patients presenting to a respiratory clinic with chronic cough were asked to describe the nature of their child's cough. They were then shown video clips of different types of cough using age-appropriate examples, and their initial report was compared with the types of cough chosen from the video.

Results

In a quarter of cases, the parents chose a video clip of a 'dry' or 'wet' cough having given the opposite description. In a further 20% parents chose examples of both 'dry' and 'wet' coughs despite having used only one descriptor.

Discussion

While the characteristics of a child's cough carry important information that may be helpful in reaching a diagnosis, clinicians should interpret parental reporting of the nature of a child's cough with some caution in that one person's 'dry' cough may very well be another person's 'wet' cough.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^111ZkiFT]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — cough pointers list provides systemic and pulmonary features to guide targeted evaluation. Systemic pointers include cardiac abnormalities, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, medications or drugs associated with chronic cough (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, illicit drug use), neurodevelopmental abnormality, fever, immune deficiency (primary or secondary), feeding difficulties, and history of contacts (eg, tuberculosis). Pulmonary pointers include chest pain, daily moist or productive cough, hemoptysis, abnormal cough characteristics (brassy, plastic bronchitis, paroxysmal with/without posttussive vomiting, staccato, cough from birth), recurrent pneumonia, hypoxia/cyanosis, history of previous lung disease or predisposing causes (eg, neonatal lung disease, foreign body aspiration), exertional dyspnea, dyspnea at rest or tachypnea, chest wall deformity, auscultatory findings (eg, stridor, wheeze, crackles), chest radiograph abnormalities, and pulmonary function test abnormalities.
