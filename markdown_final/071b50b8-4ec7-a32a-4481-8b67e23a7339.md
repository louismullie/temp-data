## Question

aafp guidelines recent strep without symptoms to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether recent streptococcal infection without symptoms warrants treatment to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae, and what the current guidelines say about this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "recent strep without symptoms" means clinically and microbiologically. Then, I should verify which nonsuppurative sequelae we are trying to prevent and how they arise. Next, I will review the most authoritative guidelines (CDC, IDSA, AAP/AAFP-aligned sources) for testing and treatment thresholds. After that, I need to check for any exceptions where asymptomatic carriage or post-infectious states change management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm antibiotic choices and durations where treatment is actually indicated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "recent strep without symptoms" could mean asymptomatic pharyngeal carriage detected on screening, or a documented recent GAS infection that has now resolved without symptoms. Importantly, it does not meet diagnostic criteria for acute GAS pharyngitis, which requires compatible symptoms plus a positive test, and it is not the post-streptococcal immune syndromes like rheumatic fever or Sydenham chorea, which are managed differently [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256].

> I need to check the nonsuppurative sequelae we are trying to prevent: acute rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are the key entities. ARF follows inadequately treated GAS pharyngitis via molecular mimicry and is the principal target of antibiotic therapy during acute infection, whereas APSGN can follow either pharyngeal or skin infection and is not prevented by treating the antecedent infection once established, though timely treatment of GAS may reduce risk if given early in the course [^ff8f2e91] [^30e3549e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I should verify guideline positions on asymptomatic carriage. The CDC explicitly advises against testing patients with clear viral symptoms and does not recommend screening or treating asymptomatic carriers; antibiotics are reserved for patients with confirmed symptomatic GAS pharyngitis, because carriage is common, low risk for complications, and treatment does not reliably eradicate carriage or prevent sequelae [^2d54ac5a] [^ab5578d3]. The IDSA guideline similarly focuses testing and treatment on symptomatic patients with sore throat, using clinical scores to guide who should be tested, and does not endorse treating asymptomatic carriage [^71629256].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about "recent" infection. If there was a documented symptomatic GAS pharyngitis in the prior 9–10 days that was never treated, some clinicians consider treatment to reduce very late complications, but evidence is limited and this is not a standard recommendation; once symptoms have resolved and the window for primary prevention has passed, routine treatment is not advised. By contrast, if the patient now has ARF or Sydenham chorea, that is a different indication entirely and warrants antibiotic therapy plus secondary prophylaxis regardless of current throat culture status [^2d54ac5a] [^d97d3f38].

> I should double-check the exceptions. In special populations or outbreak contexts, public health measures may target carriage to interrupt transmission, but that is not the same as preventing nonsuppurative sequelae in an individual asymptomatic carrier. For example, healthcare personnel epidemiologically linked to transmission may receive chemoprophylaxis to eradicate carriage, and outbreak investigations may include carriage-based interventions, yet these are transmission-control strategies rather than routine care for asymptomatic individuals [^cbf99622] [^fe82f35f].

> Let me consider the bottom line and make sure I'm aligned with the evidence: for a person with recent GAS exposure but no symptoms, routine testing and treatment are not recommended to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae. Management should be symptom-triggered, and antibiotics should be reserved for confirmed symptomatic GAS pharyngitis or for established post-streptococcal immune diseases requiring secondary prophylaxis. If the patient is high risk for ARF (e.g., personal or family history, endemic setting), maintain vigilance for symptoms and treat promptly if they appear, but do not treat asymptomatic carriage [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256] [^d97d3f38].

> But wait, what if the "recent strep" was actually a post-infectious syndrome like Sydenham chorea or established rheumatic heart disease? In those cases, I should confirm that antibiotic therapy is indicated for secondary prevention of future GAS infections to prevent recurrences and progression of carditis, using benzathine penicillin G or oral alternatives if allergic, with duration tailored to cardiac involvement. This is a different question than treating asymptomatic carriage and is supported by pediatric consensus guidelines [^d97d3f38] [^be5729db].

> I will now examine antibiotic choices briefly to ensure completeness when treatment is actually indicated: for symptomatic, confirmed GAS pharyngitis, first-line options include amoxicillin or penicillin V for 10 days, or a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. In penicillin allergy, use a first-generation cephalosporin if non-anaphylactic, or a macrolide or clindamycin if anaphylactic, noting local resistance patterns and FDA cautions about agents like sulfonamides that do not eradicate GAS in the oropharynx [^2d54ac5a] [^c793603a] [^f9d50dbc].

> In summary, I should confirm the key message: recent streptococcal exposure without symptoms does not warrant antibiotics to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae. Reserve treatment for confirmed symptomatic GAS pharyngitis or for post-streptococcal immune diseases requiring secondary prophylaxis, and avoid screening or treating asymptomatic carriage in routine care [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256] [^d97d3f38].

Current AAFP guidance does not recommend **testing or treating asymptomatic streptococcal carriage** to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. Asymptomatic carriage is common, low risk, and not linked to increased sequelae risk; antibiotics do not reliably eradicate carriage and may cause harm. Testing and treatment are reserved for **symptomatic patients** with clinical features of streptococcal pharyngitis, using RADTs with culture backup when indicated [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256]. Routine screening or treatment of asymptomatic individuals is discouraged.

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance of asymptomatic streptococcal carriage

Asymptomatic streptococcal carriage is **common**, especially in children, with reported rates of 5–20% [^7846637f]. Carriage reflects colonization without active infection and is typically transient, resolving without intervention. Importantly, carriage is not associated with an increased risk of nonsuppurative complications such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) [^notfound].

---

## Evidence regarding nonsuppurative sequelae in asymptomatic carriage

Nonsuppurative sequelae, including ARF and PSGN, are immune-mediated complications that occur following symptomatic streptococcal infections, particularly untreated pharyngitis. There is **no evidence** that asymptomatic carriage alone significantly increases the risk of these complications. ARF and PSGN typically follow symptomatic infections, and their occurrence is closely linked to the presence of clinical symptoms and untreated active infection [^ff8f2f91] [^30e3549e].

---

## Current AAFP recommendations

The AAFP aligns with CDC and IDSA guidance: **do not test or treat asymptomatic individuals** for streptococcal carriage. Key recommendations include:

- **Do not test**: Avoid testing asymptomatic individuals for streptococcal carriage.
- **Do not treat**: Do not administer antibiotics to asymptomatic carriers.
- **Treat only symptomatic patients**: Reserve testing and treatment for patients with clinical features of streptococcal pharyngitis (e.g. sudden sore throat, fever, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates) [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256].

---

## Rationale behind AAFP recommendations

The AAFP's stance is based on several **critical considerations**:

- **Low risk of complications**: Asymptomatic carriage does not significantly increase the risk of ARF or PSGN.
- **Ineffectiveness of treatment**: Antibiotics do not reliably eradicate carriage, and treated individuals often remain colonized.
- **Potential harms**: Unnecessary antibiotics can cause adverse effects, contribute to antibiotic resistance, and increase healthcare costs.
- **Lack of evidence**: There is no evidence that treating asymptomatic carriers reduces the incidence of nonsuppurative sequelae.

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic carriage are discouraged, certain **special circumstances** may warrant consideration:

- **Outbreak settings**: In specific outbreak scenarios, public health authorities may recommend targeted interventions, including treatment of carriers, to control transmission.
- **High-risk populations**: In populations with historically high rates of ARF (e.g. certain indigenous communities), public health strategies may differ, though routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic individuals remain unsupported by current evidence.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Current AAFP guidance does not support testing or treating asymptomatic streptococcal carriage to prevent nonsuppurative sequelae. Asymptomatic carriage is common, low risk, and not associated with increased risk of ARF or PSGN. Antibiotics are ineffective at eradicating carriage and may cause harm. Clinicians should focus on **identifying and treating symptomatic patients** with streptococcal pharyngitis while avoiding unnecessary testing and treatment of asymptomatic individuals [^2d54ac5a] [^71629256].

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^2d54ac5a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinical features Acute pharyngitis symptoms It commonly presents with
- Fever
- Pain with swallowing
- Sudden onset of sore throat On clinical examination, patients with group A strep pharyngitis usually have
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever.

Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:

- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis. Instead, these children usually have what is called "streptococcal fever" or "streptococcosis, " which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:

- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups.

Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Positive RADT or culture Healthcare providers can use a positive RADT or throat culture as confirmation of group A strep pharyngitis. Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever.

All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups. Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications. Amoxicillin, oral
- 50 mg/kg once daily for 10 days Alternate: 25 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days Benzathine penicillin G, intramuscular Weight less than 27 kg: 1 dose Weight 27 kg or more: 1 dose. Other options for patients with a penicillin allergy Prescribe one of multiple recommended regimens for patients with a penicillin allergy.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^5bdf56bb]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea — initial antibiotic management is recommended at diagnosis as a precautionary measure in all patients, independently of microbiological confirmation of streptococcal throat infection; evidence for a recent streptococcal infection is usually not available in the majority of patients (85% in total but mainly by serological testing; by positive throat culture for GAS in only 37%). In the absence of penicillin allergy, treatments of choice are a single dose of intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G, or a 10-day course of oral penicillin V or amoxicillin, while oral cephalexin (or other first-generation cephalosporin) or a macrolide may be used with nonimmediate or immediate allergy to penicillin, respectively.

### Clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis [^71629256]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to clinical scoring systems, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a clinical scoring system, such as Centor or McIsaac, to determine which patients with sore throat should be tested for group A streptococcus.

- strongly consider testing high-risk patients even if their clinical scores are low. High-risk patients include those with sore throat who have had household exposure to group A streptococcus, such as living or sleeping in the same indoor shared space as a person diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection, a history of previous rheumatic fever diagnosis, or symptoms or signs suggestive of complicated local or systemic group A streptococcus infection, such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, scarlet fever, and/or toxic shock syndrome

- use a clinical scoring system as part of the evaluation of patients with sore throat. The principal utility of a scoring system is to identify patients with a low probability of group A streptococcus pharyngitis, in whom further evaluation by diagnostic testing is unlikely to be helpful

- given the lack of evidence favoring any particular scoring system, clinicians and patients may favor clinical scoring systems that do not include laboratory tests

- recognize that the recommendation to use a scoring system does not apply to children under 3 years of age, as group A streptococcus infection in this age group may not present with typical clinical features represented in these scoring systems.

ASB — general management and indications for screening/treatment: A recent systematic review concluded that antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) does not appear to improve microbiologic outcomes, morbidity, or mortality, and current evidence indicates that screening/treatment of ASB does not reduce urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, morbidity, or mortality in patients with complicating factors. In a large cohort of hospitalized patients with ASB and no systemic signs of infections, female patients without vital sign abnormalities or leukocytosis had a predicted probability of bacteremia of 2% or less. The only clearly recognized indications for screening/treatment of ASB are 1) pregnant women, and 2) patients undergoing elective urologic surgery, and symptoms such as malodorous and/or cloudy urine, although associated with bacteriuria, do not warrant treatment.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^4be86a7d]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — index patient scope states that the index patient is an otherwise healthy adult female with localized rUTI in the absence of complicating factors. The infection should be associated with acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract and occurs in the presence of both urinary inflammation (pyuria) and detection of a urinary bacterial uropathogen. The guideline does not apply to pregnant women, patients who are immunocompromised, those with anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract, women with rUTIs due to self-catheterization or indwelling catheters, or those exhibiting signs or symptoms of upper UTI or systemic bacteremia, such as fever and flank pain. The guideline also excludes those with neurological disease or illness relevant to the lower urinary tract, including those who exhibit genitourinary sequelae of peripheral neuropathy, diabetes, and spinal cord injury, and it does not discuss prevention of UTI in operative or procedural settings.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^d97d3f38]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea (SC) — antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis: In all children with SC, antibiotic therapy is required to prevent recurrence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and development or progression of rheumatic heart disease, and antibiotic therapy is not expected to shorten the duration of chorea at the first presentation. At SC diagnosis without penicillin allergy, either a single dose of intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G or a 10-d course of oral penicillin V or oral amoxicillin should be given, even without a positive throat culture or cardiac disease. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent future streptococcal infections should be used in all children with SC, with duration guided by cardiac status per cited recommendations: patients with no carditis may stop prophylaxis after 5 y or age 21 (whichever is longer), those with carditis but no residual heart disease should continue for 10 y or age 21, and those with carditis and residual heart disease should continue for 10 y or until 40 y of age (whichever is longer), or may require lifelong prophylaxis. The main aim of long-term prophylaxis is prevention of carditis or worsening heart damage in rheumatic heart disease, and prophylaxis may have a role in prevention of SC relapse. For penicillin allergy, a 10-d course of oral cephalexin (or other 1st generation cephalosporin) is recommended for non-immediate allergy at diagnosis; for immediate allergy an oral macrolide is recommended at diagnosis; for secondary prophylaxis a macrolide is recommended if penicillin allergic, with oral sulfonamides considered if macrolides cannot be used. When selecting long-term antibiotics and route, efficacy, accessibility, acceptance and adherence should be considered, including risk evaluation for intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G in patients with SC with rheumatic heart disease, and practitioners administering intramuscular antibiotics should apply strategies and measures to reduce pain and distress associated with treatments.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^be5729db]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea — long-term antibiotic prophylaxis lists intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G dosed as Children ≤ 30 kg: 600 000 units every 4 weeks and Children > 30 kg, adults: 1 200 000 units every 4 weeks; oral penicillin V Children and adults: 250 mg twice a day; oral macrolides as an alternative if Penicillin allergy, including Erythromycin (ethylsuccinate): 40 mg/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses (max 1 g/day); and oral sulfonamides as an alternative if penicillin and macrolides cannot be used with Sulfadiazine: children ≤ 27 kg: 500 mg once daily and children > 27 kg; adults: 1 g daily. Notes state If intramuscular preparations are chosen, the use of an adjunctive local anesthetic should be considered, Every 3 weeks if the patient experiences GAS infection or RF relapses despite full adherence to a 4-week regimen, or worsening cardiac status risk, For amoxicillin no published data available on the efficacy for secondary prophylaxis, and Patients with breakthrough GAS pharyngitis on penicillin should be treated with an alternative agent such as clindamycin for the acute episode and then restart penicillin prophylaxis (consider switching to a 3-weekly regimen as in Note 2 above).

PANS with clinical pharyngitis — group A streptococcus (GAS) testing and antibiotics: children with sudden and abrupt onset of behavioral symptoms of PANS (almost always OCD) with clinical pharyngitis should receive a diagnostic test for GAS infection — a throat culture, a rapid antigen detection test, or a nucleic acid amplification test; if positive, the child should be treated with appropriate antibiotics for a 10-day course (usually amoxicillin); in the absence of a positive culture, treatment is not recommended even if an antistreptococcal antibody test result is positive; the AAP does not recommend follow-up tests, treatment for longer than 10 days, or prophylaxis if a follow-up test result is positive; only 2 studies in a cited review included a placebo arm, both finding no significant effect from antibiotics.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^bee7b33e]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea (SC) — relationship to infection and diagnostic context: A throat infection (usually a GAS pharyngitis) commonly precedes SC, but the absence of history of a clinical infection does not rule out SC (S: Strong; L: 1–2). An SC diagnosis can be made in a child with chorea even without evidence of a recent or concurrent GAS throat infection (S: Conditional; L: 1–2). In a child with unexplained new onset chorea and without evidence of a recent or concurrent GAS throat infection, the presence of carditis would strongly support a diagnosis of SC (S: Strong; L: 1–2). In populations at moderate to high-risk for ARF, SC is an important cause of new-onset chorea in a child (≤ 18 y) (S: Strong; L: 2). In populations at low-risk for ARF, alternative causes of chorea must be strongly considered in a child with suspected SC, especially in patients with atypical features for SC or absence of evidence of a recent or concurrent GAS infection (S: Strong; L: 2).

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^229a35db]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea (SC) relapse management — assessment and treatment adjustments: In the event of an SC relapse, a repeat clinical assessment and severity scoring is warranted; an alternative etiology should be considered (eg, moyamoya syndrome, benign hereditary chorea, functional disorder), particularly if etiological investigations were incomplete at first diagnosis or in patients with an atypical presentation; antibiotic therapy plus first-line immunotherapy should be considered, but second-line or maintenance immunotherapy is not recommended; relapses should be differentiated from exacerbations associated with pregnancy or with estrogenic or progestmogenic therapies; and when there is evidence of GAS reinfection associated with relapses, a shortening of the benzylpenicillin SAP interval should be considered (eg, moving from 4 weeks to 3 weeks) or a resumption of SAP if it has been stopped.

Prophylaxis:

Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the upper respiratory tract, e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis). Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients.1

The therapeutic dose should be administered for 10 days.

Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever.

### Management of urachal anomalies in children: insights from a retrospective cohort study [^f196a295]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, surgical excision has been part of the standard protocol for management of UA due to the concern for infection and the rare chance of urachal malignancies later in life. However, urachal cancers are very rare, and no evidence exists demonstrating that UAs in pediatric patients increase the likelihood of future malignancy (Arora et al.). Gleason et al. reported that 5721 UAs would need to be excised in order to prevent a single case of urachal adenocarcinoma out of 65 000 patients studied. Surgical excision of UA solely as a preventative measure against later malignancy appears to have minimal support in literature. Thus, non-operative management of symptomatic patients has become the preferred reasonable alternative to surgical treatment in contemporary practice. One study reported that 44 (56.4%) symptomatic patients had resolution of symptoms under observation. Another reported successful resolution of symptoms in 9 out of the 13 total patients. A study by Lipskar et al. even found three patients who had infected cysts recovered successfully with non-operative management of abscess drainage and treatment with antibiotics. When surgery becomes required, recommendations vary as to the ideal age for intervention, ranging from 6 months to 1 years.

However, that does not address the risk of future infections in asymptomatic patients. A study by Ueno et al. was one of the first to recommend non-invasive management for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Zieger et al. posited that likely spontaneous involution of the UA during the first 6 months of life is common, so serial monitoring of UA in infants instead of excision is preferred in infancy. Naiditch et al. recommended non-operative management for asymptomatic UA without developing complications in the face of postoperative complication rate of 15% in 34 of their surgically treated patients, reported lower elsewhere in the literature. One study, while advocating for conservative treatment for asymptomatic UA, also recommends that patients with large cysts who do not achieve clinical or radiological resolution should undergo laparoscopic excision.

In recent years, clinicians have sought to formulate an algorithmic approach to managing UAs. Lipskar et al. suggested such an algorithm predicated on symptom presentation, type of UA, and whether UA resolution was achieved after conservative treatment. Gelikman et al. conducted a meta-analysis to investigate which predictive factors determine the need for surgical management. The analysis failed to identify any predictive factors to guide management of UA in pediatric patients.

### Erythromycin [^e9eb0f16]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis

Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the upper respiratory tract, e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis). Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients.1The therapeutic dose should be administered for ten days.

Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever).1

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin delayed-release capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin delayed-release capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^ce79b248]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Streptococcus is a common bacterium that causes pharyngitis. Timely antibiotic treatment is critically important to prevent severe complications. One of the rarest complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (PGN) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).PGN is a swiftly worsening form of kidney inflammation within the glomeruli, causing a reduction in the kidney's ability to filter waste. This presents with edema, hematuria, and hypertension which leads to kidney failure if not treated promptly.DAH presents with hemoptysis and respiratory distress due to small capillaries bleeding into the alveolar spaces of the lungs. The accumulation of blood impairs gas exchange, leading to rapidly developing respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation.

Together these conditions form PRS, a condition with high rates of morbidity and mortality, requiring urgent medical intervention. Although PRS is more commonly associated with autoimmune disorders, post‐streptococcal PRS is exceedingly rare, highlighting the need for early recognition and treatment. The goal of this case report is to raise awareness of an extremely rare complication of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis: pulmonary‐renal syndrome. This case emphasizes the importance of early antibiotic adherence and guiding providers on the swift diagnosis and management of PRS to improve patient outcomes.

### Polymeric heart valves: addressing global gaps in rheumatic heart disease care? [^1187c58d]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatic heart disease and valvular surgery

In high-income countries, RHD has been nearly eradicated due to improvements in primary care and antibiotic management in the late 20th century. In LMICs, streptococcal pharyngitis often remains undetected or untreated, frequently resulting in progression to RHD in children and adolescents. This is particularly worrisome in poorer populations that are at higher risk for primary infection when living in crowded environments and are less likely to be able to access primary care, afford antibiotics, or get a diagnosis of pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, or RHD. Ultimately, RHD results in the gradual deterioration of heart valves, most commonly affecting the mitral and aortic valves, which may eventually result in heart failure. Valve repair is preferred over replacement due to its superior long-term survival and freedom from reoperation while avoiding the economic cost of the valve prosthesis. However, in LMICs, patients often present at a stage where repair is no longer feasible or recommended. Valve replacement with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves is effective but carries the disadvantages of structural valve deterioration and lifelong anticoagulation, respectively, further placing financial burdens on lower-income populations who often lack health insurance.

### 2025 ESC guidelines for the management of myocarditis and pericarditis [^9e44a149]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to pericardial drainage, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to perform surgical pericardial drainage in patients with pericardial effusion when percutaneous pericardiocentesis is not feasible or in cases of purulent pericardial effusion to ensure complete drainage and prevent constriction.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^4168fea6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

The sulfonamides should not be used for the treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.

CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Early-life serological profiles and the development of natural protective humoral immunity to Streptococcus pyogenes in a high-burden setting [^9be17980]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) is a major global pathogen responsible for 500,000 deaths annually, with the majority due to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) caused by long-term pathological immune sequelae. An effective and equitable S. pyogenes vaccine is a global priority, yet few candidates are currently in clinical development. In addition to preventing invasive infections, an S. pyogenes vaccine needs to prevent throat and skin (pyoderma) infections, and perhaps asymptomatic carriage in children, that lead to pathological immune priming responsible for RHD. Much of the S. pyogenes disease burden, including RHD, is experienced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where skin infections are more common than in high-income countries (HICs).

A recognized scientific barrier to developing an S. pyogenes vaccine is the lack of understanding of naturally occurring immunity, particularly to protect against pharyngitis and pyoderma, which represent endpoints for future vaccine trials. The prevalence of S. pyogenes pharyngitis and pyoderma progressively reduces from childhood to adulthood, suggesting that naturally protective immunity is acquired through repeated exposures. Moreover, pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can promote opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of bacteria in vitro. Together, these findings suggest that naturally occurring humoral immunity to S. pyogenes is one mechanism protecting adults from infection.

S. pyogenes vaccine development has taken two broad approaches. Initial efforts focused on the M protein, a major surface-expressed virulence factor encoded by the emm gene, also used for strain typing. The M protein is immunogenic, with type-specific antibodies shown to protect in animal models and in limited observational human studies –. With over 275 emm types, multivalent M protein vaccines are limited by the high emm /M type diversity in LMICs. An alternative approach focuses on conserved antigens such as the S. pyogenes cell envelope protease (SpyCEP), S. pyogenes adhesion and division protein (SpyAD), Streptolysin O (SLO) and the streptococcal Group A carbohydrate (GAC). Although animal models and genomic analyses demonstrate a promising role for these as vaccine antigens, their contribution to natural protection in humans remains unknown –. With both multivalent M protein and conserved antigen vaccines in development, understanding the evolution of natural immunity to these different antigens in early life and their relative roles in protection remains vital.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

### The economic burden of rheumatic heart disease in the Eastern mediterranean region [^ff8f2e91]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an abnormal immunologic response to group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections arising as a sequela of untreated pharyngitis. It manifests 2–3 weeks after the onset of infection and may have cardiac, neurologic, musculoskeletal or dermatological manifestations. While ARF is common in children aged 5–15 years, it can affect individuals of every age. ARF has a high recurrence rate, particularly in patients left untreated. Severe or recurrent bouts of ARF can result in the development of complications such as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is caused by molecular mimicry. As the streptococcal M-protein bears structural resemblance to cardiac myosin and valvular endothelium, the immune system mistakenly targets cardiac tissues, causing valvular damage and disruption of cardiac function. This may lead to various heart-related issues, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and infective endocarditis. There is no cure for RHD, and treatment is symptomatic. In case there is damage to the heart valves, surgical intervention is carried out to replace or repair the damaged valves.RHD in pregnancy can cause both maternal and fetal complications, with increased risk of preterm delivery, abortions and intrauterine death.RHD is a preventable condition, primarily through the prompt and effective treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics, such as penicillin. Additionally, regular follow-up and treatment by healthcare providers can help manage RHD and reduce its impact on affected individuals.

Current situation of streptococcal infection in Nepali children

A cross-sectional study conducted in 2001 found that 7.2% of children aged between 3 and 10 years had Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis. In a separate study involving 487 throat swabs to assess the rate of asymptomatic throat carriage among schoolchildren, Group A Streptococci were isolated from 9.2% of the samples. By 2013, the prevalence of GABHS in throat swabs in asymptomatic preschool children had decreased to 5%. Furthermore, there was an increase in cases of streptococcal pneumonia and APSGN in Nepal following the 2015 earthquake, affecting both the adult and paediatric populations.

### The impact of antibiotic therapy in psoriasis patients with active streptococcal infection: a prospective study [^d45ef8b8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The association between psoriasis and streptococcal infection has been widely explored in both children and adults. However, the exact impact of Streptococcus pharyngeal infection on the course of psoriasis is not fully comprehended. This study explored the impact of Streptococcus pharyngeal infection on psoriasis and investigated the effectiveness of systemic antibiotic therapy in conjunction with standard topical treatment for psoriatic patients with concomitant streptococcal throat infection. The research involved 115 patients with mild‐to‐moderate psoriasis, clinically assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients with active streptococcal infection were administered adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy along with standard local treatment for psoriasis, while psoriasis patients without evidence of infection received the local topical treatment only. Streptococcal infections were more common in psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls. A group of psoriasis patients with active streptococcal throat infections, treated with antibiotics in addition to standard topical psoriasis therapy, did not show any difference in PASI score reduction compared to those without evidence of active infection. While our study did not show a statistically significant reduction in PASI scores in psoriasis patients with streptococcal throat infections treated with antibiotics, it highlights the complex interaction between infection and psoriasis. Larger studies with longer follow‐up may better clarify this relationship, contributing to stronger evidence for or against the use of antibiotics in managing psoriasis triggered by streptococcal infections.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^4b9afdf3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Further, there were no recommendations highlighted in the palliation domain across the different CPGs. Although AP is often considered a self-limiting condition, patients with severe or necrotising disease may experience a high symptom burden, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity. In such cases, a palliative approach that is focussed on symptom management, quality of life, and supportive care may be needed. For instance, pain management remains a cornerstone of treatment, particularly in patients with persistent abdominal pain despite resolution of the acute episode. In addition to opioids and adjunctive analgesics, multimodal pain relief strategies, including regional anaesthesia and non-pharmacological interventions, should be considered. Nutritional support also plays a role in palliation, especially for patients who develop pancreatic insufficiency or experience recurrent AP episodes that impact their nutritional status. Early enteral feeding is recommended in severe cases, but in patients with long-term complications, dietary modifications and enzyme supplementation may be required to maintain nutritional balance and prevent weight loss. In rare cases where acute pancreatitis progresses to multisystem organ failure, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decision-making may be necessary. For patients with refractory AP or those at high risk of mortality, palliative care services can provide holistic support, addressing not only symptom relief but also psychological and family-centred concerns. While palliation is not a primary focus of AP management, incorporating symptom-based supportive care principles in severe or chronic cases may improve overall patient well-being. Further research is needed to explore the role of palliative care in AP, particularly in patients with recurrent or treatment-resistant disease.

The majority of recommendations exist for in-hospital management or treatment. Despite this, historical shifts in recommendations for fluid resuscitation and antibiotic use offer a compelling case study illustrating guideline variability driven by evolving evidence. One of the most debated areas is early fluid resuscitation. Earlier guidelines often recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent hypoperfusion-related pancreatic necrosis; however, more recent evidence suggests that excessive fluid administration may contribute to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome and increased mortality. As a result, some recent guidelines advocate for a more conservative, goal-directed fluid resuscitation strategy. Similarly, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in AP remains controversial. Initial recommendations favoured broad antibiotic use to prevent infected pancreatic necrosis, but subsequent randomised controlled trials failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit. Consequently, more recent guidelines recommend selective antibiotic use based on clinical deterioration rather than routine prophylaxis. These changes highlight the importance of continuously updating guidelines to reflect the latest evidence, ensuring that recommendations are both safe and effective.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [^f9d50dbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia

Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.4Avoid co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia.

### Cefaclor [^53e2586d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cefaclor is indicated in the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms:

Otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes

Note: β-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains of Haemophilus influenzae should be considered resistant to cefaclor despite apparent in vitro susceptibility of some BLNAR strains.

Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes

Note: β-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains of Haemophilus influenzae should be considered resistant to cefaclor despite apparent in vitro susceptibility of some BLNAR strains.

Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis, caused by Streptococcus pyogenes

Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefaclor is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of cefaclor in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis and cystitis, caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp ., and coagulase-negative staphylococci

Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes

Appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed to determine susceptibility of the causative organism to cefaclor.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefaclor Capsule and other antibacterial drugs, Cefaclor Capsule should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.
Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae.
Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established.

1.2 Pediatric Patients

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]

Acute otitis media (> 6 months of age) caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae
Community-acquired pneumonia (> 6 months of age) due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumonia, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (> 2 years of age) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following:

patients with cystic fibrosis,
patients with nosocomial infections,
patients with known or suspected bacteremia,
patients requiring hospitalization,
elderly or debilitated patients, or
patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness (including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia).

### Iptacopan (Fabhalta) [^353c0b38]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Infections Caused by Encapsulated Bacteria

FABHALTA, a complement inhibitor, increases a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis (caused by any serogroup, including non-groupable strains), and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Life-threatening and fatal infections with encapsulated bacteria have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of FABHALTA treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.

Complete or update vaccination against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of FABHALTA, according to the current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with FABHALTA. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent FABHALTA therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with vaccines against encapsulated bacteria according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer these vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including FABHALTA. The benefits and risks of treatment with FABHALTA, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.

Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious encapsulated bacterial infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of FABHALTA in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated.

FABHALTA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^46cadb9b]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) initial evaluation and differential diagnosis emphasize discussing diagnoses broader than PANS and targeted testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection when indicated. Pediatric health care providers are encouraged to initially discuss the likelihood of a diagnosis that is broader than PANS — including acute-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or other anxiety disorders, tic disorder, Tourette syndrome, Sydenham chorea, or autoimmune encephalitis (AE). A review of symptom longevity is required to assess these possibilities. Initial laboratory workup consists of a diagnostic test for GAS infection (eg, throat culture, a rapid antigen detection test, or a nucleic acid amplification test) when signs of pharyngitis are present. Focal neurologic signs and symptoms and those that indicate the potential for AE require additional evaluation.

### Dalteparin sodium (Fragmin) [^2b22a66e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent FRAGMIN dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least 4 hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors. For patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of FRAGMIN may be more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of FRAGMIN (2,500 units or 5,000 units once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (200 units/kg once daily, 120 units/kg twice daily) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.

Use FRAGMIN with extreme caution in patients who have an increased risk of hemorrhage, such as those with severe uncontrolled hypertension, bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulceration and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal or ophthalmological surgery. FRAGMIN may enhance the risk of bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet defects; severe liver or kidney insufficiency, hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with FRAGMIN.

5.2 EPYSQLI REMS

EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called EPYSQLI REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Notable requirements of the EPYSQLI REMS include the following:

Prescribers must enroll in the REMS.
Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection.
Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials.
Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI.
Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI.
Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense EPYSQLI must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified.
Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection.
Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with EPYSQLI.

Further information is available at www.EPYSQLIREMS.com or 1-866-318-0342.

5.3 Other Infections

Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported.

Eculizumab products block terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria, such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with eculizumab products may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving eculizumab products are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination.

### A narrative review of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis in nepali children [^30e3549e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

APSGN is a significant health problem and one of the leading causes of hospitalisation and outpatient clinic visits among children in Nepal. This high incidence of APSGN is primarily attributed to the prevalence of streptococcal pyoderma and pharyngitis in Nepali children. However, the lack of comprehensive data on APSGN in paediatric populations from various geographical locations (plains, hills, and mountains), diverse clinical severities (severe, mild, and subclinical cases), and different clinical settings (tertiary or peripheral hospitals) complicates the task of accurately determining the actual prevalence of APSGN in Nepal.

Epidemiological data on APSGN in Nepali children were primarily gathered from hospital records at tertiary care facilities. These centres mainly manage severe and complicated cases of APSGN, meaning that milder cases often do not reach these facilities. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding cases that resolve without medical intervention, frequency of subclinical diseases, predominant routes of preceding infections, and specific serotypes of Streptococcus responsible for APSGN in Nepal. Additionally, many health centres in Nepal do not have access to streptococcal serological tests, complement analysis, and kidney biopsy, making it difficult to diagnose APSGN.

This narrative review aimed to analyse hospital-based data on APSGN from different regions of Nepal in order to estimate the epidemiological burden of APSGN in Nepali children. This review also collected information on various clinical manifestations, diagnostic findings, complications, and treatment outcomes of APSGN in different regions. The results of this review can help healthcare professionals manage and understand the different disease patterns among populations in different regions of Nepal.

### Group A Streptococcus | Infection control… [^cbf99622]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations
- Postexposure prophylaxis and work restrictions are not necessary for healthcare personnel who have an exposure to group A Streptococcus.
- For healthcare personnel with known or suspected group A Streptococcusinfection, obtain a sample from the infected site, if possible, for group A Streptococcusand exclude from work until group A Streptococcusinfection is ruled out, or until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy, provided that any draining skin lesions can be adequately contained and covered.
- For draining skin lesions that cannot be adequately contained or covered, exclude from work until the lesions are no longer draining.
- Work restrictions are not necessary for healthcare personnel with known or suspected group A Streptococcuscolonization, unless they are epidemiologically linked to transmission of the organism in the healthcare setting.
- For healthcare personnel with group A Streptococcuscolonization who are epidemiologically linked to transmission of the organism in the healthcare setting:

- Administer chemoprophylaxis in accordance with CDC recommendations AND
- Exclude from work until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy AND
- Obtain a sample from the affected site for group A Streptococcus testing 7 to 10 days after completion of chemoprophylaxis; if positive, repeat administration of chemoprophylaxis and again exclude from work until 24 hours after the start of effective antimicrobial therapy. Background Group A Streptococcus is a bacterium that can cause many different infections, including strep throat, scarlet fever, impetigo, and others. A common cause of pharyngeal, skin, and other soft tissue infections, GAS can also cause severe, life-threatening invasive disease, including pneumonia, streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis.

Healthcare-associated transmission of GAS has been documented from patients to healthcare personnel and from HCP to patients. Prevention of transmission of GAS in healthcare settings involves:

- in addition to using Standard Precautions, placing patients with known or suspected GAS infection in recommended transmission-based precautions according to their clinical manifestations of GAS disease;
- rapidly diagnosing and treating patients with clinical infection; and
- excluding potentially infectious HCP from work. Occupational Transmission There are no recommended actions, such as administering postexposure prophylaxis or work restrictions, after HCP exposure to GAS. Contact or dispersal of respiratory secretions are the major modes of transmission of GAS in healthcare settings. HCP who were GAS carriers have been linked to outbreaks of surgical site, postpartum, and burn wound infections.

In these outbreaks, GAS carriage was documented in the pharynx, the skin, the rectum, and the female genital tract of the colonized HCP. Transmission from patients to HCP has been described, with potential contributing factors including gross contamination of surgical attire during extensive wound debridement, presence of dermatitis, not using gloves when providing wound care, and sharps injury. Although rare, spread of GAS infections may also occur via food. Foodborne outbreaks of pharyngitis have occurred due to improper food handling, and HCP have been linked to foodborne transmission of GAS, causing pharyngitis. Clinical Features GAS infections can have a wide variety of clinical presentations. GAS pharyngitis is fairly common and characterized by sudden-onset sore throat, pain when swallowing, fever, inflamed tonsils, petechiae on the soft or hard palate, and swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck.

### Rifampin [^1913b10f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningococcal Carriers

Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. Rifampin is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection because of the possibility of the rapid emergence of resistant organisms (See WARNINGS).

Rifampin should not be used indiscriminately, and, therefore, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed for establishment of the carrier state and the correct treatment. So that the usefulness of rifampin in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers is preserved, the drug should be used only when the risk of meningococcal disease is high.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of rifampin and other antibacterial drugs, rifampin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Patient demographics are associated with testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^1a8a9b80]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Racial disparities in pediatric healthcare, including in antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), have been reported. Pharyngitis is among the top 3 diagnoses associated with antibiotic prescribing in pediatric outpatients. A rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test to evaluate for Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is the most common diagnostic test administered to children presenting with ARTI symptoms in our institution (unpublished local data). However, there is great variation in GAS testing rates at the levels of clinician, clinic, and clinic type, which can drive differences in antibiotic prescribing. In prior studies, baseline inappropriate pediatric GAS testing rates ranged from 39% to 64% and prescriptions for patients with a negative GAS test ranged from 8% to 59%.

Common reasons to test and treat GAS pharyngitis include reducing symptom duration and severity, preventing local and disseminated infection and complications such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and reducing transmissionHowever, in areas with low rates of ARF, like the United States, overutilization of GAS testing in patients with clear viral symptoms leads to the frequent detection of streptococcal colonization rather than GAS pharyngitis, which, in turn, can lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis.

It is unclear whether racial or other demographic differences exist in diagnostic testing rates for GAS pharyngitis. While the quantity and quality of antibiotic prescribing has been shown to vary according to clinician and patient-level factors, including race, ethnicity, age, sex, rurality of residence, insurance status, and clinician specialty, less is known about factors that influence GAS diagnostic testing. To improve the quality and equity of pediatric care in the outpatient setting, identify targets for future pediatric outpatient antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, we aimed to determine characteristics that influence rapid GAS testing across different clinicians, patients, and clinic types.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^9347ae37]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

C. difficile testing — diagnosis and endoscopy indications emphasize that either the C. difficile toxin B gene (nucleic acid amplification testing [NAAT]) or the C. difficile toxin B protein (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]) is required for diagnosis, that EIAs have low sensitivity while polymerase chain reaction assays have high sensitivity and can detect asymptomatic carriers, and that glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen assays must be combined with a second confirmatory test for stool C. difficile toxin B; based on stated criteria, guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection support using a NAAT alone or a multiple-step algorithm (e.g. GDH plus toxin B assay) versus an EIA alone for C. difficile testing. Endoscopy generally should be reserved when stool culture, microscopy, C. difficile toxin B assay, and blood culture fail to reveal an etiology or when treatment for an established diagnosis fails, and endoscopy with biopsy may be required for diagnosing etiologies such as cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, cytomegalovirus, or MAC gastroenteritis and noninfectious causes of GI symptoms. Clinicians should remain alert to sexually transmitted infections; in patients with relevant exposures and symptoms of proctitis or proctocolitis, diagnostic evaluation and treatment for STIs should be recommended.

### Prevention of osteoradionecrosis in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiation therapy [^fcc7a83e]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

ORN is a morbid and costly complication of RT in patients with HNC. Apart from other social costs, a conservative estimate of the cost of the management of ORN is reported from US$4000 to US$35000 with some estimates up to US$74000 per patient. There is presently a paucity of European data on the therapeutic and societal costs of ORN. Studies have reported that pre‐ and post‐RT oral health management and care can reduce the costs associated with ORN treatment.,

Appropriate oral health care requires multidisciplinary integration within the patient pathway to minimize oral symptoms and sequelae before, during, and after RT and should be considered an integral aspect of care for every patient with HNC. High‐quality, targeted, and comprehensive oral health treatment protocols should be followed pre‐ and post‐RT to reduce oral complications such as ORN. Oral health care requires multidisciplinary integration to minimize oral symptoms and sequelae before, during, and after RT and must be an accepted aspect of care for patient with HNC.,

Multiple guidelines from various professional organizations have been developed for oral health care of patients with HNC, who undergo RT. Despite these guidelines, there remains ambiguity related to extraction of all teeth with poor prognosis, the minimum period between timing of tooth extraction and start of RT, prophylactic antibiotics for post‐RT dental extractions and oral health care.,

The aim of this research is to build on existing professional organization guidelines by determining international consensus from health professionals involved in the care of patients with HNC regarding the prevention and management of ORN. Unique to this work is our direct inclusion of the views of patients and carers in our findings.

### Erythromycin (erythromycin ethylsuccinate) [^21697b7d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension may be administered without regard to meals.

Children:

Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. In mild to moderate infections, the usual dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate for children is 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 hours. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

The following dosage schedule is suggested for mild to moderate infections:

Adults:

400 mg erythromycin ethylsuccinate every 6 hours is the usual dose. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

For adult dosage calculation, use a ratio of 400 mg of erythromycin activity as the ethylsuccinate to 250 mg of erythromycin activity as the stearate, base or estolate.

In the treatment of streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be administered for at least 10 days. In continuous prophylaxis against recurrences of streptococcal infections in persons with a history of rheumatic heart disease, the usual dosage is 400 mg twice a day.

For treatment of urethritis due to C. trachomatis or U. urealyticum: 800 mg three times a day for 7 days.

For treatment of primary syphilis: Adults: 48 g to 64 g given in divided doses over a period of 10 days to 15 days.

For intestinal amebiasis: Adults: 400 mg four times daily for 10 days to 14 days. Children: 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 10 days to 14 days.

For use in pertussis: Although optimal dosage and duration have not been established, doses of erythromycin utilized in reported clinical studies were 40 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day, given in divided doses for 5 days to 14 days.

For treatment of Legionnaires' Disease: Although optimal doses have not been established, doses utilized in reported clinical data were 1.6 g to 4 g daily in divided doses.

### Eculizumab-aagh (Epysqli) [^3384fb84]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Meningococcal Infections

Eculizumab products, complement inhibitors, increase a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of EPYSQLI treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection.

Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y, and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of EPYSQLI, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations, considering the duration of therapy with EPYSQLI. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent EPYSQLI therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including eculizumab products. The benefits and risks of treatment with EPYSQLI, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis.

Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination.

Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life- threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of EPYSQLI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated.

EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Are we playing It fast and loose with the serofast? [^7aca1140]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Four infants (one singleton and a set of triplets) born to mothers with serofast reactive plasma reagin at 1:4 to 1:8 were found to have congenital syphilis. Each mother had a history of receiving appropriate treatment for their syphilis stage at the time of diagnosis with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly weekly 3 times. Both exhibited a 4-fold decrease in their reactive plasma reagin titer. The singleton was asymptomatic but found to have long bone radiographic evidence for congenital syphilis. Of the triplets, one had laboratory abnormalities and a rash, while all 3 triplets had radiographic findings of congenital syphilis. All were treated with 10–14 days of intravenous penicillin G according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines. These cases highlight that infants may be at risk for congenital syphilis, despite being classified as "congenital syphilis unlikely" according to current syphilis practice guidelines. A thorough maternal history and complete infant physical evaluation at birth is recommended for all neonates born to mothers diagnosed with and treated for syphilis. Close follow-up with repeat nontreponemal titers, as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, is recommended.

In both studies, patients were vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), either within 2 years prior to Day 1 or within 2 weeks after starting treatment with EMPAVELI. Patients vaccinated after initiation of treatment with EMPAVELI received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In addition, prophylactic antibiotic therapy was administered at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with local treatment guidelines for patients with PNH receiving treatment with a complement inhibitor.

A dose of 1,080 mg twice weekly was used for patients randomized to the EMPAVELI group of each study. If required, the dose of EMPAVELI could be adjusted to 1,080 mg every 3 days. EMPAVELI was administered as a subcutaneous infusion; the infusion time was approximately 20 to 40 minutes.

### A striking increase in carriage among young children in Iceland paralleled the unprecedented increase of invasive group A streptococcal infection from 2022 to 2023 [^9daea882]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

An unprecedented increase in pediatric invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections was observed in most countries, including Iceland, in early 2023. The reasons for this rise are largely unknown. The aim of the study was to describe the parallel between nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of group A streptococcal (GAS) in Icelandic children and the incidence of invasive disease.

Methods

Electronic health records were used to identify children admitted to the Children's Hospital, Iceland, with iGAS. NP samples from asymptomatic children were collected for culture in February and March 2023 in 15 day-care centers in the greater Reykjavik area. Invasive and noninvasive isolates were characterized using whole genome sequencing. The results of the NP carriage were compared with data from 2009 to 2020.

Results

Twenty-one children were diagnosed with iGAS from December 2022 to April 2023. Empyema, necrotizing fasciitis and septic or toxic shock were the most common clinical presentations. All the children were hospitalized; none died, but 9 needed intensive care. Pediatric iGAS infections increased 8-fold from a mean of 2.0/100.000 for 1975 to 2022 to 16.5/100.000 in early 2023. Asymptomatic NP GAS carriage among healthy children increased 3.5-fold from 8.0% from 2009 to 2020 to 28.5% in early 2023. Close genetic relatedness was found between carriage and invasive strains.

Conclusions

The significant rise of NP GAS carriage observed in early 2023 likely contributed to the simultaneous increased incidence of iGAS. With surveillance data, microbiological culture and molecular typing, genetic similarities between invasive disease isolates and NP isolates characteristics were confirmed.

### Early-life serological profiles and the development of natural protective humoral immunity to Streptococcus pyogenes in a high-burden setting [^122d6a97]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes leads to 500,000 deaths annually, many due to rheumatic heart disease in low-income settings. Limited understanding of natural protective immunity to S. pyogenes hinders vaccine development. Here we describe the evolution of serological profiles to conserved vaccine antigens and serotype-specific M proteins from birth and throughout the life course in The Gambia. As placentally transferred IgG waned after birth, serological evidence of new exposure was seen in 23% of infants during the first year of life. After culture-confirmed S. pyogenes events, the highest IgG increases occurred in children younger than 2years of age after both pharyngeal and skin disease and asymptomatic carriage at both sites. Higher IgG levels against conserved vaccine antigens correlated with functional activity and were associated with protection from culture-confirmed events after adjustment for age and anti-M protein IgG levels. To our knowledge, our data provide the first evidence of protection associated with humoral immunity to conserved vaccine candidate antigens in humans.

Wilson disease (WD) — management of asymptomatic patients: Asymptomatic patients require treatment; however, urgency for starting treatment is greater if there is any evidence of organ damage due to either inflammation or structural damage. Treatment with a chelating agent, such as D-penicillamine or trientine, or with zinc effectively prevents disease progression and symptomatic disease. The starting dose of medication may be the same as for maintenance dosing. Individualization is important in children who are less than 3 years-old, and zinc appears preferable for these very young asymptomatic children, but there is no consensus as to whether treatment should be started without evidence of organ damage because of possible adverse effects of treatment on development.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^795197ca]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.

Use enoxaparin sodium with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.

Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported. Some of these cases have been fatal.

Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with enoxaparin sodium. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.

5.2	Increased Risk of Bleeding following Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization Procedures

To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non–Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between enoxaparin sodium doses. It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium. If the treatment with enoxaparin sodium is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3	Increased Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Concomitant Medical Conditions

Enoxaparin sodium should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.

Psoriasis represents an immunologic reaction involving antigen‐activated T lymphocytes with subsequent cytokine release in the context of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Streptococcal pharyngeal infection is one of the environmental triggers that has been linked to the onset of guttate psoriasis and flares of plaque psoriasis. This phenomenon involves superantigens, including M proteins of beta‐hemolytic Streptococci groups A, C, and G, as well as pyogenic toxins, which cause T‐cell activation through molecular mimicry of keratin proteins. The subsequent epidermal stimulation results in hyperplasia and clinically recognizable psoriatic eruptions.

A limited number of studies have also reported an association between psoriasis and anogenital dermatitis. Anogenital dermatitis comprises several distinct conditions, most of which are characterized by erythema, edema, pruritus, and/or pain of the genitalia, perineum, perianal area, intergluteal cleft, and/or inguinal crease, which may be associated with constipation, fissures, and/or rectal bleeding. Mainly group A β‐hemolytic Streptococcus and, in one case, group B Streptococcus have been isolated in cultures of anogenital dermatitis. Limited case reports and series have reported on 7 adult and 17 pediatric patients with psoriasis and associated perianal or vulvovaginal group A β‐hemolytic and group B streptococcal dermatitis. Of note, improvement of psoriasis severity after treatment of the perianal infection has been suggested. Because identifying and treating the infection has been suggested to limit the severity and extent of the associated psoriasis, we studied a cohort of pediatric patients with concomitant psoriasis or psoriasiform dermatitis and a suspected anogenital or pharyngeal bacterial infection to identify key clinical characteristics, analyze management, and evaluate outcomes of both psoriasis and the positive culture results in this population.

### Enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) [^4f43ab9b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.

Use Lovenox with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.

Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported. Some of these cases have been fatal.

Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Lovenox. An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.

5.2	Increased Risk of Bleeding following Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization Procedures

To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non–Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox doses. It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI. In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately. If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous Lovenox. If the treatment with Lovenox is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal. The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3	Increased Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Concomitant Medical Conditions

Lovenox should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.

### Clinical considerations for group A Streptococcus… [^ab5578d3]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Streptococcus pyogenesare also called group A Streptococcus.
- Group A strep bacteria can cause both noninvasive and invasive disease.
- They can also cause long-term sequelae.
- The bacteria are contagious and usually spread via respiratory droplets.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A strep infection. Guiding principles Etiology S. pyogenes are gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. They exhibit β-hemolysis when grown on blood agar plates. They belong to group A in the Lancefield classification system for β-hemolytic Streptococcus, and thus are called group A streptococci. Cause infections and immune-mediated sequelae Learn about clinical features, complications, diagnosis, and treatment options for the following conditions related to group A strep bacteria. Noninvasive diseases Invasive diseases Immune-mediated sequelae.

Transmission Transmission is most often direct person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets. It can also occur through contact with secretions from an infected person. Although rare, spread of group A strep bacteria may also occur via food. Environmental transmission via surfaces and fomites may be possible. However, it's likely a less common route of transmission. How they don't spread There's no evidence pets can transmit the bacteria to humans, the primary reservoir for group A strep bacteria. Prevention Prevention activities vary by condition, but generally focus on three important goals:

- Limit exposure and spread of bacteria
- Treat group A strep infections
- Use preventive antibiotics when appropriate Surveillance and trends CDC tracks invasive group A strep disease. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is the only nationally notifiable disease caused by group A strep bacteria.

### Lipid-lowering therapy use when indicated and subsequent ischemic stroke severity [^06c373b9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the substantial body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of LLT use in at‐risk patients to prevent ASCVD including stroke, LLT was underused prestroke among those eligible in our study. A lack of previous ASCVD events among patients who were LENP may reflect clinicians' biases to prescribe LLT, patients' perception about the risk:benefit ratio, or that prescribing physicians had not yet adopted the contemporaneous guidelines to prescribe LLT regardless of LDL‐C level. Our finding of lower stroke severity among eligible individuals prescribed with LLT prestroke may provide additional impetus to clinicians and patients to consider LLT initiation. The development of neurologic symptoms poststroke is a significant concern to the US population. A recent survey of > 1000 Medicare subscribers reported loss of physical mobility (84%) to be one of their greatest fears, only second to cognitive decline (86%), both prominent sequelae of AIS. Our results support adherence to the American College of Cardiology/AHA cholesterol guidelines of LLT initiation when eligible to reduce morbidity. Furthermore, as a consequence of milder symptoms, LLT use prestroke among those eligible may also minimize health care, societal, and individual costs. Our results support the efficacy of LLT in reducing severe disability following AIS. The potential health care burden of severe stroke irrespective of a potential low rate of occurrence warrants LLT be prescribed when indicated, even in a stroke‐naïve population.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Household molecular epidemiology of Streptococcus pyogenes carriage and infection in the Gambia [^7b61c9d8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Africa experiences a high burden of Streptococcus pyogenes disease but has limited epidemiological data. We characterized emm-types and emm-clusters associated with carriage and disease in The Gambia, a setting with high rheumatic heart disease burden.

Methods

A one-year household cohort study (2021–2022) recruited 442 participants from 44 households to assess S pyogenes carriage and non-invasive infection. Pharyngeal and skin swabs were collected to detect carriage, pharyngitis and pyoderma swabs were taken tp assess infection. Cultured isolates underwent emm-typing and were compared with previous collection from the same region.

Results

221 cultured isolates showed 52 different emm-types and 16 emm-clusters. Strain diversity was high (Simpson's reciprocal index 29.3, 95% CI: 24.8–36.0), with highest diversity seen in pyoderma and lowest in pharyngitis. Based on available cross-opsonisation data, the 30-valent M-protein vaccine candidate would cover 50.3% of the isolates but cross-opsonisation data are unknown for 38.5% of them. emm-clusters showed lower diversity and were stable over time, with 4 clusters defining 65.2% of the isolates. 68% of isolates were collected from skin sites (carriage and pyoderma), with evidence of skin-to-throat transmission in the same host.

Conclusion

This study provides a unique molecular analysis of skin and throat isolates prospectively collected from carriage and non-invasive infection in Africa. Despite high strain diversity, 4 clusters gathered two-thirds of the isolates, representing antigen priorities for broad vaccine coverage. In this rheumatic fever-endemic setting, pyoderma and skin carriage represent an important S pyogenes reservoir and should be included in further surveillance studies and public health interventions.

BOXED WARNING

WARNING: DO NOT DISCONTINUE ABRUPTLY Abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen, regardless of the cause, has resulted in sequelae that include high fever, altered mental status, exaggerated rebound spasticity, and muscle rigidity, that in rare cases has advanced to rhabdomyolysis, multiple organ-system failure and death. Prevention of abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen requires careful attention to programming and monitoring of the infusion system, refill scheduling and procedures, and pump alarms. Patients and caregivers should be advised of the importance of keeping scheduled refill visits and should be educated on the early symptoms of baclofen withdrawal. Special attention should be given to patients at apparent risk (e.g., spinal cord injuries at T-6 or above, communication difficulties, history of withdrawal symptoms from oral or intrathecal baclofen). Consult the technical manual of the implantable infusion system for additional post-implant clinician and patient information [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Azithromycin dihydrate [^c98a5a8f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

Resistance

Azithromycin demonstrates cross resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSBphenotype).

Antimicrobial Activity

Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Haemophilus ducreyi
Haemophilus influenzae
Moraxella catarrhalis
Neisseria gonorrhoeae

Other Bacteria

Chlamydophila pneumoniae
Chlamydia trachomatis
Mycoplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-Positive Bacteria

Beta-hemolytic streptococci (Groups C, F, G)
Viridans group streptococci

Gram-Negative Bacteria

Bordetella pertussis
Legionella pneumophila

Anaerobic Bacteria

Prevotella bivia
Peptostreptococcus species

Other Bacteria

Ureaplasma urealyticum

### Electrophysiological monitoring of asymptomatic transthyretin mutation carriers [^13bdb9ef]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an inherited genetic disorder characterized by an autosomal dominant mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. This mutation leads to the formation of amyloid deposits in tissues, predominantly affecting the heart and peripheral nerves. These manifestations often result in severe disability and a survival of approximately 10 years from time of symptom onset. Treatment options, including liver transplantation and drugs limiting amyloidosis, have provided stabilization for patients. However, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to minimize functional disability.

With available treatments, there is a growing interest in screening asymptomatic individuals carrying the TTR mutation within families diagnosed with FAP. It is imperative to monitor asymptomatic carriers to detect the disease onset at the earliest possible stage. Currently, there are no generally‐accepted guidelines for the monitoring of asymptomatic carriers, although it is acknowledged that such surveillance is crucial, especially in the decade leading up to the age of the youngest known case of FAP within the family. Late diagnosis increases the risk of disease‐related complications, while starting a treatment as soon as the mutation is detected, before symptoms appear, exposes carriers to potentially long‐term effects of drugs with unknown outcomes. For instance, recent drugs inhibit hepatic synthesis of TTR or pre‐albumin, a protein involved in transporting thyroid hormones and vitamin A. While the absence of pre‐albumin is well tolerated over a few years, long‐term effects over several decades remain unknown.

The factors that can predict the transition from the asymptomatic to the symptomatic form of the disease have not been conclusively identified. The follow‐up protocol for asymptomatic carriers is not standardized, and there is a lack of clarity regarding the nature and frequency of electrophysiological examinations. The objective of this study was to analyze changes in electrophysiological parameters during the follow‐up of asymptomatic TTR mutation carriers and to detect the biomarker most sensitive to change over time.

Guidelines regarding best practices for DDH screening and treatment based on current evidence and expertise have been published by both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). These guidelines may not be relevant to certain countries where screening, imaging, clinical expertise, resource availability, and treatment methods differ. Toward the goal of standardizing diagnosis and management decisions concerning DDH, it will be important to understand the existing variability between healthcare practitioners in Sri Lanka. By gaining a thorough understanding of the current screening, imaging, referral, and treatment practices in place, guidelines to best help patients affected by DDH in Sri Lanka can be developed.

### Cefprozil [^c080a4f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Small amounts of cefprozil (< 0.3% of dose) have been detected in human milk following administration of a single 1 gram dose to lactating women. The average levels over 24 hours ranged from 0.25 to 3.3 mcg/mL. Caution should be exercised when cefprozil is administered to a nursing woman, since the effect of cefprozil on nursing infants is unknown.

Pediatric Use

(See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of otitis media have been established in the age groups 6 months to 12 years. Use of cefprozil for the treatment of otitis media is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in pediatric patients. (See CLINICAL STUDIES .)

The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis or uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections have been established in the age groups 2 to 12 years. Use of cefprozil for the treatment of these infections is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in pediatric patients.

The safety and effectiveness of cefprozil in the treatment of acute sinusitis have been established in the age groups 6 months to 12 years. Use of cefprozil in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefprozil in adults.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established for the treatment of otitis media or acute sinusitis, or below the age of 2 years for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis or uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. However, accumulation of other cephalosporin antibiotics in newborn infants (resulting from prolonged drug half-life in this age group) has been reported.

### Natural carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with increased experimental pneumococcal carriage but reduced conjugate vaccine efficacy in a human challenge model [^19eba260]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In Malawi, the national 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) demonstrated less herd immunity than in the United States, likely due to higher natural pneumococcal carriage rates. We assessed PCV13 efficacy against experimental pneumococcal carriage in healthy Malawian adults. We explored how natural carriage (pneumococcal carriage of any serotype apart from 6B) influenced experimental carriage rates and vaccine efficacy.

Methods

Healthy adults aged 18 to 40 years were randomly assigned to PCV13 (n = 98) or saline (n = 106), followed by intranasal SPN 6B inoculation at 20 000 (n = 40), 80 000 (n = 74), or 160 000 (n = 90) colony-forming units/100 µL at 28 days postvaccination. We evaluated natural and experimental pneumococcal carriage before and after vaccination on days 2, 7, and 14 postinoculation using culture and multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the lytA/cpsA genes, and we compared carriage rates by vaccination status.

Results

Of 204 participants, 19.6% (n = 40) exhibited experimental carriage detected by culture and 25.5% (n = 52) by qPCR. Vaccinated individuals had lower experimental carriage rates (10.2%, n = 10/98) than the placebo group (28.3%, 30/106). This difference in vaccine efficacy was more pronounced in participants without natural carriage (PCV13, 8%, 6/75; placebo, 25.9%, 21/81) vs those with natural carriage (PCV13, 14.8%, 4/27; placebo, 26.5%, 9/34). According to a log-binomial model, vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 62%, whether assessed by culture or qPCR. Natural carriers had lower VE (52%) vs participants with no natural carriage (69%).

Conclusions

We have shown that the PCV13 VE estimate (62%) is robust whether carriage is assessed by culture or qPCR. PCV13 had lower VE in natural carriers when compared with those without natural carriage at the inoculation visit.

### Metronidazole [^935d2a92]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

### Colistimethate (coly-mycin) [^ff8b472c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory arrest has been reported following intramuscular administration of colistimethate sodium. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of apnea and neuromuscular blockade following administration of colistimethate sodium. Therefore, it is important to follow recommended dosing guidelines. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for use in renal impairment.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Coly-Mycin M Parenteral, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Intracutaneous amyloid deposition is associated with nerve conduction studies deterioration in presumed asymptomatic pathogenic variant TTR carriers [^04f74dbb]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv amyloidosis) is an autosomal dominant disease leading to the deposition of misfolded amyloidogenic transthyretin in tissues, causing organ dysfunction, affecting principally the heart and peripheral nerves.

Recent years have seen major advances in therapy, with the development of multiple disease‐modifying treatments, based on tetramer stabilization or silencing, already available, and future technologies, such as gene editing or depleting antibodies, considered promising. Early treatment is crucial to prevent irreversible extensive axonal damage, but treatment is currently indicated only for symptomatic patients. There are no guidelines for asymptomatic carriers of causal mutations. Asymptomatic carriers should therefore be screened regularly, to prevent unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment. However, it can be challenging to define disease onset because the initial manifestations may be purely subjective and not confirmed by standard explorations. The underlying mutation and age at disease onset in the proband have been shown to be linked to disease onset in carriers, leading to development of the concept of "predicted age at disease onset" (PADO), which is useful for guiding the initiation of follow‐up. Recommendations concerning the nature and frequency of monitoring in asymptomatic carriers have also been proposed.

Our recent studies on presumed asymptomatic pathogenic TTR carriers (PA‐ATTRc‐C) have shown that exhaustive searches for disease activity can lead to earlier disease detection. We analyzed 130 TTR gene mutation carriers with normal nerve conduction study (NCS) results. We found that clinical abnormalities appeared late in disease progression, constituting "the tip of the iceberg". This finding suggests that the clinically vague notion of a transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic status may not be the best marker for decisions about treatment initiation, encouraging the search for alternative signs of disease onset. In this previous study, we classified carriers into four groups: those with overt disease; those with asymptomatic ATTRv amyloidosis; those with isolated abnormalities of unclear significance — borderline cases intermediate between asymptomatic carriers and overtly symptomatic individuals — and a group with entirely normal findings. We extended the follow‐up of these populations, excluding individuals with overt symptomatic disease, to determine whether specific abnormalities could predict progression to overt disease. Particular attention was paid to carriers with confirmed amyloid deposits, with the aim of identifying risk factors for disease progression and exploring the potential for preemptive treatment.

We used nerve conduction studies to define disease onset, as NCS is an objective, non‐invasive, and sensitive marker of neurological disease progression in the large nerve fibers of presumed asymptomatic pathogenic variant TTR carriers.

Hepatitis C virus–associated B-cell lymphomas — evidence and treatment approach are outlined. Large population-based or multicenter case-control studies have demonstrated a strong association between seropositivity for HCV and development of B-cell lymphomas, and the prevalence of HCV seropositivity was consistently increased among patients with DLBCL and MZL. Several published reports suggested that treatment with antivirals led to regression of lymphoma in people with HCV infection, and in indolent B-cell lymphomas not requiring immediate chemoimmunotherapy, initial treatment with interferon (with or without ribavirin) appeared to induce lymphoma regression. Direct-acting antiviral agents administered with pegylated interferon and ribavirin have shown significantly higher rates of sustained virologic response than standard therapy alone in chronic carriers of HCV genotype 1; telaprevir and boceprevir are DAA that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, and the AASLD recommended that DAA be incorporated into standard antiviral therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1. The Panel recommends initial antiviral therapy in asymptomatic patients with HCV-positive low-grade B-cell lymphomas; for those with HCV genotype 1, triple antiviral therapy with inclusion of DAAs should be considered as per AASLD guidelines. Patients with HCV-positive aggressive B-cell lymphomas should initially be treated with appropriate chemoimmunotherapy regimens according to the NCCN Guidelines for B-Cell Lymphomas, and the incidence of hepatotoxicity with chemoimmunotherapy was higher among people with HCV infection.
