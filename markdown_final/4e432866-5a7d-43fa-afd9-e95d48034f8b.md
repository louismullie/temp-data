## Question

Should a muscle relaxer be used post abdominoplasty?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether muscle relaxants should be used after abdominoplasty for postoperative pain control. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and typical pain generators after abdominoplasty. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about skeletal muscle relaxants for acute postoperative pain. Next, I will check whether any abdominoplasty-specific trials or protocols support their use. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits against risks, including sedation, respiratory effects, and interactions with opioids. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, evidence-based recommendation and outline safer alternatives that align with multimodal, opioid-sparing care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Abdominoplasty produces substantial acute pain driven by a long transverse incision, extensive undermining, and often rectus plication, with pain peaking in the first 24–72 hours. This is precisely why abdominoplasty is frequently used as a validated acute pain model in trials, underscoring the intensity and time course we need to treat [^111QnvAh] [^114K3QZk].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology so I don't conflate perioperative neuromuscular blockade with postoperative skeletal muscle relaxants. The intraoperative "muscle relaxants" (e.g., rocuronium) are neuromuscular blocking agents used to facilitate intubation and surgical exposure; they are reversed prior to extubation and are not continued postoperatively for analgesia, whereas the question here is about oral skeletal muscle relaxants like methocarbamol or cyclobenzaprine for postoperative pain and spasm [^115fEN7E] [^114Tu1Y7].

> Next, I should review direct evidence for skeletal muscle relaxants in acute postoperative pain. Hold on, I should double-check guideline strength. The AAOS/METRC guideline concludes there is no significant difference in pain intensity or opioid consumption between oral muscle relaxants and placebo after musculoskeletal extremity/pelvis surgery, with a moderate-strength recommendation against routine use for postoperative pain, which is the closest high-quality guideline signal we have for acute surgical pain contexts [^116bofs2]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing; still, the absence of benefit and the burden of adverse effects are consistent across studies informing that recommendation [^116bofs2].

> I will now examine whether any abdominoplasty-specific trials or protocols support postoperative skeletal muscle relaxants. Let me check the abdominoplasty pain literature and perioperative protocols. Contemporary abdominoplasty trials and reviews emphasize multimodal analgesia with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, regional techniques, and adjuncts like ketamine or gabapentinoids; muscle relaxants are not highlighted as effective postoperative analgesics in these pathways, and when mentioned, it is as part of institutional routines rather than as evidence-based therapy for pain reduction [^111fybqF] [^116FDZQg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought one of the abdominoplasty ketamine trials might have included a muscle relaxant arm, but on review, those studies focused on ketamine with or without magnesium and did not evaluate skeletal muscle relaxants for analgesia, so I should not ascribe benefits from those studies to muscle relaxants [^114zZ3Gk] [^114is6VR].

> Let me consider potential benefits and risks so I don't jump to conclusions. Potential benefits are largely theoretical — reduction of reflex muscle spasm around the plication site — but I should confirm whether any trials demonstrate improved pain scores or opioid sparing; I find no abdominoplasty-specific randomized data showing benefit, whereas the risks are concrete: CNS depression, dizziness, somnolence, and dangerous respiratory depression when combined with opioids, which is particularly concerning in the early postoperative period after abdominoplasty when patients already have incisional pain and reduced inspiratory effort [^114Tu1Y7] [^111nb5yE]. Hold on, I should verify the interaction risk signal; coprescribing of opioids with sedatives, including skeletal muscle relaxants, is associated with increased opioid refills and overdose risk, reinforcing caution even beyond single-center anecdotal practice [^1177mYTz].

> I need to ensure alignment with broader postoperative pain principles. Modern guidance emphasizes multimodal, opioid-sparing strategies, individualized assessment, and avoidance of sedative co-medications that impair recovery; muscle relaxants as a class add sedation without proven analgesic benefit in this setting, which conflicts with these goals [^1133qxSq] [^112GcnM3] [^1177mYTz]. But wait, what if the pain is purely muscular spasm? Even then, the balance of evidence does not support routine skeletal muscle relaxants for acute postoperative pain, and safer, evidence-based alternatives exist [^116bofs2].

> Next, I should review better-supported alternatives specific to abdominoplasty. Let me verify the strength of regional anesthesia data. TAP blocks consistently reduce 24–48 hour opioid consumption and improve early recovery metrics, and quadratus lumborum blocks further reduce pain and opioid use while improving quality of recovery; these are reasonable first-line regional options unless contraindicated [^116FDZQg] [^116ajpsY]. I should also confirm the role of scheduled nonopioids; NSAIDs and acetaminophen are foundational, and perioperative celecoxib reduces pain and opioid requirements after major plastic surgery, aligning with multimodal protocols [^116M6sUC] [^111fybqF]. For select patients, low-dose ketamine infusions can provide opioid-sparing effects without the respiratory depression seen with sedatives, though dosing must be conservative to minimize psychomimetic effects [^114zZ3Gk] [^114is6VR]. Finally, I need to check local strategies; bupivacaine/meloxicam extended-release solution has abdominoplasty-specific data showing sustained analgesia and reduced opioid consumption over 72 hours, and local anesthetic delivery systems (e.g., pain pumps or field blocks) have supportive, though lower-level, evidence for opioid reduction and earlier mobilization [^113PkPUH] [^116RBT68] [^1142cbdK].

> Hold on, I should verify that any exception would be justified. If a patient develops pathologic muscle spasm or a documented myofascial pain syndrome contributing to pain, a short, closely monitored trial of a skeletal muscle relaxant could be considered case-by-case, but this is off-label for postoperative abdominoplasty pain and should be the exception, not the rule, given adverse effect profiles and lack of supporting evidence [^111nb5yE] [^114Tu1Y7].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Routine use of skeletal muscle relaxants after abdominoplasty is not supported by evidence and conflicts with contemporary multimodal, opioid-sparing principles. They add sedation and respiratory risk without proven analgesic benefit in this surgical context, so they should generally be avoided in favor of regional techniques, scheduled NSAIDs/acetaminophen, selective perioperative celecoxib, and adjuncts like low-dose ketamine or local anesthetic strategies as appropriate to patient risk and contraindications [^116bofs2] [^116FDZQg] [^116M6sUC] [^111fybqF].

---

Routine use of muscle relaxants after abdominoplasty is **not recommended** because of limited evidence of benefit and meaningful risks, including sedation, respiratory depression, and delayed recovery [^114Tu1Y7] [^116bofs2]. They may be considered only for **severe muscle spasms unresponsive to first-line therapy**, and even then, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring. Multimodal analgesia with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and regional blocks (TAP or QL) is preferred; muscle relaxants should not be first-line [^111fybqF] [^116FDZQg] [^116ajpsY].

---

## Clinical evidence for muscle relaxant use after abdominoplasty

There is **limited evidence** supporting routine postoperative muscle relaxants after abdominoplasty; most data come from general surgical or mixed populations, not abdominoplasty-specific cohorts. A Cochrane review found no significant difference in pain or opioid use between muscle relaxants and placebo after surgery, suggesting **no clear benefit** [^116bofs2]. Moreover, abdominoplasty-specific trials and reviews do not support routine muscle relaxant use; instead, they emphasize multimodal analgesia and regional anesthesia [^111fybqF].

---

## Potential benefits of muscle relaxants

Muscle relaxants may reduce **postoperative muscle spasms** and discomfort, particularly after rectus plication, theoretically improving comfort and mobility. However, these benefits are **anecdotal and not well supported by high-quality evidence** [^114Tu1Y7].

---

## Risks and side effects of muscle relaxants

Muscle relaxants carry **significant risks**, especially when combined with opioids or other sedatives:

- **Sedation and respiratory depression**: Increased risk of oversedation and respiratory complications, particularly with opioids [^1177mYTz].

- **Delayed recovery**: Sedation can delay ambulation and recovery, increasing complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary issues [^116wphg2].

- **Abuse and dependence**: Some agents (e.g. carisoprodol) have abuse potential and should be avoided [^111nb5yE].

- **Adverse effects**: Dizziness, drowsiness, and gastrointestinal effects are common [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative pain management strategies

Muscle relaxants are **less effective and carry more risks** than alternatives:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | High | Effective for mild-to-moderate pain; opioid-sparing | GI bleeding, renal impairment |
| Acetaminophen | High | Effective for mild pain; opioid-sparing | Hepatotoxicity at high doses |
| Regional anesthesia (TAP, QL) | High | Reduces pain and opioid use; improves recovery | Minimal, local anesthetic toxicity |
| Muscle relaxants | Low | Limited benefit | Sedation, respiratory depression, abuse potential |

---

Regional anesthesia (TAP or QL blocks) is **particularly effective**, reducing pain and opioid consumption with minimal risk [^116FDZQg] [^116ajpsY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend routine muscle relaxant use** after abdominoplasty. Instead, they endorse **multimodal analgesia** with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and regional anesthesia, reserving muscle relaxants for refractory muscle spasms [^111fybqF] [^112GcnM3].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing muscle relaxant use

Muscle relaxants may be considered for patients with **severe muscle spasms** unresponsive to first-line therapy, but use should be individualized and carefully monitored. Factors include:

- **Severity of muscle spasms**: Persistent spasms despite NSAIDs and regional anesthesia [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Respiratory disease, obesity, or sleep apnea increase sedation risk [^notfound].

- **Concurrent medications**: Caution with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives due to additive effects [^1177mYTz].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine muscle relaxant use after abdominoplasty is **not supported by evidence** because of limited benefit and significant risks. Clinicians should prioritize **multimodal analgesia** and regional anesthesia, reserving muscle relaxants for refractory spasms at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring.

### Painless abdominoplasty: the efficacy of combined intercostal and pararectus blocks in reducing postoperative pain and recovery time [^1168BBMv]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing postoperative pain following abdominoplasty is essential for shortening the length of recovery time, reducing the use of narcotics, promoting quicker return to normal activities, and maximizing overall patient satisfaction. The extended use of narcotics and pain pumps is often unacceptable because of nausea, restriction of normal activities, and inconvenience. When the recovery process is not too lengthy and debilitating for the patients, they are more likely to refer the procedure to others and to return for additional elective procedures.

Methods

The charts of 209 patients undergoing abdominoplasty over a 10-year period were reviewed. The control group (n = 20) received no blocks, whereas the treatment group (n = 77) received a combination of nerve blocks, using bupivacaine, tetracaine, and Depo-Medrol. Recovery room data and patient questionnaires were used to evaluate clinical efficacy. Patient procedures were classified into four severity classes for analysis.

Results

The treatment group had significantly less pain across all severity classes and required significantly less narcotics and less time in the recovery room. Pain scores continued to be significantly lower at home. Patients had significantly less nausea, took less pain medication, and resumed normal activities significantly sooner than the control group.

Conclusions

This is the first study showing successful long-term relief of pain associated with abdominoplasty using a combination of intercostal, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and pararectus blocks. This pain-block procedure significantly reduces the recovery time and allows the patient to return to normal activities and work much sooner.

### Bupivacaine / meloxicam ER: a new dual-acting extended-release local anesthetic for opioid-sparing postoperative pain management [^113PkPUH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review data for bupivacaine/meloxicam extended-release (ER) solution for management of postoperative pain and opioid-sparing effects.

Data Sources

Literature search of PubMed (1946 to August 2021) and ProQuest (1946 to August 2021) was performed using the terms: Zynrelef, HTX-011, and "bupivacaine AND meloxicam". Additional information sources include ClinicalTrials.gov, prescribing information, Heron Therapeutics' Clinical and Economic Evidence Dossier, meeting abstracts, and references of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and articles evaluating bupivacaine/meloxicam ER for postoperative pain management.

Data Synthesis

Bupivacaine is a short-acting local anesthetic. Its efficacy is negatively impacted by the acidic environment of surgical sites. Meloxicam, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, reduces inflammation at the surgical site and increases pH propagating bupivacaine movement into the neurons. In Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, bupivacaine/meloxicam ER was compared with bupivacaine HCl, bupivacaine ER, and meloxicam ER with and without scheduled nonopioid multimodal analgesia (MMA) in bunionectomies, herniorrhaphies, total knee arthroplasty and abdominoplasty. Postoperative pain was well controlled for 72 hours and consistently superior to placebo, with minimal or no opioid use. Wound healing was not impacted and adverse effects were similar to placebo (most commonly nausea, dizziness, constipation, and headaches).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Bupivacaine/meloxicam ER is a viable, safe, nonopioid local anesthetic for sustained 72-hour postoperative pain management mitigating opioid consumption.

Conclusion

Bupivacaine/meloxicam ER is the only dual-acting, extended-release local anesthetic available. It provides effective analgesia in the postoperative setting and successfully reduces or eliminates postoperative opioid consumption.

### Postoperative opioid prescribing after female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery [^114rWSHX]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways — recommendation and multimodal analgesia for FPMRS. The guideline states to use enhanced recovery pathways to improve perioperative care, optimize perioperative pain control, and minimize opioid use, with a strong recommendation based on grade A aggregate evidence. ERAS pathways are evidence-based, protocol-like interventions, and Level 1 evidence shows that ERAS reduces the physiologic stress of surgery and improves patient outcomes. Multimodal, opioid-sparing pain management is a core component of ERAS and is supported by evidence; adjuncts for postoperative pain include pregabalin (in place of gabapentin), tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and ketamine. Local injection of prilocaine to the uterosacral ligaments has been shown to decrease opioid consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively and could be considered for FPMRS patients; attention should also be given to preoperative dexamethasone, and phenazopyridine may increase voiding trial success rates.

### Postoperative opioid prescribing after female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery [^111BJ5mh]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative opioid prescribing — principles for individualized and safe pain management in FPMRS. It is important to emphasize that information regarding decreased opioid prescribing is presented with the firm assumption that postoperative pain should be appropriately treated, and the importance of appropriate pain treatment cannot be overemphasized because poor pain management can lead to higher rates of hospitalization, increased postoperative complications, and development of chronic pain. We encourage physicians to prescribe the appropriate quantity of opioids based on patient-specific needs rather than uniform strategies, recognizing that under this framework some patients will need higher than average oral MME to achieve adequate pain control and others will need less. Widespread adoption of ERAS protocols, increased utilization of minimally invasive surgical approaches, optimization of nonopioid analgesia, and judicious prescribing will give FPMRS clinicians the tools they need to achieve optimum pain management while minimizing risks associated with opioid overprescribing.

### Pain and nausea after bariatric surgery with total intravenous anesthesia versus desflurane anesthesia: a double blind, randomized, controlled trial [^112uVr7B]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence-based knowledge regarding optimal anesthesia in obese patients.

Objective

To evaluate optimal anesthetic approach for patients undergoing bariatric surgery by determining and comparing peri- and postoperative outcomes in patients receiving intravenous anesthesia with propofol versus desflurane anesthesia.

Setting

Nonacademic primary referral center.

Methods

Patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2016 and 2017 were randomized into 1 of the following 2 types of anesthesia: intravenous anesthesia with propofol, or desflurane. Perioperative outcomes were registered by the operation staff. A form based on visual analog scale estimating the patient's intensity of pain and nausea was completed postoperatively at the postoperative unit, surgical ward, and 24 to 48 hours postsurgery. The primary outcome was postoperative nausea and vomiting or postoperative pain between treatment groups. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the "time of awakening", peritoneal stretch, and use of perioperative muscle relaxants.

Results

One hundred eighty-three patients were randomized to receive intravenous anesthesia (n = 90) or desflurane anesthesia (n = 93). Mean time ± standard deviation of surgery for both procedures was 41 ± 17 minutes, whereas mean time of awakening was 2 ± 2 minutes for both the intravenous anesthesia and desflurane group. There was no significant difference in visual analog scale for pain or for nausea and vomiting postoperatively, nor in the number of patients receiving muscle relaxants for peritoneal stretch between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

We found no significant differences between the 2 anesthetic regimens regarding postoperative nausea and pain, awakening time, peritoneal stretch, or the use of perioperative muscle relaxants.

### Opioid coprescribing with sedatives after implant-based breast reconstruction [^1177mYTz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines are thought to mitigate against postoperative muscle contraction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration warn against coprescribing them with opioids because of increased risks of overdose and death. The authors evaluated the frequency of coprescribing of opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines after implant-based reconstruction.

Methods

The authors examined health care claims to identify women (18 to 64 years old) who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction between January of 2008 and June of 2019 to determine the frequency of coprescribing, factors associated with coprescribing opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines, and the impact on opioid refills within 90 days of reconstruction.

Results

A total of 86.7 percent of women (n = 7574) who had implant-based breast reconstruction filled an opioid prescription perioperatively. Of these, 27.7 percent of women filled prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines, 14.4 percent for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, and 2.4 percent for opioids, benzodiazepines, and skeletal muscle relaxants. Risk factors for coprescribing opioids and benzodiazepines included use of acellular dermal matrix, immediate reconstruction, and history of anxiety. Women who filled prescriptions for opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants, opioids and benzodiazepines, and opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to refill opioid prescriptions, even when controlling for preoperative opioid exposure.

Conclusions

Nearly half of women filled an opioid prescription with a benzodiazepine, skeletal muscle relaxant, or both after implant-based breast reconstruction. Coprescribing of opioids with skeletal muscle relaxants may potentiate opioid use after surgery and should be avoided given the risks of sedation. Identifying strategies that avoid sedatives to manage pain after breast reconstruction is critical to mitigate high-risk prescribing practices.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bupivacaine hydrochloride implant in patients undergoing abdominoplasty [^114dqNER]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention and procedures

Abdominoplasty was performed according to standard surgical techniques under general anesthesia, with no other local anesthetic used at the surgical site (online supplemental material 1 contains the anesthesia protocol). The abdominoplasty procedure was performed with an anterior approach, and with an incision not extending above the umbilicus. In general, the incision was from one anterior superior iliac spine to the other, but the exact incision length could vary depending on the patient's anatomy. Drains could be placed at the discretion of the investigator, but ancillary procedures (eg, liposuction) at the same time were prohibited.

Prior to incision closure, the INL-001 or placebo implants were placed in the surgical site. Following tissue removal and repair of the abdominal musculature, two implants were placed on the rectus diastasis at the site of rectus sheath plication and one implant was placed below the abdominal incision between Scarpa's fascia and the subcutaneous fat. The implants were, to the greatest extent possible, placed so they spanned the fascia that was exposed prior to surgical closure. Implants could be cut in two halves to accommodate placement. Patients in both treatment groups were permitted rescue medication (opioids — morphine or oxycodone, and/or acetaminophen) to manage breakthrough pain (see online supplemental material 2).

### Postoperative opioid prescribing after female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery [^112RRbvt]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery — postoperative opioid prescribing guidance is based on a literature search of English language publications between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2021, with a total of 6,028 unique abstracts identified, 452 screened, and 198 full-text articles assessed; Fifteen articles informed the primary outcome and 32 informed secondary outcomes. For opioid-naive patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, we strongly recommend surgeons to provide no more than 15 tablets of opioids (roughly 112.5 morphine milligram equivalents) on hospital discharge. In cases where patients use no or little opioids in the hospital, patients may be safely discharged without postoperative opioids. Patient and surgical factors that may have an impact on opioid use should be assessed before surgery. Enhanced recovery pathways should be used to improve perioperative care, optimize pain control, and minimize opioid use. Systemic issues that lead to opioid overprescribing should be addressed.

### Postoperative opioid prescribing after female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery [^1143NgbR]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

FPMRS clinical practice statement — scope and audience specify that the target audience is female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) perioperative care providers and the target patient is any patient undergoing FPMRS procedures who is under consideration to be discharged home with an opioid prescription. The primary purpose is to inform FPMRS perioperative care providers of best practices in postoperative opioid prescribing by summarizing published data and providing expert consensus on the strength of this literature. The secondary purpose is to identify patient- and surgical-level factors and evidence-based interventions that may have an impact on the amount of opioid required for adequate pain control, and the document offers suggestions for systems-level improvements that may mitigate the opioid crisis and recommendations for future research.

### Clinical evaluation of 310 abdominoplasties and measurement of scar level [^112NaqbC]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Although many factors have been implicated in venous thromboembolism risk, such as age, abdominoplasty, combined procedures, and operating time, a rigorous study of 1000 consecutive cosmetic surgery outpatients who were all screened for deep venous thromboses using ultrasound found that only age persisted as an independent risk factor on logistic regression. Sequential compression devices did not reduce risk. A separate level 1 randomized study revealed no fibrinolytic benefit. Accordingly, the author has abandoned the use of sequential compression devices.

To minimize blood loss, the author uses 1:500,000 epinephrine concentrations in infusion solutions (< 4 L) and limits liposuction aspirate volumes (< 4 L). Blood loss from abdominoplasty is reduced by thorough infusion of wetting solution before the dissection. The operating room temperature is kept warm (ie, 75°F). Warmed fluids and blankets and a Bair Hugger (Arizant, Inc, Eden Prairie, MN) are also used to avoid hypothermia. Age is obviously not a modifiable risk factor. The most important consideration in reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism is avoiding muscle paralysis in surgery and preserving the calf muscle pump.

Performing concomitant cosmetic procedures is commonly done by plastic surgeons. However, surgeons need to be knowledgeable of expected blood loss for these procedural combinations. Plastic surgeons need to be both proficient and efficient in performing the procedures individually before offering them in combination.

Anesthesia and Patient Positioning

An important advantage in using total intravenous anesthesia without paralysis is spontaneous breathing. The patient is not on a ventilator. The rectus diastasis may be repaired while the patient is breathing spontaneously, with no muscle paralysis. Any change in respirations can alert the operator that the repair might be too tight. Using a laryngeal mask airway, the anesthetist is able to gauge anesthetic administration by peripheral stimulation rather than tolerance of an endotracheal tube. Spontaneous breathing makes the respiratory rate available so that intraoperative anesthesia (propofol) and opioid (fentanyl) administration can be titrated closely. Both pain and respiratory rate are clinical signs that are unavailable if general endotracheal anesthesia is used. Avoiding mechanical ventilation has other safety advantages, including avoidance of respiratory alkalosis from overventilation and secondary hypokalemia. The fewer physiological alterations during surgery, the better.

### Myofascial pain in hysterectomy patients [^115XDHZD]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the prevalence of myofascial pain in women undergoing uncomplicated, minimally invasive hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain, to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with preoperative myofascial pain, and examine the association between myofascial pain and postoperative pain in hysterectomy patients.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A tertiary care teaching hospital.

Patients

A total of 353 adult women who underwent uncomplicated, minimally invasive hysterectomy between January 2014 and 2016.

Interventions

All women underwent a preoperative pelvic floor examination. Myofascial pain was diagnosed as tenderness and reproduction of pain symptoms in at least 2 of 6 pelvic floor muscles. Demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative characteristics were compared between women with and without preoperative myofascial pain.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 353 women who underwent hysterectomy, the prevalence of myofascial pain was 42.7% (86.0% in patients with chronic pelvic pain [CPP] compared with 13.7% without CPP). Women with myofascial pain were more likely younger, Caucasian, sexually active, and with comorbid pain conditions. Patients with myofascial pain used a greater number of adjuvant pain medications before surgery including opiates (29.5%) but were only half as likely to use muscle relaxants (12.1%) for preoperative pain control. Contrastingly, in women without myofascial pain before surgery, controlled substances such as opiates (8%, p < .01) and benzodiazepines (3%, p < .01) were used at a three- fold lower frequency. Postoperative pain score was higher in patients with myofascial pain, with 37% reporting a visual analog scale score greater than 5 at the routine postoperative visit compared with only 1% of patients without myofascial pain.

Conclusion

Myofascial pelvic pain must be considered in the evaluation of CPP, especially in surgical candidates. Women with myofascial pelvic use a greater amount of pain medication preoperatively and have higher pain scores postoperatively. Identification of these high-risk patients before surgery may improve pre and postoperative pain management with a multimodal therapy approach.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^1147Q5U9]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain guideline evidence strength and applicability — although these guidelines are based on a systematic review of the evidence on management of postoperative pain, the panel identified numerous research gaps, and of 32 recommendations, the panel rated only 4 as supported by high-quality evidence, and 11 recommendations were on the basis of low-quality evidence. Nonetheless, the panel came to near-unanimous consensus on almost all of its recommendations. Clinical practice guidelines are "guides" only and might not apply to all patients and all clinical situations.

### Effect of enhanced recovery after surgery on older patients undergoing transvaginal pelvic floor reconstruction surgery: a randomised controlled trial [^1144CDcd]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) was first introduced by a Danish anaesthetist Henrik Kehlet, with the aim of optimising peri-operative management. This involves strategies, such as minimising unnecessary bowel preparation, utilising multimodal analgesia to reduce opioid consumption, and promoting early post-operative feeding and mobilisation. These interventions are designed to alleviate surgical stress and expedite patients' post-operative recovery. Previous research has consistently demonstrated the benefits of ERAS, including reductions in the average length of stay (LOS), decreased incidence of post-operative complications and mortality, cost-effectiveness, and enhancement of patients' quality of life. The ERAS protocols are now widely implemented across various surgical specialties, including colorectal surgery, urology, cardiothoracic surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, and orthopaedics. However, its application in gynaecological surgery, particularly in transvaginal pelvic floor reconstruction, has been adapted from experiences in colorectal and gastrointestinal surgery, with numerous decisions lacking robust supporting evidence. Additionally, patients undergoing transvaginal pelvic floor reconstruction surgery are often older individuals, with more fragile neurological, respiratory, and circulatory systems. To reduce post-operative complications in these patients, ERAS strategies, such as low-opioid anaesthesia, multimodal pain management, and prophylactic anti-emetics, are necessary. Beyond patient age and vulnerability, gynaecological surgeries differ from colorectal procedures in terms of anatomy, surgical techniques, complication risks, wound healing, and psychosocial factors, necessitating the development of customised ERAS protocols for optimal patient outcomes.

### Analysis of the association of sugammadex with the length of hospital stay in patients undergoing abdominal surgery: a retrospective study [^115ku2hf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is commonly used in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and optimize surgical conditions, including during abdominal surgery. Although short-acting muscle relaxants are widely used, residual NMB often occurs. Recent studies have reported that approximately 40% patients spontaneously recover. Incomplete reversal of NMB after emergence from anesthesia leads to increased incidence of postoperative complications, such as respiratory impairment. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, already in clinical use, are ineffective in reversing deep muscle relaxation, and may be associated with high incidence of nicotinic and muscarinic side effects.

Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin that selectively binds to free rocuronium (a neuromuscular blocker) molecules in plasma. Contrary to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, sugammadex directly encapsulates rocuronium; hence, it facilitates rapid NMB reversal without residual muscle relaxation. Administration of sugammadex has been reported to expedite rapid recovery of smooth muscle functions, leading to improved postoperative bowel function, decreased recovery time, fewer postoperative pulmonary complications, and reduced costs.

Enhanced recovery after surgery is garnering considerable attention. According to our observations, patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are at a high risk of perioperative respiratory complications due to their poor physical condition or multiple co-morbidities. Therefore, methods to ensure safe and effective rapid postoperative recovery are important considerations for surgeons and anesthesiologists.

Previous studies have reported that length of hospital stay is considered an important indicator for evaluating postoperative functional recovery and is correlated with postoperative complications and use of resources. However, despite the evidence to support the use of sugammadex, studies that determine its usefulness in reducing length of hospital stay after abdominal surgery are limited. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether there was a difference in the length of postoperative hospital stay after administration of sugammadex when compared to spontaneous recovery after NMB for abdominal surgery and additionally, analyzed the differences in recovery by comparing gastrointestinal motility outcomes and postoperative pulmonary complication rates.

### Use of abdominal field block injections with liposomal bupivicaine to control postoperative pain after abdominoplasty [^1142cbdK]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known that improving postoperative pain control in plastic surgery procedures leads to earlier mobilization, shortened hospital stay, reduced hospital costs, and increased patient satisfaction.

Objective

The authors evaluate the use of abdominal field block injections with liposomal bupivicaine (Exparel; Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc, San Diego, California) in postoperative pain management in patients undergoing abdominoplasty with rectus plication.

Methods

Case records from 64 female patients who underwent abdominoplasty with rectus plication were reviewed. We performed a total of 118 abdominoplasties with rectus plication, alone or in combination with other surgical procedures, from August 2012 to December 2012, but 54 patients were excluded from the series due to inadequate follow-up. Patients received liposomal bupivicaine injections in an abdominal field block fashion. Patient age, height, weight, and smoking status were recorded. Delivery of standardized postoperative intramuscular or intravenous injections and oral pain pills was recorded. Postoperative data and questionnaires were used to evaluate clinical efficacy.

Results

The average number of procedures (including abdominoplasty with rectus plication) per patient was 7. Average patient body mass index was 27 kg/m². Average pain scores were 3.5 (postoperative visit 1) and 2.8 (visit 2). The average number of oral pain pills required was 14 at the first postoperative visit and 11.5 at the second postoperative visit. Patients were able to resume normal activity at an average of 6.4 days.

Conclusions

Our experience with liposomal bupivicaine injections for regional blocks in abdominoplasty with rectus plication indicates that patients experienced reduced postoperative pain, required less postoperative narcotic medication, and resumed both earlier ambulation and normal activity. Further investigation is warranted with more clinical cases to recommend the use of this medication for routine pain management after an abdominoplasty.

### How much are patients willing to pay to avoid postoperative muscle pain associated with succinylcholine? [^115sNKDi]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine how much money patients are willing to pay to avoid postoperative muscle pains associated with succinylcholine.

Design

Observational study with survey instrument.

Setting

University-affiliated metropolitan hospital.

Patients

Eighty-eight adult patients, 43 men and 45 women, who were scheduled to undergo surgery with general anesthesia and who completed a preoperative questionnaire (median age range, 41–50 y; median income, US$45,000–60,000).

Interventions and Measurements

Patients completed a computerized, interactive questionnaire preoperatively. They were asked about demographics and previous experiences with muscle pain and postoperative myalgia. With the use of the willingness-to-pay model, the value that they would be willing to pay for a hypothetical muscle relaxant that avoided postoperative myalgia was determined.

Main Results

Eighty-nine percent of patients considered avoiding postoperative myalgia as important. Patients were willing to pay a median (interquartile range) of $33 ($19-$50) out of pocket for a muscle relaxant that was not associated with postoperative myalgia, a figure that increased to $40 if the insurance company paid for the drug (P < 0.0001). Willingness to pay was influenced by patients' income but not by prior experience with postoperative myalgia.

Conclusion

Patients consider avoidance of postoperative myalgia important and are willing to pay $33 out of pocket for a muscle relaxant that is not associated with this side effect.

### A randomized, phase IIb study investigating oliceridine (TRV130), a novel µ-receptor G-protein pathway selective (μ-GPS) modulator, for the management of moderate to severe acute pain following abdominoplasty [^114NCAUL]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Patients

At screening, males or females aged 18–65 years who planned to undergo abdominoplasty without any additional collateral procedures were enrolled. At that time, patients were excluded if they were classified as P3 or worse on the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System, had clinically significant medical conditions or a history of such conditions, or had previously participated in an oliceridine clinical study. In the immediate postoperative period, patients were eligible to enroll if they had recovered from the intraoperative anesthetic and analgesic regimen to a degree to which they were considered by investigators to be sufficiently lucid to complete the required questionnaires. They were also required to have a score of ≥ 5 on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and moderate or severe pain on a 4-point categorical rating scale (with categories of none, mild, moderate, or severe) within 4 hours after the end of surgery. Patients who had undergone prolonged surgeries (> 2.5 hours) or surgeries that deviated from surgical or anesthetic protocols and those who had surgical or postsurgical complications were excluded from the study. Patients were required to meet all of these preoperative (screening) and postoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria to be eligible for the study and receive study medication.

The general anesthetic regimen was standardized to reduce variability and consisted of fentanyl and propofol, with or without volatile anesthetics or muscle relaxants. Opioids other than fentanyl were prohibited; at least 20 minutes must have elapsed between the final dose of fentanyl (either intraoperative or postoperative) and the initiation of study medication. Other prohibited medications included intraoperative or postoperative steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous acetaminophen, regional or neuraxial anesthesia, long-acting local anesthetics, and prophylactic anti-emetics.

Patients who used no opioids during their hospitalization may be discharged without an opioid prescription (Recommendation, for treatment effect, with a preponderance of benefit over harm). Patient and surgical factors that may impact opioid prescribing should be assessed before surgery (Recommendation, for treatment effect, with a preponderance of benefit over harm). Use enhanced recovery pathways to improve perioperative care, optimize perioperative pain control, and minimize opioid use (Strong recommendation, for treatment effect, with a preponderance of benefit over harm). Address systemic issues that lead to opioid overprescribing and increased risk of diversion/ abuse (Strong recommendation, for treatment effect, with a preponderance of benefit over harm).

### Transversus abdominis plane block anesthesia in abdominoplasties [^1143NVTt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The transversus abdominis plane block is a promising approach to the provision of postoperative analgesia following abdominal incision. This effective method blocks the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall. The authors evaluated its analgesic efficacy over the first 12 postoperative hours after abdominoplasty with liposculpture in a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial.

Methods

Twenty-eight women undergoing abdominoplasty by means of a lower abdominal incision were randomized to undergo transversus abdominis plane block (n = 14) in addition to standard care therapy (n = 14). The investigators, who were blinded to the conditions of the study, assessed the patients in the postanesthesia care unit at 4, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively.

Results

The transversus abdominis plane block group reported reduced pain scores (F = 12.73, p < 0.001). Morphine requirement was also reduced in the first 12 postoperative hours (χ² = 19.27; p < 0.005). Transversus abdominis plane block group patients also exhibited early ambulation compared with the control group (F = 65.15, p < 0.001). All of the patients in the transversus abdominis plane block group reported lower levels of pain with their postoperative analgesic regimen, which was demonstrated by their rates of recovery. The Mann-Whitney test was performed on the data, which illustrated that mean ranks consistently corresponded to the trend the authors predicted.

Conclusions

The transversus abdominis plane block seems to hold considerable promise for patients undergoing abdominoplasty by providing effective postoperative analgesia in the first 12 postoperative hours after major abdominoplasty.

### Optimal pain control in abdominal wall reconstruction [^11475Bui]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Lack of physician familiarity with alternative pain control strategies is a major reason why opioids remain the most commonly used first-line treatment for pain after surgery. This is perhaps most problematic in abdominal wall reconstruction, where opioids may delay ambulation and return of bowel function, while negatively affecting mental status. In this article, we discuss multimodal strategies for optimal pain control in abdominal wall reconstruction. These strategies are straightforward and are proven to improve pain control while minimizing opioid-associated side effects.

### Intraoperative ketamine and magnesium therapy to control postoperative pain after abdominoplasty and / or liposuction: a clinical randomized trial [^114is6VR]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that the administration of intraoperative ketamine plus magnesium reduces morphine consumption by almost 50% during the first 12h in patients subjected to abdominoplasty and liposuction compared to patients controls and those who did not receive magnesium associated with ketamine. Additionally, intraoperative infusion of ketamine plus magnesium delayed the first morphine request, while there were no differences in the proposed treatment's adverse effects. However, pain scores were similar among all groups. Nevertheless, multiple linear regression and nonlinear approach analyses indicate that the Control group had more pain and consumed more morphine per hour than the ketamine and the ketamine plus magnesium groups. Thus, ketamine and magnesium are effective analgesic drugs with an opioid-sparing effect in patients who undergo abdominoplasty and liposuction.

Recently, the "Consensus Guidelines on the Use of Intravenous Ketamine Infusions for Acute Pain Management" from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, The American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American Society of Anesthesiologist (2018) conclude that a subanesthetic ketamine dose remains as a powerful and inexpensive tool for practitioners who manage acute pain. The guidelines recommended that the ketamine bolus dose do not exceed 0.35 mg/kg and infusions do not exceed 1 mg/kg/h; however, this higher dose, although it is more effective, has a higher incidence of adverse effects, such as hallucinations, nightmares, nausea, blurred vision, and dizziness. On the other hand, the efficiency of too low doses has inconclusive evidence. In this context, we used low doses of ketamine (bolus 0.3 mg/kg and infusion 0.15 mg/kg/h), which effectively decrease the morphine consumption in the treatment of acute pain. Sen et al (2009) showed a 35% reduction in morphine use during the first 24h after an abdominal hysterectomy, with a similar ketamine dose as in our regime. Likewise, Aida et al (2000) found that in patients undergoing distal or total gastrectomy, patients that were administered ketamine had a lower cumulative morphine consumption than patients administered the placebo. Nevertheless, this study used higher doses of ketamine than our study (1 mg/kg and then maintained 0.5 mg/Kg/h).

### Multimodal analgesia bundle and postoperative opioid use among patients undergoing colorectal surgery [^113F6KWN]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The opioid epidemic affects large parts of the world, causing an estimated 350 000 deaths annually worldwide. In 2019, 70 630 people died from an opioid overdose in the United States, and in 28% of those, medically prescribed opioids were involved. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reported that the opioid epidemic now also affects Europe, where Sweden has the second-highest incidence of opioid-related deaths.

In the United States, surgeons issued approximately 30 million opioid prescriptions in 2012, constituting about 10% of all prescribed opioids. Prescribed opioids are consumed not only by the patient but often also by relatives and friends; indeed, the main source of abused prescription opioids is family and friends.

In addition to addiction, opioids have adverse effects that impair recovery after surgery, such as impaired gastrointestinal motility and impaired mobilization. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols use a range of opioid-sparing strategies. Multimodal analgesia is an approach in which several analgesics are combined to maximize analgesia while minimizing their adverse effects. Regional analgesic techniques, such as epidurals, spinal blocks, transverse abdominis plane blocks, and rectus blocks, are widely used.

Additional methods have been proposed to reduce the need for opioids in postoperative pain control. Those include individualized opioid dosages, gabapentinoids as a baseline analgesic, and clonidine as a rescue analgesic. However, the opioid-sparing effects of these methods have not yet been well evaluated in major abdominal surgery.

In this retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected perioperative data, we evaluated the association of implementing a care bundle consisting of an individualized opioid regimen, regular gabapentinoids, and clonidine as a rescue analgesic and the amount of opioids administered postoperatively among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Additionally, the associations between each intervention and opioid administration were analyzed.

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant… [^111nb5yE]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

28 A Cochrane review analyzed three high-quality trials that showed tizanidine plus analgesics was more effective in providing pain relief and decreasing muscle spasm than analgesics alone. 17 Conversely, one low-quality open-label study comparing cyclobenzaprine alone versus combination with ibuprofen showed that, although all groups improved at seven days, there was no statistical difference in outcomes among the groups. Place in Therapy Although the evidence for effectiveness of skeletal muscle relaxants in musculoskeletal conditions is limited, strong evidence does exist in terms of toxicity. In acute low back pain trials, skeletal muscle relaxants increased overall adverse effects and central nervous system adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness.

17 Because of the weak evidence for comparable effectiveness, selection of an agent should be based on side-effect profile, patient preference, abuse potential, drug interaction potential, and other characteristics of the individual drugs. 32 Skeletal muscle relaxants are indicated for short-term use; therefore, multiple modalities may be warranted to prevent chronic use of these medications. Selection of a skeletal muscle relaxant should be individualized to the patient. If there are tender spots over the muscle or trigger points on physical examination, a skeletal muscle relaxant is a reasonable adjunct to analgesic treatment of low back pain. Skeletal muscle relaxants may also be used as an alternative to NSAIDs in patients who are at risk of gastrointestinal or renal complications. Patients with low back pain or fibromyalgia may benefit from treatment with cyclobenzaprine.

Recent evidence showed similar effectiveness at half of its manufacturer recommended dose, but with fewer adverse effects. Carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate and has been shown to produce psychological and physical dependence. 34 Carisoprodol and diazepam should be reserved for last-line therapy because of their abuse potential and lack of superiority to other skeletal muscle relaxants. Although all skeletal muscle relaxants should be used with caution in older patients, diazepam especially should be avoided in older patients or in patients with significant cognitive or hepatic impairment.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^112zAT3y]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Abdominoplasty is a widely utilized cosmetic surgery procedure. Despite its popularity, seroma formation remains a prevalent complication. Seroma can lead to extended recovery time, increased medical appointments, and the potential for infection or the need for additional surgical revision. Preserving Scarpa's fascia may mitigate the risk of seroma in patients following abdominoplasty. The goal of this systematic review was to determine the impact of preserving Scarpa's fascia on the occurrence of seroma and total drain output following an abdominoplasty procedure. This review searched academic literature in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for clinical and observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals, from March 2022 to November 2022, that evaluated the impact of preserving Scarpa's fascia on postoperative seroma and total drain output during abdominoplasty. The primary outcomes of interest were seroma and total drain output, with secondary outcomes of interest including hematoma, time to drain removal, length of hospital stay, wound dehiscence, and infection rate. The systematic review of 8 studies, involving 846 patients, found that the preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure was associated with decreased seroma occurrence, reduced drain output, faster drain removal, and fewer infections. However, it did not affect the incidence of hematoma, hospital stay duration, or wound dehiscence. The preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure should be considered as a routine practice, because it has been shown to result in reduced seroma incidence rates and faster drain removal.

### The role of taping in early recovery after abdominoplasty: a comprehensive review and proposal of a standardized protocol [^116u1qfh]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominoplasty, a widely performed surgical procedure for body contouring, is often associated with significant postoperative discomfort, edema, and prolonged recovery times. Optimizing postoperative recovery remains a critical goal to improve patient satisfaction and outcomes.

Objective

This article explores the role of taping as a noninvasive adjunctive therapy to standard postoperative care in the early recovery phase following abdominoplasty.

Methods

A comprehensive review of current literature is presented to evaluate the mechanisms of action and clinical benefits of taping, including its impact on edema reduction, wound healing, and skin adherence. Furthermore, we outline standardized research protocol, implemented over the past 5 years, where taping is applied from the first postoperative day as part of enhanced recovery pathways.

Results

Taping has demonstrated potential benefits such as reduced edema, improved tissue support, enhanced wound healing, and better skin adherence, contributing to faster and smoother recovery for patients undergoing abdominoplasty.

Conclusions

Incorporating taping into the early recovery process may offer a promising, noninvasive approach to improving outcomes after abdominoplasty. Further controlled studies are needed to validate its efficacy and establish standardized protocols for widespread clinical use. Kinesiology taping significantly reduces postoperative edema and enhances wound healing in abdominoplasty. Patients using KT report lower pain levels and improved mobility, contributing to faster recovery. The technique is a cost-effective, non-invasive adjunct that may improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. Further studies are needed to establish standardized protocols and confirm long-term benefits.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^1175YXpC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2 (Abdominoplasty Surgery) In the second controlled, multiple-dose trial (NCT02678286) of adult patients with postoperative pain who underwent elective abdominoplasty surgery, 219 patients were treated with meloxicam injection 30 mg or placebo administered once daily for two days starting on the day of surgery. An optional third dose was permitted just prior to discharge. A minimum postoperative baseline pain intensity of 4 on the NPRS (range 0–10) and pain categorized as moderate or severe were required for randomization. The majority of patients were female (98%). The average age was 40 years. The mean overall baseline pain intensity on the NPRS was 7.3. A statistically significant difference demonstrating efficacy was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint of the summed pain intensity difference over the first 24 hours (SPID24) as well as over the first 48 hours (SPID48). The average pain intensity over time is depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 3. A generally consistent separation in pain scores between the meloxicam injection and placebo group was observed from time of onset through most of the dosing interval with a narrowing at the end of the first 24-hour dosing interval.

Onset of Meaningful Pain Relief and Use of Rescue Analgesic Medication

The median time to first rescue analgesic use in patients treated with meloxicam injection (2 hours in Study 1 and 1 hour in Study 2) came before the median time to patient-reported meaningful pain relief in both studies (2 hours in Study 1 and 3 hours in Study 2). Fifty percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 49% of patients treated with placebo in Study 1 received rescue analgesia medication in the first 2 hours after the start of dosing. Seventy-eight percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 78% of patients treated with placebo in Study 2 received rescue in the first 3 hours after the start of dosing.

### Limitations of patient-controlled epidural analgesia following abdominoplasty [^114pn9yT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective postoperative pain management is essential for patient satisfaction and an uneventful postoperative course, particularly in body contouring procedures. Systemic analgesic regimens can be supported by regional procedures, such as the transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block, but these have a limited duration of action. In contrast, thoracic epidural analgesia offers the possibility of a longer-lasting, individualized regional anesthesia administered by a patient-controlled analgesia pump.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a patient-controlled epidural analgesia to better classify the clinical value of this procedure in abdominoplasties.

Materials and Methods

This work reviewed the digital medical charts of patients who underwent selective abdominoplasty without combined surgical procedures between September 2018 and August 2022. Evaluated data comprise the postoperative analgesia regimen, including on-demand medication, mobilization time, inpatient length of stay, and clinical outcome. The patients were grouped by the presence of a thoracic epidural catheter. This catheter was placed before anesthetic induction and a saturation dose was preoperatively applied. Postoperative PCEA patients received a basal rate and could independently administer boluses. Basal rate was individually adjusted during daily additional pain visits.

Results

The study cohort included 112 patients. Significant differences in the demand for supportive nonepidural opiate medication were shown between the patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) group (n = 57) and the non-PCEA group (n = 55), depending on the time after surgery. PCEA patients demanded less medication during the early postoperative days (POD 0: PCEA 0.13 (± 0.99) mg vs non-PCEA 2.59 (± 4.55) mg, P = 0.001; POD 1: PCEA 0.79 mg (± 3.06) vs non-PCEA 2.73 (± 3.98) mg, P = 0.005), but they required more during the later postoperative phase (POD 3: PCEA 2.76 (± 5.60) mg vs non-PCEA 0.61 (± 2.01) mg, P = 0.008; POD 4: PCEA 1.64 (± 3.82) mg vs non-PCEA 0.07 (± 2.01) mg, P = 0.003). In addition, PCEA patients achieved full mobilization later (PCEA 2.67 (± 0.82) days vs non-PCEA 1.78 (± 1.09) days, P = 0.001) and were discharged later (PCEA 4.84 (± 1.23) days vs non-PCEA 4.31 (± 1.37) days, P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Because the postoperative benefits of PCEA are limited to potent analgesia immediately after abdominoplasty, less cumbersome, time-limited regional anesthesia procedures (such as TAP block) appear not only adequate but also more effective.

### The effect of deep muscle relaxation on the force required during latissimus dorsi dissection for breast reconstructive surgery: results of a prospective, double-blinded observational pilot study [^116f6xse]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study ever objectively investigating the effect of a muscle relaxant on an individual in vivo muscle relevant for plastic and reconstructive surgery. We found that the administration of a muscle relaxant significantly reduced the force likely required during manually raising the LD flap in the majority (10/15) of patients. Correspondingly, the attending surgeons subjectively felt a change ("softer muscle") in 83% of patients after muscle relaxant administration. Not formally investigated by this trial, but empirically noted by surgeons during the investigation was the absence of strong and irritating muscle twitches when diathermy was used after the patient had been paralysed. Above described changes support the claim for a facilitating effect of muscle relaxants during LD flap surgery.

Though this generally supports the use of muscle relaxation during pedicled LD flap surgery, the described effect may not be required or even desired by every individual surgeon. As NMBA such as rocuronium have rare but potentially serious side effects, such as anaphylaxis, the risk-benefit ratio of using muscle relaxants during LD surgery is best discussed between surgeon and anaesthetist for each individual patient.

Surgeons in our trial recognized the effects of muscle relaxation vs saline in most patients, with an objective reduction of force by means of muscle relaxation by a median of 22%. Though to our knowledge no similar study exists, the magnitude of change is in-line with findings of studies investigating the use of muscle relaxants for laparoscopic surgery. After neuromuscular blockade, Lindekaer et al. found an increase of abdominal workspace of approximately 9%. In a similar but larger prospective trial Dubois et al. could show that muscle relaxation significantly improved surgical working conditions. It is therefore likely, that surgeons would indeed feel a difference of muscle tension in the range of 20%.

### Abdominoplasty as an acute postoperative pain model: insights from 8 years of clinical trials [^1169MkqM]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

Abdominoplasty is a well-validated soft-tissue surgical model that provides high-quality experimental outputs, enabling the efficacy of investigational analgesics in soft-tissue pain to be understood successfully. Abdominoplasty studies are also quick to enroll and can, therefore, decrease clinical trial time and cost relative to other models. Because abdominoplasty's use in clinical pain trials is relatively new, there is not yet adequate public data to meaningfully analyze some nuances of the model. As the popularity of abdominoplasty in clinical trials continues to expand, researchers can expect a fuller understanding of its characteristics.

### The efficacy of different nerve blocks on postoperative pain and sequelae in patients undergoing abdominoplasty: a network meta-analysis [^116FDZQg]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although abdominoplasty is growing in popularity, it still results in considerable postoperative pain, which prolongs recovery.

Objectives

The aim of this network meta-analysis was to combine evidence about different regional nerve blocks to examine their effectiveness in the management of postoperative pain sequelae and recovery following abdominoplasty.

Methods

An electronic literature search in the MEDLINE (PubMed; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), Scopus (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library (London, UK) and US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register electronic databases (Bethesda, MD) was conducted from inception to July 2022. Inclusion criteria were the presence of intervention and control groups; data derived from controlled studies evaluating nerve blocks after abdominoplasty, in terms of analgesia needs, complications, and patient satisfaction; and publication in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of studies was assessed via Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool. A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted for all outcomes of interest.

Results

A total of 12 studies, containing 543 patients with no differences in age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, met the inclusion criteria. Transversus abdominis plane blocks have been found to reduce 24-hour and 48-hour opioid consumption (-3.70 and -5.01 weighted mean difference, respectively). In addition, the nerve blocks reviewed effectively prolonged the time to first rescue analgesia request, were safe in terms of complications, and were associated with high satisfaction rates.

Conclusions

Nerve blocks emerge as an effective and safe adjunct for adequate pain management following abdominoplasty. This meta-analysis provides an evidence-based strategy to optimize the current analgesia regimens following abdominoplasty.

### Local anesthetic pain catheters to reduce opioid use in massive weight loss patients undergoing abdominoplasty: a comparative study [^116RBT68]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominoplasty is a common procedure for anatomical restoration of the lower abdominal skin, with a continuously increasing annual number of procedures performed. The significance of postoperative pain management is of crucial importance from a patient's perspective and to ensure the achievement of the aimed clinical outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of local pain pump catheters (PPCs) on massive weight loss patients undergoing body-contouring abdominoplasty.

Methods

Primary abdominoplasty procedures after massive weight loss performed from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the use of the PPC. The primary outcome measure was the amount of opioid use calculated as morphine equivalents. The secondary outcome measures were the length of hospital stay (LOS) and early postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery.

Results

A total of 61 patients were included in the study: 24 patients in the PPC group and 37 patients in the conventional abdominoplasty analgesia (CAA) group. No significant differences between the study groups were found with regard to demographics, operative time, and resection weight. A significantly decreased use of opioids was observed after using PPC versus control (14.0 ± 13.9 mg vs. 74.6 ± 73.3 mg, p < 0.001). Similarly, the LOS was shorter in the PPC group (3.1 ± 1.1 days vs. 3.8 ± 1.0 days, p = 0.023). There was a similar rate of complications in both groups (45.8% vs. 40.5%, p = 0.622). The most common complication was seroma formation (25.0% vs. 18.5%, p = 0.315).

Conclusion

The use of local anesthetic pain catheters in abdominoplasty may be associated with a decreased use of opioids and might result in a shorter hospital stay on massive weight loss patients. Further studies are needed to validate this treatment modality.

### Intraoperative ketamine and magnesium therapy to control postoperative pain after abdominoplasty and / or liposuction: a clinical randomized trial [^114zZ3Gk]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

All patients received a standardized general anesthesia protocol. Anesthesia induction was performed with 2 mg/kg of propofol, remifentanil effect-site targeted concentration between 3–5 ng/mL (Minto model), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with 0.8–1.0 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane, effect-site remifentanil between 3–5 ng/mL, and subsequent doses of rocuronium if needed. The neuromuscular blocking effect was evaluated before extubation using the TOF monitor. If T₄/T₁ was < 90%, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with 20–60 μg/kg of neostigmine and 10–30 μg/kg atropine. Antibiotic prophylaxis was carried out with 2 g of cefazolin (or Clindamycin 600mg in the case of allergy to penicillin). All patients received noninvasive standard monitoring. Before skin incision, the surgeon performed a subcutaneous administration with a 1:1.000.000 adrenaline solution. Thirty minutes before the end of the surgery, all patients received 1 g of paracetamol with 60 mg of ketorolac in addition to 0.1 mg/kg of morphine thirty minutes before the end of the surgery. Nausea and vomiting prophylaxis was carried out with 8 mg of dexamethasone after induction and 4 mg of ondansetron. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), nausea was treated with 0.625 mg of droperidol. After the surgery, patients spent at least two hours in the PACU. The pain and morphine consumption were evaluated by an investigator who was unaware of the treatment group assignments.

Postoperative analgesia included a 90 mg ketorolac in 250 mL of 0.9% saline solution infusion every 24h. A morphine PCA pump was installed and programmed with no continuous infusion, 1 mg boluses, and 8 min lockout. Thromboembolic prophylaxis was initiated with 10 mg of rivaroxaban (Xarelto ®, Bayer) per day for ten days; 20 mg of esomeprazole (Nexium ®, Astra-Zeneca) was administered every 12h for seven days as prophylaxis for pharmacological gastritis, and antibiotic prophylaxis with 500 mg of cefadroxil (Cefamox ®, Merck-Serono) begun every 12h for seven days.

### Effect of perioperative intravenous lidocaine on postoperative recovery in patients undergoing ileostomy closure: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^1124576k]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

In the lidocaine group, 1.5 mg/kg predicted body weight (PBW) of lidocaine (with a total dose not to exceeding 100 mg) will be administered by slow intravenous push approximately 30s before induction of anesthesia. This will be followed by continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine at a rate of 2 mg·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ until the end of the operation. In the control group, normal saline will be administered in the same manner. Both groups will have intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for 48 hours postoperatively. The same analgesic formulation, ie, dexmedetomidine 2 ug·kg⁻¹, fentanyl 0.01 mg·kg⁻¹, butorphanol tartrate 0.06mg·kg⁻¹, and metoclopramide 20 mg, diluting to 100 mL with 0.9% saline, will be given to both groups. PBW is calculated as follows, male 50 + (0.91 × [height −152.4]), female 45.5 + (0.91 × [height - 152.4]).

Anesthesia Management

A standardized anesthesia management and care process is uniformly implemented for all patients. Bowel preparation will be strictly implemented according to surgical routine.

Induction of Anesthesia

On the day of surgery, ECG, non-invasive arterial pressure, saturation of pulse oximetry, and bispectral index will be routinely monitored upon admission to the operating room. A peripheral intravenous access will be established. In the trial group, 1.5 mg·kg⁻¹ (PBW) of lidocaine (with a total dose not exceeding 100 mg) will be given slowly and intermittently before induction of anesthesia, followed by continuous infusion of lidocaine at a rate of 2 mg·kg⁻¹·h⁻¹ until the end of the operation. The same volume of normal saline will be given to the control group. Oxygen will be preadministered (8 L·min⁻¹) before induction, and the concentration of inhaled oxygen will be 100%. Patients in both groups will be induced with propofol 1.5–2.0 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.3 μg·kg⁻¹, dexamethasone 10 mg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg⁻¹ successively. After the patient loses consciousness and adequate muscle relaxation is achieved, the same attending anesthesiologist will perform tracheal intubation and connect the anesthesia machine for mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, a unilateral transversus abdominal plane (TAP) block on the surgical side will be performed with 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine.

### Abdominoplasty with procedural sedation and analgesia [^114YSGUz]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The ability to perform abdominal cosmetic surgery in the ambulatory setting provides a more comfortable environment for the patient, ease of scheduling for the physician, and decreased costs. Avoiding the use of general anesthesia allows for quicker recovery, shorter length of hospital stay, and decreased rate of postoperative complications. The authors report 106 consecutive abdominoplasties, including fascial plication when indicated, using local anesthesia, with procedural sedation and analgesia. All procedures were performed with an anesthesiologist providing intraoperative monitoring of the patients. Their protocol uses procedural sedation and analgesia, which results in a depressed level of consciousness, but allows the patient to maintain airway control independently and continuously. The results of this approach were measured in terms of procedure time, length of hospital stay, rate of complications, total recovery time, and the level of patient satisfaction. Between January 1996 and January 1999, 106 patients underwent abdominoplasty (performed by one of the authors) under local anesthesia with procedural sedation and analgesia. All patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists status of 1 to 3, and underwent a full abdominoplasty, including fascial plication. In 26% of the patients, allied procedures were also performed, most commonly liposuction or augmentation mammaplasty. The mean age in this series was 45 years, and all patients were available for follow-up at least 1 year after surgery. The mean operative time was 135 minutes, recovery room time was 68 minutes, and all patients were ambulatory. There were no surgical complications, including flap loss or wound dehiscence, and no complications related to anesthesia (cardiac, deep vein thrombosis, fat emboli, pulmonary embolism, etc.). Because paralytic agents were not used, none of the patients required catheterization postoperatively. Patients were generally pleased with the results of surgery. Although the extent of the surgery remains the same, this approach provided patients with an easier postoperative experience. In summary, abdominoplasty, including full fascial plication of the rectus and external oblique aponeurosis, can be performed safely and comfortably under local anesthesia with procedural sedation and analgesia. Patients are comfortable, recover quickly, and are very satisfied with their surgical result and overall experience.

### Effect of preoperative versus postoperative use of transversus abdominis plane block with plain 0.25% bupivacaine on postoperative opioid use: a retrospective study [^111xTgpR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient selection

All patients who received TAP blocks during a transabdominal colorectal resection between August 2018 and January 2020 were identified through hospital chart review. The TAP procedure was performed by the regional anesthesiologist on duty that day. The majority of TAP blocks are performed preoperatively in our institution. At times, the TAP block was done at the conclusion of the operation often due to timing issues. All included patients underwent colorectal resection done by colon and rectal surgeons at our tertiary care hospital. We abstracted patient demographics, medical comorbidities, preoperative diagnosis, past medical and surgical history, procedure-related details, and postoperative opioid use after the index operation until discharge. The study was approved by the Henry Ford Health System Institutional Review Board. This manuscript was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the amended 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

Patients were divided in 2 groups based on timing of TAP block procedure: before (preoperative) or immediately after (postoperative) their surgical procedure.

TAP block technique

Under ultrasound guidance, TAP blocks were performed by, or under supervision of, the attending anesthesiologist who specializes in acute pain management and regional anesthesia. The blocks were performed either 1 h preoperatively or at the conclusion of the surgery procedure within 30 min of reaching the post-anesthesia care unit. The TAP block consisted of bilateral injection of 20 mL of 0.25% plain bupivacaine in the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles in the midaxillary line. None of the patients in the 2 groups received additional regional anesthesia, including epidural or spinal anesthesia.

Additional multimodal adjuncts

Our postoperative pain management protocol consisted of scheduled acetaminophen, muscle relaxant (methocarbamol or cyclobenzaprine), gabapentin, and ketorolac in the absence of any contraindication. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCAs) were initiated for patients who had inadequate pain control, had pain-related hypertension or tachycardia, or were unable to ambulate or participate in pulmonary toilet. All patients were routinely assessed for their pain levels. However, the use of numerical pain scoring was not consistent amongst the patients and hence, was not included in the study. While there may be minor differences in pain management based on specific surgeon-preference, most of the patients were treated using this protocol. Finally, the decision to prescribe discharge opioid was based on several factors such as surgeon's discretion, the level patient's pain control, and history of chronic opioid use.

### Erector spinae plane block for lumbar spinal surgery: a systematic review [^114weVGG]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pain is often severe in patients undergoing lumbar surgery. Due to postoperative pain, patients are unwilling to get out of bed at an early stage, which affects their recovery. Patient-controlled analgesia or epidural injection analgesia is usually used in the clinic. However, patient-controlled analgesia is prone to opioid-related side effects. Epidural injection is associated with infections, hematomas and other adverse events. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of conventional postoperative analgesia is limited. If the postoperative pain of the lumbar spine could not be effectively relieved, it may develop into chronic pain, affecting the quality of life of the patients.

Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) as a new trunk fascia block technique was proposed in 2016.ESPB has aroused the interest of many nerve block experts. The benefits of ESPB are not yet demonstrated. The specific mechanism is still controversial. Some believethat ESPB can block the posterior root of the spinal nerve and produce part of the paraspinal block effect with the diffusion of the drug solution. Many scholars have applied ESPB to postoperative analgesia in chest and abdomen. Furthermore, they found that ESPB may reduce perioperative muscle relaxation and analgesic drug use. Finneran and co-workers reported that ESPB can provide analgesia for breast surgery. A study reported that ESPB was effective for abdominal analgesia in weight loss surgery. Similarly, a report showed that ESPB relieved postoperative pain in patients with lumbosacral spine surgery, reducing the use of analgesic drugs. Some believed that the analgesic effect of ESPB may be better than that of epidural injection. Reducing the use of analgesic drugs in the perioperative period is beneficial to accelerate the recovery of patients and reduce the cost of hospitalization.

However, few clinical studies have focused on ESPB in lumbar surgery. What is more, there are differences in the mechanism and effect of block in different parts of the erector spinal muscle. Some scholars question the practicability of ESPB in lumbar surgery. Tseng and Xu believe that postoperative analgesia in patients with lumbar spine surgery using a thoracolumbar interfascial plane (TILP) block may be better than ESPB. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically summarize the use of ESPB in lumbar spine surgery so as to better understand and promote this technique and benefit patients undergoing lumbar surgery.

Standardized anesthetic protocol — anesthetic regimens should be designed to facilitate rapid recovery, routine preoperative sedatives should be avoided, and multiple anesthetic techniques are acceptable without evidence of superiority; if general anesthesia is chosen, sevoflurane or desflurane are preferred over isoflurane, and propofol-based total IV anesthesia facilitates rapid recovery and decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while nitrous oxide may increase PONV but this risk is eliminated with aggressive prophylaxis; lung-protective ventilation targets approximately 6 cc/kg ideal body weight and plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O, though higher tidal volumes may be acceptable when low-tidal strategies cannot maintain oxygenation/ventilation; residual neuromuscular blockade is linked to complications and should be fully reversed if nondepolarizing block is used; spinal anesthetics should be tailored for rapid motor recovery; intraoperative analgesia should be multimodal with minimized opioids, and regional techniques, including transverse abdominis plane blocks and local infiltration, should be employed when appropriate.

### Guided imagery and relaxation in conventional colorectal resections: a randomized, controlled, partially blinded trial [^1141oUyx]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to investigate whether brief psychologic interventions to reduce perioperative stress may improve the postoperative course of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Methods

We used a randomized, controlled, partially blinded trial to evaluate the differential effectiveness of two brief psychologic interventions (guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation) on analgesic requirement, pain perception, pulmonary function, duration of postoperative ileus, and fatigue after conventional resection of colorectal carcinoma in elderly cancer patients.

Results

Sixty patients (20 guided imagery, 22 relaxation, 18 control) were evaluated. Acceptance of the brief psychologic interventions was high and 90 percent of the patients indicated that they would recommend it to other patients. Analgesic consumption (P = 0.6) and subjective pain intensity at rest (P = 0.3) and while coughing (P = 0.3) were not different between groups. Recovery of pulmonary function, duration of postoperative ileus, and subjective postoperative fatigue were also not influenced. When the data from intervention groups were pooled, again no benefits were detected compared with the control group.

Conclusions

Brief psychologic interventions such as guided imagery and relaxation yielded a very positive patient response but did not show a clinically relevant influence on the postoperative physiologic course of elderly patients undergoing conventional resections of colorectal cancer.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery pathway for abdominal wall reconstruction: pilot study and preliminary outcomes [^115AW5eh]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways represent a multimodal approach to improve the quality of postoperative care by diminishing the stress response to the trauma of an operation, thereby minimizing hospital length of stay and potentially complications. At a time when healthcare costs are being intensely scrutinized, efforts to reduce patient morbidity and hospital stay are imperative and timely. The success of ERAS fast-track surgery pathways-thoroughly studied in the colorectal literature-has led to their application in other fields. Herein, we present our ERAS pathway for patients undergoing abdominal wall repairs, including the rationale and supporting evidence behind each of its components and our early clinical results after implementation. Although hastened patient recovery is clearly multifactorial, our pathway, incorporating alvimopan, early feeding strategies, and multimodal pain therapy with an emphasis on the reduction of opiate usage as well as precise intraoperative nerve block with novel longer-acting local anesthetic Exparel, appears to provide significant improvement in postoperative pain, bowel function recovery, and shorter hospital stay. Although a prospective evaluation of the entire ERAS pathway as well as contribution of its various components is currently ongoing at our Hernia Center, we believe ours or similar ERAS pathways will soon become standard for the vast majority of patients undergoing abdominal wall surgery.

### Improvement in back pain following abdominoplasty: results of a 10-year, single-surgeon series [^115d1ECa]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Several studies have demonstrated improved spinal stabilization and resultant relief of chronic back pain, and improvement in other quality-of-life metrics following abdominoplasty with rectus plication. In contrast, 1 case report demonstrates improvement in back pain and other functional improvements following abdominoplasty without plication. A single study shows no significant difference in trunk muscle endurance or physical function between patients randomly allocated to undergo abdominoplasty with or without plication, irrespective of diastasis width. Patients in both cohorts showed increased abdominal muscle endurance postoperatively, regardless of plication status. Given the significant increase in operative time and risks associated with abdominal wall plication compared with abdominoplasty without plication, the primary goal of this study was to further delineate differences in outcomes that may exist between the 2 groups.

Several studies have examined functional and radiographic changes in the spine after abdominoplasty with rectus plication in patients with diastasis. Initially, these changes were credited to the wide abdominal rectus plication (WARP) abdominoplasty, which involved an aggressive plication that brought the rectus muscles through a 90° rotation at the midline. Diastasis was thought to decrease efficiency of the abdominal wall musculature, thus predisposing patients with chronic back pain to failure of conservative management and orthopedic interventions that do not address the abdominal wall. After WARP abdominoplasty, patients reported significant relief of chronic back pain, had improved intervertebral space height on MRI, and significant gains in torque strength of the core compared with preoperative values. These early reports concluded that significant tightening of the lateral abdominal musculature and the subsequent increase in intra-abdominal pressure was necessary to improve spinal stabilization and reduce back pain. More recently, studies have demonstrated similar clinical and radiographic improvements in patients undergoing abdominoplasty with limited rectus plication. A recent prospective, multicenter study showed improvement in both chronic back pain and urinary incontinence following abdominoplasty with a variety of different limited plication techniques in postpartum females. Contrary to earlier studies, current literature suggests that a limited plication can improve vertebral angles and relieve pressure on the spine, while avoiding the potential complications of abdominoplasty with wide plication previously described.

### Abdominal fascial plication and the risk of venous thromboembolism in abdominoplasty patients: a systematic review of the literature [^1138JKZW]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal Pressure

Huang et al, in a unique, controlled, and frequently cited study, compared intra-abdominal pressures between abdominoplasty patients and breast reduction patients, finding no significant difference in pressures before, during, or after surgery. All pressures were < 20 mm Hg, considered clinically unimportant. A recent study of intraoperative intra-abdominal pressures in 46 postbariatric patients undergoing a circumferential fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty with rectus plication reported pressures < 10 mm Hg and no cases of VTE.

Two publications reported increased common femoral vein diameters in breast reconstruction patients undergoing abdominal free flaps. The authors believe these findings support the bottleneck theory leading to venous stasis in patients who undergo plication of the rectus fascia (in this case because of flap harvesting as opposed to abdominoplasty). A limitation of these studies was the absence of a control group. Moreover, the data points do not fit the physical law relating flow velocity to vessel diameter, which is exponential rather than linear. Any percentage increase in vessel diameter must be associated with a larger percentage decrease in flow rate to maintain the same cardiac output because of the inverse squared relationship between these variables. One case report also documented a temporary increase in the proximal femoral vein diameter and decreased flow velocity after abdominal wall plication in a breast reconstruction patient treated with a pedicled transversus abdominus flap. None of the studies ultrasonically evaluating the proximal femoral vein found evidence of a DVT.

Anesthesia

An important factor in VTE risk, and one that often goes unmentioned (and is not considered in the Caprini score)is the type of anesthesia. Whenever possible, muscle relaxation should be avoided. This author does not use muscle relaxation during surgery. Patients breathe spontaneously using a laryngeal mask airway. The calf muscle pump is preserved, reducing VTE risk. There is no need for sequential compression devices, which have been shown to be ineffective in plastic surgery outpatients.

An underrecognized benefit of total intravenous anesthesia without muscle paralysis is the fact that any change in respirations that may be caused by overtightening of the fascial layer is easy to detect. This valuable clinical sign is unavailable when patients are mechanically ventilated.

### Peri-operative management of neuromuscular blockade: a guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care [^115fEN7E]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent data indicated a high incidence of inappropriate management of neuromuscular block, with a high rate of residual paralysis and relaxant-associated postoperative complications. These data are alarming in that the available neuromuscular monitoring, as well as myorelaxants and their antagonists basically allow well tolerated management of neuromuscular blockade. In this first European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) guideline on peri-operative management of neuromuscular block, we aim to present aggregated and evidence-based recommendations to assist clinicians provide best medical care and ensure patient safety. We identified three main clinical questions: Are myorelaxants necessary to facilitate tracheal intubation in adults? Does the intensity of neuromuscular blockade influence a patient's outcome in abdominal surgery? What are the strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of residual paralysis? On the basis of this, PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) questions were derived that guided a structured literature search. A stepwise approach was used to reduce the number of trials of the initial research (n = 24000) to the finally relevant clinical studies (n = 88). GRADE methodology (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used for formulating the recommendations based on the findings of the included studies in conjunction with their methodological quality. A two-step Delphi process was used to determine the agreement of the panel members with the recommendations: R1 We recommend using a muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation (1A). R2 We recommend the use of muscle relaxants to reduce pharyngeal and/or laryngeal injury following endotracheal intubation (1C). R3 We recommend the use of a fast-acting muscle relaxant for rapid sequence induction intubation (RSII) such as succinylcholine 1mg·kg⁻¹ or rocuronium 0.9 to 1.2mg·kg⁻¹ (1B). R4 We recommend deepening neuromuscular blockade if surgical conditions need to be improved (1B). R5 There is insufficient evidence to recommend deep neuromuscular blockade in general to reduce postoperative pain or decrease the incidence of peri-operative complications. (2C). R6 We recommend the use of ulnar nerve stimulation and quantitative neuromuscular monitoring at the adductor pollicis muscle to exclude residual paralysis (1B). R7 We recommend using sugammadex to antagonise deep, moderate and shallow neuromuscular blockade induced by aminosteroidal agents (rocuronium, vecuronium) (1A). R8 We recommend advanced spontaneous recovery (i.e. TOF ratio > 0.2) before starting neostigmine-based reversal and to continue quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade until a TOF ratio of more than 0.9 has been attained.

### Putting it all together: recommendations for improving pain management in plastic surgical procedures [^114QHoGV]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

The benefits of optimal pain management are well recognized. Nevertheless, treatment of postoperative pain continues to be a major challenge, and inadequate postoperative pain relief remains disturbingly high. One of the reasons for suboptimal pain management may be related to inadequate or improper application of available analgesic therapies. Use of patient-specific and procedure-specific pain management strategies should improve pain control and consequently improve perioperative outcome, including early ambulation, ability to perform rehabilitation activities, and return to activities of daily living. This article discusses the current evidence that should allow improved postoperative pain control with emphasis on the use of procedure-specific pain management.

### Abdominoplasty as an acute postoperative pain model: insights from 8 years of clinical trials [^111QnvAh]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1.4.1.2. Full abdominoplasty

Incision is made from iliac crest to iliac crest; surgical wound encompasses the umbilicus
Skin can be removed from as far as from the xiphoid to the pubic bone
Umbilicus is removed, reconstructed, and repositioned
Always requires plication of the rectus muscle
Extensive fascial plication
Extensive repair and suture of abdominal wall muscle and fascia
Moderate to extensive abdominal liposuction
Surgery can take up to 2 1/2 hours or more

Because mini and full abdominoplasties are different surgeries with different degrees of tissue dissection, they have different pain trajectories. In an ideal analgesic study, the pain trajectory associated with the chosen surgical model matches up with the expected onset, potency, and offset of the experimental agent (the model gives rise to the most pain when the drug is most potent). So whether full abdominoplasty or mini abdominoplasty is a better choice for a given study depends in part on the expected characteristics of the study drug.

Figure 3.
Seeking a level of postoperative pain where an effective drug provides relief, but placebo does not.

The ideal model gives rise to a level of postoperative pain where an effective drug provides relief, but placebo does not (Fig. 3). Cooper 5 likened an analgesic study to an Olympic high jump bar. Assuming the investigational drug actually works, the goal is to design a study where the "bar" (postoperative pain) is at height where study drug can clear it but placebo cannot (Fig. 3 B). With a bar that is too low (ie, not enough pain generated by surgery [Fig. 3 A]), both placebo and study drug will provide relief, and the study fails. With a bar that is too high (too much pain generated by surgery [Fig. 3 C]), neither study drug nor placebo will provide adequate relief, and the study fails. To best differentiate an effective study drug from placebo, one must match the model and design of a study with the expected characteristics of a drug and choose a model that generates only as much pain as the drug can reliably relieve.

### Abdominoplasty as an acute postoperative pain model: insights from 8 years of clinical trials [^114K3QZk]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

The pain signal from full abdominoplasty is typically of greater intensity than that of mini abdominoplasty, and full abdominoplasty pain lasts longer than mini abdominoplasty pain (approximately 72 vs 48 hours). For a study drug believed to be highly potent (comparable with narcotic analgesia), full abdominoplasty may be the better choice. For a drug believed to have moderate potency (comparable with NSAIDs or acetaminophen), mini abdominoplasty is likely the better choice.

1.4.2. Anesthetic and analgesic procedures

For most studies, the goal of the anesthetic regimen is for subjects to wake up in the recovery room shortly after surgery presenting as alert, capable of answering questions or following instructions, and either experiencing moderate pain or on the verge of doing so. In general, abdominoplasties in clinical trials are performed under general anesthesia, often using propofol with or without muscle relaxants or volatile anesthetics. Small doses of short-acting preoperative or intraoperative opioids (100 µg of fentanyl with supplementation as needed) are used for analgesia.

### Outpatient abdominoplasty under conscious sedation [^116KqZgJ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

According to the authors, advantages of outpatient abdominoplasty performed with the patient under conscious sedation are decreased nausea and vomiting and greatly reduced risk of deep venous thrombosis. Sharp dissection without electrocautery, preservation of perforators, and a plane of dissection that preserves lymphatic vessels has provided rapid recovery, minimal need for postoperative narcotics, and a low complication rate.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^115gku6n]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Neuraxial and regional anesthesia — As opioid-minimizing strategies, neuraxial and regional anesthesia effects on PONV are challenging to evaluate due to underreporting and variable protocols. In a comprehensive network meta-analysis of inguinal hernia repairs, transversus abdominis plane, quadratus lumborum, and caudal blocks were more effective than systemic opioid administration in preventing PONV, though their advantage over local wound infiltration was uncertain. Additional meta-analyses showed conflicting results, with a reduction in PONV from erector spinae plane blocks but no benefit from serratus anterior plane blocks. Overall adoption should be tailored to the surgical intervention and patient factors (C1).

### Ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block for postoperative pain in abdominoplasty: a randomized controlled study [^116ajpsY]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain after abdominoplasty can delay postoperative ambulation, leading to life-threatening complications. Previous reports have shown the utility of quadratus lumborum block in providing adequate pain relief and avoiding side effects after numerous abdominal operations. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to demonstrate the efficacy of the quadratus lumborum block in abdominoplasty.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to receive a bilateral quadratus lumborum block with either ropivacaine or normal saline. Postoperative cumulative analgesic medication consumption, pain severity at rest and on movement, and quality of recovery were evaluated and compared in both groups.

Results

Twenty patients were allocated to each group. Total morphine dose received in the postanesthesia care unit was lower in the ropivacaine group than in the control group, with a mean of 3.4 mg and 6.6 mg, respectively. Cumulative tramadol consumption per patient in the first 48 hours postoperatively was significantly lower in the ropivacaine group compared with the control group (42.5 mg versus 190 mg; p = 0.0031). The Numeric Rating Scale both at rest and with effort was significantly lower in the ropivacaine group compared with the control group. The median quality of recovery for the ropivacaine group was 133 compared with 112 for the control group (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Quadratus lumborum block in abdominoplasty reduces postoperative pain and opioid consumption and improves the quality of recovery. Further studies are needed to compare the quadratus lumborum block to more traditional blocks.

### Invited discussion on: mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone in body contouring surgery for post massive weight loss patients: is this good enough? [^117MonHS]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Petersen et al. completed all their cases in less than 3 hours. Their only combination procedure was breast surgery and brachioplasty, although breast procedures are not listed among the types of procedures performed. Liposuction is not listed either. To expedite surgery, two surgeons and two assistants operated simultaneously. Is operating time an independent risk factor for VTEs? Hardy et al. concluded that surgery that exceeds 3 hours poses additional risk. However, this association could not be isolated from confounding variables related to procedure complexity. When these other variables are eliminated, such as in single-procedure series (facelifts, for example), this time correlation disappears. Swanson generally limits operating times to less than 6 hours, not because this length of time holds special meaning but because it is a loose marker for the extent of surgery. Patients quite understandably prefer to have one operation rather than two. Abdominoplasty, liposuction, and augmentation/mastopexy may be safely performed together by experienced surgeons. Effective regional anesthesia and vasoconstriction using (warmed) wetting solutions help to limit blood loss and reduce systemic anesthesia and fluid requirements.

Anesthesia is an important, and often overlooked (it is not considered in the Caprini score), consideration. Petersen et al. use general endotracheal anesthesia exclusively. By contrast, Swanson routinely performs surgery, including lower body lifts, on patients treated with intravenous propofol, a laryngeal mask airway, and no muscle relaxation ("SAFE" Anesthesia — Spontaneous breathing, Avoid gas, Face up, Extremities mobile). Total intravenous anesthesia reduces VTE risk. Paralysis is avoided to preserve a functioning calf muscle pump during surgery. Prone positioning, with its additional anesthetic considerations, unfavorable body positioning, and unsuitability for combined breast surgery (usually done first to optimize sterility), is eliminated. The objective is to disturb the patient's physiology as little as possible during surgery. A 6-hour total intravenous anesthetic in a spontaneously breathing patient is likely to be more physiologic than a 3-hour anesthetic in a patient who is intubated, paralyzed, prone, and receiving positive pressure ventilation and anesthetic gas. Postoperative side effects such as nausea and sedation are minimized. In keeping with the emphasis on enhanced recovery, patients are discharged home after a mean recovery room stay of 51 minutes.

### A proposed classification and treatment algorithm for rectus diastasis: a prospective study [^112RN8JV]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The finger-width method is used preoperatively and postoperatively. It primarily functions as a screening tool to detect the presence or absence of RD.
Ultrasound imaging (USI) is performed in all patients preoperatively to localize any concomitant hernia.
During surgery, measurement of rectus diastasis is performed using a standardized ruler to ensure symmetric plication. The diastasis is better visualized if needed using electrocautery by stimulating the rectus muscles. The intraoperative measurements are taken in maximum inspiration and are not significantly increased due to muscle relaxants given during the procedure.

Classification

A four-type classification system is described to define the deformities and tailor a treatment plan to each individual. Details are demonstrated in Table 1. An example of the RD classification is shown in Fig. 1.

Table 1
Four-type classification system and treatment algorithm

Fig. 1
Schematic demonstration of rectus diastasis classification

Only relevant aspects of the abdominoplasty procedure are mentioned.

Preoperative Steps

A standardized antimicrobial and antithrombotic protocol are applied in every patient undergoing abdominoplasty.

The Caprini score (2005) is calculated. Antithrombotic socks and Flowtron boots are placed before the surgery, and knees are bent 10–15° using a pillow. An electric blanket is used, surgical room temperature is set at 20–22°C and warm fluids are used to avoid hypothermia. Also, patients are advised to eliminate smoking and food supplements/aspirin/anti-inflammatory drugs two weeks before surgery. If indicated, chemoprophylaxis is used.

3.9. Demographics

Pooled demographic data from 5 studies with published results, totaling 1231 patients, are presented below. Abdominoplasty in clinical research is overwhelmingly performed on female patients, which matches clinical practice: a study of over 25,000 abdominoplasties in clinical practice found that 97% of patients were female. Programs with a regulatory or market requirement for exposures to male patients will require alternate or additional models.

The mean subject BMI is relatively low at 26.95, which reflects abdominoplasty data from clinical practice — 2 studies reviewing relatively large samples of abdominoplasty patients found mean BMIs of 26 and 27.5, respectively. Although the abdominoplasty procedure can be performed concurrently with liposuction, it is not a weight loss surgery per se but rather serves to cosmetically tighten the appearance of the abdomen by manipulation of the skin, ligaments, and muscle tissue.

Table 8 shows subject demographics for studies with available data.

3.10. Adverse events

Among studies with published articles or posters, the most common adverse events in the placebo arms across studies (and thus not secondary to the study drug or comparator) were as follows:
Nausea, which was reported in 5/5 studies and occurred at an average rate across studies of 31%.
Headache, which was reported in 4/5 studies and occurred at an average rate across studies of 18.3%

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: PROSPECT methodology [^112h2Nra]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The PROSPECT sub‐group then determines if each intervention should be recommended or not recommended. To be recommended the intervention must be shown to be beneficial in at least two RCTs. Studies are not excluded from the review based on the risk of bias scoring. Additionally, to ensure clinical relevance, the relevance to current peri‐operative practice is assessed. Likewise, we assess if the intervention would improve postoperative pain relief and/or outcomes when added to the 'basic analgesic regimen' or would be beneficial if this regimen is not possible or is contra‐indicated. Furthermore, the balance between the invasiveness of the analgesic technique and the consequences of postoperative pain, as well as a balance between the analgesic efficacy and the adverse event profile of the analgesic technique is also considered. In addition, relevant patient characteristics (e.g. opioid tolerance and psychiatric comorbidities) may be included to ensure not only procedure‐specific but also patient‐specific aspects of pain management. Of note, efficacy data from 'similar' procedures are not used for recommendations. Adverse effects of analgesic interventions are identified through an extensive literature search, which is not procedure‐specific; however, risks are adjusted for the procedure being evaluated. Case–control studies and cohort studies or observational studies can be used to determine adverse effects of analgesic interventions.

Finally, a draft table or algorithm of the recommendations of analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions is prepared with each recommendation assigned a grade based on the overall level of evidence and balance of clinical practice information and evidence (Table 1).

The proposed recommendations are then sent to all members of the Working Group along with data extraction files, included studies and excluded studies with reasons for exclusion, level of evidence of the included studies and reasons for recommending or not recommending interventions. Members of the Working Group also have access to the publications of included studies so that they can review the evidence for themselves. Five questions are then asked of the Working Group about each recommendation:
Is the recommended intervention clinically relevant?
Does it add to the 'basic analgesic' technique?
Does the balance between efficacy and adverse effects allow recommendation?
Does the balance between invasiveness of the analgesic intervention and degree of pain after surgery allow recommendation?
Are the reasons for not recommending an analgesic intervention appropriate?

### Perioperative versus postoperative celecoxib on patient outcomes after major plastic surgery procedures [^116M6sUC]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy continues to surround the use of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors in the perioperative period. We designed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine the hypothesis that administration of celecoxib preoperatively or postoperatively and for 3 days after major plastic surgery would improve pain control and clinically important patient outcomes. Another objective of the study was to determine whether perioperative administration of celecoxib offered any advantages over postoperative administration alone.

Methods

One hundred and twenty healthy consenting patients undergoing major plastic surgery (e.g., breast augmentation, abdominoplasty procedures) using a standardized general anesthetic technique were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 1) control group (n = 40) received two placebos orally before and after surgery, as well as one placebo BID for 3 days after surgery; 2) postoperative group (n = 40) received two placebos before surgery and 2 celecoxib 200 mg p.o. after surgery, followed by one celecoxib 200 mg p.o. BID on postoperative day #1, #2 and #3; and 3) perioperative group (n = 40) received 2 celecoxib 200 mg p.o. 30–90 min before surgery, and two placebos after surgery, followed by one celecoxib 200 mg p.o. BID on postoperative day #1, #2, and #3. Pain scores, the need for rescue analgesics, and side effects were recorded at specific time intervals in the postoperative period. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 24, 48, 72 h, and 7 days after surgery to assess postdischarge pain, analgesic requirements, return of bowel function, resumption of normal daily activities, quality of recovery, as well as patient satisfaction with pain management.

Results

Compared with the control group, the two celecoxib groups had similar significant reductions in postoperative pain and need for opioid analgesics during the first three postoperative days (P < 0.01). Patients recovered bowel function 1 day earlier and resumed normal activities 2 days earlier in the celecoxib groups. In addition, patient satisfaction with pain management and quality of recovery were significantly improved in the celecoxib (versus control) groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Celecoxib (400 mg p.o.) administered on the day of surgery and for 3 days postoperatively is effective in improving postoperative pain management, as well as the speed and quality of recovery after major plastic surgery. However, perioperative administration offers no advantages over simply giving the drug after surgery.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bupivacaine hydrochloride implant in patients undergoing abdominoplasty [^117S1GPc]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment with INL-001 was associated with significantly less pain during the first 24 hours following abdominoplasty surgery compared with placebo. This is similar to the results of open inguinal hernia studies conducted with INL-001and is clinically relevant since the first 24 hours after surgery are generally the most painful for soft tissue surgeries like abdominoplasty.

The primary analgesic outcome of this study was pain intensity, specifically SPI24 resulting from repeat pain intensity measurements. While there is no established clinical threshold for SPI endpoints, repeat measurement of pain intensity with analysis over a period of time was chosen as the primary efficacy outcome based on the FDA recommendation to use a well-defined and reliable patient-reported outcome measure of the subject's pain intensity which allows for frequent pain intensity measurements at preselected timepoints during the trial to measure the effect of a non-opioid analgesic effect over time. In addition, SPI is a common measure in pain trials.

This study was underpowered for the first key secondary endpoint (SPI48) in the statistical hierarchy and not powered for the remaining key secondary endpoints of this study. There was in increase in pain intensity variability between patients as time from surgery increased, which is not surprising given the subjective nature of pain measurement and differences in recovery between patients postoperatively. This variability impacted the ability to demonstrate statistical significance. Given the numeric differences in favor of INL-001 on the key secondary endpoints, further study of these outcomes with INL-001 could be warranted.

In this study, INL-001 was well tolerated. The percentage of INL-001 patients (84%) reporting any AEs was similar to the placebo group (87%). The types of AEs in this study are expected after surgery, general anesthesia, or abdominoplasty specifically, or can be seen with opioid use. In addition, the incidence and types of AEs were comparable or lower than reported in placebo or bupivacaine-treated groups in other abdominoplasty studies.

### Postoperative opioid prescribing after female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery [^116j5RJv]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) — postoperative opioid use across randomized and prospective studies is generally low, with quantified consumption and refill needs. In an ICE-T multimodal analgesia trial, patients in the ICE-T arm "used no opioids", whereas the standard group "used an average of 4.6 tablets of oxycodone/ acetaminophen (34.5 MME)". In a randomized study of vaginal hysterectomy with sacrocolpopexy, the "median total opioid use… was 52.5 mg MME… and 46 mg MME". After posterior colporrhaphy/perineorrhaphy, both groups had low requirements over 72 hours ("median, 22.5 mg MME in each group"). With a standardized discharge prescription of "20 tablets of 5 mg of oxycodone", median consumption was "22.5… for native tissue apical reconstruction, 15.0… for mesh-augmented apical reconstruction, 6 for colpopexy, and 7.5 for isolated perineorrhaphy"; "40% of participants denied postoperative opioid consumption" and "Eight percent of patients received an opioid prescription refill". Across prospective cohorts, mean and median postoperative use was "less than 10 to 15 tablets" for major surgery and "less than 5 to 10 tablets" for minor surgery, with refill rates "between 6% and 13%". Overall, most patients without chronic pain will use about "15 tablets of 5 mg of oxycodone (11.25 mg MME) or less" after discharge, although lower prescribing may increase postoperative refill rates "of 10.6% to 18%".

### Multimodal pain control in abdominoplasty: a systematic review and algorithm of optimal pain management [^111fybqF]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The procedure with the highest rate of opioid prescription in plastic surgery is abdominoplasty. Additionally, plastic surgery patients are at a particularly elevated risk of becoming opioid-dependent. The main objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and create an algorithm for a multimodal pain regimen specific to patients undergoing abdominoplasty. A systematic search of the research literature was performed to summarize the prevailing understanding of multimodal pain control in the management of abdominoplasty. The initial search yielded 448 articles. Sixty-eight manuscripts were identified for full-text review. The effectiveness of current strategies was evaluated by way of pain scores, opioid usage, and length of stay, as well as other measures of physical function such as time to early mobilization. In 32 studies involving 2451 patients, the efficacy of different pain regimens during abdominoplasty was evaluated. Among nontraditional, opioid-sparing analgesia, efficacy of treatment interventions for improved pain and decreased opioid usage was found inall studies. Among local infusion studies, efficacy of treatment interventions for improved pain and decreased opioid usage was found in 78% of studies. Last, among regional block studies, efficacy of treatment interventions for improved pain was found in 87%, with 73% efficacy for decreased opioid usage. Multimodal pain regimens in abdominoplasty have the potential to play an important role in opioid-sparing practices in medicine by incorporating nonopioid pain adjuvants such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and transversus abdominis plane blocks in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods.

### Use of a combination of diaphragmatic ultrasound and muscle relaxation monitoring in predicting post-extubation adverse respiratory events among elderly patients in an anesthesia intensive care unit [^117T9fU5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients in the AICU usually have complications due to other systemic diseases, poor intraoperative conditions, older age, and postoperative adverse events. Additionally, extubation after general anesthesia is a high-risk perioperative event. If the extubation is done too early, it can result in respiratory adverse events, while late extubation can increase the risk of complications such as pulmonary infection. Accurate and timely extubation during resuscitation can lessen the anesthetic intake and prevent ventilator-related injury. Therefore, this procedure is a critical link in the treatment of patients in the AICU, especially with the growing popularity of accelerated rehabilitation post-surgery. Accurately predicting adverse respiratory events after extubation in elderly patients in the AICU and early interventions can significantly benefit patients by reducing pain, improving their comfort, and minimizing postoperative complications.

Clinicians who perform extubation generally rely on their clinical experience; that is, they perform the extubation based on the recovery of muscle strength by judging the patient's grip strength, tongue extension, leg lifting, and other actions. Physiological changes in the elderly cause the metabolism of muscle relaxation drugs in elderly patients to differ from that in young people, and this makes them more vulnerable to postoperative residual curarization (PORC). Residual muscle relaxation can induce serious harm in elderly patients and can increase the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, which is not favorable for the prognosis in such patients. Currently, extubation is considered safe when muscle relaxation monitoring TOFr is > 0.9.

In this study, the clinician was blinded to the patient's muscle relaxation value when performing the extubation. We found that about 45.9% of the patients had a TOFr < 0.9 when undergoing extubation, and this was slightly lower than the residual rate of muscle relaxation in the study by Murphy et al. This confirms that there are obvious deficiencies in extubation performed based on experience. We found that 4.6% of the patients had a TOFr < 0.6, which was significantly lower than the 22.9% incidence of TOFr < 0.6 after abdominal surgery reported by Yu et al. This difference may be due to the safety monitoring provided in the AICU, due to which, after a period of sedation, the patients shifted to the AICU had a more complete recovery of muscle relaxation, allowing for a more accurate timing of extubation. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis confirmed that extubation under muscle relaxation monitoring could predict the occurrence of respiratory adverse events post-extubation in elderly patients after laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer.

### Transversus abdominis plane block reduces the analgesic requirements after abdominoplasty with flank liposuction [^114YCaNP]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a technique of locoregional anesthesia that blocks the sensorial afferent nerves localized between the transversus abdominis muscle and the internal oblique muscle. We describe results obtained with a case control study between patients undergoing abdominoplasty with the TAP block compared with a similar group of patients not receiving the block.

Materials and Methods

Medical notes were reviewed, and patients were classified according to the presence of TAP. Outcomes evaluated were the requirements of morphine in the first postoperative hour and the number of co-codamol tablets administered afterward.

Results

Seventy-five patients were screened. No intra- or postoperative complications were recorded. TAP+ patients required significantly less analgesia during the first 12 postoperative hours (P < 0.001). The patients with increased body mass index and large flap resected were more likely to fail the anesthetic block and required postoperative analgesia.

Conclusions

In aesthetic abdominal surgery, the TAP block is safe, is performed without ultrasound guidance, and markedly reduces the requirement of postoperative opioid analgesia. Future studies will now confirm these results and evaluate the consequences in terms of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and overall satisfaction of patients.

### AAOS / METRC clinical practice guideline summary: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^111j6Mqn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Guided relaxation therapy — Implementation considerations note there seem to be no obvious harms from use of these modalities, and, if future research supports its use, there is the potential benefit of improved patient outcomes and lower opioid use. The interventions in the noted studies were provided by a variety of healthcare professionals and researchers, and there would be costs associated with the use of this modality for initial and continued training that would need to be balanced with improvements in patient outcomes (and decreased lengths of stay) and opioid use. Patients are accustomed to interventions or medications for pain control, and there would need to be assessment of acceptance among patients undergoing surgical treatment in the US and education among healthcare professionals in the US about the potential use and impact of these techniques. Feasibility may be limited because guided relaxation therapy may not be available to patients undergoing outpatient surgery or in locations where the availability of therapists/biofeedback machines are limited, the cost of these technique and need to have access to appropriately trained personnel could limit use especially in rural/frontier or smaller hospitals, and time needed for patient interaction may be challenging given time constraints in most healthcare systems.

### Abdominoplasty as an acute postoperative pain model: insights from 8 years of clinical trials [^116jPdRg]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

1.4. Clinical characteristics of abdominoplasty as an experimental model

Abdominoplasty requires a larger (and thus more painful) surgical incision compared with other common soft-tissue models (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Abdominoplasty incision compared with other common soft-tissue surgeries.

Abdominoplasty is an elective cosmetic surgery designed to remove excess skin and adipose tissue from the lower abdomen and tighten abdominal muscles and fascia, to give the abdomen an improved appearance. The exact cosmetic issues that abdominoplasty patients present with can be fairly variable in clinical practice. As such, there are multiple forms of abdominoplasty surgery involving varying techniques, including different incision lengths, different incision placements, and different degrees of tissue removal. For an overview of standard surgical techniques used for abdominoplasty in practice, please see Regan (2020).

In clinical practice, secondary or collateral procedures (such as liposuction outside the immediate area of the abdominoplasty incision, breast lift, etc.) are often performed concurrently with abdominoplasty. But most research studies seek to minimize collateral procedures by strict requirements in the study surgical protocol, to guarantee relatively standardized surgeries across subjects. Abdominoplasties performed in acute pain postoperative studies typically fall into 1 of 2 types: partial or "mini" abdominoplasty or full abdominoplasty.

Mini abdominoplasty and full abdominoplasty use different surgical techniques (Fig. 2).

Figure 2.

1.4.1.1. Mini abdominoplasty

A 12″ to 16″ incision is made roughly from iliac crest to iliac crest, below the umbilicus
Skin and fat are removed roughly from the pubic bone to below the umbilicus
Umbilicus remains in place
May or may not involve rectus plication, depending on whether or not the patient presents with rectus diastasis (a bulging of the rectus muscle, requiring tightening)
Minimal to no abdominal liposuction

Studies were identified by searches of the NIH National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google search. We included only randomized, placebo-controlled studies that were intended to evaluate the efficacy of investigational analgesic drugs for the purpose of U.S. regulatory approval. Studies designed for U.S. regulatory approval are well-suited to our analysis because they share the following characteristics:
These studies typically use single-agent therapy, rather than multimodal therapy, as the experimental treatment
These studies recruit from a homogenous patient population and use standardized surgical and anesthetic variables
These studies domicile patients in in-patient units for the entire treatment period in which postoperative pain is measured for the study's primary efficacy endpoint

Of the 13 studies collected, 11 had published data available, whether in the form of a published article, poster, public results on, or a press release highlighting topline results. Of these, 2 incorporated additional surgical models besides abdominoplasty and public data were not separated by the model. These were removed from the analysis, leaving 9 abdominoplasty-only studies with public results.

Table 2 shows 13 abdominoplasty studies reviewed for our analysis.

### AAOS / METRC clinical practice guideline summary: pharmacologic, physical, and cognitive pain alleviation for musculoskeletal extremity / pelvis surgery [^116mxV1V]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Guided relaxation therapy — There is no significant difference in pain and opioid use outcomes between guided relaxation therapy and standard treatment, and the Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Guided relaxation therapy includes progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery with or without therapeutic touch. Three moderate quality studies met inclusion criteria, and one study found no differences in reported pain or opioid use among patients receiving guided imagery or therapeutic touch, compared to patients receiving usual care.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bupivacaine hydrochloride implant in patients undergoing abdominoplasty [^112tFgVi]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Most wound-healing AEs were mild or moderate. There was one serious AE reported in the study. The patient (placebo) experienced a wound infection at a drain site that required hospitalization. The patient recovered. The majority of reported wound dehiscence events occurred at one center and was likely influenced by surgical postoperative management and medical experience of the assessor. Results from the Southampton Wound Grading System are provided in online supplemental material 5.

There were no clinically meaningful effects on laboratory test results, vital sign parameters, physical examinations, electrocardiography parameters, and concomitant medication (other than described for rescue pain medication).

### Prediction of postoperative pain and opioid consumption using intraoperative surgical pleth index after surgical incision: an observational study [^111nTbua]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

After surgery, 200 mg sugammadex was injected to reverse the muscle relaxant. After evaluation of orientation regarding person and place, the pain score was assessed with a numerical rating scale (NRS) at rest in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients with complaints of NRS ≥ 4 or with request of analgesics were treated with intravenous hydromorphone 0.01 mg/kg. Pain intensity was reassessed and treated every 10 min.

Postoperative pain was controlled by rescue analgesics administered by hospital personnel in addition to IV-PCA. Patients with complaints of NRS ≥ 4 or with request of analgesics in the ward were treated with intravenous pethidine 50 mg. The complete history of continuous infusion, bolus infusion, and bolus demand for the IV-PCA device was downloaded after surgery.

### Standardization of the extent and timing of rectus diastasis repair in abdominoplasty cases with TOF neuromuscular monitoring: a clinical study [^1156fH1N]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the close focus on the anterior abdominal wall and the classification, maneuvers and materials related to the rectus abdominis and its fascia, there is no established standard concerning the extent of plication. The anterior abdominal wall is a musculoaponeurotic structure and a dynamic motor system with innervation and tonus. Therefore, the timing of the plication is as important as the suture technique and material, since the muscle relaxant will lose its effect in varying time periods. The aims of our study were to determine the change in the amount of plication between groups with and without muscle relaxants before plication and whether the amount of this change can be standardized using train-of-four (TOF) monitoring. In 2022 and 2023, 12 women aged between 25 and 48 years with a body mass index between 24 and 38 years were included in the study. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by train-of-four (TOF) monitoring in all patients. Maximum plication areas at above-zero TOF value and zero TOF value were calculated and compared with each other. The reduction in the area of group 1, which represents the phase without muscle relaxant, and group 2, which represents the phase with neuromuscular blockade, were compared using the t-test. When assessed for above-zero TOF, the area between plication lines (a, a') was always smaller than the area between the plication lines (b, b') when the TOF value was zero. The t test comparison of group 1, which includes (a, a') values, and group 2, which includes (b, b') values, resulted in a value of p = 0.000. All cases, the plication value obtained with above-zero TOF value was lower than the plication value when the TOF value was zero. This difference was also confirmed statistically on a group basis. This suggests that neuromuscular measurements should be taken during the plication phase in the routine flow of surgery. Muscle relaxants are not routinely administered to patients undergoing abdominoplasty or rectus diastasis repair who are already under sufficient analgesia, unless there is a pressure alert on the anesthesia device. The surgeon cannot always determine the degree of muscle laxity accurately by palpation. TOF monitoring is a cost-effective quantitative method that can be easily and quickly performed, accurately determining the timing of muscle-fascia plication of the rectus abdominis. Through this approach, the anterior abdominal wall can be plicated with maximum tightness and maximum aesthetic gain can be obtained.
