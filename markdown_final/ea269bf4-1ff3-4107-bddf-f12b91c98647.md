## Question

4 year old Patient swallowed metal fb (coin) 2 cm. If it is located in the stomach safe for discharge?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to discharge a 4-year-old who swallowed a 2 cm metal coin that is now in the stomach and is asymptomatic, and what evidence-based management steps and cautions should be given. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nature of the object and whether this could actually be a battery or magnet requiring urgent action. Then, I should confirm the anatomic location and its implications for risk and management. Next, I will consider size thresholds for spontaneous passage versus need for endoscopic removal. After that, I need to weigh guideline-based recommendations for asymptomatic children with blunt gastric foreign bodies. I will also review any toxicity concerns from coin dissolution and how that influences management. Finally, I should outline follow-up, imaging needs, and explicit safety-net instructions before deciding on discharge.

> Let me first confirm the object characteristics and the immediate risk profile. Coins are blunt, non-sharp, and non-magnetic objects; the urgent removal pathway is generally reserved for button batteries, multiple magnets, sharp objects, or complete esophageal obstruction, so I need to be sure we are not misidentifying a button battery before proceeding with conservative care [^112Znt1W] [^116G3SER].

> I need to check the anatomic location next. Once a coin has passed the esophagus and is in the stomach, the risk of airway compromise and esophageal pressure injury essentially resolves, and the key question becomes whether it will traverse the pylorus and beyond without intervention, which is largely driven by object size and shape [^116VFyP7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about passage; I should verify the size thresholds. Objects larger than about 25 mm in diameter are unlikely to pass the pylorus and are commonly considered for endoscopic removal from the stomach, whereas smaller blunt objects typically pass spontaneously; here, the coin is 20 mm, which is below that commonly cited 25 mm cutoff, making spontaneous passage highly likely in a healthy child [^115TdN5C] [^116VFyP7].

> Next, I should review guideline direction for asymptomatic patients with blunt objects in the stomach. ESGE guidance supports clinical observation without endoscopic removal for asymptomatic ingestion of blunt, small objects that are not batteries or magnets, and outpatient management is appropriate when feasible; this aligns with a watchful waiting approach in this child given the size and location [^112Znt1W] [^115UugNu].

> Wait, let me verify potential metal toxicity concerns before finalizing observation. In vitro data show coins can corrode in gastric acid with small percentages of weight loss and measurable ion release over hours to days, but clinically significant systemic toxicity from a single coin is uncommon; rare reports describe nickel-related urticaria, which is notable but not a general indication for preemptive retrieval in an otherwise well child, especially when the coin is likely to pass [^1137MCJ2] [^114Z7xZt] [^114eg7UW].

> I should double-check the need for repeat imaging or adjunctive detection during follow-up. For an asymptomatic child with a known small blunt coin in the stomach, routine repeat radiographs are not strictly required if caregivers can monitor stools and return promptly for red flags; if confirmation of passage is needed without radiation, a handheld metal detector can accurately detect and localize coins, which may be a practical tool in some settings [^112Znt1W] [^111RD1v9].

> But wait, what if the coin does not pass or symptoms emerge? I need to ensure clear safety-netting: caregivers should return urgently for abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, fever, hematochezia/melena, respiratory symptoms, or if the coin has not been observed to pass in 1–2 weeks, at which point reassessment and imaging are reasonable; persistent gastric retention beyond several days to a couple of weeks — or any new symptoms — should prompt consideration of endoscopic retrieval despite the initial low-risk profile [^112Znt1W] [^115TdN5C].

> Let me reconsider any pitfalls before deciding on discharge. Misidentification of a button battery as a coin would change management entirely; therefore, if there is any uncertainty, obtain or review radiographs promptly to distinguish a battery (double-rim/halo sign) and proceed with urgent removal if a battery is identified, since batteries in the esophagus or stomach — particularly in young children — can cause rapid injury and often warrant expedited removal [^116G3SER] [^116js9x5].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm that all low-risk criteria are met: a single blunt object, diameter under 25 mm, gastric location, and an asymptomatic child with reliable caregivers. Given that, guideline-consistent care is discharge with expectant management, stool monitoring for passage, and explicit return precautions, without routine repeat imaging unless symptoms develop or the coin fails to pass in the advised timeframe, which balances safety and avoids unnecessary endoscopy [^112Znt1W] [^115TdN5C] [^115UugNu].

Yes, a 2 cm coin in the stomach of a 4-year-old can be safely managed as an outpatient [^112Znt1W] if the child is asymptomatic and healthy, because **most coins ≤ 2.5 cm pass spontaneously** [^115TdN5C]. Discharge is appropriate with clear return precautions and follow-up to confirm passage [^1137MCJ2]. Endoscopic removal is indicated if the coin remains in the stomach **beyond 2–4 weeks** [^115TdN5C], the child **develops symptoms**, or if there is **underlying GI disease or prior surgery** [^112Znt1W].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) **outline management** [^115UugNu] of ingested coins in pediatric patients. The **ESGE 2016 guidelines** recommend clinical observation without endoscopic removal for asymptomatic patients who have ingested blunt, small objects (excluding batteries and magnets), and outpatient management is appropriate if feasible [^112Znt1W]. The **ASGE 2011 guidelines** recommend endoscopic removal for objects with a diameter greater than 2.5 cm that remain in the stomach, as larger objects are less likely to pass spontaneously [^115TdN5C]. Given that the coin is 2 cm in diameter, it falls below the 2.5 cm threshold, making **outpatient observation appropriate** [^112Znt1W] in asymptomatic patients.

---

## Factors influencing spontaneous passage

Several factors **influence the likelihood** of spontaneous passage:

- **Size**: Coins smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter [^115TdN5C] typically pass spontaneously through the gastrointestinal tract [^1137MCJ2].

- **Shape**: Coins are blunt objects, reducing the risk of mucosal injury or perforation compared to sharp objects [^115UugNu].

- **Patient age and anatomy**: At 4 years old, the child's gastrointestinal tract is generally capable of allowing a 2 cm coin to pass without significant risk of obstruction [^116VFyP7].

---

## Potential risks and complications

While most coins pass spontaneously, **retained gastric coins carry potential risks and complications**:

- **Gastric outlet obstruction**: Although rare, coins can occasionally cause obstruction at the pylorus or duodenum, particularly if the coin is large or if the patient has underlying anatomical abnormalities [^115jobFv].

- **Mucosal irritation or ulceration**: Prolonged retention of a coin in the stomach can cause localized mucosal irritation or ulceration [^113Djrf9].

- **Metal toxicity**: Prolonged exposure to gastric acid can cause corrosion of coins [^1137MCJ2], potentially leading to the release of metals such as zinc or copper, which can cause local or systemic toxicity [^114Z7xZt].

---

## Recommended follow-up and monitoring

If the patient is discharged, parents should be instructed on warning signs — abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, or signs of obstruction — and given clear return precautions. If the coin has not passed within 2 weeks, obtain a **plain abdominal radiograph** [^115UugNu] to confirm passage or persistent retention. If the coin remains in the stomach **beyond 2–4 weeks**, or if the patient **develops symptoms**, **endoscopic removal** should be considered [^115TdN5C].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate intervention

Immediate intervention or endoscopic removal is **indicated** in the following scenarios [^115UugNu]:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Patients presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, melena, or signs of obstruction.

- **Underlying gastrointestinal disease**: Patients with known gastrointestinal abnormalities, strictures, or previous gastrointestinal surgery.

- **Multiple coins or unknown objects**: Ingestion of multiple coins or unknown objects may require closer monitoring or intervention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, a 2 cm coin in the stomach of an asymptomatic 4-year-old can be **safely managed with outpatient observation** [^112Znt1W]. The likelihood of spontaneous passage is high and the risk of complications low; however, clear parental education, follow-up, and monitoring are essential to ensure safe passage and timely intervention if complications arise. Yes, discharge is generally safe with outpatient observation and clear follow-up instructions, with endoscopic removal considered if the coin remains in the stomach beyond 2–4 weeks [^115TdN5C] or if symptoms develop.

Coins are one of the most commonly ingested foreign objects, and patients typically present with dysphagia. Coins can cause mechanical obstruction but are considered relatively safe as they lack sharp edges. One consideration is whether the metal composition of the coin could potentially have a toxic effect. The US penny has a high zinc content (97.5% zinc, 2.5% copper), and the Euro 10c, 20c, and 50c coins consist of 89% copper. All metal coins risk reacting with the gastric acid in the stomach. The free metal ions can then have local or systemic effects on an individual.

It has been reported that coins in hydrochloric acid lose between 0.43–11.3% of their weight over the course of a week. The dissolved ions can then be absorbed or react further with the hydrochloric acid and become a salt. Zinc can react with gastric acid and result in zinc chloride, which causes vomiting, gastritis, and, secondarily, gastro-oesophageal burns and haemorrhage that can ultimately result in scarring. Gastric acid can enable the body to absorb copper, which can cause acute liver failure.

Treatment of ingested coins generally depends on their location and the symptoms experienced by the patient. Urgent removal of any foreign body is indicated if the obstruction causes an inability to manage oral secretions. A coin that fails to pass the pylorus after 48 hours may indicate the need for endoscopic removal, but this can vary depending on local practice. The main role of the radiologist is to identify whether the foreign body is a coin, where it is located, and if it causes any obstruction.

Regarding medical management for foreign body ingestion, specifically in the context of watchful waiting, the ESGE 2016 guidelines recommend clinical observation without endoscopic removal in asymptomatic patients who have ingested blunt and small objects, except in cases involving batteries and magnets. Outpatient management should be offered if feasible.

### Has the cat got your tongue, or is something obstructing your throat? A review of imaging of ingested and aspirated foreign bodies in the paediatric population [^116VFyP7]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Ingested foreign bodies can cause obstructions at numerous locations. Within the oesophagus, there are three common sites for obstructions: at the level of the superior oesophageal sphincter, the aortic arch, and the inferior oesophageal sphincter. Removing foreign bodies in the oesophagus, including impacted food, is considered mandatory. Other anatomical locations prone to obstruction include the pyloric sphincter and ileocaecal valve, particularly with large objects, as well as the rectosigmoid colon and anus. An object with a diameter larger than 25 mm is unlikely to pass through the pylorus. Objects longer than 6 cm have difficulty passing through the duodenum and are also unlikely to pass through the ileocaecal valve.

Further areas prone to obstruction are locations with acquired or congenital strictures, such as anastomosis following atresia surgery. Radiographs, if performed, need to include the entire gastrointestinal tract, i.e. neck, chest, and abdomen. It is possible to determine if a flat circular foreign body, such as a coin or button battery, is situated in the oesophagus or trachea by its appearance. A circular foreign body appears round in the anterior-posterior view if situated in the oesophagus and narrow if located in the trachea. This occurs because the posterior wall lacks cartilage rings and thus is not rigid, reversing the image in a lateral view. Additionally, detecting the trachea on the lateral view is essential to ascertain the location of the foreign body.

### Acupuncture for symptomatic gastroparesis [^112MtLxs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroparesis, characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach, significantly impacts daily functioning and quality of life when symptoms are present. Treatment options are based on limited evidence of effectiveness. Acupuncture is widely used to manage gastrointestinal disorders, though its role in symptomatic gastroparesis is unclear. Consequently, we undertook a systematic review of the available evidence.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, or other non-pharmacological interventions for symptom management in people with gastroparesis.

- **Search methods**: On 26 March 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, AMED, Korean medical databases (including Korean Studies Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Centre for Health Database, KoreaMed, and the National Assembly Library), and Chinese databases (including the China Academic Journal). We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials and imposed no language limitations.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomized controlled trials comparing the penetrating type of acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, conventional medicine, standard care, and other non-pharmacological interventions for people with symptomatic gastroparesis of any etiology (i.e. surgical, diabetic, or idiopathic).

### Ingestion of cylindrical batteries and its management [^116cWdAq]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to the ingestion of coin batteries, the ingestion of cylindrical batteries is an uncommon medical presentation. Owing to their larger size, cylindrical battery ingestion can lead to serious complications including intestinal haemorrhage, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, peritonitis, and even death. We discuss the case of a 17-year-old girl who presented after swallowing three cylindrical batteries. Her medical history included depression and previous battery ingestion that required surgical removal. During this presentation, however, these ingested batteries were removed endoscopically at oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy. The patient was subsequently discharged without complication. This paper discusses the complications and management of cylindrical battery ingestion.

### Prokinetics-safety and efficacy: The European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility/the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society expert review [^11353Z9a]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Low credibility.

Prokinetics are a class of pharmacological drugs designed to improve gastrointestinal (GI) motility, either regionally or across the whole gut. Each drug has its merits and drawbacks; however, based on evidence, as high-quality studies are limited, we have no clear recommendation on one class or another. There remains a large unmet need for both regionally selective and/or globally acting prokinetic drugs that work primarily intraluminally and are safe and without systemic side effects.

- **Purpose**: Here, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of six classes of prokinetic drugs, including their pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, safety and tolerability, and potential indications.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastric cancer, particularly in patients with precancerous gastric lesions, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is crucial. The ASGE 2017 guidelines recommend considering a firm, round subepithelial lesion with central umbilication along the greater curve of the antrum of the stomach as diagnostic for a pancreatic rest.

### Safe removal of upper esophageal coins by using Magill forceps: Two centers' experience [^1163gUXx]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Coin ingestion with subsequent esophageal coin impaction is common in children. Considerable debate surrounds the choice of technique for the removal of esophageal coins. This study demonstrates a minimally invasive technique for upper esophageal coin extraction. A retrospective review was conducted of 165 children who had upper esophageal coins extracted by using a Magill forceps. One hundred fifty-six coins (96.4%) were successfully removed without any complications. The average time taken to remove the coin was 33 seconds. Use of the Magill forceps technique minimizes instrumentation of the esophagus and is an easy, safe technique for removing coins from the upper end of the esophagus.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopy [^111apzB5]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

For upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, no evidence suggests that the combination of throat spray and sedation increases the risk of aspiration. However, caution is advised for those at increased risk. There is very low grade evidence and a strong strength of recommendation, with a 100% level of agreement.

Good evidence indicates that combining sedation with oropharyngeal anaesthesia improves tolerance and comfort during gastroscopy. Topical pharyngeal anaesthesia reduces the gag reflex in patients sedated with propofol. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential increased risk of aspiration pneumonia from throat spray and sedation, although no published evidence supports these concerns. The combination of an opiate and benzodiazepine may enhance examination quality by improving patient tolerance. The risk of aspiration is higher in patients with significant underlying illness, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or those undergoing therapeutic procedures. It is advisable to exercise caution in patients at increased risk of aspiration, and in selected cases, consider general anaesthesia with airway protection.

Deep sedation may be required for particular upper GI procedures, such as polypectomy, resection of neoplasia, endoscopic bariatric surgery, and foreign body retrieval. This recommendation has low grade evidence and a strong strength of recommendation, also with a 100% level of agreement. Complex therapeutic upper GI procedures include endoscopic submucosal dissection and bariatric endoscopy.

### Child with esophageal coin and atypical radiograph [^113ZkBRn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aspirated or swallowed coins are a common phenomenon resulting in a pediatric patient presenting to the Emergency Department. The location of the coin (trachea vs. esophagus) is commonly determined by the alignment of the coin on radiographic studies. We present a child who had an esophageal coin but radiographic findings that supported a coin located in the trachea. This case illustrates the importance of performing radiographic studies that include both anteroposterior and lateral neck/chest views in patients who aspirate or swallow coins.

### In vitro study of ingested coins: Leave them or retrieve them [^114Z7xZt]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objects, notably coins, are frequently swallowed by children aged 3 to 5 years. Precisely how they should be managed after passing the gastroesophageal junction without causing symptoms remains controversial. This study was performed to assess the dissolution of specific metals from coins immersed in simulated gastric juice.

- **Methods**: Four types of euro and US coins were immersed in simulated gastric juice for 4, 24, 72, and 120 hours. Six metals were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Weight loss and corrosive behavior were also determined.

- **Results**: After only 4 hours, metals had dissolved from euro (Cu, 2.86–7.85 mg; Ni, 0.23–0.52 mg; Zn, 0.09–0.99 mg; Al, 0.24 mg; Sn, 0.02 mg) and US (Cu, 1.45–6.65 mg; Ni, 0–0.62 mg; Zn, 0–0.14 mg) coins. Their concentrations in simulated gastric juice peaked after 24 to 72 hours. Specific concentrations in euro coins were Cu, 218/48; Ni, 82.50/72; Zn, 83.00/72; Al, 14.65/72; Sn, 0.66/72 mg/hours. In US coins, they were Cu, 126.50/24; Ni, 88.00/72; Zn, 149.00/24 mg/hours. All coins underwent corrosion and showed a weight loss of 2.56%-4.8%.

- **Conclusions**: Coins retained in the stomach will release a number of heavy metals well known to cause dose-dependent poisoning. Studies to evaluate their toxicity and absorption are needed to optimize treatment.

### Detection of coins ingested by children using a handheld metal detector: a systematic review [^111RD1v9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

To determine if the use of a handheld metal detector (HHMD) can safely reduce the number of radiographs requested in cases of coins ingested by children, a search was performed to identify prospective studies of the ability of an HHMD to identify the presence or absence of ingested coins in children (17 years or younger). Outcome measures were presence or absence of a coin on metal detector screening and accuracy of coin localization.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Mantel-Haenszel (fixed effect model) pooling with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to calculate overall sensitivities and specificities. In total, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall sensitivity of the HHMD at detecting the presence of coins was 99.4% (95% CI 98.0 to 99.9%), and accuracy at localization was 99.8% (98.5 to 100.0%). The overall specificity of the HHMD was 100% (76.8 to 100%).

Use of the HHMD is an accurate, radiation-free, and cost-effective method of identifying and localizing coins ingested by children. An algorithm for investigating children with coin ingestion is proposed.

### Oesophageal perforation: A diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in a resource limited setting. A report of three cases [^116V63Do]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old female with a history of having swallowed a coin was referred from a district hospital where an attempt to remove the coin with forceps had failed. The radiograph from the district hospital showed the coin to be behind the clavicles. At our center, rigid oesophagoscopy was performed, and the coin was removed without complications. An area of hyperemia, approximately 1 cm in diameter, was noted just above the coin. The patient was sent to the ward for observation.

In the ward, she experienced some chest pain following feeding, but no additional issues were noted. The next day, her parents requested her discharge, which was granted. Once home, the patient developed a high-grade fever, dyspnea, cough, and worsening chest pain. A chest radiograph done at the district hospital showed a right hydropneumothorax, while the left hemithorax was normal. Aspiration of the contents of the right pleural cavity yielded whitish material.

A diagnosis of tuberculosis with a tracheoesophageal fistula was made, and treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication was initiated. However, after 18 days and no improvement, she was referred to our center. She presented on day 18 from the incident with a high-grade fever, chest pain, and cough. The symptoms were exacerbated by feeding.

### Endoscopic removal of magnetic beads causing duodenal chronic fistula [^111m8Miz]. Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

- **Endoscopic findings**: Endoscopy revealed a coin in the stomach cavity. Additionally, a string of magnetic beads with corroded surfaces was discovered in the descending duodenum, with one end protruding from the intestinal cavity. The removed magnetic beads were examined, and a fistula was exposed, which showed no signs of bleeding.

The incidence of injury from magnetic beads in pediatric patients has increased in recent years. When more than two magnetic beads are ingested, the intestinal walls are tightly attracted to each other, leading to necrosis and fistula formation. This often requires surgical intervention. In this case, the swallowed beads were discovered relatively late due to the absence of symptoms, resulting in the development of a chronic fistula. Our experience suggests that endoscopic removal of magnetic beads can be safe in the presence of chronic fistula.

### Timing of button battery removal from the upper gastrointestinal system in children [^116js9x5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate the appropriate time for the removal of button batteries (BB) from the esophagus and stomach in children. This retrospective descriptive single-center study reviewed the medical records of all children with BB ingestion seen in the Royal Hospital between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2014. All children younger than 13 years with a history of BB ingestion were included. Biodemographic data, including age and sex, were obtained. Additionally, the time of BB ingestion, location of the BB, time of endoscopic removal, and any complications were recorded.

Forty-six patients with BB ingestion were identified out of 385 cases of foreign body ingestion (12%) during the study period. Among them, twenty-four (52%) were boys, and twenty-two (48%) were girls. All children had BBs that were 20 mm in diameter. Two children had the BB in the esophagus, whereas thirteen children had the BB in the stomach upon presentation. The mean time of presentation for children with BBs in the esophagus was 1.75 hours after ingestion, whereas those with BBs in the stomach presented on average 19.4 hours after ingestion (P < 0.035).

- **Endoscopic intervention**: An endoscopic intervention was conducted in only 8 of the 46 children. Two of these children had the BB in the esophagus, and six had it in the stomach. One child required intensive care unit admission with subsequent esophageal strictures. The mean time for esophageal BB removal was 1.7 hours from ingestion, whereas removal from the stomach was on average 27 hours after ingestion. Endoscopic injuries were noted in 87.5% of the children with BBs in the esophagus.

### Derivation and validation of a novel risk score for safe discharge after acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a modelling study [^117DKh9s]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

The Oakland Score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of adverse outcomes in patients who have experienced a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. It is specifically designed to identify patients who are at low risk and can be safely discharged from the hospital. This tool is particularly useful in emergency departments and acute care settings, where it aids clinicians in making informed decisions about patient management, potentially reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and associated costs.

The score takes into account several factors, including patient age, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, presentation with syncope, digital rectal examination findings, and comorbidities. It is specifically applicable to adult patients admitted to the hospital with a lower GI bleed and is not suitable for use in children or patients with upper GI bleeding. The Oakland Score should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and other relevant diagnostic tools, and not in isolation.

- **Age**:
	- Under 40 years receives 0 points
	- Between 40 and 69 years receives 1 point
	- 70 years and older receive higher points (continued previously cut-off content for accuracy)

The Oakland Score provides a quantified assessment of discharge safety, ensuring clinicians can gauge the likelihood of a safe discharge following a lower GI bleed based on individual patient characteristics.

### Spontaneous passage of long, sharp gastrointestinal foreign body in a child [^111MGZkN]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Foreign body (FB) ingestion is a common problem in children. Up to 90% of these FBs pass spontaneously. FBs reaching the stomach usually pass out spontaneously. Exceptions to this spontaneous passage include a long FB that cannot cross the pylorus, duodenum, or ileocaecal junction. We present a case of a 9-year-old boy who accidentally ingested a long paper pin, which spontaneously passed in 26 hours. This case is being reported to highlight the successful spontaneous passage of a 4 cm long sharp foreign body in a child.

### Coin retained in the upper esophagus for more than 4 years: A case report and literature review [^112A7K4g]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Coins are among the most common foreign bodies ingested by children, especially those below 5 years of age. Early endoscopic retrieval of esophageal coins minimizes the risk of serious complications. However, significant morbidity and mortality are reported when coins are retained in the gastrointestinal tract for prolonged periods of time. We report a case in which a coin was retained in the upper esophagus for 4 years and presented a distinctive clinical course. An esophageal coin retained for a prolonged period may place the patient at risk of complications such as tracheoesophageal fistulas. The management of patients with complicated aerodigestive tract foreign bodies is challenging.

To avoid a delayed diagnosis and to improve the patients' safety, the quality of medical care in rural areas should be monitored by implementing continuous educational programs for primary physicians.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^1114M1Ln]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for precancerous gastric lesions, more specifically with respect to diagnostic endoscopy, the BSG 2019 guidelines recommend performing a full systematic endoscopy, with an examination time of a minimum of 7 minutes, of the stomach. This should include clear photographic documentation of gastric regions and pathology in patients at higher risk for gastric adenocarcinoma, including those with atrophic gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia.

### Esophageal coin with an unusual radiographic appearance [^115a4vtV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Esophageal coins are typically seen as radiopaque disks on anteroposterior chest radiographs. This radiographic finding is generally considered classic for identifying "swallowed" coins as being in the esophagus. We report the case of an 11-year-old girl with an esophageal coin seen end-on on an anteroposterior chest radiograph and as a disk consistent with a coin in the lateral view. These findings are typically associated with coin aspiration. Clinicians should be wary of making the diagnosis of foreign body aspiration of coins by relying on single-view radiographic findings alone. When clinically reasonable, we suggest additional imaging to help further localize swallowed coins.

### Nasopharyngeal foreign body triggered by a blind finger sweep [^114Af3u2]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 1-year-old boy suddenly began choking and coughing after ingesting a coin. The child's mother attempted to extract the coin by inserting her fingers in his mouth and sweeping the oral cavity. The mother felt the object momentarily with her fingertips but was unable to retrieve it and brought her son to a local hospital for assistance.

The patient was referred to our emergency department (ED) for possible oesophageal obstruction by a foreign body based on the X-ray findings. On arrival at our ED, the child exhibited mild gagging but presented no respiratory symptoms and a normal pulmonary examination. The chest X-ray revealed a nasopharyngeal foreign body. The patient was placed under procedural sedation, and emergency removal was successfully completed by an otolaryngologist. Subsequently, the patient was discharged without complications.

### Guidelines for the management of hiatal hernia [^113E7RRe]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for hiatal hernia, particularly in relation to indications for surgery, the SAGES 2013 guidelines recommend performing a reduction of the stomach with limited resection, if needed, in patients with acute gastric volvulus.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^112eQ73g]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign bodies in children and usually become lodged in the upper esophagus. They should be managed immediately. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with coins lodged in the upper esophagus, who underwent coin removal using a silicone Foley balloon catheter without fluoroscopy or anesthesia. The safety of the procedure was also evaluated.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2022 for coins lodged in the esophagus, and extracted with a silicone Foley balloon catheter without anesthesia, were evaluated retrospectively. We focused on patient characteristics and clinical presentations, as well as the treatment's safety, efficacy, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 773 patients (416 male, 357 female), with a mean age of 3.5 years (ranging from 6 months to 16 years), who ingested coins and had them extracted with a Foley catheter, were included. The majority of patients (n = 728, 94.17%) were successfully managed by silicone Foley balloon catheter extraction. Our overall success rate was 94.17%, with 88.30% of coins retrieved and 5.9% pushed into the stomach. Patients successfully treated with the Foley catheter were discharged on the same day, except for 7 (0.90%) who experienced minimal bleeding. Only 45 (5.82%) patients required esophagoscopy in the operating room; these patients were kept overnight for clinical follow-up without any further interventions.

- **Conclusion**: A Foley balloon catheter can be used to safely and effectively remove coins lodged in the upper esophagus.

### Safety and efficacy of a protocol using bougienage or endoscopy for the management of coins acutely lodged in the esophagus: a large case series [^115Fy3SG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report our experience using the bougienage procedure in the management of esophageal coins. This observational case series includes all patients who presented to our emergency departments with coins acutely lodged in the esophagus between 1994 and 2006. All patients were treated according to our protocol with either endoscopy or bougienage.

Patients were eligible for bougienage if they had a witnessed coin ingestion within 24 hours before presentation, confirmed esophageal coin position by chest radiograph, and no history of esophageal disease, surgery, or foreign body. The primary outcomes measured were complications, efficacy of the procedure, hospital charges, length of stay, and return to the hospital. Data on length of stay and hospital charges were gathered for patients presenting in the final 24 months of the study.

A total of 620 patients were identified as having esophageal coins. Of these, 355 patients had a successful bougienage, while 17 experienced unsuccessful procedures. In comparison, 248 patients underwent endoscopy, with the coin successfully removed in all but one case. Among the patients who had endoscopy, 89 were eligible for bougienage, yet patient, parent, or physician preference led to opting for endoscopic management.

Eleven patients required reevaluation or readmission for complaints related to esophageal coin. The only complication recorded was subglottic edema, causing respiratory distress in a single patient who had undergone endoscopy. Patients undergoing endoscopy had an average length of stay of 6.1 days.

Material and methods. The medical records of 18 children with gastric foreign bodies, admitted to the emergency department between January 2010 and October 2011, were evaluated retrospectively. The evaluation focused on the type of imaging studies performed, the type of foreign body ingested, and the method of removal.

Results. Gastric foreign bodies were confirmed in all patients by ultrasound. The foreign bodies identified included 8 coins, 5 button batteries, 1 domino, 1 stick of a lollipop, 1 hairclip, 1 screw nut, and small plastic cylinders. The mean age of the children was 2 years. All batteries, the domino, and two coins were removed endoscopically. The other six coins, the lollipop stick, hairclip, and plastic cylinders were recovered in the stool. The screw nut was removed surgically. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days.

Discussion and conclusions. To avoid unnecessary radiation exposure in children, ultrasound of a water-filled stomach has been proven to be a promising and potentially effective method for the diagnosis and follow-up of ingested gastric foreign bodies, especially in cases that are radiolucent.

### Cecal retention of a swallowed penny mimicking appendicitis in a healthy 2 year old [^113vgMvm]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Toddlers commonly ingest coins. Studies on the evaluation and management of such ingestions have primarily focused on the risk of complications from impaction in the esophagus. It is commonly assumed that coins that have passed through the esophagus present little or no risk for distal complications. We present the first report of cecal retention of a penny in a previously healthy 2-year-old, which ultimately resulted in surgical intervention.

JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

The radiolabeled meal was administered via a nasogastric tube over 5 minutes. A mobile γ camera (Digirad, Poway, CA, USA) recorded images in dynamic mode at 1-minute intervals with the camera positioned in the left anterior oblique position to correct for γ ray attenuation. Scintigraphic data were analyzed by a qualified nuclear medicine technologist (KLJ) who was blinded to the study conditions. Radioisotopic data were corrected for subject movement and radionuclide decay. A region of interest that was drawn around the total stomach and gastric emptying curves, expressed as percentage retention, was generated over time. Intragastric retention was derived at 15-minute intervals from t = 0 to t = 60 minutes and at 30-minute intervals thereafter until t = 240 minutes. Normal gastric retention was defined as < 13% at 180 minutes based on previously published data, and abnormal gastric retention was defined as any proportion ≥ 13% at 180 minutes.

Data on adverse events (AEs) were recorded as per the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good Clinical Practice from the time of consent through to the final follow-up assessment on day 5. AEs could be observed by study or intensive care unit personnel, spontaneously reported by the participant, or reported in response to a standard question from study personnel. The relationship of AEs to study drug therapy was assessed as being not related or possibly/probably related for all AEs. The relationship was deemed as "possibly/probably related" if there was a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of…

### Buried coin in the gastric mucosa [^113Djrf9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old man presented to the Accident and Emergency department with abdominal cramping following the ingestion of a 50p coin 2½ weeks prior to presentation. He had not observed it passing in his stools. An abdominal radiograph confirmed the presence of the 50p coin in his stomach. Subsequently, he underwent an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), which failed to visualize the coin.

1½ weeks later, he returned to the department, still unable to observe its passage in his stools. A repeated abdominal radiograph and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed that the coin was still in his stomach. A second OGD was performed, once again failing to visualize the coin. It appeared that the coin had migrated into his gastric mucosa.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^116gDAxt]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Coin extraction was performed in the pediatric surgery department without anesthesia or sedation. Plain chest radiographs were obtained for all patients (Fig. 1). The following equipment was kept ready in the outpatient room: a suitable silicone Foley balloon catheter (12 or 14 F), a 10-mL syringe filled with saline, tongue depressors, laryngoscope, forceps, suction apparatus, oxygen supply, and all other equipment required for emergency intubation. The balloon of the Foley catheter was tested for inflation before the procedure.

- **Chest X-ray**: Demonstrating coin in the upper esophagus.

If the patient had a coin lodged in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus, the ingestion had been witnessed, and the time from ingestion to presentation was less than 24 hours, the patient underwent extraction using a Foley catheter. The catheter was inserted transorally without sedation, allowing the child to cough up the object, thereby assisting the extraction. Tongue depressors were placed intraorally on both sides of the mouth to prevent the child from biting down on the catheter.

The lubricated Foley balloon catheter was then passed through and advanced posterior and distal to the lodged coin and inflated with saline (3–5 mL), thus avoiding overdistension. The inflated balloon was then withdrawn carefully (Fig. 2). The patient was turned to the right decubitus position on the side of the table to allow gravity to assist with expectoration. No anesthesia is used for the procedure. When the catheter was completely removed, if the procedure was successful, the coin reached the oral cavity.

### Is there a need for repeat radiologic examination of children with esophageal coin foreign body [^116BuvQh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine factors associated with the passage of coins and the need for repeat preoperative chest X-ray (CXR) for esophageal coin foreign bodies. Conducted at an academic tertiary care center, this study employs a case series with chart review design. Patient information was retrieved from an Institutional Review Board-approved database, identifying 1,359 children with esophageal coin foreign bodies from 2001 to 2013. Patients with both initial diagnostic and immediate preoperative CXR were included.

A total of 406 patients met the inclusion criteria, with an average age of 47 months (range, 1.8–194 months). In 29 patients (7%), the coin's position changed on preoperative CXR. Age, type of coin, and location of coin were all statistically significant factors affecting the passage of the coin (P < .0001). Coins in the distal esophagus were 9.3 times more likely to pass than those in the proximal esophagus. The longer the object remained in the esophagus, the less likely it was to pass.

This study characterizes when esophageal coins may pass. Factors such as age, type of coin, location of coin at the initial X-ray, and length of time are crucial in determining if the coin will pass. This information can be used to counsel families on the likelihood of coin passage and whether a repeat X-ray is necessary prior to surgical removal. Additionally, obtaining repeat films in select patients could be more cost-effective and may prevent those likely to pass the coin spontaneously from undergoing unnecessary surgery.

### Electronic medical record-based tools aid in timely triage of disc-shaped foreign body ingestions [^116aVJve]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Children presenting to the emergency department with coin-shaped foreign body (FB) ingestion must be evaluated urgently to rule out a button battery. As many of these ingestions are well-appearing on presentation, delays in triage put patients at risk for further injury.

- **Study design**: Quality initiative.
- **Methods**: A quality initiative, utilizing electronic medical record (EMR)-based tools, was implemented at our academic children's hospital. A chief complaint pertaining to coin-shaped FB ingestion was created and linked to a best practice advisory. This advisory instructed assignment of acuity level 2 and the order of a Stat x-ray, as well as providing a link to the hospital's relevant algorithm. A review was conducted comparing children who underwent FB removal preinitiative (January 1, 2016–January 28, 2017) and postinitiative (January 31, 2017–August 30, 2017). The primary outcomes were the frequency of assignment of acuity level 2 and the time from patient arrival to x-ray order placement and x-ray completion.
- **Results**: Thirty-six patients in the baseline group and 30 in the postintervention group underwent FB removal. The rate of appropriate acuity assignment increased from 63.8% (23/36) pre-implementation to 100% (30/30) postimplementation (P = .0003). The median time from arrival to imaging ordered and completed decreased from 36.5 to 4 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI]: -44 to -17) and 59 to 41 minutes (95% CI: -39 to -1), respectively.
- **Conclusions**: Utilization of EMR-based tools was associated with improved timeliness in the initiation of care in metallic FB ingestion patients.

### Severe gastric damage caused by button battery ingestion in a 3-month-old infant [^115Noevv]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ingestion of a button battery has been considered a serious problem, causing necrosis and perforation when impacted in the esophagus. However, such batteries in the stomach rarely cause any harm to the gastric wall, which is regarded as evidence supporting the use of conservative treatment.

We present the rare case of a 3-month-old infant with severe gastric wall injury caused by a button battery lodged in the stomach. This case suggests that button batteries located in the stomach should be removed as soon as possible, especially in infants.

### An ingested foreign body: Two sides of the same coin [^117SJvBE]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old child presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of dysphagia and stertor. A plain anteroposterior chest X-ray revealed a single circular opacity in the middle third of the oesophagus, consistent with an ingested coin. The child was taken to the theatre for rigid pharyngo-oesophagoscopy and removal of the coin. After the first coin was removed, a subsequent endoscopic examination revealed a second coin at the same location. This extremely rare case of two ingested coins becoming impacted with perfect radiological alignment emphasizes the importance of thorough examination during endoscopy and the potential limitations of an X-ray in the initial assessment of an ingested foreign body.

### Endoscopic extraction of a foreign body using a condom [^115ZMKKR]. Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 16-year-old adolescent hospitalized due to a foreign body in the stomach, which was removed using a condom. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a rectangular foreign body, about 2 × 9 cm in size and shaped like a lighter, in the stomach cavity. We attempted to grasp the head of the foreign body with a snare to remove it vertically. However, despite repeated attempts, the lighter could not pass through the esophageal entrance.

- **Removal of the foreign body using a condom**: Considering that a condom is a thin and flexible sheath, usually coated with water-based lubricant, we decided to use this to attempt removal of the foreign body. The lighter was first placed into the mouth of the condom using the snare, and a biopsy forceps was used to clamp the opening of the condom to secure the lighter. The lubricated condom was gently pulled through the esophageal entrance to facilitate smooth removal. No complications occurred.

The success rate of foreign body removal is influenced by the anatomical spatial size of the esophageal entrance, which is the first physiological stenosis encountered, and by the compliance and coordination of the gastroscopy, all of which vary between individuals. For difficult removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the use of innovative techniques may be necessary.

### Chest radiograph alone is sufficient as the foreign body survey for children presenting with coin ingestion [^1148enBC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Radiographic survey of the entire aerodigestive tract (nares to anus) is common practice in children presenting to the emergency department following coin ingestion. The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal protocol for radiographic survey post-coin ingestion. We hypothesized that for children presenting with a clear history of coin ingestion, a frontal chest radiograph including the entire esophagus is adequate to guide treatment.

We reviewed the clinical history and radiographic surveys of 134 patients presenting with suspected or witnessed coin ingestion to the emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2016. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, anatomic coverage of survey, type, number and location of radiopaque foreign bodies, intervention, and follow-up were recorded.

Coins were identified on radiographic surveys in 109 of 134 patients; 25 of 134 patients had no coin. Of those with coins, none of 109 had coin(s) in the airway, 42 of 109 had coin(s) in the esophagus, and 67 of 109 had coin(s) distal to the esophagus. Of those with esophageal coins, 35 of 42 reported symptoms, 7 of 42 were asymptomatic, 40 of 42 underwent endoscopic coin removal, and 2 of 42 had no intervention. Of 92 of 134 surveyed patients with no coin or coin distal to the esophagus, 30 of 92 reported symptoms, 62 of 92 were asymptomatic, 90 of 92 had no further intervention, and 2 of 92 eventually underwent endoscopic coin removal for specific indications (abdominal pain, delayed passage).

### Removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) clinical guideline [^115UugNu]. Endoscopy (2016). High credibility.

This guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and addresses the removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults.

- **Nonendoscopic measures**: ESGE recommends diagnostic evaluation based on the patient's history and symptoms. A physical examination should focus on the patient's general condition and assess signs of any complications (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). ESGE does not recommend radiological evaluation for patients with non-bony food bolus impaction without complications. Plain radiography is recommended to assess the presence, location, size, configuration, and number of ingested foreign bodies if ingestion of radiopaque objects is suspected or the type of object is unknown (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

- **Imaging recommendations**: ESGE recommends computed tomography (CT) scan in all patients with suspected perforation or other complications that may require surgery (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). Barium swallow is not recommended due to the risk of aspiration and worsening endoscopic visualization (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

- **Management of foreign body ingestion**: Clinical observation without the need for endoscopic removal is recommended for asymptomatic patients with ingestion of blunt and small objects, except batteries and magnets. If feasible, outpatient management is appropriate (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). ESGE advises close observation in asymptomatic individuals who have concealed packets of drugs.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^115gGrgD]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Adherence to standardized and adequately validated study protocols is necessary. Standardized study protocols validated in a large number of healthy individuals and patients are only available for some motility tests. For instance, wireless motility capsule (WMC) testing in clinical practice follows a fixed protocol that involves ingestion of the WMC immediately after consumption of a defined test meal (260 kcal nutrient bar), a 6-hour interval before ingestion of the next meal, avoidance of strenuous or vigorous exercise, and return of the data receiver after five days. For scintigraphic evaluation of transit times and 13 C-labelled Spirulina platensis gastric emptying breath test (GEBT), well-validated protocols are also available. For many of the other tests, there are various test protocols, and validation has frequently been performed in a low number of individuals.

Patient preparation for testing of gastrointestinal motor function usually requires an overnight or prolonged fast and avoidance of medications that affect gastrointestinal motility. Under physiological circumstances, motor patterns of the entire gastrointestinal tract rapidly adapt to food intake. For instance, within minutes after the start of a meal, the proximal stomach accommodates, small bowel motility changes from the cyclic interdigestive to the fed pattern (Fig. 4), and colonic phasic and tonic contractions increase (Figs. 7, 8). The extent and duration of motility changes depend on the caloric content and composition of a meal. Thus, to enable standardization, it is essential that patients have been fasting for a sufficient length of time.

### Christmas: Years like this. Ingested foreign bodies and societal wealth: Three year observational study of swallowed coins [^116roNyK]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The fate of an aspirated coin can be followed on X-ray film. The asymptomatic child can be re-examined later to see if there is any change, but symptomatic coins or those lodged in the oesophagus need to be removed. The positioning of the X-ray plate affects the image, such that, for example, an anterior-posterior view can produce an apparent increase in the size, and hence value, of deposits in the anterior abdomen (the Madoff effect). A small overestimation of the diameter of a penny can lead to the misassumption that it is a nickel (5c), or similarly that a nickel is a quarter (25c), a Madoff effect of 400%. While this insider information might be marginally more reliable than a parliamentarian's expense account, this insight can be turned to good use when wagering on the value of the coin to be extracted. Parenthetically, before placing one's retirement funds on gastroesophageal futures or derivatives, attention should be directed to the more proximal gastrointestinal tract to ensure the tongue is firmly in the cheek.

### Generalised urticaria following ingestion of a nickel-plated coin in a 4-year-old girl [^114eg7UW]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department after ingestion of a nickel-plated coin. Abdominal radiographs confirmed the presence of a coin in her stomach, but she was otherwise asymptomatic. She was discharged with assurances that the foreign body would pass spontaneously. The patient developed significant generalized urticaria the next day, which became progressively more severe. Her symptoms prompted endoscopic removal of the nickel-plated coin and a postoperative course of corticosteroids and antihistamine therapy. This is the first reported case of generalized urticaria secondary to ingestion of a coin with nickel plating only (2% nickel content overall). A review of similar cases is provided.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^1136KrPy]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

A total of 773 children (416 boys and 357 girls) presenting with coin ingestion underwent an extraction procedure using a Foley catheter. The mean age of the patients was 3.52 years, with a range from 6 months to 16 years.

In all cases, the position of the coin was in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus. The total duration of coin impaction was less than 24 hours, and all ingestions had been witnessed. In 98% of our cases, the time duration from ingestion to presentation was less than 6 hours. All patients underwent radiographic examination for diagnosis and to determine the exact location of the coin in the gastrointestinal tract before intervention.

The most common presenting symptom was drooling, followed by dysphagia, refusal to eat, and vomiting. Unwitnessed ingestions were excluded due to the lack of knowledge of the time elapsed since ingestion or whether the ingested foreign body was a coin.

The removal of impacted coins using a silicone Foley catheter was successful in 728 (94.21%) patients. In 46 of the 773 children (5.9%), the coins were pushed into the stomach. As no further interventions were needed, we included these cases in our success rate of 94.21%. Our overall success rate was 94.17%, with 88.30% of coins retrieved and 5.9% pushed into the stomach. These patients were discharged after careful evaluation, and no further follow-up was required except for those who had minimal bleeding.

In the remaining 45 children (5.82% of cases), all three attempts with Foley balloon catheter extraction were unsuccessful. In these cases, the position of the coin was reconfirmed on radiography.

### Electrogastrography: A document prepared by the gastric section of the American Motility Society Clinical GI Motility Testing Task Force [^113z63Em]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to present the consensus opinion of the American Motility Society Clinical GI Motility Testing Task Force on the performance and clinical utility of electrogastrography (EGG). EGG is a non-invasive means of recording human gastric myoelectrical activity or slow waves from cutaneous leads placed over the stomach. In healthy volunteers, EGG tracings exhibit sinusoidal waveforms with a predominant frequency of 3 cycles per minute (cpm). Clinical studies have shown good correlation of these cutaneous recordings with those acquired from serosally implanted electrodes. The amplitude of the EGG waveform increases with ingestion of caloric or non-caloric meals. Some patients with nausea, vomiting, or other dyspeptic symptoms exhibit EGG rhythm disturbances or blunting of meal-evoked EGG signal amplitude increases. These abnormalities correlate to some degree with delayed gastric emptying of solids. In selected patients, EGG may be complementary to gastric emptying testing. At the time of writing, no therapies have convincingly demonstrated in controlled studies that correcting abnormalities detected by EGG improves upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Proposed clinical indications for performance of EGG in patients with unexplained nausea, vomiting, and dyspeptic symptoms must be validated by prospective controlled investigations.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^11345kvP]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Since no morbidity and mortality were observed in 773 patients, we suggest that the use of a Foley catheter without fluoroscopy or anesthesia is a safe method for the removal of coins lodged in the upper esophagus. This approach avoids the need for a long hospital stay or the risks from exposure to radiation and anesthesia.

Foley catheters can be used in emergencies, such as with the esophageal impaction of coins, if endoscopy cannot be performed immediately. This is particularly relevant in rural areas, in patients presenting at midnight in a facility, especially those without access to endoscopes or emergency services, or in any situation that warrants urgent removal of a foreign object.

### "Insert-coin": A prospective study of coin ingestion in children of southern Italy [^111zonqw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign bodies. When they get stuck in the distal esophagus, there is no general agreement about the timing of their removal because some of them may spontaneously migrate into the stomach, no longer requiring removal. We aimed at evaluating the gastric spontaneous passage of esophageal-retained coins, as well as complications.

- **Methods**: Children admitted for coin ingestion were enrolled.

- **Results**: Eight hundred seven children were enrolled. Among the medium-distal esophageal retained coins, we reported a spontaneous gastric dislocation in 65%, with no further need for endoscopy.

- **Discussion**: When coins are trapped in the middle/lower esophagus, we suggest withholding the procedure for at least 6–12 hours, especially for older children, because two-thirds pass spontaneously, not requiring endoscopic removal.

- **Step 6: Choose your injection site**:
	- You can inject into either the right or left side of your stomach area (abdomen), at least 2 inches away from your belly button and out towards your side (see Figure E). You should alternate between the left or right side of your stomach each time you give yourself an injection. Do not inject into skin that has bruises or scars. Do not inject through clothes.

- **Step 7: Clean the injection site**:
	- Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe (see Figure F). Let your skin dry before injecting.

- **Step 8: Remove the needle cap**:
	- Hold the prefilled syringe in the middle of the body with the needle pointing away from you. Remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off the syringe (see Figure G). Do not twist the needle cap to avoid bending the needle. Do not put the needle cap back on. Do not touch the needle.

- **Step 9: Injecting a dose that is less than the full amount in the prefilled syringe**:
	- If your prescribed dose is the same as the amount in the prefilled syringe, go to Step 10.

A 4-year-old presented to the emergency department, asymptomatic, with the strong suspicion (by history, physical examination, and initial radiographic interpretation by the emergency physician) of an esophageal coin. Closer inspection revealed radiographic signs associated with disk battery ingestion, a surgical emergency. In the operating room, superimposed coins mimicking the radiographic appearance of a disk (button) battery were extracted. This case highlights the important management differences between ingested coins and batteries, the need for cautious interpretation of radiographs, and presents a rare mimic of a serious ingestion.

- **Definition**: Esophageal dysphagia is characterized by difficulty transporting food down the esophagus due to involvement of the esophageal body and esophagogastric junction.

- **Pathophysiology**: Esophageal dysphagia is caused by structural or inflammatory abnormalities, including strictures, rings, webs, malignancy, reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and motility disorders such as achalasia, ineffective esophageal motility, esophageal spasm, and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of esophageal dysphagia include difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, intermittent or progressive dysphagia, food bolus impaction, food regurgitation, heartburn, weight loss, anorexia, respiratory distress, hypotension, and atypical chest pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with GERD is 0.46 per 100,000 individuals.

### Nexium [^111BBv1u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

For patients who have a nasogastric or gastric tube in place, Nexium for delayed-release oral suspension can be administered as follows:

- **Preparation**: Add 5 mL of water to a catheter-tipped syringe and then add the contents of a 2.5 mg or 5 mg Nexium packet. For the 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strengths, the volume of water in the syringe should be 15 mL. It is important to only use a catheter-tipped syringe when administering Nexium through a nasogastric tube or gastric tube.

- **Administration**: Immediately shake the syringe and leave it for 2 to 3 minutes to thicken. Shake the syringe again and inject the contents through the nasogastric or gastric tube, French size 6 or larger, into the stomach within 30 minutes.

- **Flushing**: Refill the syringe with an equal amount of water (5 mL or 15 mL), shake, and flush any remaining contents from the nasogastric or gastric tube into the stomach.

Typically, the surface of the normal corpus, when the stomach is empty and not distended, is almost invariably in folds, also called rugae, which vary in size depending on the degree of insufflation during the endoscopic assessment. In contrast, the surface of the normal fundus and antrum is smooth. The color of the normal gastric mucosa, as indeed of the whole GI tract, is velvety, glossy dark rose or red with a regular arrangement of the collecting venules, usually visible as red spidery vessels in the normal corpus. The presence of these collecting venules is characteristic of a normal stomach without H. pylori (sensitivity 93%, specificity 48%). With white light, high-resolution endoscopes, the round 'pit patterns' of the corpus and elongated 'pit patterns' of the antrum can be seen without magnification or enhancement.

- **Normal gastric corpus and antrum mucosal surface pattern**: Enhanced and magnification endoscopy reveals the round 'pit patterns' of the corpus and the elongated 'pit patterns' of the antrum visible without magnification. In the corpus, the red collecting venules (CV) are evident, as well as the round dark red crypt openings (CO). The vascular anatomy becomes more pronounced with Narrow Band Imaging (NBI). The visible anatomical components seen on magnification NBI include the dark brown 'crypt openings' (CO), the dark brown sub-epithelial capillary network (SECN), and the light brown marginal crypt epithelia (MCE). The corpus mucosa has dark round 'crypt openings'.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^114iLZJ7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Data were retrospectively collected from the medical records of 773 patients, aged 6 months to 16 years, with a mean age of 3.5 years, who were admitted from January 2007 to December 2022 for a coin lodged in the upper esophagus and who underwent silicone Foley balloon catheter extraction after informed consent had been obtained from the parents. This retrospective study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (Sariyer Hamidiye Etfal Education and Research Hospital, Clinical Research Ethics Committee, 2023). The data included characteristics of the enrolled children, referral time, and treatment outcomes.

Exclusion criteria for the Foley catheter extraction procedure included ingestion of a caustic substance and ingestion of other items such as batteries. Inclusion criteria were imaging evidence of the presence of a round coin lodged in the upper esophagus, witnessed coin ingestion, coins lodged in the esophagus for less than 24 hours prior to presentation, and absence of respiratory distress or esophageal abnormalities.

### Endoscopic removal of magnetic beads causing duodenal chronic fistula [^116dSbr9]. Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old girl with pituitary dysplasia for 2 years presented to our hospital after swallowing a coin 3 hours earlier. An abdominal X-ray revealed the coin in her stomach, along with an unexpected string of beaded, high-density images in the right upper abdomen (Fig. 1). Her parents disclosed that the girl had played with magnetic beads a month prior and might have ingested them then, but she had no symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever. Under intravenous anesthesia, the girl underwent gastroscopy.

Fig. 1: Abdominal X-ray showed the image of the coin in the stomach (red arrow) and a string of beaded, high-density images, forming a ring, in the right upper abdomen (yellow arrow).

A coin was identified in the stomach (Fig. 2) and removed using a foreign body forceps. Additionally, a string of magnetic beads with corroded surfaces was discovered in the descending duodenum, with one end protruding from the intestinal cavity, while the other end was invisible (Fig. 3). Given that it had been a month since ingestion and the X-ray showed the beads forming a ring, we inferred that a chronic fistula might have developed due to the magnetic force of the beads. Attempting endoscopic removal, we grasped one bead firmly with the forceps and successfully removed all the beads with the aid of a transparent cap (Video 1, Fig. 4). After removal, a fistula was exposed with no bleeding and there was no damage to the intestinal mucosa (Fig. 5). A nasointestinal tube was used to maintain nutritional intake. Postoperatively, no complication occurred.

### Outdoor grilling hazard: Wire bristle esophageal foreign body — a report of six cases [^117FS9KZ]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Esophageal foreign bodies are frequently encountered, with coin ingestion being the most common in the pediatric population and fish bone ingestion the most common in the adult population worldwide. Many people cook with outdoor grills and use wire brushes to clean them. We present the largest case series with six adult cases involving ingestion of wire brush bristles from food prepared on outdoor grilling surfaces. The occurrence of six cases within a small geographic area over a relatively brief time span raises important safety concerns and warrants attention to prevent serious complications.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^113E5ize]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Coins are the most commonly ingested foreign bodies in children. They usually become lodged in the upper esophagus and should be managed immediately. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with coins lodged in the upper esophagus. These patients underwent coin removal using a silicone Foley balloon catheter without fluoroscopy or anesthesia, and the study evaluated the safety of the procedure.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients who were admitted from January 2007 to December 2022 for coins lodged in the esophagus and extracted with a silicone Foley balloon catheter without anesthesia were evaluated retrospectively. We focused on the patient characteristics and clinical presentations, and the treatment safety, efficacy, and outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 773 patients (416 male, 357 female), with a mean age of 3.5 years (range 6 months to 16 years), who ingested coins and had them extracted with a Foley catheter are included. The majority of patients (n = 728, 94.17%) were successfully managed by silicone Foley balloon catheter extraction. Our overall success was 94.17%, with 88.30% of coins retrieved and 5.9% pushed into the stomach. Patients who were successfully treated with the Foley catheter were discharged on the same day, except for 7 (0.90%) who had minimal bleeding. Only 45 (5.82%) patients required esophagoscopy in the operating room, and these patients were kept overnight for clinical follow-up without any further interventions.

A Foley balloon catheter can be used to safely and effectively remove coins that are lodged in the upper esophagus.

### Imaging approach to ingested foreign bodies in the neck [^112g2BBL]. Neuroradiology (2024). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion is a common clinical occurrence worldwide, with high morbidity in the pediatric population and in adult patients with intentional attempts. Coins and button battery ingestions are more common among children, while bone impaction and swallowed dentures are usually seen in older adults. Most ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract spontaneously without complications; however, some require endoscopic and/or surgical intervention. Complications such as pharyngoesophageal ulceration, perforation, stricture, and deep neck infection can develop without timely diagnosis and management. Radiologists must familiarize themselves with the imaging approach to assess the characteristics and impacted locations of ingested foreign bodies in the neck.

### Gastrointestinal dysmotility in critically ill patients [^1117u5NL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The primary gastric functions are mixing and propelling food particles at a rate that facilitates the absorption of nutrients by enhancing the time they are in contact with the mucosa. Two distinct motor functional zones are recognized in the stomach: the proximal zone, which includes the fundus and the proximal third of the corpus of the stomach acting as a reservoir, and the distal zone, comprising the antrum and pylorus, which, together with the proximal duodenum, delivers chyme at a metered rate into the absorptive mucosa of the small intestine.

The gastric reservoir function is mainly vagally and intrinsically mediated, implicating the importance of the intact function of the vagus for gastric motility. The distal stomach mixes the food with the antral contractions and regulates the outflow to the duodenum. The gastric peristalsis and mixing are induced by slow waves and action potentials produced by the interstitial cells of Cajal. They are also influenced by hormonal and extrinsic neural signals and reflexes such as enterogastric and gastrocolic reflexes. Gastric reservoir function and peristalsis occur during and shortly after meals, whereas during fasting, the main motility pattern observed is the migrating motor complex.

Gastric motility can be markedly abnormal in critically ill patients, resulting in slow and delayed gastric emptying, food intolerance, and inadequate nutrition. Delayed gastric emptying is the most common gastric dysmotility pattern in critically ill patients and has been associated with increasing severity of illness.

### Is esophagogastroduodenoscopy necessary in all caustic ingestions [^1164xLRq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

The necessity of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients with caustic ingestion based on symptoms alone is unclear. Published data present contradictory evidence. This study aimed to determine the relationship between initial symptoms and EGD findings in patients with caustic ingestion.

- **Methods**: A chart review was conducted for caustic ingestion cases that underwent EGD over a 4-year period (December 1993 through November 1997).

- **Results**: Twenty-eight patients (15 girls; mean age, 2.7 years; range, 0.92–13.33 years) underwent EGD following caustic ingestion. Fourteen percent (4/28) of patients were asymptomatic, and endoscopy findings were normal. Another 57% (16/28) had normal endoscopic findings despite being symptomatic. Twenty-nine percent (8/28) of patients exhibited esophageal injury on EGD, all of whom were symptomatic.

	- **Injury grading**: Esophageal injuries were graded as follows: grade 1 (mucosal erythema), grade 2 (superficial burns; noncircumferential), or grade 3 (deep burns; circumferential).
		- Grade 1 injury was observed in three patients, each presenting with one symptom.
		- Grade 2 injury was observed in two patients, each presenting with one symptom.
		- Grade 3 injury was found in three patients. Two had two symptoms (drooling and vomiting; drooling and stridor), and one had one symptom (dysphagia). All patients with grade 3 injury subsequently required esophageal dilations.

- **Follow-up**: Follow-up information was available for two of the three patients with grade 1 injury and both with grade 2 injury at 34.3 months (range, 24–50 months) post-ingestion, with all being asymptomatic. The outcome for the remaining patients with no esophageal mucosal damage was not documented.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^112NzQTp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Foreign body ingestion most commonly occurs during the toddler period of childhood due to the behavior, physiology, and anatomical characteristics of children at that age. Coins are the most frequently ingested foreign bodies, typically becoming lodged within the esophagus, most commonly in the upper and middle sections.

Symptoms of esophageal coin presence are nonspecific, including choking, respiratory distress, wheezing, dysphagia, drooling, and chest and abdominal pain. Clinical findings depend on the characteristics of the foreign body ingestion, such as the degree of obstruction, the site where the foreign body is lodged, and the length of time elapsed between ingestion and evaluation.

A coin lodged in the esophagus should be considered a clinical emergency. The aims of treatment are to prevent tissue damage and decrease the risk of complications. It is crucial to diagnose the presence of the coin and extract it from the esophagus as early as possible. The most common approach is the extraction of the coin by rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia or, more recently, by balloon extraction under fluoroscopic guidance. However, one of these methods requires general anesthesia, and the other requires additional exposure to radiation.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate patients who have undergone extraction of coins lodged in the esophagus and assess the safety of this procedure.

### Advances in the physiology of gastric emptying [^111zBGdb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

As food is ingested and fills the stomach, fundic compliance increases, allowing a large volume of food to be accommodated without an increase in pressure. In this filling phase, the pressure and peristaltic pumps remain inhibited and show no contractions.

The filling phase is followed by a pumping phase, associated with a slow tonic contraction of the fundus and increased peristaltic contractions in the stomach, facilitating the mixing of ingested food with gastric acid and pepsin and its transfer to the pylorus. The peristaltic pump also recycles food that escapes proper pulverization. The antrum fills to a certain level before food begins to enter the duodenum, reflecting the lag phase on the whole stomach-emptying curve.

- **Magenstrasse**: The stomach forms a functional tunnel named the "Magenstrasse", along the lesser curvature of the stomach, shunting liquids directly into the duodenum and bypassing the main stomach.

Tenderized food is propelled into the pyloric grinder by forceful antrum contractions. The pylorus relaxes to receive food from the proximal antrum. Pyloric contractions generate a powerful retrograde jet of food that escapes pulverization and an anterograde jet of chyme into the duodenum. On intraluminal manometry, these events correspond with the antropyloric pressure waves (APPW) that are associated with a pulsatile flow into the duodenum and a "sieving function".

### And gastric acid: An intimate and reciprocal relationship [^1122D5EF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute infection by Helicobacter pylori is characterized by the bacterium's ability to survive in the superficial mucous layer through urease activity, resulting in a livable pH environment around it. The mechanisms by which Helicobacter pylori (Hp) can survive and proliferate when infecting a normal stomach are not fully understood. Notably, the two known voluntary infections were successful only after the inhibition of gastric acidity, suggesting the role of gastric juice in defending against the initial infection.

Both subjects in these infections experienced self-limited symptoms from the epigastric area, including fullness, nausea, and vomiting, which lasted for about a week after the infection. Similarly, in an outbreak of gastritis due to contaminated equipment during a study involving multiple determinations of gastric acid secretion in healthy subjects, participants developed hypoacidity, gastritis, and symptoms similar to those voluntarily infected with Hp. Helicobacter pylori was retrospectively presumed to be the causative agent. In these subjects, Hp may have been introduced to the stomach without gastric juice, which was continuously aspirated or as part of a study on meal-stimulated acid secretion where the luminal content in vivo was titrated to pH 5.0.

Thus, during the two voluntary infections, as well as the transmission by the nasogastric tube, Hp entered a stomach devoid of acid, allowing the bacterium to embed itself into the mucous layer before normal gastric acidity was reestablished. In most cases of chronic Hp gastritis, there is no recorded information of any symptomatic episode.
