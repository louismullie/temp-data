## Question

Femur fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about femur fracture management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the fracture by anatomic location and mechanism. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging strategy. Next, I will consider special fracture types such as atypical, periprosthetic, and pediatric patterns. After that, I need to outline treatment principles by location, including timing, fixation choices, and nonoperative exceptions. Finally, I should integrate perioperative care, osteoporosis management, rehabilitation, and quality metrics, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because management hinges on it. Femur fractures are broadly categorized by location as proximal (femoral neck, intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric), shaft, and distal, and by mechanism as high-energy traumatic versus low-energy fragility fractures, with the latter typically reflecting osteoporosis and falls from standing height, which carry different risks and treatment priorities.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. Standard radiographs, including AP pelvis and lateral hip, are first-line for suspected proximal femur fractures, but if radiographs are normal and suspicion remains high, MRI is recommended to detect occult or nondisplaced fractures, and this strategy reduces missed injuries and guides timely intervention. For suspected atypical femur fractures, I should confirm the ASBMR diagnostic criteria and look for lateral cortex beaking, transverse orientation, and minimal trauma, because these features alter both surgical planning and medical management [^116n2nMA]. In periprosthetic settings, I need to check for implant stability and bone quality using the Vancouver classification to align fixation choices with revision needs [^111TgAK2].

> Hold on, I should verify special fracture types that change management. Atypical femur fractures, often subtrochanteric or diaphyseal and associated with prolonged bisphosphonate use, require cessation of antiresorptives, consideration of teriparatide to aid healing, and intramedullary nailing with careful reduction to avoid propagation; healing is slower and complications are more frequent, so I need to plan accordingly [^115EUnP8] [^112oVW7K]. Periprosthetic fractures around THA/TKA are classified by location and implant stability, and unlike native hip fractures, early surgery within 48 hours has not consistently improved mortality, so timing should be individualized to comorbidities and logistics [^111TgAK2] [^113R76sw]. Pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures follow age-based algorithms, with early spica for 0–5 years, flexible nailing for 6–10 years, and rigid nailing for adolescents, with regional anesthesia considered for pain control [^111u1MsM] [^114NrDAY].

> Next, I should review proximal femur fractures, starting with femoral neck. For stable, nondisplaced femoral neck fractures, internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty, or even nonoperative care may be considered, but I need to weigh patient factors and local expertise; evidence is moderate and decisions should be individualized [^116vCCWv] [^111FnPGi]. For unstable, displaced femoral neck fractures, I should confirm that arthroplasty is preferred over fixation because it reduces reoperation and improves function, with unipolar and bipolar hemiarthroplasty performing similarly and total hip arthroplasty offering small functional gains at the cost of more complications in selected patients [^117FT4BM] [^113GgzPz] [^114r9tRM]. I should double-check that this applies to adults 55 and older with low-energy fractures, which is the target population for the AAOS guideline [^1147KvCv].

> I will now examine intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. For intertrochanteric fractures, cephalomedullary nails are generally favored in unstable patterns due to superior biomechanics and lower failure rates, whereas sliding hip screws remain acceptable in stable patterns; I need to ensure implant choice matches fracture geometry and bone quality [^111DgYyn]. For subtrochanteric fractures, I should confirm that intramedullary nailing is preferred because it better resists eccentric loading and shear forces in this region, and I must plan for poor bone stock and potential iatrogenic fracture during entry [^111DgYyn].

> Let me consider femoral shaft fractures carefully. Intramedullary nailing is the standard of care for adult diaphyseal femur fractures, with antegrade nailing typical and retrograde nailing useful in certain trauma patterns or ipsilateral injuries; I should confirm that early stabilization within 24 hours is recommended in polytrauma to reduce pulmonary complications and facilitate mobilization when physiologically feasible [^11373Zah]. But wait, what if the patient is unstable? In that case, damage control external fixation is appropriate until resuscitation allows definitive nailing, and I need to monitor for nonunion risk factors and manage accordingly if healing stalls [^116jbtjA] [^116YYrge].

> For distal femur fractures, I should double-check the evidence base because it is weaker. Locked plating and retrograde intramedullary nailing are both acceptable, and contemporary data do not show clear superiority of one over the other; given high mortality and complication rates, I need to ensure meticulous soft tissue handling, early mobilization, and vigilant surveillance for infection and implant failure [^112stCA7] [^113dJvy9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought early surgery within 48 hours would mirror hip fracture benefits, but I should correct that: unlike native hip fractures, early fixation has not consistently improved mortality for periprosthetic distal femur fractures, so timing should balance medical optimization with avoidance of undue delay [^113R76sw] [^114NTvHq].

> I need to ensure perioperative care is integrated and protocolized. Multidisciplinary co-management with geriatrics or hospital medicine reduces length of stay, readmissions, and complications; regional anesthesia should be prioritized when appropriate to reduce delirium and cardiopulmonary events; and early mobilization within 24–48 hours is essential to mitigate deconditioning and thromboembolic risk [^117HNFaU] [^112F9tSC]. Hold on, I should verify that these principles are reflected in high-quality guidance and not just single-center experiences; yes, AAOS and anesthesia society guidance endorse these standards for geriatric hip fracture care [^117HNFaU] [^112F9tSC].

> Next, I should review osteoporosis evaluation and treatment because secondary prevention changes future risk. After any fragility femur fracture, I should confirm that patients undergo osteoporosis workup and initiate pharmacotherapy; bisphosphonates are first-line in most patients, with denosumab, teriparatide, or abaloparatide as alternatives based on risk, contraindications, and cost; I need to ensure calcium, vitamin D, and fall-risk mitigation are addressed concurrently [^113r3Juw] [^116tff4d] [^115beCmp]. For patients with atypical femur fractures, I should stop antiresorptives and consider teriparatide to support healing, recognizing the evidence is observational but biologically plausible and widely adopted [^115EUnP8] [^1125ZsxJ].

> I will now examine rehabilitation and functional recovery expectations. Less than half of survivors return to prefracture function, so I should set realistic goals and embed physical therapy early with pain-control strategies, progressive weight bearing per fixation type, and strength and balance training to reduce recurrent falls; I need to ensure therapy protocols align with contemporary CPGs for older adults with hip fracture [^1146dXmL] [^11136Qfi]. Let me reconsider whether aerobic adjuncts help; a trial of arm ergometry is feasible in the inpatient setting, but evidence for functional gains remains limited, so I should individualize and prioritize mobility-focused interventions first [^111jxvqT].

> But wait, what about nonoperative management and palliative care in the highest-risk patients. Nonoperative care is associated with substantially higher mortality and is generally reserved for patients with prohibitive surgical risk or aligned goals of care; even then, I should confirm that decisions are made via shared decision-making and documented multidisciplinary consensus, and I should integrate early palliative care for patients with limited prognosis to optimize comfort and dignity [^1146wZnM] [^1172nA71] [^113BT5QT]. I should double-check that local policies address ceilings of care and DNACPR discussions proactively to avoid delays and moral distress among teams [^111TErVR].

> Finally, I need to ensure quality metrics and system processes are embedded. Tracking time to surgery, 30-day and 1-year mortality, readmissions, and functional outcomes enables continuous improvement; implementing standardized order sets and checklists can improve adherence to evidence-based care, though I should verify that checklist use alone does not guarantee outcome gains without concurrent process redesign and leadership support [^117HNFaU] [^112qD57b]. Let me summarize the decision flow to keep this actionable: classify by location and mechanism, image appropriately with MRI when radiographs are nondiagnostic, tailor fixation to fracture pattern and patient factors, prioritize early mobilization and co-management, treat osteoporosis aggressively, and individualize nonoperative care with palliative integration when appropriate [^117HNFaU] [^1147KvCv].

Femur fractures are **classified by location** (proximal, shaft, distal) and **managed based on patient factors and fracture pattern** [^117HNFaU]. Most **proximal femur fractures** in older adults require surgery within 48 hours to reduce mortality and complications, with arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck and intramedullary nailing for intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric fractures [^117HNFaU] [^117FT4BM]. Shaft fractures are treated with **intramedullary nailing**, while distal femur fractures often need plating or nailing; nonoperative care is reserved for select patients with high surgical risk or minimal displacement [^11373Zah] [^112stCA7]. Early mobilization, osteoporosis therapy, and thromboprophylaxis are essential to recovery and secondary prevention [^112F9tSC] [^113r3Juw].

---

## Classification and epidemiology

Femur fractures are **classified by anatomical location**:

- **Proximal femur**: femoral neck, intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric.
- **Femoral shaft**: diaphyseal fractures.
- **Distal femur**: supracondylar and condylar fractures.

Proximal femur fractures are most common in older adults, typically due to low-energy falls, and are associated with **high morbidity and mortality** [^11465DtJ]. Shaft and distal femur fractures are more often due to high-energy trauma in younger patients [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Typical presentation includes:

- **Pain**: severe, localized.
- **Swelling and deformity**: often with shortening and external rotation.
- **Functional impairment**: inability to bear weight or ambulate.

Diagnosis relies on **plain radiographs** (AP and lateral) of the femur; MRI or CT may be needed for occult or complex fractures [^117HNFaU].

---

## Management principles

Management depends on **fracture type, patient age, comorbidities, and activity level**. The overarching goals are **anatomic reduction, stable fixation, early mobilization, and pain control** [^11136Qfi].

---

### Proximal femur fractures

- **Surgical intervention**: Standard of care for most patients; early surgery within 48 hours reduces mortality and complications [^117HNFaU] [^112F9tSC].
- **Femoral neck fractures**: Displaced fractures are best managed with arthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty) [^117FT4BM]; non-displaced fractures may be treated with internal fixation [^116vCCWv].
- **Intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures**: Intramedullary nailing is preferred due to superior biomechanical stability and lower failure rates [^notfound].

---

### Femoral shaft fractures

Intramedullary nailing is the **gold standard** for femoral shaft fractures, providing stable fixation and enabling early mobilization [^notfound]. Nonoperative management is reserved for patients with significant surgical risk or minimal displacement.

---

### Distal femur fractures

Operative management with **locking plates or intramedullary nails** is preferred, particularly in displaced or intra-articular fractures [^112stCA7]. Nonoperative care may be considered for non-displaced fractures or patients with high surgical risk.

---

## Complications

Femur fractures are associated with **significant complications**, including:

- **Infection**: wound infection, osteomyelitis, and prosthetic joint infection [^115nmyum].
- **Nonunion and malunion**: particularly in osteoporotic or poorly managed fractures [^116YYrge].
- **Avascular necrosis**: especially in femoral neck fractures due to disrupted blood supply [^113WoTwY].
- **Thromboembolism**: deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: high one-year mortality, particularly in elderly patients [^11465DtJ].

---

## Rehabilitation and recovery

Early mobilization and **physical therapy** are critical to restore function, prevent complications, and improve quality of life [^1146dXmL]. Rehabilitation protocols are individualized based on patient factors, fracture type, and surgical intervention. Osteoporosis evaluation and treatment are essential to reduce the risk of future fractures [^113r3Juw].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by fracture type, patient age, and comorbidities. Proximal femur fractures in elderly patients carry **high mortality and morbidity**, with only about half of patients regaining pre-fracture function [^11465DtJ] [^11136Qfi]. Younger patients with isolated shaft or distal femur fractures generally have better outcomes with appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.

---

Femur fractures are **major injuries** requiring prompt, evidence-based management. Early surgical intervention, stable fixation, and comprehensive rehabilitation are key to optimizing outcomes, while osteoporosis management and fall prevention are critical for secondary prevention.

Clinical practice guidelines are designed to assist clinical decision-making by summarising evidence and forming recommendations. The number of available guidelines is vast and they vary in relevance and quality. We reviewed guidelines relevant to the management of a patient with a fractured neck of femur and explored similarities and conflicts between recommendations. As guidelines are often produced in response to an area of clinical uncertainty, recommendations differ. This can result in a situation where the management of a particular clinical problem will depend upon which guideline is followed. We explore the reasons for such differences.

### Management of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur: state of the art [^116jYSPP]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2004). Low credibility.

Metastases to bone are the most common cause of a destructive lesion of the skeleton in an adult. The proximal femur is the most commonly affected bone with metastatic disease in the appendicular skeleton. A systematic approach to patient management is critical, so as to avoid complications that will delay systemic therapy. The orthopedic traumatologist is often the first physician to see the patient with a pathologic fracture. As a result, the surgeon must be aware of the indications for resection versus internal fixation, as well as options for reconstruction. Polymethyl methacrylate and curettage can be useful in the appropriately selected patient. Postoperative external beam irradiation can significantly reduce disease progression and subsequent loss of fixation. A multidisciplinary approach to this patient group will help optimize prognosis as well as function. This article reviews the evaluation, management, and complications of treatment of pathologic fractures of the proximal femur, with an emphasis on metastatic disease and multiple myeloma.

Geriatric hip fractures — epidemiology and guideline context note that fractures of the proximal femur, or hip fractures, are common injuries in the elderly, typically resulting from relatively low energy mechanisms such as falls from standing height; the elderly patient population is particularly susceptible due to increased prevalence of osteoporosis and medical co-morbidities that predispose them to falls, and when injuries occur they are at increased risk of complications and prolonged hospitalization or readmission; notably, almost 30 percent of patients die within one year of injury; in response, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) published clinical practice guidelines in 2014 entitled "Management of Hip Fractures in the Elderly", which provide a detailed overview of optimal pre-, intra-, and postoperative management.

### Reduction techniques for diaphyseal femur fractures [^115ebmvp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining reduction in patients with a diaphyseal femur fracture may be difficult; therefore, thorough preoperative planning is required. To fully prepare for successful surgical management of diaphyseal femur fractures, surgeons must consider appropriate patient positioning and necessary tools, including surgical tables, traction devices, and instruments. Principles of acceptable reduction rely on the restoration of length, alignment, and rotation. Reduction of diaphyseal femur fractures should be attained in the least invasive manner, via percutaneous reduction techniques, if possible, to preserve fracture biology and promote successful fracture healing. Intraoperative assessment of reduction often requires imaging studies of the contralateral extremity as a reference. Intraoperative assessment for associated femoral neck fractures and postoperative clinical examination of the hip and knee are imperative to the successful management of diaphyseal femur fractures. Other reference modalities and clinical examinations are required in patients with bilateral diaphyseal femur fractures.

### Addition of aerobic training to conventional rehabilitation after femur fracture… [^111jxvqT]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Addition of Aerobic Training to Conventional Rehabilitation After Femur FractureClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. Some estimates assume that the number of fractures per year will double by 2050. Observational studies suggest that following hip fracture, only 40–60% of people who survive are likely to reach their prefracture level of mobility. Up to 70% may recover their level of independence for basic activities of daily living and less than half of all people experiencing hip fracture may regain their ability to perform instrumental ADLs. In Italy, as in Western nations, approximately 10–20% of patients are institutionalized after a hip fracture, which imposes a large cost burden on society. Then, it is widely recognised that a vicious cycle can occur after a hip fracture where pain and hospitalization result in disuse atrophy of muscles and general low level of aerobic fitness which increases the risk of immobility and new fractures.

Unfortunately, it is hardly conceivable that these patients could reach, in a hospitalization regime, activity levels equal to those recommended by the guidelines. For all these reasons, the investigators have introduced aerobic training performed with an arm cycle ergometer, in patients hospitalized and subjected to conventional rehabilitation. The primary purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to verify the feasibility of an aerobic exercise program in subjects with recent proximal femur fracture treated surgically.
- Older men or women aged 65 years and older.
- An intertrochanteric fracture, AO Type 31-A, confirmed with hip radiographs, surgically repaired by internal fixation.
- Low energy fracture.
- No other major trauma.
- Admission to the rehabilitation clinic from 8 to 12 days after the surgery
- Patients autonomous prior to fracture.

### Periprosthetic femoral fractures in the emergency department: what the orthopedic surgeon wants to know [^111TgAK2]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Femoral fracture in the setting of a hip arthroplasty is an increasingly common complication encountered in the emergency department (ED). Diagnosis and management of periprosthetic fractures are complicated, and orthopedic surgeons rely on imaging findings to guide the appropriate management approach to the injury. Delay in identification and appropriate definitive management of periprosthetic fractures is associated with high morbidity and mortality. At present, the Vancouver classification system for periprosthetic hip fractures is the most common classification system used by orthopedic surgeons. It relies on three radiographic criteria-fracture location, prosthesis stability, and quality of the femoral bone stock-to characterize these fractures and to help guide management decisions. Familiarly with the Vancouver classification system allows radiologists to both recognize and communicate the most clinically relevant imaging findings to the treating orthopedic surgeon. This article reviews the imaging workup for hip pain in patients with a femoral prosthesis, risk factors for periprosthetic fracture, and the expected normal appearance of the most commonly encountered types of femoral prostheses. Fracture terminology and the Vancouver classification system are reviewed in a simplified algorithm with emphasis on the most common patterns of periprosthetic fractures, the radiologic determinants of prosthesis stability and bone quality, and the management implications of these imaging findings. Finally, multiple instructive clinical cases are used to demonstrate critical application of the classification system and to highlight the clinical implications of the imaging findings. © RSNA, 2017.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^111u1MsM]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures — this clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies for the treatment of isolated diaphyseal femur fractures in children and aims to provide practice recommendations, highlight limitations, and suggest areas for future research. The goal is to summarize areas where there is good evidence and poor evidence in the treatment of isolated diaphyseal femur fractures in children and identify areas where evidence of any kind is lacking; AAOS staff and the physician work group predetermined specific questions, systematically reviewed the literature, and developed recommendations based on the strength or weaknesses of the results. Intended users are orthopaedic surgeons and all qualified physicians managing pediatric patients, with treatment based on informed decision making between the patient/guardian and the healthcare provider; clinician input based on medical knowledge, conservative management and surgical experience as well as skill influences identification of who will benefit from specific treatment options. The guideline is not intended for use as a benefits determination document. The patient population addressed is children who have not yet reached skeletal maturity with isolated diaphyseal femur fractures, and it is not intended for use in pediatric patients who present with additional coexisting injuries that require formal surgical intervention or other life-threatening conditions that take precedence over the treatment of the diaphyseal femur fracture.

### Initial fracture management and results [^1163vd9A]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2006). Low credibility.

In the management of fractures, the appropriate treatment must take into consideration the nature of the injury, the surgical insult and technique, and a variety of patient factors. The surgeon must also anticipate potential complications and plan the initial treatment accordingly. This article discusses the impact of surgical decisions on the process of fracture healing.

### Is there a role for early palliative intervention in frail older patients with a neck of femur fracture? [^116Zj6dQ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Should surgery be performed in very high-risk patients that are not expected to survive their hospital admission? Limited work exists in this area. A recent systematic review demonstrated very few studies comparing operative and nonoperative management. The available work focuses on mortality and not quality of life or health-care costs. Six patients in our mortality group did not receive a procedure following a consensus decision from the MDT. Due to their medical condition on admission, they were considered to have a very low chance of surviving surgery and received symptom management only.

Further work is necessary to explore the opinions of patients and members of the MDT regarding early palliative care interventions in patients with fragility hip fractures, to aid design of the most appropriate interventions.

Limitations

This work was carried out in a single hospital, and patient populations in other regions may vary; however, this regional major trauma center has an established orthogeriatric team and over 500 annual admissions for patients with an NOF fracture. The work is retrospective, and so informal care discussions with patients and their relatives may not be included; however, clinicians are encouraged to document all care escalation decisions and a comprehensive review of patient documentation followed by a multidisciplinary discussion has been carried out. These discussions were performed after death, and so potential bias is substantial; however, they highlight that patients may demonstrate several predictors of deterioration.

### Atypical fractures: an issue of concern or a myth? [^117G9vBH]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Atypical Femoral Fractures (AFF) represent fractures located between the lesser trochanter and the supracondylar flare of a femur. An increasing pool of evidence supports their association with the prolonged use of bisphosphonates, even though a direct correlation is yet to be proved. The purpose of this review is to encapsulate the current evidence associating bisphosphonate use and the development of AFFs, the clinical features related to their presentation, as well as to report the armamentarium of strategies available in the prevention and treatment of AFFs. Based on these evidence, we propose a management algorithm for AFFs, that can serve as a guide for patients presenting with this condition.

### Management of atypical femoral fracture: a scoping review and comprehensive algorithm [^116n2nMA]. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ASBMR criteria for atypical femoral fractures" for femoral fracture.

The ASBMR (American Society for Bone and Mineral Research) criteria for atypical femoral fractures is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients who have experienced a specific type of femoral fracture that is often associated with long-term use of bisphosphonates. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating atypical femoral fractures from other types of femoral fractures, which can guide appropriate treatment strategies.

The primary components of the ASBMR criteria include five key characteristics of the fracture, each of which contributes one point to the total score. These characteristics include: the fracture being associated with minimal or no trauma, such as a fall from a standing height or less; the fracture line originating at the lateral cortex and being substantially transverse in its orientation; the fracture extending through both cortices and possibly being associated with a medial spike, or in the case of incomplete fractures, involving only the lateral cortex; the fracture being noncomminuted or minimally comminuted; and the presence of localized periosteal or endosteal thickening of the lateral cortex - known as "beaking" or "flaring" - at the fracture site.

The total score is determined by adding one point for each characteristic that is present, with a maximum possible score of five. A score of four or more indicates that the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for an atypical femoral fracture. If the score is less than four, the diagnostic criteria are not met, suggesting that the fracture is likely of a different type.

This calculator determines if an atypical femoral fracture fits the diagnostic criteria set by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR). It assesses five specific fracture characteristics through a series of true/false questions:

- Is the fracture associated with minimal or no trauma, such as a fall from a standing height or less?
- Does the fracture line start at the lateral cortex and is it substantially transverse, possibly becoming oblique as it moves medially across the femur?
- Does the fracture extend through both cortices in complete fractures, potentially with a medial spike, or involve only the lateral cortex in incomplete fractures?
- Is the fracture noncomminuted or only minimally comminuted?
- Is there localized periosteal or endosteal thickening at the lateral cortex, referred to as beaking or flaring, at the fracture site?

For each question answered "true", the calculator adds one point to the score, resulting in a possible total of up to 5 points. The interpretation of the score is straightforward:

- A score of 4 or more suggests that the fracture meets the diagnostic criteria for atypical femoral fractures, indicating a likely diagnosis.
- A score below 4 indicates that the fracture does not meet the full criteria, suggesting that it may not be atypical according to ASBMR guidelines.

By providing both the score and its interpretation, the tool helps clinicians evaluate fracture cases based on established criteria, facilitating better-informed diagnostic decisions.

### Management of distal femur fractures in adults: an overview of options [^113kt9Ry]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of periarticular and intra-articular fractures of the distal femur pose a significant challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. The primary goal of surgical treatment remains: restoration of the articular surface to the femoral shaft, while maintaining enough stability and alignment to enable early range of motion and rehabilitation. With appropriate surgical planning, these injuries can be managed with a variety of methods and techniques, while taking into account patients' functional goals, fracture characteristics, health comorbidities, bone quality, and risk of malunion and nonunion.

### Periprosthetic femur fractures [^112cAVNx]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of periprosthetic femur fractures, like all fractures, requires careful attention to understand the fracture pattern nuances, identifying and executing a rational treatment approach, and providing an appropriate postoperative recovery protocol. Unlike most other fractures, modification of standard techniques is often required to obtain a stable fixation construct, and there is a greater role for revision arthroplasty in the treatment of periprosthetic fractures. Optimal indications for surgical repair versus revision arthroplasty and optimal postoperative weight-bearing protocols remain uncertain. Reported outcomes for patients with periprosthetic femoral shaft fractures are generally good and are relatively consistent. Results for periprosthetic distal femur fractures, however, are less good and more inconsistent. Both periprosthetic femoral shaft and distal femur fractures are associated with relatively high mortality rates, approaching that of patients with hip fractures. This review should provide insight into the current solutions and challenges for the treatment of patients with periprosthetic femur fractures.

### Femoral neck fractures: current management [^117JWmVy]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2015). Low credibility.

Femoral neck fractures are a commonly encountered injury in orthopaedic practice and result in significant morbidity and mortality. It is essential that surgeons are able to recognize specific fracture patterns and patient characteristics that indicate the use of particular implants and methods to effectively manage these injuries. Use of the Garden and Pauwels classification systems has remained the practical mainstay of femoral neck fracture characterization that help dictate appropriate treatment. Operative options include in situ fixation, closed or open reduction and internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty. Recent reports demonstrate diversity among orthopaedic surgeons in regard to the optimal treatment of femoral neck fractures and changing trends in management. The present discussion focuses on the current indications and methods for femoral neck fracture management to provide direction with respect to appropriate and effective care of these injuries.

### Surgical timing and postoperative outcomes in distal femur fractures: does early intervention matter? [^113QDcYZ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

Our findings suggest that the emphasis on early surgery for distal femur fractures may be less critical than in hip fractures. Instead, a patient-centered approach that balances timely surgical intervention with appropriate preoperative optimization may be more beneficial. While unnecessary surgical delays should be avoided, particularly in stable patients, forcing early surgery in medically complex cases may not yield significant improvements in outcomes.

For clinical practice, these results highlight the importance of assessing each patient individually, considering factors such as preoperative mobility, frailty, comorbidities, and baseline functional status when determining the optimal timing for surgery. Furthermore, our findings reinforce the importance of comprehensive perioperative care, including strategies to reduce infection risk, improve early mobilization, and address medical comorbidities preoperatively.

Potential benefits, harms, and contraindications — "This document potentially benefits providers, patients, and third parties", but "one potential risk is that guidelines are incomplete or inaccurate due to the paucity of well-controlled studies on the efficacy of fracture prevention with medical and radiation interventions"; the page warns that "if a non-surgical intervention is selected and the patient suffers a pathologic fracture of the femur, there would be significant additional harm", and states "it is thus important for clinicians to examine all relevant clinical information and use appropriate judgement in deciding when to make referrals to surgical specialists and for surgeons when deciding to undertake prophylactic internal fixation to prevent fractures".

Discussion

In clinical practice, there is great uncertainty of how to treat patients after they have sustained an AFF. This relates both to potential (positive or negative) effects of bone agents on the healing of the fracture and to the safety of osteoporosis drugs in those patients, who are still at high risk of fragility fracture after an AFF. Bisphosphonates are usually stopped because patients are considered at risk of an AFF of the other femur since bilaterality is commonly reported, varying from 28% up to 44%. In this systematic literature review, we aimed to assess the effects of teriparatide, denosumab, raloxifene, romosozumab, and abaloparatide on both the occurrence and healing of AFF in order to give recommendations for medical management. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions because there are no reported RCTs of treatment in patients with AFF with any of these drugs. Based on descriptions of 165 AFFs treated with teriparatide in observational studies, we made a crude estimate of effects of teriparatide on radiological healing of AFF after 6 and 12 months. The majority of surgically treated incomplete (n = 9, 90%) and complete AFFs (n = 44, 76%) healed within 6 months of teriparatide treatment, in contrast with nonoperated incomplete fractures treated with teriparatide (n = 13, 43%) and complete AFFs that were not treated with teriparatide (n = 34, 51%). The reported data are insufficient for an evidence-based recommendation of the use of teriparatide to accelerate healing of AFF. Yet, keeping in mind the flawed study designs and heterogeneity between studies, the observational data might suggest that teriparatide could have a beneficial effect on the healing time of surgically treated AFF, although nonunion after 1 year can still occur. There is no evidence of improved fracture healing for conservatively managed incomplete AFFs based on these observational data. Our findings clearly show that even during and after teriparatide treatment, a new AFF can occur, either as a first presentation of AFF or as a second AFF of the contralateral femur, but only in patients previously treated with bisphosphonates. The role of teriparatide for healing of any type of fracture is debated. One meta-analysis of 5 RCTs in patients with osteoporotic fractures found a significantly shorter healing time in the teriparatide-treated group, while another analysis including also nonosteoporotic fractures did not demonstrate any effectiveness for teriparatide with regard to faster union. Two RCTs involved subjects with femoral fractures. In one trial with postmenopausal women and low-trauma femoral neck fractures, teriparatide did not improve radiological fracture healing, but the sample size was too small to detect any differences. The other RCT involved premenopausal women with acute stress fractures of the lower extremities and who showed a tendency toward improved healing on MRI in the teriparatide group (83.3%) in comparison with the control group (57.1%), but this was not statistically significant (P = 0.18).

### Geriatric co-management of proximal femur fractures: total quality management and protocol-driven care result in better outcomes for a frail patient population [^115ZTeVN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Hip fractures in older adults are a common event, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Hip fractures have been previously described as a "geriatric, rather than orthopedic disease". Patients with this condition have a high prevalence of comorbidity and a high risk of complications from surgery, and for this reason, geriatricians may be well suited to improve outcomes of care. Co-management of hip fracture patients by orthopedic surgeons and geriatricians has led to better outcomes in other countries but has rarely been described in the United States. This article describes a co-managed Geriatric Fracture Center program that has resulted in lower-than-predicted length of stay and readmission rates, with short time to surgery, low complication rates, and low mortality. This program is based on the principles of early evaluation of patients, ongoing co-management, protocol-driven geriatric-focused care, and early discharge planning. This is a potentially replicable model of care that uses the expertise of geriatricians to optimize the management of a common and serious condition.

### Trochanteric femur fracture operated with dynamic hip… [^11421PmC]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate at 30 days after sustaining a hip fracture is up to 10%, and at one year 35% after the fracture. It is further known that almost half of the survivors are unable to reach their previous functional levels, partly related to the surgical treatment and fixation failure. One fifth of all fragility fractures is in the hip with an almost equal ratio in in the cervical and trochanteric regions. Hip arthroplasty and internal fixation are the two most common treatment options for cervical and trochanteric femoral fractures. Healthier patients with long life expectancy have better functional recovery and lower mortality when internal fixation is used. However, dynamic hip screws and intramedullary nails and screws are associated with high failure rates, particularly in unstable trochanteric fractures.

Osteosynthesis cutout, with penetration of the cervical screw through the femoral head, preceded by a neck-shaft varus tilting, is the most common reason of failure, reported in up to 10% in trochanteric fractures, and in about 5% of neck fractures. In addition, reoperations have been reported to be as high as 30%, where treatment of dislocated femoral neck fracture with internal fixation fails and subsequently gets revised with total hip arthroplasty. It is well established that salvage THA following hip fractures has significantly higher risk of complications compared to primary THA. In a limited one-year follow up study, the use of an injectable ceramic applied in the trochanteric fracture bone void has been shown to lead to adequate fracture healing with minimal DHS screw migration Preliminary data from biomechanical studies in osteoporotic sawbones and donated human osteoporotic femoral heads indicates that using a.

In a recent study, by combining the well-established fracture risk assessment tool and the Sernbo score to form a fracture and mortality risk evaluation Index, one fifth of the patients could be identified as a cohort, with high risk of subsequent fracture but low risk of mortality. This group could theoretically benefit from cancellous bone augmentation during internal fixation of a fragility hip fracture. By utilizing a simple form, the FAME Index was successfully applied in the acute setting before the operation, during history taking by well-informed medical staff in less than 10 minutes.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^117HNFaU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Geriatric hip fracture — injury assessment, imaging, timing, anesthesia, and fracture categorization emphasize early suspicion and coordinated care: when a geriatric patient presents with severe hip pain, particularly following a fall, a hip fracture should be suspected, and a thorough history and physical examination should be performed with evaluation for concurrent injuries; early consultation with an inpatient medical or geriatric specialist may be beneficial, geriatric specialists or hospitalists may help streamline preoperative testing and serve as an effective liaison to the anesthesia team, and a well-coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is encouraged; diagnosis is typically evident on standard radiographic assessment, and when a hip fracture is suspected in the setting of normal radiographs, it is recommended that additional imaging (for example, MRI) be obtained to evaluate for the presence of a nondisplaced fracture; once diagnosed, patients are typically admitted, medically optimized, and should be surgically treated as soon as able, preferably within 48 hours; there is strong evidence that regional anesthesia improves perioperative management in patients with hip fracture and may reduce postoperative delirium and cardiac events; geriatric fractures of the proximal femur broadly fall into three categories: femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures.

### Approach to femoral shaft nonunions: diagnosis and management [^116YYrge]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the high union rate of femoral shaft fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (90% to 100%), the annual incidence of femoral shaft nonunion ranges from 2% to 6%. Although less common than tibial nonunions, femoral shaft nonunions remain a clinical problem in orthopaedic surgery. Proper treatment begins with appropriate diagnosis, workup, and identification of risk factors followed by a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. This article provides current evidence-based guidance for providers on the diagnosis and management of femoral shaft nonunions.

### Surgical management of atypical femur fractures associated with bisphosphonate therapy [^112oVW7K]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Atypical femur fractures associated with long-term bisphosphonate use can be challenging injuries to manage. Not only do they have a prolonged healing time and increased rate of nonunion as compared to typical femur fractures, intraoperative complications are not infrequent and can be catastrophic. Given the pathologic nature of these fractures, a multidisciplinary approach to the patient's care is necessary. Treatment begins with medical optimization and careful surgical planning. Radiographic characteristics of the fracture and femoral osteology dictate reduction strategy, adjunctive surgical techniques, and implant choice. Intraoperative complications including malreduction, iatrogenic fracture, and fracture propagation can be avoided with thoughtful planning. The purpose of this article is to discuss the technical aspects of surgical management of atypical femur fractures. We also discuss management of intraoperative complications and treatment failure. Finally, we provide an update on recommendations for postoperative medical treatment and management of the contralateral femur.

Patients with thoracic injuries and a femoral shaft fracture — this injury pattern was the initial focus of damage control orthopaedics, with the concern being significant worsening of pulmonary dysfunction due to FES. If the patient has been adequately resuscitated and meets no other indication to hold off on definitive fixation, there appears to be little risk to proceeding, but patients who at or shortly following presentation have evidence of significant pulmonary dysfunction on high levels of ventilatory support who could not tolerate any nonessential operative procedure are an exception. Temporary external fixation might be reasonable in this scenario.

### Fracture-related infection of the proximal femur-diagnostics and treatment [^115nmyum]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

With the aging population and rising life expectancy the incidence of trauma-related injuries, particularly proximal femur fractures, is expected to increase. Complications such as fracture-related infections (FRI) significantly impede the healing process and pose substantial risks to patients. Despite advancements in understanding, diagnosing, and treating FRI, challenges persist in achieving optimal outcomes. This review addresses the significance of FRI following proximal femur fractures, emphasizing diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic modalities to enhance clinical care.

Findings

Notably, a consensus definition for FRI has been established, providing clarity for accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria encompass confirmatory and suggestive elements, facilitating precise identification of FRI. Therapeutic strategies for FRI in proximal femur fractures include a spectrum of surgical and antimicrobial approaches. Surgical interventions, ranging from debridement with implant retention over implant removal/exchange to staged conversions to arthroplasty, are tailored based on fracture stability, individual patient factors, and infection characteristics. The intricate decision-making process is elucidated, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment plans and multidisciplinary collaboration. Antimicrobial therapy plays a pivotal role in FRI management, with empirical regiments targeting common pathogens and local delivery systems offering sustained antibiotic release. Microbiological analysis and collaboration with infectious disease specialists should guide antimicrobial treatment and ensure optimal therapy efficacy.

Conclusion

Managing FRI following proximal femur fractures requires a tailored, multidisciplinary approach. Treatment strategies should be guided by diagnostic precision, patient-specific considerations, and collaboration among surgical, infectious disease, and clinical teams. Implementing comprehensive therapeutic approaches is essential for mitigating the impact of FRI and improving patient outcomes.

### The value of nonoperative versus operative treatment of frail institutionalized elderly patients with a proximal femoral fracture in the shade of life (FRAIL-HIP); protocol for a multicenter observational cohort study [^1172nA71]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Guidelines have no strict advice for frail elderly with a proximal femoral fracture, as a result of lack of evidence on palliative care in these patients. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises to discuss if patients are open to hospital admission and possible surgery. Dutch guidelines advocate operative treatment in patients with a life expectancy beyond 6 weeks. This leads to practice variation. Current practice is that over 90% of femoral fracture patients that presented to hospital are operated, even if they are institutionalized and have a limited life expectancy.

A systematic review of the literature on nonoperative management versus operative management of proximal femoral fractures in frail elderly resulted in 7 studies that met the eligibility criteria; All were nonrandomized, five were retrospective studies. A total of 1189 patients were included, 242 (20.3%) were treated nonoperatively. The mean age ranged from 76.9–101.8 years. The data indicated an unadjusted pooled odds ratio of 3.95-fold and 3.84-fold higher 30-day and 1-year mortality for nonoperative versus operative management. Data also showed that mortality was affected by the number of comorbidities. None of the comparative studies examined (health-related) quality of life, degree of frailty, and costs. The literature review shows a lack of high quality evidence on the true effect of nonoperative versus operative management on quality of life, pain, mortality, complications, and costs in the first 6 months after trauma in frail institutionalized elderly. Those answers are needed to aid patients and health care providers in decision-making for surgical repair, particularly in frail elderly patients. The above shows that the best treatment is not known, and supports the need for high quality evidence. Evidence supporting (non)operative management in terms of quality of life, pain, complications, and mortality is lacking.

It is common practice to decide on treatment following a shared decision process, but still nonoperative treatment is uncommonly used. It is unclear to what extent patients or their relatives currently have a say in the treatment decision.

This study aims to investigate the effect of nonoperative management versus operative management of proximal femoral fractures in a selected group of frail institutionalized elderly with regards to quality of life and clinical outcomes. Treatment decision will be reached following a structured shared decision process, in which pros and cons of both operative and nonoperative management are discussed with patients, their relatives, and all relevant care providers involved.

### Attitudes to palliative care in patients with neck-of-femur fracture – A multicenter survey [^113BT5QT]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The mortality of patients with neck-of-femur (NOF) fractures remains high, with increasing recognition of a subgroup of patients with predictable mortality. The role of palliative care in this group is poorly understood and underdeveloped. This research aims to investigate current clinician attitudes toward palliative care for patients with NOF fracture, and explore processes in place for early identification for patients nearing the end of life.

Materials and Methods

An online survey was constructed with reference to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence end-of-life guidelines (CG13) and distributed to multidisciplinary teams involved in the care of NOF fracture patients in 4 hospitals of contrasting size and location in the United Kingdom.

Results

Forty health-care professionals with a broad range of seniority and roles responded. The palliative care team was felt to have several potential roles in the care of NOF fracture patients, but there was difference of opinion between specialties about what these were. A number of barriers to palliative referral were identified, including stigma and active surgical management. The majority (75%) felt that all NOF fracture patients should have a discussion about ceiling of care, with difference of opinion about who should do so, and when.

Discussion

As the elderly population has grown, so too has the volume of NOF fracture patients. It is increasingly important to identify and escalate patients who have poor prognosis following hip fracture and ensure they benefit from palliative care where appropriate. This survey demonstrates a barrier to addressing the care of these patients and a lack of consensus on identification and referral to appropriate palliative care planning.

Conclusions

There should be close communication between specialties with regard to requirements for palliative care in NOF fracture patients, with ongoing education and clear local and national guidance to ensure they receive the right care at the right time.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^113P4nVi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Fragility hip fractures are a major public health problem with a notable effect on quality of life for patients and their families. Management of Hip Fractures in Older Adults: Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline serves as current evidence-based practice guidelines for orthopaedic surgeons in the management of this common fracture and is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the surgical treatment of hip fractures in adults aged 55 years and older (older adults). The lower age limit for the patient population was set at 55 years but was also required to have a median age of 65 years. All aspects of care for older patients at risk of hip fracture or who have sustained a hip fracture could not be addressed within the scope of this guideline, including important topics of prevention of primary or secondary hip fractures or posthospital rehabilitation. This guideline contains 16 recommendations and three options to assist orthopaedic surgeons and all qualified physicians managing patients older than 55 years with hip fractures based on the best current available evidence. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in the literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

### Interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults [^112stCA7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the distal femur (the part of the thigh bone nearest the knee) are a considerable cause of morbidity. Various different surgical and non-surgical treatments have been used in the management of these injuries but the best treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (9 September 2014); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 8); MEDLINE (1946 to August week 4 2014); EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 36); World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (January 2015); conference proceedings and reference lists without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults. Our primary outcomes were patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of knee function and adverse events, including re-operations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We assessed treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) and, where appropriate, we pooled data using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included seven studies that involved a total of 444 adults with distal femur fractures. Each of the included studies was small and assessed to be at substantial risk of bias, with four studies being quasi-randomised and none of the studies using blinding in outcome assessment. All studies provided an incomplete picture of outcome. Based on GRADE criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low for all reported outcomes, which means we are very uncertain of the reliability of these results. One study compared surgical (dynamic condylar screw (DCS) fixation) and non-surgical (skeletal traction) treatment in 42 older adults (mean age 79 years) with displaced fractures of the distal femur. This study, which did not report on PROMs, provided very low quality evidence of little between-group differences in adverse events such as death (2/20 surgical versus 1/20 non-surgical), re-operation or repeat procedures (1/20 versus 3/20) and other adverse effects including delayed union. However, while none of the findings were statistically significant, there were more complications such as pressure sores (0/20 versus 4/20) associated with prolonged immobilisation in the non-surgical group, who stayed on average one month longer in hospital. The other six studies compared different surgical interventions. Three studies, including 159 participants, compared retrograde intramedullary nail (RIMN) fixation versus DCS or blade-plate fixation (fixed-angle devices). None of these studies reported PROMS relating to function. None of the results for the reported adverse events showed a difference between the two implants. Thus, although there was very low quality evidence of a higher risk of re-operation in the RIMN group, the 95% confidence interval (CI) also included the possibility of a higher risk of re-operation for the fixed-angle device (9/83 RIMN versus 4/96 fixed-angle device; 3 studies: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.57). There was no clinically important difference between the two groups found in quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form in one study (23 fractures). One study (18 participants) provided very low quality evidence of there being little difference in adverse events between RIMN and non-locking plate fixation. One study (53 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a higher risk of re-operation after locking plate fixation compared with a single fixed-angle device (6/28 locking plate versus 1/25 fixed-angle device; RR 5.36, 95% CI 0.69 to 41.50); however, the 95% CI also included the possibility of a higher risk of re-operation for the fixed-angle device. Neither of these trials reported on PROMs. The largest included study, which reported outcomes in 126 participants at one-year follow-up, compared RIMN versus locking plate fixation; both implants are commonly used in current practice. None of the between-group differences in the reported outcomes were statistically significant; thus the CIs crossed the line of no effect. There was very low quality evidence of better patient-reported musculoskeletal function in the RIMN group based on Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (0 to 100: best function) scores (e.g. dysfunction index: MD -5.90 favouring RIMN, 95% CI -15.13 to 3.33) as well as quality of life using the EuroQoL-5D Index (0 to 1: best quality of life) (MD 0.10 favouring RIMN, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.21). The CIs for both results included a clinically important effect favouring RIMN but also a clinically insignificant effect in favour of locking plate fixation.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the major limitations of the available evidence concerning current treatment interventions for fractures of the distal femur. The currently available evidence is incomplete and insufficient to inform current clinical practice. Priority should be given to a definitive, pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial comparing contemporary treatments such as locked plates and intramedullary nails. At minimum, these should report validated patient-reported functional and quality-of-life outcomes at one and two years. All trials should be reported in full using the CONSORT guidelines.

### The jehovah's witness and dementia: who or what defines' best interests'? [^116LP5Ap]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

An elderly woman with dementia presented for repeat surgical management of fractured neck of femur. Although no advance directive had ever been generated, the patient was declared to be a strict Jehovah's Witness by her daughter, who vetoed the transfusion of any blood products. The fracture was managed conservatively but the patient suffered repeated chest infections, from which she died 4 months after admission. This case raised several clinical, ethical and legal issues and generated a spectrum of opinion as to the appropriateness of operative intervention, transfusion and provision of intensive care. We suggest that professional guidelines and the new Mental Capacity Act 2005 do not provide explicit and comprehensive guidance for practitioners. Further deliberation is required to bring about convergence between the law, ethical principles and professional guidelines.

Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) document Treatment of Hip Fractures in the Elderly to improve patient care and obtain optimal outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from indications typical of patients commonly presenting with hip fractures in clinical practice, as well as from current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature. The 30 patient scenarios and 6 treatments were developed by the Writing Panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. A separate, multidisciplinary Voting Panel made up of specialists and nonspecialists rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Imaging features and management of stress, atypical, and pathologic fractures [^116CeU8n]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic and atraumatic fractures are entities with distinct but often overlapping clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and management protocols. This article is a review of terminology, etiology, and key imaging features that affect management of atraumatic fractures including stress fractures, atypical femoral fractures, and pathologic fractures. The terminology of atraumatic fractures is reviewed, with an emphasis on the distinctions and similarities of stress, atypical, and pathologic fractures. The basic biomechanics of normal bone is described, with an emphasis on the bone remodeling pathway. This framework is used to better convey the shared etiologies, key differences, and important imaging findings of these types of fractures. Next, the characteristic imaging findings of this diverse family of fractures is discussed. For each type of fracture, the most clinically relevant imaging features that guide management by the multidisciplinary treatment team, including orthopedic surgeons, are reviewed. In addition, imaging features are reviewed to help discriminate stress fractures from pathologic fractures in patients with challenging cases. Finally, imaging criteria to risk stratify an impending pathologic fracture at the site of an osseous neoplasm are discussed. Special attention is paid to fractures occurring in the proximal femur because the osseous macrostructure and mix of trabecular and cortical bone of the proximal femur can function as a convenient framework to understanding atraumatic fractures throughout the skeleton. Atraumatic fractures elsewhere in the body also are used to illustrate key imaging features and treatment concepts. © RSNA, 2018.

Hip fracture clinical practice guideline (CPG) scope — population and fracture types — addresses adults with existing hip fracture and defines the target population and exclusions. For the purpose of this CPG, we define "older adults" as those who are aged 65 years or older. This CPG is focused on low-energy fractures of the proximal femur in older adults, which are most likely related to falls and osteoporosis; therefore, it does not address fractures due to high-velocity trauma, pathological fractures due to cancer or other disease, or fractures of the acetabulum. The goal of this CPG was to review the evidence relevant to physical therapist management and to provide evidence-based recommendations for physical therapy diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, and assessment of outcome in adults with hip fracture.

Damage control orthopaedic surgery — Key messages state that damage control surgery is an integral tool in the armamentarium of the orthopaedic trauma surgeon and should be considered as the first stage of intervention when early definitive surgical management is not possible — typically in patients who are critically injured or those with significant soft tissue injuries pending resuscitation and/or soft tissue injury resolution. Damage control surgery should be considered in patients who demonstrate severe traumatic brain injury and in those with inability to be adequately resuscitated as demonstrated by ongoing fluid and blood requirements, high base deficit or lactate, which are not improving, and pulmonary dysfunction requiring significant ventilatory support; open or closed compromised or suspected compromise of soft tissues (soft tissue loss, significant contamination, severe closed soft tissue injury) also applies, and damage control surgery should also be considered for patients who receive initial care in an environment with limited experience and/or resources. The use of damage control orthopaedic surgery should be monitored by the trauma performance improvement program (PIPS). If a patient is in extremis, it is reasonable to place a skeletal traction pin to aid in bony stabilization and alignment, and patients with femur or pelvis fractures who are not stable enough to be anesthetized for placement of spanning external fixation or are unable to tolerate the additional blood loss or physiologic insult may benefit from a period of skeletal traction. Once patients are in the operating room for management of concurrent injuries or able to physiologically tolerate operative intervention, formal stabilization with external or definitive fixation should be performed. Damage control surgery is utilized for critically ill or injured patients as an early initial step to definitive surgical management.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^116HCHea]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Hip fracture clinical practice guidelines — patient/participant inclusion requires studies using data from humans with participants 65 years of age and older (if mixed, the mean should be over 65) and fragility/low-energy hip or proximal femur fracture, spanning intracapsular, extracapsular (trochanteric and subtrochanteric/proximal femur [ICD-10 S72.2]), displaced and nondisplaced, and include all surgical approaches and weight-bearing status; if mixed conditions are included, there must be at least enough patients (approximately n = 15 in each group) with hip fracture and results reported separately. Exclusions include acetabular fracture only, primary hip replacement (not for hip fracture), femoral shaft/distal femur fractures, high-velocity/force or pathology-related fractures, animal studies, samples focusing on people younger than 65 years old, healthy/normal participants, primarily previously nonambulatory individuals, delivery-model papers not focused on physical therapy delivery, and orthogeriatric versus standard care if focused on medical management or just the orthopaedic surgeon and geriatrician role.

Hip fracture management in older adults — treatment goals, recovery expectations, and benefit–harm balance are described. Hip fracture in an older adult patient is typically a life-altering event requiring surgical treatment with the associated risks. Recovery to pre-fracture level of function is often unsuccessful and may occur in less than 50% of patients, regardless of their previous level of function. The aim of treatment of hip fracture in the older adult is to provide pain relief and restoration of function. For the vast majority of fractures, surgical treatment is indicated and carries greater potential benefit than harm.

### Timing of complications following surgery for distal femur fractures in older adults [^113dJvy9]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fragility fractures of the lower extremity are a substantial source of morbidity and mortality for the U.S. aging population. Distal femur fractures account for 4%-6% of fragility fractures of the femur, with an annual incidence of 4.5/100.000 in the general population and more than half occurring in individuals aged over 70 years. These injuries typically result from low-energy trauma, such as ground-level falls, and the 1 year post-operative mortality rate ranges from 13.4% to 35%, similar to hip fractures. - The management of distal femur fractures can be challenging. The fractures are often comminuted, intra-articular, periprosthetic, and involve osteoporotic bone. The high incidence of comorbidities in the older adult population may also impact operability, recovery, and survival. Addressing these multifaceted issues requires a multidisciplinary approach. Innovative interventions, such as geriatric fracture centers and multidisciplinary geriatric fracture programs, have shown promise in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.

Most previous studies involving distal femur fractures have focused on the technical aspect of patient care with limited data on perioperative complications.- In particular data are scarce regarding the timing of common local and systemic complications of operative-managed distal femur fractures in older adult patients. Adequate evidence on local and systemic complications is crucial to set expectations appropriately for healthcare providers and patients.

This study aims to determine the timing and rates of perioperative complications in older patients with isolated low-energy distal femur fractures. By analyzing complication timing, providers can optimize care strategies and improve patient outcomes. The study utilized a national multi-center surgical database to evaluate the timing of complications after surgery for distal femur fractures in older patients and whether complications were associated with patient factors.

### Attitudes to palliative care in patients with neck-of-femur fracture – A multicenter survey [^111TErVR]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

There was a strong consensus among survey respondents that all NOF fracture patients should be engaged in discussions about resuscitation and Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) forms. Three-quarters of respondents felt this should apply to all NOF fracture admissions, with the remaining quarter adding a caveat that the patient should be either comorbid or older than 60 years. Again, a unified local policy on which patients should have a DNACPR discussion may prevent confusion, promote consistent practice, and provide clarity in the case a patient declines later in their admission. The grade of doctor responsible for this discussion provoked a wide range of answers. Most respondents felt it should be at least an F2 doctor; however, 15% would accept a Foundation year 1 (F1) doctor. National guidance from the General Medical Council does not explicitly mention what grade of doctor should initiate DNACPR discussions. The United Kingdom Resuscitation Council guidance suggests that overall responsibility for these decisions lies with the consultant in charge of the patient's care and that an F1 doctor should not be signing DNACPR forms legally. This is in stark contrast with the findings of our survey where only 1 respondent felt a consultant should be having the DNACPR discussions and 6 felt it was appropriate for an F1 to have this discussion.

Improvements and clarity of national guidelines could result in more patients having these discussions, at the right time by the right grade of doctor and prevent potential medico-legal ramifications of failure to initiate and document these discussions appropriately.

Reassuringly, the majority of respondents felt there were no barriers to referring NOF fracture patients to palliative care. A number of orthopedic respondents felt that the stigma or negative connotations of referral to palliative care might be a barrier to referral. Furthermore, they raised the possibility that the surgical management of these patients may confuse the picture for these patients. It is important for all members of the NOF fracture patients' clinical care team to be aware that NOF fracture surgery can be a palliative procedure and that referral to palliative care should not be seen as a failure of active management, but an adjunct to holistic care.

### Subtrochanteric fractures: current management options [^115QkaMh]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review current management options for subtrochanteric fractures of the femur. These fractures behave differently from other proximal femoral fractures and have their own management pitfalls and problems.

Method

Articles were identified from Medline. Papers on the management of subtrochanteric fractures were assessed, and included if they contained relevant information. The articles were divided into groups depending on the type of management described. Conservative and operative management were considered separately. Operative management was classified according to the type of device used into extramedullary and intramedullary.

Conclusions

Conservative management gives satisfactory results in 56% of patients compared to 70–80% for operative methods. The studies on conservative methods are mostly dated, with less stringent outcome measures. Conservative management is safe, and has a low frequency of non-union. It is most applicable in regions where facilities are suboptimal, in patients unfit for surgery, and in children. When considering operative management, intramedullary devices appear to give better results than extramedullary devices, particularly when the medial buttress of the proximal femur is compromised. However, when operative treatment is undertaken, it should be by experienced surgeons using the technique with which they are most familiar.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^117FT4BM]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS hip fracture guideline — unstable (displaced) femoral neck fractures: In patients with unstable (displaced) femoral neck fractures, arthroplasty is recommended over fixation. The guideline rates Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Direct comparisons of arthroplasty (hemi- and/or total hip arthroplasty) to internal fixation for unstable/displaced (Garden III and IV) femoral neck fractures consistently reported better outcomes (reoperation rate, pain scores, functional status, and/or complication rate) for patients treated with arthroplasty, with a decreased rate of reoperation the most consistent finding, and composite analysis showing no statistically significant difference in mortality between arthroplasty and internal fixation. Implementing this recommendation does not result in additional harm beyond usual surgical risk, and although arthroplasty may be associated with somewhat higher initial charges due to more costly implants and higher procedural and professional fees, this is likely offset by the decrease in reoperations expenses avoided by arthroplasty versus internal fixation. Future studies should help to identify patient populations who may benefit from less invasive treatment.

### Hip fracture protocols: what have we changed? [^1126drcx]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Early surgical intervention is thought to reduce in-hospital morbidity and mortality as well as short-term mortality rates for elderly patients with hip fractures. However, hip fractures are also thought to be a symptom of progressive decline in elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities. A measured approach to medical optimization, which may preclude rapid surgical intervention, is often required to improve the patient's ability to resume a prefracture standard of living. Of late, new models of geriatric hip-fracture care have emerged, most of which entail early involvement of geriatricians and interdisciplinary care pathways, while continuing to focus on rapid surgical treatment.

### Surgical timing and postoperative outcomes in distal femur fractures: does early intervention matter? [^114NTvHq]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fragility fractures in the lower extremities represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the aging population in the U.S. Among elderly patients, distal femur fractures are the second most common type of femoral fragility fracture after hip fractures. Typically resulting from minor trauma, such as falls from standing height, these fractures are associated with a high postoperative mortality rate, ranging from 13.4% to 35% within the first year — a rate that is often similar to or even exceeds that of hip fractures. - Given these similarities, there is increasing interest in exploring whether early surgical intervention, which has shown improved outcomes in hip fracture patients, might yield comparable benefits for distal femur fracture patients.

Managing distal femur fractures presents unique challenges. These fractures often involve complex patterns, such as comminution and intra-articular extension, and occur frequently in patients with osteoporotic bone. Furthermore, the increasing rate of total knee and hip arthroplasty has led to a rise in periprosthetic and interprosthetic distal femur fractures, further complicating surgical management. 8 9 While early surgery has been shown to improve outcomes in hip fracture patients, - its impact on distal femur fractures remains less clear. Despite similarities in patient demographics and injury mechanisms, studies examining time to surgery in distal femur fractures have reported conflicting results. These inconsistencies may stem from differences in study design, patient populations, and institutional protocols.- A multi-institutional analysis is therefore needed to determine whether early surgical intervention provides comparable benefits in this population.

The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between surgical timing and postoperative outcomes in distal femur fracture patients. The primary outcome is 30-day mortality, assessing whether early surgical intervention is associated with improved survival. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of postoperative complications (such as infectious, thromboembolic, renal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary complications), length of stay (LOS), and the rates of hospital readmission and reoperation within 30 days.

By systematically analyzing these outcomes, this study aims to determine whether early surgery for distal femur fractures confers similar benefits to those observed in hip fracture management.

### Special topic: ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures – does evidence give us the answer? [^116362kZ]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Ipsilateral fractures of the femoral neck and shaft are rare, high-energy injuries that typically occur in young polytrauma patients. The associated fracture of the neck is often vertical in nature and is more frequently non-displaced than in isolated femoral neck fractures. Historically the diagnosis of an associated femoral neck fracture was delayed or missed in approximately one third of cases. Studies have shown that detection can be significantly improved with the implementation of a protocolized approach to hip imaging in all patients with femoral shaft fractures. Prompt recognition of an associated femoral neck fracture allows for timely stabilization and may decrease the risks of non-union and avascular necrosis. In contrast, failure to recognize a non-displaced or minimally displaced associated neck fracture prior to fixation of the shaft can lead to displacement, a decrease in neck fixation options, a technically challenging secondary procedure and increased risk of long-term sequelae. A vast array of treatment strategies have been described for this combined injury. Published options range from spica casting to open reduction and internal fixation of both fractures and include almost all conceivable combinations in between. While timely surgical stabilization is now universally recommended for both shaft and neck, no consensus exists as to the most appropriate method of fixation for either fracture. Most authors recommend prompt, but not emergent, surgery with priority given to anatomic reduction and stabilization of the neck fracture by either closed or open methods. Fixation of the shaft fracture follows as patient condition allows. The rare nature of this injury makes it very challenging to study and most published series' are retrospective with very small sample sizes. In short, no scientificallycompelling study is available to definitively support any one implant choice or method of stabilzation over another for the treatment of associated fractures of the femoral neck and shaft.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^116jbtjA]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Damage control orthopaedic surgery — priorities, techniques, and indications are outlined: Damage control surgery prioritizes resuscitation and correction of metabolic derangements, coagulopathy, hypothermia, and/ or resolution of soft tissue injuries over early definitive surgical repair, with focus to control hemorrhage, decrease contamination through debridement, and provide bone and soft tissue stabilization to patients unable to undergo definitive repair. External fixation is often used, particularly in femur fractures, to minimize ongoing soft tissue damage, decrease risks of fat embolism, control hemorrhage and contamination, alleviate pain due to fracture motion, and facilitate patient mobilization, and is also used to regain and/ or maintain gross length, rotation, and alignment of extremities with unstable fractures and soft tissue injuries that preclude early internal fixation. After a period of resuscitation, patients are taken back to the operating room for definitive management, and those who could benefit include patients undergoing emergent control of life-threatening injuries by other disciplines or who are reaching the limits of physiologic reserve as determined by hypothermia, coagulopathy, and/or acidosis, or who have severe closed or open soft tissue injuries. Modern orthopaedic approaches to fractures may in many cases be thought of as a soft-tissue injury that contains within it a fractured bone, and severe compromise of this soft-tissue envelope presents another indication for damage control surgery; examples include heavily contaminated open fractures or closed injuries that historically have been shown to do poorly with acute open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), such as pilon fractures and bicondylar tibial plateau fractures, whereas unicondylar plateau fractures are typically amenable to immediate ORIF. Because soft tissue injuries evolve over the hours or days following injury, temporary approaches to skeletal fixation allow the full extent of the soft tissue injury to declare itself before committing to a definitive internal fixation.

### Gaps and opportunities in the management of the young femoral neck fracture [^112JuVuD]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Femoral neck fractures in young adults are difficult to treat. There are substantial gaps in our knowledge regarding treatment and prevention of young adult femoral neck fractures. Avoiding malunion or nonunion of these fractures after fixation remains a challenge. Currently available fixation techniques may allow for healing to occur, but in a shortened position, with negative consequences on gait mechanics and physical function. Osteonecrosis remains a problem, affecting up to half of patients who sustain femoral neck fractures. Achieving reliable healing may require a reconsideration of fracture fixation implants as well as biological methods to address metabolic, endocrine, and/or genetic abnormalities that may be present in the young adult femoral neck fracture patient. Also, prevention of low-energy femoral neck fractures (e.g. stress fracture) remains an area ripe for investigation.

### A guide to improving the care of patients with fragility fractures, edition 2 [^111woa19]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past 4 decades, much has been learned about the pathophysiology and treatment of osteoporosis, the prevention of fragility fractures, and the perioperative management of patients who have these debilitating injuries. However, the volume of published literature on this topic is staggering and far too voluminous for any clinician to review and synthesize by him or herself. This manuscript thoroughly summarizes the latest research on fragility fractures and provides the reader with valuable strategies to optimize the prevention and management of these devastating injuries. The information contained in this article will prove invaluable to any health care provider or health system administrator who is involved in the prevention and management of fragility hip fractures. As providers begin to gain a better understanding of the principles espoused in this article, it is our hope that they will be able to use this information to optimize the care they provide for elderly patients who are at risk of or who have osteoporotic fractures.

### Initial preoperative management of geriatric hip fractures [^11358gSG]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Initial Preoperative Management of Geriatric Hip Fractures

The medical management of hip fractures uses a multifactorial approach and employs an evidence-based treatment algorithm. Initial assessment of the patient begins upon their arrival at the emergency department, where the patient is medically stabilized and evaluated for possible coexisting injuries. After initial stabilization, basic laboratory test results are obtained (ie, complete blood count, Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP), Prothrombin Time (PT)/international normalized ratio, and urinalysis) for assessment of anemia, renal function, and coagulation status and to document a preexisting condition. Imaging is also performed at this time. A lateral femur and an anteroposterior pelvis plain film of both hips is considered adequate in most cases.

Literature on reduction of hip fractures remains controversial as older studies suggest that patients enjoy little benefit and suffer increased pain from reduction maneuvers. Current literature, however, favors earlier surgical intervention over reduction in the setting of hip fracture. In addition to providing adequate pain management, efforts are also directed toward pain control, which does not compromise mental status. Depending on the structure of the care system, the primary management team may be based on medicine or orthopedics, but geriatric fracture centers have moved toward orthopedic primary care with a comanagement model. This collaborative effort between geriatric and orthopedic services is effective in decreasing the overall length of stay from 4.6 days compared with a national average of 5.2 days. Additionally, readmission rates have been reduced (9.7% vs 19.4% national average) along with in-hospital mortality (1.5% vs 3.2% national average).

### Variability in the follow-up management of pediatric femoral fractures [^113ocV2T]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

After obtaining ethics approval from the university institution-affiliated research ethics board, a retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients presenting to a single tertiary pediatric care center who sustained an isolated femoral fracture between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. Surveillance for follow-up visits was conducted through December 31, 2019. Over this period, there were eight pediatric orthopaedic surgeons managing femur fractures at this center. Patients were identified from a surgical database and from the hospital's Performance Measurement and Reporting Agency using appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes (Table 1). Operations missing procedure codes were identified using the diagnosis. Key diagnosis search terms included femur #, femur fracture, femoral fracture, # right femur, # left femur, # femur, fracture femur, fracture left femur, fracture right femur, bilateral femur fracture, femoral shaft fracture, femur shaft fracture, femur shaft #, hip fracture, and femur malunion. Medical records and radiographs of potentially eligible patients were reviewed to confirm inclusion.

Table 1
ICD-10Diagnosis Codes and CPTProcedure Codes Used to Identify Femur Fracture Treatment and Treatment of Complications

Patients were included if they were younger than 18 years at presentation and were treated for an isolated femur fracture. Patients were excluded if there were any pre-existing pathologies increasing the likelihood of a fracture (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta) or history of a previous femur fracture at the same site. Patients were also excluded if they presented with open fractures or fractures at other sites of the body, with the exception of bilateral femur fractures. Open fractures were excluded because the treatment and potential for complications vary greatly from those of closed fractures. Patients were excluded if they were lost to follow-up at any point during the duration of their care. This was determined by a lack of documented clinic or radiographic visits, despite a clinic note saying the patient is due to return. The presence of complications was documented for all clinic visits. Cast irritation requiring early removal, growth arrest, infection, notable pain, refracture, and nonunion were analyzed as true complications. Implant irritation and leg-length discrepancy were analyzed as expected sequelae.

There should be protocol-driven, fast-track admission of patients with hip fractures through the emergency department. Patients with hip fractures require multidisciplinary care, led by orthogeriatricians. Surgery is the best analgesic for hip fractures. Surgical repair of hip fractures should occur within 48 hours of hospital admission. Surgery and anaesthesia must be undertaken by appropriately experienced surgeons and anaesthetists. There must be high-quality communication between clinicians and allied health professionals. Early mobilisation is a key part of the management of patients with hip fractures. Pre-operative management should include consideration of planning for discharge from hospital. Measures should be taken to prevent secondary falls. 10. Continuous audit and targeted research is required in order to inform and improve the management of patients with hip fracture.

### Conservative versus operative treatment for hip fractures in adults [^112cMRp9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Until operative treatment involving the use of various implants was introduced in the 1950s, hip fractures were managed using conservative methods based on traction and bed rest.

Objectives

To compare conservative with operative treatment for fractures of the proximal femur (hip) in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008), Current Controlled Trials, orthopaedic journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing these two treatment methods in adults with hip fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by fracture type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped by implant type and data were pooled where appropriate using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

The five randomised trials included in the review involved only 428 elderly patients. One small and potentially biased trial of 23 patients with undisplaced intracapsular fracture showed a reduced risk of non-union for those fractures treated operatively. The four trials on extracapsular fractures tested a variety of surgical techniques and implant devices and only one trial involving 106 patients can be considered to test current practice. In this trial, no differences were found in medical complications, mortality and long-term pain. However, operative treatment was more likely to result in the fracture healing without leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay and a statistically non-significant increase in the return of patients back to their original residence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is a lack of available evidence to inform practice for undisplaced intracapsular fractures, variation in practice has reduced and most fractures are treated surgically. The limited available evidence from randomised trials does not suggest major differences in outcome between conservative and operative management programmes for extracapsular femoral fractures, but operative treatment is associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. Conservative treatment will be acceptable where modern surgical facilities are unavailable, and will result in a reduction in complications associated with surgery, but rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity more common. Currently, it is difficult to conceive circumstances in which future trials would be practical or viable.

### Management principles of osteoporotic fractures [^114ZN5kU]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are difficult to manage. They pose a number of difficulties to the surgeon arising from the underlying poor bone stock compromising the intention to achieve optimum fixation. Moreover, the frail elderly patients present with a variety of medical co-morbidities increasing the risk of developing perioperative complications. Despite these recognized challenges, there are currently a number of improving technologies and strategies at the surgeon's disposal to provide more confidence with fracture fixation and maximize the chance of success.

### Fracture risk following an atypical femoral fracture [^115EUnP8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) are rare insufficiency fractures of the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal region of the femur, which occur in a number of metabolic bone disorders but are mainly recognized as a long‐term complication in subjects with long‐term anti‐resorptive (AR) therapies. AFFs have been associated with the duration of treatment with AR therapies; ie, incidence increasing from three to more than 50 cases per 100,000 person‐years between 1 and 10 years of exposure. However, the benefit of AR drugs on fracture prevention in patients with established osteoporosis or at high risk of fractures largely exceeds the risk of AFF, with about 1200 fractures prevented for one AFF associated with 3 years of bisphosphonate therapy. Even in the context of bone fragility, clinical management of patients who sustained an AFF generally includes cessation of AR treatments, which decreases the risk of AFF by 70% after 1 year, despite the long‐term remnant effect of bisphosphonates in bones. Low‐quality evidence is available concerning medical management of patients with AFF, whereby the possibility of a second AFF is balanced with the need to prevent future fragility fractures in high‐risk patients. The current attitude is case‐specific, but a consensus‐based strategy includes surgical fixation depending on the pattern of the fracture (intramedullary nailing in majority of cases), discontinuation of AR treatments, adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and consideration of teriparatide for patients with delayed healing.

Poor postoperative outcomes (required revision surgery, implant failure, and delayed radiological union) have been reported after AFF, whereas no excess risk of mortality was established in AFF patients when compared to the general population. It is noteworthy that data are lacking on the incidence of subsequent fragility fractures after an AFF. In particular, it remains unknown whether AFF should be considered as a predictor of imminent fracture risk, similarly to a recent osteoporotic fracture.

In this follow‐up study, we compared the incidence of new fragility fractures following an AFF to the one following an osteoporotic fracture.

### Does time to surgery affect outcomes for periprosthetic femur fractures? [^113R76sw]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic femur fractures around total hip (THA) and total knee (TKA) arthroplasties are difficult complications to manage. With native hip fractures, delay to fixation has been correlated with an increase in postoperative mortality. The effect of time to definitive fixation of periprosthetic femur fractures around THA and TKA is not well established. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of time to definitive fixation on postoperative length of stay and mortality for patients with periprosthetic femur fractures around THA and TKA.

Methods

A review of 2537 arthroplasty patient charts yielded 235 patients who were diagnosed with a periprosthetic femur fracture at our institution from 2005 to 2014. Time to surgical management, length of stay, demographics, referral status, fracture classification, and fixation modality along with mortality was recorded for all patients.

Results

One hundred eighty patients met study inclusion (111 THAs, 69 TKAs). Average age was 79.2 years and 72.2% were female. The average time from admission to definitive fixation was 96.5 hours with 31.1% of patients having surgery within 48 hours after presenting to hospital. Postoperative length of stay and mortality were not affected by time to definitive fixation greater than 48 hours for either of the periprosthetic TKA or THA patient cohorts. Postoperative mortality within 1 year was 5.5% for all patients (6.3% THA, 4.3% TKA).

Conclusion

The timing of fixation of periprosthetic femur fractures does not appear to affect postoperative length of stay or mortality within 1 year.

### Diagnosis and management of ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures [^1123UNyk]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures typically occur as a result of high-energy trauma in young adults. Up to 9% of femoral shaft fractures will have an associated femoral neck fracture. Awareness of this association and the use of a protocolized approach to diagnosis and management can help prevent missed injuries and the associated complications of displacement, nonunion, and osteonecrosis. The femoral neck fracture is often vertically oriented and either nondisplaced or minimally displaced, and thus, these fractures are frequently missed in the initial evaluation. Fixation of these combined injury patterns is challenging, and multiple treatment options exist. Treatment goals should include anatomic reduction and adequate fixation of the femoral neck fracture, as well as restoration of the length, alignment, and rotation of the femoral shaft fracture.

AAOS hip fracture guideline — evidence selection and hierarchy explain that when examining primary studies, we will analyze the best available evidence regardless of study design and will first consider randomized controlled trials identified by the search strategy. In the absence of two or more RCTs, we will sequentially search for prospective controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, and prospective case-series studies. Only studies of the highest level of available evidence are included, assuming that there were 2 or more studies of that higher level; for example, if there are two Level II studies that address the recommendation, Level III and IV studies are not included.

### Outpatient management of the elderly patient following fragility hip fracture [^114JWSCc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hip fractures associated with underlying osteoporosis result in significant morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and increase the risk for future fractures. Several underlying modifiable contributors may be identified, while osteoporosis itself is amenable to a number of effective treatments. Other interventions can further reduce the risk of falls and second fractures. This paper reviews evaluation and management options after fragility (low trauma) hip fractures in the geriatric population.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^111FnPGi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS hip fracture guideline — stable (impacted/non-displaced) femoral neck fractures: In patients with stable (impacted/non-displaced) femoral neck fractures, hemiarthroplasty, internal fixation or non-operative care may be considered. The guideline rates Quality of Evidence as Moderate and Strength of Option as Limited. Rationale describes strong evidence from one prospective clinical trial comparing non-operative care, internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty, with short- and intermediate-term pain, function and quality-of-life outcomes favoring hemiarthroplasty over non-surgical care, while other outcomes and long-term results were similar between groups. Therefore, hemiarthroplasty may be considered for short term improvement of function, QOL and mortality. Benefits/harms note no differences in adverse events between hemiarthroplasty and non-operative groups but better outcomes with hemiarthroplasty at least in short and intermediate terms; acceptability may vary, and feasibility notes that hemiarthroplasty may not be available in all centers.

### Management of pediatric femoral neck fracture [^113kSUE6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

In the pediatric population, femoral neck fracture is a relatively uncommon injury with a high complication rate, despite appropriate diagnosis and management. The anatomy and blood supply of the proximal femur in the skeletally immature patient differs from that in the adult patient. Generally, these fractures result from high-energy trauma and are categorized using the Delbet classification system. This system both guides management and aids the clinician in determining the risk of osteonecrosis after these fractures. Other complications include physeal arrest, coxa vara, and nonunion. Multiple fracture fixation methods have been used, with the overall goal being anatomic reduction with stable fixation. Insufficiency fractures of the femoral neck, although rare, must also be considered in the differential diagnosis for the pediatric patient presenting with atraumatic hip pain.

### Checklists in femur fractures: high adherence after implementation of computer-based pediatric femur guidelines [^112qD57b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) created an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the care of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures in 2010. Our institution implemented checklists based off these guidelines embedded in a standardized EMR order. The purpose of this study was to describe compliance with checklist completion and to assess safety improvement in a large urban pediatric hospital.

Methods:

Retrospective and prospective data were collected from 2 years before and 5 years after checklist implementation. This included the patient safety checklists from August 2011 through August 2016. Patients aged 0 to 18 years with a diaphyseal femur fracture were queried from the EMR and included in this study. Patient charts were reviewed for complications, including nerve injury, pressure sore, leg length discrepancy, loss of reduction, failure of fixation, nonunion, delayed union, and infection. Compliance rates were reported based on the AAOS clinical practice guidelines.

Results:

A total of 313 patients for the postchecklist period were reviewed in this study. Of 219 patients eligible for inclusion, 198 had checklists completed (group B). This group was compared with 100 patients with diaphyseal femur fractures from the period before implementation of the checklist (group A). We found no statistical difference in the number of patients with complications between groups (12% in both groups, P = 0.988). Postoperative checklists demonstrated that 89.9% of patients (178/198) received age-appropriate treatment consistent with the AAOS guideline recommendations after implementation of the checklist. Before the checklist implementation (group A), 94% (94/100) adhered to the guidelines.

Conclusion:

This study reveals high compliance rates with the AAOS evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric femur fractures. Implementing standardized checklists is possible by embedding them into the EMR. Implementation of checklists did not improve compliance or patient outcomes.

### Epidemiology, patient outcome and complications after non-operative management of hip fracture: a systematic review [^1146wZnM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Introduction

Surgery is the preferred treatment for hip fracture in older people. However, a proportion of patients with hip fracture do not receive surgery. There is a lack of contemporary evidence describing this patient population and what their associated outcomes are. We aimed to describe the variation in non‐operative management and its outcomes around the world.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of older people presenting to hospital with hip fracture, comparing those with and without surgery for non‐operative proportions, mortality and other outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale. We performed a random effects meta‐analysis with adjustment for clustering.

Results

Of 4437 screened studies, 185 were included from 172 separate cohorts, 44 countries, six continents and involving 10,763,994 patients. The overall proportion of non‐operative management was 8.4% (95%CI 7.2–9.7%) with wide within‐country and regional variation. There was no consistent association of non‐operative management proportions with the admission characteristics of sex, fracture type or patient ethnicity. Non‐operative management was associated with a greater relative risk of death at all time points. Risk of bias was generally low except for the expected confounding by indication.

Discussion

Non‐operative management of hip fracture is relatively common, but there is wide variation that is unexplained by differences in patient characteristics. The evidence is limited by incomplete reporting of patient characteristics and outcomes, and a lack of controlled studies even in the highest risk populations. Further work is needed to understand this decision‐making process.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^114r9tRM]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Unstable femoral neck fractures — total hip arthroplasty versus hemi arthroplasty is characterized as follows: In properly selected patients with unstable (displaced) femoral neck fractures, there may be a functional benefit to total hip arthroplasty over hemi arthroplasty at the risk of increasing complications, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (Downgraded). Evidence from two or more "High" quality studies supported this, and the panel notes Four high strength and ten moderate strength studies examined this question. The evidence demonstrates a small functional outcome benefit to patients who received total hip arthroplasty, whereas Hemi arthroplasty was associated with a small decrease in dislocation and instability, and Mortality rates were largely unaffected within the first 4 years after treatment. The strength of the evidence is strong but the effect size is small, which led the expert panel to unanimously downgrade this recommendation to moderate, and Cautious decision making for lower functioning patients may be justified considering the bias and risk for complications.

### Trochanteric femur fracture operated with dynamic hip screw system (DHS) augmented with a biphasic apatite sulphate combined with systemic or local bisphosphonate… [^1168CKbH]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate at 30 days after sustaining a hip fracture is up to 10%, and at one year 35% after the fracture. It is further known that almost half of the survivors are unable to reach their previous functional levels, partly related to the surgical treatment and fixation failure. One fifth of all fragility fractures is in the hip with an almost equal ratio in in the cervical and trochanteric regions. Hip arthroplasty and internal fixation are the two most common treatment options for cervical and trochanteric femoral fractures. Healthier patients with long life expectancy have better functional recovery and lower mortality when internal fixation is used. However, dynamic hip screws and intramedullary nails and screws are associated with high failure rates, particularly in unstable trochanteric fractures.

Osteosynthesis cutout, with penetration of the cervical screw through the femoral head, preceded by a neck-shaft varus tilting, is the most common reason of failure, reported in up to 10% in trochanteric fractures, and in about 5% of neck fractures. In addition, reoperations have been reported to be as high as 30%, where treatment of dislocated femoral neck fracture with internal fixation fails and subsequently gets revised with total hip arthroplasty. It is well established that salvage THA following hip fractures has significantly higher risk of complications compared to primary THA. In a limited one-year follow up study, the use of an injectable ceramic applied in the trochanteric fracture bone void has been shown to lead to adequate fracture healing with minimal DHS screw migration Preliminary data from biomechanical studies in osteoporotic sawbones and donated human osteoporotic femoral heads indicates that using a.

In a recent study, by combining the well-established fracture risk assessment tool and the Sernbo score to form a fracture and mortality risk evaluation Index, one fifth of the patients could be identified as a cohort, with high risk of subsequent fracture but low risk of mortality. This group could theoretically benefit from cancellous bone augmentation during internal fixation of a fragility hip fracture. By utilizing a simple form, the FAME Index was successfully applied in the acute setting before the operation, during history taking by well-informed medical staff in less than 10 minutes.

### Hip fractures: diagnosis and management… [^113WoTwY]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

9, 28 For those older than 65 years, arthroplasty is generally preferred 9. Intertrochanteric and extracapsular fractures are typically repaired with open reduction and internal fixation 12,
28. Subtrochanteric fractures usually require an intramedullary rod and nail to stabilize the fem-oral head and shaft. 12, 28. 16, 54–56 The latter cause, commonly called insufficiency fracture, occurs in postmenopausal women and those with metabolic conditions that compromise bone strength. 57 Both mechanisms lead to overload and mechanical failure and, if not recognized early, may progress to complete and displaced hip fracture. Because of high, poor relative vascular supply of the circumflex femoral arteries around the femoral neck, these fractures carry high rates of nonunion and avascular necrosis. 16, 57, 58.

DIAGNOSIS When suspected, the first diagnostic test is plain radiography, which may show loss of cortical density, cortical thickening, or frank fracture
54. However, plain radiography may appear normal, and if femoral stress fracture is strongly suspected based on the patient's symptoms and activity history, magnetic resonance imaging of the hip should be performed 16, 54. MANAGEMENT If femoral neck stress fracture is confirmed on imaging, treatment depends on whether the fracture is on the tension side or the compression side. For tension-sided stress fracture, immediate surgical consultation is indicated for consideration of percutaneous screw fixation. 62, 63 Even with a lower-risk, compression-sided fracture, if surgical consultation recommends no surgery, patients must remain non–weight-bearing until pain improves and repeat imaging demonstrates evidence of healing.

Based on expert opinion, gradual progression to weight-bearing activities over the course of four to six weeks can then begin.
61. Atypical Femur Fractures A final consideration is atypical femur fractures, defined as insufficiency fractures that develop because of prolonged use of antiresorptive medications. 64 These medications suppress bone remodeling by inhibiting osteoclasts, leading to accumulation of microdamage, which may progress to complete fracture. 64, 65.

### Checklists in femur fractures: high adherence after implementation of computer-based pediatric femur guidelines [^114rsfxU]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) created an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the care of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures in 2010. Our institution implemented checklists based off these guidelines embedded in a standardized EMR order. The purpose of this study was to describe compliance with checklist completion and to assess safety improvement in a large urban pediatric hospital.

Methods

Retrospective and prospective data were collected from 2 years before and 5 years after checklist implementation. This included the patient safety checklists from August 2011 through August 2016. Patients aged 0 to 18 years with a diaphyseal femur fracture were queried from the EMR and included in this study. Patient charts were reviewed for complications, including nerve injury, pressure sore, leg length discrepancy, loss of reduction, failure of fixation, nonunion, delayed union, and infection. Compliance rates were reported based on the AAOS clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A total of 313 patients for the postchecklist period were reviewed in this study. Of 219 patients eligible for inclusion, 198 had checklists completed (group B). This group was compared with 100 patients with diaphyseal femur fractures from the period before implementation of the checklist (group A). We found no statistical difference in the number of patients with complications between groups (12% in both groups, P = 0.988). Postoperative checklists demonstrated that 89.9% of patients (178/198) received age-appropriate treatment consistent with the AAOS guideline recommendations after implementation of the checklist. Before the checklist implementation (group A), 94% (94/100) adhered to the guidelines.

Conclusion

This study reveals high compliance rates with the AAOS evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric femur fractures. Implementing standardized checklists is possible by embedding them into the EMR. Implementation of checklists did not improve compliance or patient outcomes.

### Exploring the impact of race, language, socioeconomics, and medical management on osteoporosis workup and treatment after proximal femur fractures [^113xJxk8]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the most common metabolic bone disease, osteoporosis poses significant health concerns among elderly patients. - Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mineral density and contributes to proximal femur fractures, leading to severe morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and high mortality rates. - Effective management consists of antiresorptive, anabolic, and bisphosphonate agents in combination with lifestyle modifications. Despite advances in pharmaceutics and diagnostic modalities, a subset of patients remain disproportionately affected by osteoporosis. Differences in screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been reported, particularly among racial, linguistic, and socioeconomic groups, however, explanations for such disparities remain heterogenous. - Understanding factors that influence management and outcomes of osteoporotic proximal femur fractures warrants further investigation.

In orthopedics, there is increasing recognition of how socioeconomic factors — such as race and ethnicity, language, residential area, and education — are linked to higher rates of orthopedic trauma and worse surgical outcomes. - Previous literature has identified socioeconomic factors as a barrier to initiation of osteoporosis treatment and an important contributor to the likelihood of receiving timely and appropriate care for hip fracture patients. Socioeconomic status, often assessed through metrics such as the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), result in worse medical outcomes, longer hospitalization, and higher readmission rates. - Furthermore, race has been shown to influence the care of osteoporotic patients, with Black patients disproportionately affected and less likely to receive necessary diagnosis and treatments. Linguistic barriers have also been shown to impair care delivery to patients with osteoporosis. Given the intersection of these factors, it is imperative to explore how race, language, and socioeconomic status influence vitamin D screening and osteoporosis treatment after hip fractures.

Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on vitamin D screening and osteoporosis treatment in a large cohort of geriatric proximal femur fractures. The secondary objective was to compare the impact of sociodemographic variables on the likelihood of geriatric and endocrine consultation.

### Diagnosis and management of intraoperative fractures in primary total hip arthroplasty [^112bN6Ju]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative periprosthetic fractures are challenging complications that may affect implant stability and survivorship. Periprosthetic acetabular fractures are uncommon and infrequently are the focus of studies. Acetabular fractures are occasionally recognized after patients report unremitting groin pain weeks postoperatively. The widespread use of cementless acetabular cups might lead to higher number of fractures than is clinically detectable. Conversely, the incidence of intraoperative periprosthetic femoral fractures are more common and encompass a broad spectrum, ranging from a small cortical perforation to displaced fractures with an unstable prosthesis. Appropriate recognition, including mindfulness of preoperative patient and surgical risk factors, is critical to the successful management of acetabular and femoral complications. This comprehensive review article focuses on the incidence, patient and surgical risk factors, diagnosis, management, and clinical outcomes associated with intraoperative acetabular and femur fractures in primary total hip arthroplasty.
