## Question

Long acting insulin in dka

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how and when to use long-acting insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis, including when to start it, what dose to use, how to transition off IV insulin, and whether it helps outcomes like time to resolution, length of stay, and rebound hyperglycemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard-of-care framework for DKA and where long-acting insulin fits. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic rationale for early basal insulin. Next, I will review guideline positions and the strength of evidence, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check dosing strategies and transition timing. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the standard framework so I don't jump to conclusions: DKA care hinges on IV fluids, continuous IV insulin, and electrolyte replacement, with identification and treatment of precipitating causes and close monitoring until resolution; long-acting insulin is not a substitute for IV insulin during the acute phase, but it can be layered in strategically to improve transitions and glycemic stability, which is consistent with ADA 2025 and contemporary reviews [^1117ZCKL] [^111itEwi].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiologic rationale for adding basal insulin during IV therapy. DKA reflects absolute or relative insulin deficiency with unrestrained lipolysis and ketogenesis; IV insulin suppresses these processes, but its short half-life means that abrupt cessation risks rebound hyperglycemia and recurrent ketosis unless a basal layer is in place, so giving long-acting insulin early provides a pharmacokinetic bridge and may reduce IV insulin requirements and duration, which aligns with physiologic reasoning and guideline emphasis on a planned transition [^111aJa5y] [^1163TwTf].

> Next, I should review what major guidelines say and how confident I can be. The ADA advises that for critically ill or hemodynamically unstable patients, continuous IV insulin is mandatory, and for transition, administer basal insulin 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent recurrence; for mild or moderate DKA, outcomes with IV regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs are similar when combined with aggressive fluids, supporting flexibility in route but not replacing the need for a basal plan at transition [^1163TwTf]. The Joint British Diabetes Societies explicitly recommend continuing or initiating long-acting basal insulin during DKA management, typically at 0.25 units/kg once daily, which operationalizes early basal use rather than deferring it until after resolution [^116Kickp] [^111nVy84]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance too: UK pediatric guidance similarly supports continuing preexisting basal insulin and considering early initiation in new presentations, reinforcing cross-age applicability in appropriately selected cases [^117V2pjs].

> I will now examine the direct evidence for early basal insulin added to IV infusion. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight RCTs found that early subcutaneous basal insulin reduced time to DKA resolution by about 4 hours and decreased total IV insulin dose by roughly 19 units, without increasing hypoglycemia or hypokalemia, which is clinically meaningful and methodologically reassuring [^111aJa5y]. Wait, let me verify consistency across agents: randomized trials of early glargine and early degludec both suggested faster resolution and improved post-transition glycemic profiles, with degludec specifically showing a 3.25-hour reduction in time to resolution and better 72-hour capillary glucose after bridging, again without excess hypoglycemia, supporting class plausibility and agent-specific feasibility [^111aJa5y] [^111aJa5y]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; a small retrospective comparison suggested no difference in time to resolution with early versus late basal insulin, though it did find shorter IV insulin duration and less fluid use with early basal, highlighting that heterogeneity exists and that outcomes may vary by protocol and population [^114FKByc].

> Let me think about dosing and timing, because getting this wrong undermines benefits. For adults, a single subcutaneous dose of a long-acting analog such as glargine or degludec at 0.2–0.3 units/kg given within the first few hours of IV insulin initiation is reasonable and supported by trials and protocols, with JBDS suggesting 0.25 units/kg once daily as a default in insulin-naïve patients; in pediatrics, a pragmatic dose of 0.3 units/kg has RCT support showing reduced rebound and treatment failure without accelerating resolution, which still aligns with safety goals even if the primary endpoint was neutral [^116Kickp] [^116yT14n] [^1121Gf6J]. I should double-check the transition timing: stopping the IV infusion 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose of basal insulin is a consistent theme across guidelines and quality-improvement protocols, and implementing a standardized "power plan" that mandates SC basal ≥ 1 hour before IV stop reduces inappropriate early discontinuation and rebound DKA, which is a key systems-level safeguard [^1164uV6V] [^113YCWWn].

> Next, I should review outcomes beyond time to resolution to ensure we are not missing unintended effects. Early basal insulin appears to shorten IV insulin duration and reduce total insulin dose, and in some studies is associated with less rebound hyperglycemia and fewer treatment failures, while length of stay and mortality have not consistently changed; importantly, safety signals for hypoglycemia and hypokalemia have not increased in pooled analyses, which reassures me about routine use when protocols are followed [^111aJa5y] [^1121Gf6J]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought early basal might reliably shorten hospital stay, but I should correct that: meta-analytic data did not show a consistent LOS reduction, so I should avoid overpromising on length of stay even if operational benefits like earlier IV cessation are real [^111aJa5y].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and edge cases. In children and adolescents, continuing preexisting basal insulin is endorsed, and early initiation of basal insulin during DKA is reasonable in new presentations; the pediatric RCT of early glargine did not accelerate resolution but reduced rebound and failure, supporting safety and post-resolution stability goals in pediatrics [^117V2pjs] [^1121Gf6J]. For patients already on long-acting analogs, I should confirm we continue their home basal dose unless there is a compelling reason to adjust, to avoid withdrawal of background insulin during the acute phase [^111nVy84]. In pregnancy, DKA remains high risk; while data are limited, the same principles of continuous IV insulin with planned transition apply, and individualized basal planning is prudent in coordination with maternal-fetal care teams [^1158A3Hw]. For euglycemic DKA, especially with SGLT2 inhibitors, insulin must continue with dextrose support until ketonemia clears; early basal insulin can still smooth the transition once oral intake is feasible, but the core management remains IV insulin with aggressive fluids and electrolytes [^113LT6Ht] [^113aX4rv].

> I should confirm safety guardrails and monitoring so we do not create new problems. Hypoglycemia risk is not increased with early basal when protocols are followed, but close glucose and electrolyte monitoring every 2–4 hours until stable is essential, with particular vigilance for hypokalemia as insulin and fluids shift potassium intracellularly; potassium checks every 2–4 hours early in therapy are prudent, and insulin infusion should not be stopped prematurely before anion gap closure to avoid rebound ketosis [^1164uV6V] [^112qkDfR] [^113aX4rv]. Hold on, I should verify the dextrose pivot: when glucose falls below about 250 mg/dL, adding 5–10% dextrose and reducing the IV insulin rate maintains insulin delivery for ketone clearance while preventing hypoglycemia, a maneuver that pairs well with an active basal layer during transition planning [^113aX4rv].

> Let me synthesize a practical, clinically grounded approach and sanity-check each step. At presentation, start standard IV fluids, electrolytes, and a fixed-rate IV insulin infusion; within the first 1–3 hours, administer long-acting basal insulin at 0.2–0.3 units/kg subcutaneously if the patient is insulin-naïve or continue the usual basal dose if already prescribed, documenting the time to guide transition; maintain IV insulin until DKA resolves by anion gap closure, pH normalization, and bicarbonate recovery, typically 12–24 hours but variable; 1–2 hours after the basal dose, begin a scheduled subcutaneous regimen and then stop the IV infusion; monitor glucose and electrolytes closely and adjust prandial insulin as intake allows, with diabetes team input for discharge planning and follow-up [^116Kickp] [^1164uV6V] [^113YCWWn]. I should confirm that this plan aligns with both ADA transition principles and UK guidance favoring early basal, which it does, while still honoring severity-based IV-first care in unstable patients [^1163TwTf] [^116Kickp].

> Bottom line, after reviewing guidelines and the best available trials and meta-analyses, I conclude that adding long-acting basal insulin early during DKA — typically 0.2–0.3 units/kg SC within a few hours of starting IV insulin — can safely shorten time to resolution, reduce total IV insulin requirements, and improve post-transition glycemic stability without increasing hypoglycemia, provided that standard IV therapy and monitoring continue until DKA resolves and that the IV infusion is discontinued 1–2 hours after the basal dose to prevent rebound; this strategy is reasonable across adults and children and is explicitly endorsed in UK guidance and increasingly reflected in US practice recommendations for transition planning [^111aJa5y] [^116Kickp] [^1163TwTf].

Long-acting insulin is **not used alone** in DKA; it is given with IV insulin to provide basal coverage and prevent rebound hyperglycemia after stopping the infusion [^1163TwTf]. Early basal insulin (glargine or degludec) at 0.2–0.3 units/kg within 1–3 hours of IV insulin start **shortens DKA resolution** [^111aJa5y] and reduces IV insulin duration and total dose, without increasing hypoglycemia or hypokalemia [^116yT14n]. It should be continued if already prescribed, and started early in new cases; **stop IV insulin 1–2 hours after the first SC dose** to avoid rebound [^1164uV6V]. Long-acting insulin is not a substitute for IV insulin in DKA but is essential for transition and relapse prevention [^1117ZCKL].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for long-acting insulin in DKA

Long-acting insulins (e.g. glargine, detemir, degludec) provide a **stable basal insulin level**, suppressing hepatic glucose production and ketogenesis [^114c7CQw]. In DKA, IV insulin is stopped once ketoacidosis resolves, and without basal insulin, rebound hyperglycemia and recurrent ketosis can occur [^1163TwTf]. Basal insulin maintains metabolic stability during and after the transition from IV therapy [^113YCWWn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting long-acting insulin use in DKA

Recent studies and guidelines support **early basal insulin** with IV insulin to improve outcomes:

- **Early basal insulin**: Reduces time to DKA resolution, IV insulin duration, and total insulin dose, without increasing hypoglycemia or hypokalemia [^111aJa5y] [^116yT14n].
- **Randomized trials**: Early glargine or degludec with IV insulin shortened DKA resolution and reduced IV insulin requirements [^111aJa5y] [^116yT14n].
- **Meta-analysis**: Early basal insulin reduced time to resolution by ~4 hours and IV insulin dose by ~19 units [^111aJa5y].

---

## Recommended timing and dosing of long-acting insulin in DKA

Guidelines recommend **early basal insulin** alongside IV therapy:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Patients already on long-acting insulin | Continue existing regimen | Continue existing dose |
| Newly diagnosed patients or those not on basal insulin | Within 1–3 hours of starting IV insulin | 0.2–0.3 units/kg SC once daily |
| Transition from IV to SC insulin | Administer SC basal insulin 1–2 hours before stopping IV insulin | 0.2–0.3 units/kg SC once daily |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with long-acting insulin use in DKA

Long-acting insulin during DKA is associated with:

- **Faster resolution**: Shorter time to DKA resolution [^111aJa5y] [^116yT14n].
- **Reduced IV insulin**: Less total IV insulin and shorter infusion duration [^111aJa5y] [^114FKByc].
- **Lower rebound**: Less rebound hyperglycemia and relapse [^1163TwTf] [^1121Gf6J].
- **No safety signal**: No increase in hypoglycemia or hypokalemia [^111aJa5y] [^116yT14n].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

While generally safe, long-acting insulin in DKA has **limitations**:

- **Not monotherapy**: Must be used with IV insulin; not a substitute [^1163TwTf].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Monitor closely, especially with renal impairment or altered absorption [^112T3Cze].
- **Dosing uncertainty**: Optimal timing and dose vary; protocols should be standardized [^113YCWWn].

---

## Comparison with other insulin regimens

Long-acting insulin is **superior to NPH** for basal coverage owing to its peakless profile and lower hypoglycemia risk, and is preferred over NPH for transition and maintenance [^111wL2rY]. Compared with rapid-acting analogs, long-acting insulin provides basal coverage only and must be paired with IV or rapid-acting insulin during DKA [^1163TwTf].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **early basal insulin** with IV therapy:

- **ADA 2025**: Use basal insulin 2–4 hours before stopping IV insulin to prevent rebound [^1163TwTf].
- **JBDS 2022**: Continue or start basal insulin during DKA management [^116Kickp].
- **ISPAD 2020**: Continue basal insulin in children already on it; consider early initiation in new cases [^notfound].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Clinicians should:

- **Start early**: Give basal insulin within 1–3 hours of IV insulin [^116yT14n].
- **Dose rationally**: Use 0.2–0.3 units/kg SC once daily.
- **Time the transition**: Stop IV insulin 1–2 hours after the first SC dose [^1164uV6V].
- **Monitor closely**: Track glucose, ketones, electrolytes, and acid-base status [^111nVy84].
- **Standardize care**: Use protocols to reduce variability and improve outcomes [^113YCWWn].

---

Long-acting insulin is a **key adjunct** in DKA: it provides basal coverage, accelerates resolution, reduces IV insulin needs, and prevents rebound when started early and used correctly with IV insulin and standardized transition protocols [^1163TwTf].

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113VRPBo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the progress made in the in-hospital management of diabetes over the past decades, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a serious hyperglycemic emergency accompanied by significant rates of mortality and morbidity and high financial burden for health care systems and societies. Most national and international guidelines advocate continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of regular human insulin as the standard of care for the treatment of DKA. However, subcutaneous (sc) administration of rapid-acting insulin analogues has recently emerged as an alternative for patients with DKA of mild or moderate severity.

An IV insulin infusion is traditionally preferred over other routes of administration because of the rapid onset of insulin action that is necessary for the effective resolution of the hyperglycemic crisis and the suppression of ketogenesis. In addition, the short half-life of IV regimens enables an easy titration to achieve glycemic targets. However, IV administration of insulin usually requires patients to receive treatment in the emergency room or to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) to be closely monitored. Despite the fact that IV insulin infusion is acceptable for many countries to administer in general wards, the safety of such an approach has not been adequately studied. On the other hand, data from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group show that ICU admission in patients with DKA is related to a high-risk of long-term mortality and also substantial economic costs.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111QEBUp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most serious hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DKA is the most common cause of death in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and accounts for half of all deaths in diabetic patients aged < 24 years. Recent series in adult patients with DKA have reported a mortality rate of < 5%. DKA is responsible for > 100,000 hospital admissions in the U.S. and substantial spending related to direct and indirect costs. It has been estimated that treatment of DKA episodes represent more than one of every four health care dollars spent on direct medical care for adult patients with type 1 diabetes.

The mainstay in the treatment of DKA involves the administration of regular insulin via continuous intravenous infusion or by frequent subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of regular insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogs. Although several controlled studies have shown that low-dose insulin therapy is effective regardless of the route of administration, most patients are treated with intravenous regular insulin until resolution of DKA. When this occurs, subcutaneous insulin therapy can be started. The American Diabetes Association recommends the transition to NPH and regular insulin twice daily or to a multidose regimen of short- or rapid-acting and intermediate- or long-acting insulins. Several studies have reported hospital rates of hypoglycemic events up to 37% with the use of NPH and regular insulin after discontinuation of intravenous insulin. The inadequate duration of action of NPH insulin and an undesirable peak activity at 4–6 h after injection as well as the high day-to-day variability in absorption partially explains the high rate of hypoglycemic events. In recent years, the use of long-acting basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs has been recommended as a more physiological approach than NPH and regular insulin for glucose control in the hospital; however, no previous studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs in the management of patients with hyperglycemic crises. Accordingly, the aim of this multicenter, randomized, open-label study was 1) to determine differences in treatment response between regular insulin and rapid-acting insulin analogs during the acute intravenous treatment of DKA and 2) to determine differences between treatment with glargine plus glulisine and a split-mixed regimen of NPH plus regular insulin after the transition to subcutaneous insulin following resolution of DKA.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^113mVCnH]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Early versus late administration of long-acting insulin in adult diabetic ketoacidosis [^114FKByc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence is inconclusive if early administration of subcutaneous (SQ) long-acting insulin (LAI) in management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) improves outcomes.

Objective

This study compares early versus late administration of SQ LAI in time to DKA resolution.

Methods

This single-center, retrospective study included patients with DKA who received ≥ 12 hours of continuous intravenous insulin (CIVI) with LAI overlap. Patients were compared based on LAI administration time to CIVI initiation: Early (< 12 hours) versus Late (≥ 12 hours). The DKA resolution is defined as blood glucose < 200 mg/dL and 2 of the following: anion gap < 12 mEq/L, pH > 7.35, or serum carbon dioxide > 15 mEq/L. Outcomes included time to DKA resolution, length of stay (LOS), CIVI duration, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 27 patients were included in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. There was no difference in time to DKA resolution, Early = 17.6 (13.9–26.8) hours versus Late = 19.2 (17.1–32.1) hours, P = 0.16. The Early group had shorter CIVI duration (Early = 19.5 ± 10.3 hours vs Late = 25.6 ± 8.4 hours, P = 0.02) and received less intravenous (IV) fluids in the first 36 hours (Early = 4.04 ± 2.12 L vs Late = 5.85 ± 2.24 L, P = 0.004). No differences were identified with adverse events, including hypoglycemia, or LOS.

Conclusion and Relevance

Administration of SQ LAI < 12 hours did not decrease time to DKA resolution or LOS. Patients in the Early group had received a lower dose of LAI, shorter duration of CIVI infusion, and required less IV fluids within 36 hours of admission. This study supports the need for further research to determine the potential benefits of administering SQ insulin early in managing DKA.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis and acidosis. The pathophysiology of DKA is reviewed and diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed in the context of the currently available evidence. Complications associated with DKA are often a result of the treatment itself, and these issues are also discussed.

### International consensus on risk management of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors [^116NrJ3V]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Does management of diabetic ketoacidosis with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin reduce the need for intensive care unit admission? [^114X6xHz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the last 20 years, rapid-acting insulin analogs have emerged on the market, including aspart and lispro, which may be efficacious in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when administered by non-intravenous (i.v.) routes.

Clinical Question

In patients with mild-to-moderate DKA without another reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, is the administration of a subcutaneous (s.c.) rapid-acting insulin analog a safe and effective alternative to a continuous infusion of i.v. regular insulin, and would such a strategy eliminate the need for ICU admission?

Evidence Review

Five randomized controlled trials were identified and critically appraised.

Results

The outcomes suggest that there is no difference in the duration of therapy required to resolve DKA with either strategy.

Conclusion

Current evidence supports DKA management with s.c. rapid-acting insulin analogs in a non-ICU setting in carefully selected patients.

### Early subcutaneous basal insulin with intravenous insulin infusion for diabetic ketoacidosis management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111aJa5y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early initiation of subcutaneous (SC) basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII), compared with IVII alone, for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early initiation of long- or ultra-long-acting basal insulin plus IVII versus IVII alone in DKA management. Studies published up to 6 September 2025, were included. Meta-analysis was performed using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, both with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included total intravenous insulin use, rebound hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. A one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was also conducted when individual-level data were available.

Results

Eight RCTs including 468 participants (256 receiving early SC basal insulin plus IVII; 212 receiving IVII alone) were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable across studies. Early SC basal insulin significantly reduced time to DKA resolution (MD -4.02h, 95%CI -5.52 to -2.52, p < 0.001) and total intravenous insulin dose until DKA resolution (MD -19.2units, 95%CI -28.99 to -9.26, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups for rebound hyperglycemia, safety outcomes, LOS, or in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Early SC basal insulin in combination with IVII significantly accelerates DKA resolution and reduces total IVII requirements, without increasing the risk of adverse events, including hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in COVID-19: unique concerns and considerations [^112ATS29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

While individuals with diabetes appear to be at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without diabetes, they are more likely to suffer severe consequences, including death. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and potentially lethal acute complication of diabetes arising from a relative insulin deficiency, which occurs more often in those with type 1 diabetes and in the setting of moderate to severe illness. Early reports indicate that among patients with pre-existing diabetes, DKA may be a common complication of severe COVID-19 and a poor prognostic sign.

Case Description

This clinical perspective explores the key elements of caring for individuals with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic through 2 cases. Topics addressed include diagnosis, triage, and the fundamental principles of treatment with a focus on the importance of characterizing DKA severity and medical complexity to determine the best approach.

Conclusions

As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy. Finally, DKA is often a preventable condition. We include evidence-based strategies and guidance designed to empower clinicians and patients to avoid this serious complication when possible.

### Efficacy and safety of commonly used insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis: a Bayesian indirect treatment comparison [^111D8xun]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Insulin analogues (IAs) are the mainstay for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, the relative efficacy of newer IAs is uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IAs for the management of DKA using an indirect treatment comparison (ITC).

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-, rapid-, and long-acting IAs in patients with DKA. The primary outcomes of interest were time taken to normalize DKA and time taken to normalize blood glucose levels. The secondary outcomes of interest were the amount of insulin needed to normalize DKA, the length of hospital stay, and the number of hypoglycemic events in the intervention and comparator groups. Bayesian ITC was performed by using the gemtc package in the R program. Continuous outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD), and binary outcomes are reported as odds ratios (ORs), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Findings

Ten RCTs randomizing 435 participants to treatment were included in this ITC. A total of 5 interventions (lispro, glargine with regular insulin [RI], glulisine, aspart, and regular insulin) were compared for both safety and efficacy outcomes in DKA. Glargine co-administered with regular insulin showed superiority for clinical outcomes compared with regular insulin: consuming less time (MD, -3.1 h; 95% CrI, -7.9 to 1.8), amount of insulin required (MD, -32 U; 95% CrI, 83.0 to 18.0), and the length of hospitalization (MD, -0.82 day; 95% CrI, -2.7 to 1.0) to normalize DKA. However, these results were not statistically significant. Insulin aspart had fewer reports of hypoglycemic events (OR, 1.7; 95% CrI, 0.34 to 9.3) than regular insulin.

Implications

Newer IAs were found to be equally effective and safe as regular insulin in the treatment of DKA. Thus, administering these IAs can be considered a safe and cost-effective alternative for DKA management in non-ICU settings. Cost-effective analysis of the newer IAs is needed because these agents are expensive compared with regular insulin.

### How can cerebral edema during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis be avoided? [^117Q57Pn]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare complication but it can be devastating, with significant mortality and long-term morbidity. Certain risk factors have been teased out with some large case-control studies, but more research needs to be done to make management guidelines safer. This article will discuss how DKA might be prevented from occurring in the first instance, known risk factors for cerebral edema, fluid and insulin management, the importance of careful monitoring during DKA treatment, and the importance of recognizing and acting on the earliest symptoms to prevent long-term harm.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

The current version of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is largely based on the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society/European Society of Pediatric Endocrinology (LWPES/ESPE) consensus statement on DKA in children and adolescents published in 2004. This article critically reviews and presents the most pertinent new data published in the past decade, which have implications for diagnosis and management. Four elements of the guidelines warrant modification: (i) The definition of DKA; (ii) insulin therapy; (iii) water and salt replacement; and (iv) blood ß-hydroxybutyrate measurements for the management of DKA.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^1153MQAr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In treatment of SGLT2i DKA, a tendency toward euglycemia results in clinically relevant reduction in the amount of insulin administered over the first 24 hours of treatment. It remains unclear whether the protracted duration of SGLT2i DKA is a result of inadequate insulin dosing or the ongoing effect of SGLT2i. It would be reasonable, based on the evidence presented and the safety profile of intravenous dextrose, to increase dextrose infusion rates and concentration to allow increased insulin administration and suppression of ketosis. The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and size. Prospective randomized clinical trial evidence is lacking.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^112T3Cze]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Kickp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a critical and life‐threatening complication that occurs in people with diabetes, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with an increasing proportion of cases in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The incidence of diabetes is rising globally, contributing to a reported 55% increase in DKA admissions over the past decade. The key to effective management of this condition is prompt diagnosis and the timely administration of appropriate treatment to correct the metabolic derangements in DKA (hyperglycaemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis), which result from a combination of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone).

Insulin therapy is one of the cornerstones of DKA management. Most patients are treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin until DKA resolves, at which point they are transitioned to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. Early use of basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) is increasingly common in clinical practice, as evidenced by several prospective studies. These studies have reported that coadministration of a low dose (0.15–0.3 units/kg) of glargine U‐100 during IVII reduces the time to DKA resolution, the duration of IVII, and the length of hospital stay (LOS), while also preventing rebound hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In accordance with the UK guideline, long‐acting basal insulin should be continued in patients already receiving it, or initiated at a dose of 0.25 units/kg once daily in newly diagnosed patients. Although insulin degludec has become increasingly utilised as a basal insulin in diabetes management, evidence supporting its effectiveness in the management of DKA remains lacking.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a comprehensive review [^1168HEhM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM, or it can occur with established type 1 DM, during the increased demands of an acute illness or with decreased insulin delivery due to omitted doses or insulin pump failure. In addition, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in a known diabetes patient with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours <br/> - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe DKA <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe DKA|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values <br/> - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

Monitoring

Successful management and early intervention for complications requires close monitoring. A flow chart should be maintained to document all relevant incidents regarding the patient's condition. Minimal monitoring frequency recommendations include vital signs and neurologic checks hourly; blood glucose hourly; venous blood gases every 2 hours for 6 hours, then every 4 hours; Na, K, and ionized calcium every 2 hours for 6 hours, then every 4 hours; magnesium and phosphorus every 4 hours; basic metabolic profile at admission and then every morning. These minimum requirements should be adapted to the situation; for example, more frequent (hourly) K measurements may be indicated, along with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring depending on the initial K value, or more frequent neurologic and vital sign checks (20–30 minutes) if there is a concern about the patient's mental status.

Ketonuria should not be used as a measure of improvement. The dip sticks used to measure ketones react with acetoacetate. Concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate are much higher than those of acetoacetate and will be converted to acetoacetate during successful treatment of the DKA, resulting in sustenance or increase of urinary ketone concentration. Laboratory measurement or the use of a bedside fingerstick sample monitor for beta-hydroxybutyrate will avoid this problem.

Transition

IV fluids can be stopped 1–2 hours after substantial consumption of oral fluids without vomiting.
Subcutaneous insulin injection can be started when IV fluids are no longer needed. Presupper or prebreakfast time is most convenient for starting or restarting intermediate- or long-acting insulin. Before then, rapid-acting or regular insulin 0.25 U/kg subcutaneously can be given every ∼6 hours, and the insulin infusion stopped 60–120 minutes after the first subcutaneous dose of regular insulin or 60 minutes after a rapid-acting insulin analog.
Patients should not be kept in the hospital simply to adjust insulin dosage because food, activity, and psychosocial environment are not normal in the hospital setting. Therefore, insulin requirements will not be particularly informative for home management.
Established patients with DKA can resume their usual home dose of insulin.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^115uarmp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

A recently published trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of implementing an sc insulin protocol for the treatment of DKA. In a cohort-study design involving 7989 hospitalizations over a 9-year period, Rao et al showed that the sc administration of weight-based lispro every 4 hours led to a reduction by 57% in ICU admission and by 50% in 30-day hospital readmission compared to standard treatment. Moreover, the safety profile of the sc regimen proved to be similar to the standard of care, with no differences in adverse event rates between the intervention and control sites.

The findings of this large trial replicate the results of smaller studies conducted previously. Umpierrez et al have shown that the use of sc lispro in adult patients with uncomplicated DKA was associated with a similar duration of treatment until correction of hyperglycemia and resolution of ketoacidosis, still with 39% lower hospitalization charges compared to patients in the ICU who received an IV regimen. Another study by the same group did not show differences in mortality rates, incidence of hypoglycemia, length of hospital stay, and total insulin dose until resolution of hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis between patients who received sc aspart every hour or every 2 hours compared to those who were treated with IV infusion of regular insulin (n = 15 in each group). Collectively, these data suggest that the implementation of an sc insulin protocol in individuals with mild to moderate DKA could result in the use of fewer resources including ICU beds, lower rates of complications related to IV lines (eg, thrombophlebitis), and less financial burden on health care systems compared to the traditional approach. The findings of a meta-analysis suggested there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the use of sc rapid-acting insulin vs IV regular insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate severe DKA. It should be noted that the quality of the synthesized evidence was low to very low and that the number of included trials and patients was small (5 and 201, respectively).

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^112jcM2e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute hyperglycemic emergency with the potential for serious morbidity and mortality if not treated promptly. It is a serious complication of diabetes caused by a decreasein effective circulating insulin and elevations in counter-regulatory hormones, often leading to hyperglycemia, ketone body formation, osmotic diuresis, acid-base and electrolyte derangements, and hypovolemia. The tenets of management of DKA are the administration of insulin and the correction of the fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Standard therapy in the US has included continuous intravenous (IV) regular insulin until the resolution of ketoacidosis, with patients typically managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. As a result, DKA treatment can be costly in the US, resulting in an estimated annual cost of more than $5 billion.

There is growing interest in DKA treatment that can be achieved safely outside the ICU with non-IV insulin administration. In the United Kingdom, for example, national guidelines recommend the early initiation of fixed rate intravenous insulin infusionalongside the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. A recent review, suggested that there were no substantial advantages or disadvantages of using SQ rapid-acting insulin analogs over IV insulin on the basis of the low quality of the evidence. Some studies, have suggested that SQ short-acting insulin analogs may be as effective as IV insulin. Long-acting insulin glargine was also found to be effective and safe compared with IV regular insulin infusion in a small prospective study. Despite guideline recommendations for treatment in general medical-surgical wards, ICU treatment of DKA remains common in US health system and hospital settings.

In this study, we examined the outcomes of patients with DKA treated with an SQ insulin protocol including the early use of both rapid-acting and long-acting insulin, in place of IV insulin infusion, followed by rapid-acting insulin injections given over longer periods than previously studied. This SQ DKA protocol was implemented at a single intervention hospital as a quality improvement effort, and we compared outcomes against those from 20 other standard care hospitals in an integrated health care delivery system.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to decrease insulin infusion rate to 0.05 unit/kg/hr when blood glucose values reach 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to inpatient monitoring, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable. Initiate subcutaneous multi-dose insulin plan after resolution of DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and when patient is able to eat and drink. Continue intravenous insulin infusion for 1–2 hours after subcutaneous insulin when transferring from intravenous to maintenance subcutaneous insulin.

Lipolysis and ketogenesis leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be suppressed by the continuous provision of small doses of insulin. DKA is frequently caused by omission of insulin injections, observed in 28–65% of young patients with type 1 diabetes. In young children, the use of insulin glargine and detemir was associated with a trend to less DKA episodes compared with NPH/zinc insulin, potentially related to the prolonged action of these insulin analogs. We hypothesized that long-acting insulin analogs may confer greater protection from DKA in young patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^117V2pjs]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Both BSPED and NICE recommend the following fluid maintenance requirements, using 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose, and the Holliday-Segar formula:

100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg (0–10 kg body weight).
50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg (10–20 kg body weight).
20 mL/kg for each subsequent kilogramme (> 20 kg body weight).
When calculating the total fluid replacement, subtract any initial bolus volumes from the total fluid deficit (unless the child or young person is in shock).

For insulin and electrolyte replacement requirements, both recommend:

The addition of 40 mmol/L potassium chloride to all fluids (apart from the initial intravenous bolus) unless the patient is anuric or hyperkalaemic. Include this before starting the insulin infusion if hypokalaemia is observed at presentation.
0.9% sodium chloride should be used without added glucose unless the plasma glucose is < 14 mmol/L.
Initially assess for the presence of hyponatraemia, continue to monitor throughout treatment and treat as soon as blood glucose falls. Monitor sodium levels throughout treatment and calculate sodium initially to identify if hyponatraemia is present. This should be treated as soon as blood glucose falls. It is important to monitor as hyponatraemia and rapidly increasing sodium levels can both be signs of CO.
Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to CYP with DKA unless they have compromised cardiac contractility caused by life-threatening hyperkalaemia or severe acidosis, and you have discussed with paediatric intensivist.
A soluble insulin infusion of between 0.05 units/kg/hour and 0.1 units/kg/hour, 1–2 hours after intravenous fluids have been commenced. BSPED stated that the 0.05 units/kg/hour should be sufficient unless the patient is suffering from severe DKA or is an adolescent. If they are attached to a 'continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion', disconnect when starting intravenous insulin therapy. For patients already on long-acting insulin, it may be continued, and in new patients consider commencing long-acting subcutaneous insulin alongside intravenous. Similarly, the NICE guidelines state that continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before DKA may be continued in discussion with a diabetes specialist.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115GLxpD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114c7CQw]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Previous randomized studies in patients with DKA have focused on the amount and route of insulin administration during the acute resolution phase of ketoacidosis. Few studies, however, have focused on the transition period to subcutaneous insulin after the resolution of DKA. Accordingly, in this study we aimed to compare differences between treatment with basal bolus insulin analogs and NPH and regular insulin after resolution of DKA. We found no differences in the daily glucose concentration between treatment groups; however, patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had higher rates of hypoglycemia (41%) than subjects treated with basal bolus (15%) insulin (P < 0.03). The rate of hypoglycemic events in this study is similar to the rate reported previously with the use of NPH and regular insulin after discontinuation of intravenous therapy.

The higher rate of hypoglycemia with human insulins is explained by the pharmacological features and peak duration of action of NPH and regular insulin as well as the high day-to-day variability in absorption. NPH has an onset of action ranging between 2 and 4 h, a peak concentration of ∼6–8 h, and a duration of action up to 20 h. Regular human insulin has an onset of action in 30 min, peaks at 2–3 h when given subcutaneously, and has a duration of action of 6–8 h. The combination of basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs represents a more physiological approach to glucose control in the hospital. Glargine is a peakless, long-acting basal insulin with an onset of action of ∼2 h, a plateau of biological action at 4–6 h, and duration of action up to 24 h. Glulisine has a faster onset of action and a shorter duration of action after subcutaneous injection compared with regular insulin. In agreement with these results, we recently reported that a basal bolus algorithm with glargine and glulisine is an effective intervention for glucose control with a low rate of hypoglycemic events (3%) in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. More recently, we reported that 38% of hospitalized patients treated with a combination of NPH and regular insulin experienced one or more episodes of blood glucose < 70 mg/dl during the hospital stay. Minimizing the rate of hypoglycemia events is of major importance in hospitalized patients because it may represent an independent risk factor of poor clinical outcome.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^113RToUA]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with poor metabolic control (A1C ≥ 9.0%, n = 2,652), DKA incidence was 13.7 ± 0.72/100 patient-years. In these patients, 63% used basal insulin analogs. Treatment with long-acting insulin analogs was associated with higher DKA risk compared with NPH insulin (P = 0.003, OR 1.639 [95% CI 1.180–2.277]) in this subgroup of patients.

When DKA risk was separately analyzed for insulin glargine or detemir versus NPH, the association with higher DKA risk was confirmed for both long-acting insulin analogs (P = 0.035, OR 1.268 [95% CI 0.978–1.643] and 1.526 [1.092–2.133]). In patients with poor metabolic control, even higher DKA incidences associated with insulin glargine or detemir compared with NPH were found (P = 0.011, OR 1.470 [1.046–2.065] and 1.906 [1.226–2.963]).

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^112zFcBc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To investigate if long-acting insulin analogs decrease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in young individuals with type 1 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Of 48,110 type 1 diabetic patients prospectively studied between 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DKA requiring hospitalization was analyzed in 10,682 individuals aged ≤ 20 years with a diabetes duration of ≥ 2 years.

RESULTS

The overall rate of DKA was 5.1 (SE ± 0.2)/100 patient-years. Patients using insulin glargine or detemir (n = 5,317) had a higher DKA incidence than individuals using NPH insulin (n = 5,365, 6.6 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). The risk for DKA remained significantly different after adjustment for age at diabetes onset, diabetes duration, A1C, insulin dose, sex, and migration background (P = 0.015, odds ratio 1.357 [1.062–1.734]).

CONCLUSIONS

Despite their long-acting pharmacokinetics, the use of insulin glargine or detemir is not associated with a lower incidence of DKA compared with NPH insulin.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^117RkY5f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Ultrarapid-acting insulin analogues are recent additions to the pharmaceutical arsenal against hyperglycemia. Ultrarapid lispro and fast-acting insulin aspart have been shown to provide earlier onset, greater initial exposure, increased initial glucose-lowering effect, as well as earlier offset of exposure and hypoglycemic effect compared to parental molecules. Thus, they match the physiological post meal secretion of human insulin more closely than rapid-acting insulin analogues and their use has been related to improved postprandial glucose control. In people with type 1 diabetes on both multiple daily injections and continuous sc insulin infusion, ultrarapid lispro decreased the time spent in hypoglycemia compared to classic lispro. Based on the aforementioned pharmacokinetic and glucodynamic characteristics, which in theory allow flexible dose adjustment with a lower risk of hypoglycemia between different doses because of shorter time of action, ultrafast-acting insulin analogues deserve a place in future trials evaluating sc regimens in patients with DKA. Whether the benefits of the new analogues related to fewer ICU admissions and relevant complications for patients with mild DKA who are eligible to receive sc insulin can outweigh their increased cost remains an area for future research.

More than a century has passed since the discovery of insulin in 1921. According to the title of Ian Fleming's famous novel, "You Only Live Twice". Taking into account recent advances in insulinotherapy, it appears that insulin is not just living a second life, it is probably in its second youth. And this can only give the promise of a better future for people with diabetes and their health care providers.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116mHPx6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was conducted by following a prespecified protocol and is reported based on the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Our protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42022339577). Material deviations to the prespecified protocol are described below.

We systematically searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception until April 26th, 2024 to identify studies that compared the use of subcutaneous insulin to continuous IV insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA. Keywords and search strategies used are available in Appendix 1.

We included RCTs and observational studies that compared subcutaneous insulin and a continuous IV insulin infusion in managing adult patients with mild-to-moderate DKA. Subcutaneous insulin included either short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. Inclusion was restricted to studies that included adults age ≥ 18 years old, who were identified as having diabetes with DKA, defined as having arterial pH ≤ 7.3, serum bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and anion gap is > 12 mmol/L with positive serum and/or urine ketones. Our definition of DKA was based on the criteria outlined in the ADA guidelines. Mild DKA is defined as pH 7.25 to 7.30 and serum bicarbonate 15 to 18 mmol/L, whereas moderate was defined as pH 7.00 to < 7.24 and serum bicarbonate 10 to < 15 mmol/L Studies were required to report at least one of the following outcomes: length of stay, time to resolution of DKA, mortality, need for intensive care stay, hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Studies that compared subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin in severe DKA, or in patients with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, comatose state, and other medical conditions that warranted ICU admission were excluded.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114E498g]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study, including a relatively small number of patients and the fact that the large majority of patients were African Americans with poor adherence to therapy as the primary precipitating cause of DKA. We also excluded patients with hypovolemic shock, patients in a comatose state, and patients who had acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, or pregnancy. A large prospective, randomized clinical trial of strict glycemic control is certainly needed to address these important issues.

In summary, our study indicates that intravenous treatments with regular insulin and glulisine insulin are equally effective with no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, transition to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemic events than treatment with NPH and regular insulin twice daily. These findings indicate that a basal bolus insulin regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State Management and Treatment Protocols in the Emergency Department/Floor/Intensive Care Unit

Nadine E. Palermo, DO

Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA

Key ideas

Several studies have demonstrated that the use of subcutaneous rapid acting insulin given every one to two hours can be effective in the treatment of mild/moderate uncomplicated DKA.
Classification of DKA severity can be useful in triage as patients presenting with mild uncomplicated DKA may be treated in an intermediate unit as an alternative to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Special considerations for alternative strategies in the management of hyperglycemic crises may be especially useful during a pandemic, including subcutaneous dosing and extended intervals for glucose monitoring and insulin administration.

Summary

The classification of patients by type of hyperglycemic crisis (mild-severe DKA, HHS, or both) determines appropriate therapy with intravenous or subcutaneous insulin and triage location (such as the ICU). Patients in the emergency department (ED) with hyperglycemia but without hyperglycemic crisis should be considered for rapid follow-up programs if available to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. Fluids, insulin, and electrolyte repletion remain the mainstays of therapy. Patients may benefit from early administration of basal insulin to decrease rebound hyperglycemia after insulin infusions are discontinued. Studies have shown protocols utilizing subcutaneous insulin every one or two hours are as effective as infusions in patients with mild-moderate DKA. For safe discharge, patients must have had adequate education, prescriptions and needed supplies, and follow-up scheduled. For patients with COVID-19, in order to conserve personal protective equipment, it is possible to effectively treat mild-moderate DKA with subcutaneous insulin every four hours.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^1112PZxh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

New Insights

We conducted an updated systematic review based on the initial systematic review done by Andrade-Castellanos et al. in 2016, which has allowed us to gain further insight into the use of subcutaneous insulin in the management of DKA. There are also a few differences in terms of the study population, specifically the exclusion of the pediatric population. Our systematic review included four additional observational studies and two RCTs, which were published after the systematic review conducted by Andrade-Castellanos et al. By gathering data from observational studies as well, we were able to conclude that all included studies support the use of subcutaneous insulin as an effective alternative to IV insulin in the management of mild to moderate DKA. Based on the updated data, we were able to conduct a meta-analysis for certain outcomes.

Episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can represent a life-threatening emergency for mother and fetus. The cornerstones of treatment of DKA are aggressive fluid replacement and insulin administration while ascertaining which precipitating factors brought about the current episode of DKA, and then treating accordingly to mitigate those factors. The incidence of DKA and factors unique to pregnancy are discussed in this article, along with the effects of the disease process on pregnancy. Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment modalities are covered in detail to offer ideas to improve maternal and fetal outcome.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^117UAQGT]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

After resolution of DKA, insulin infusion was discontinued 2 h after the administration of subcutaneous insulin. Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes received an initial total daily dose (TDD) of insulin of 0.6 unit · kg −1 · day −1. Subjects receiving insulin therapy before admission received the same outpatient insulin amount, with the TDD switched to glargine and glulisine or to NPH and regular insulin on a unit-for-unit basis.

Patients treated with subcutaneous glargine and glulisine received 50% of the TDD as glargine and 50% as glulisine insulin. Glargine was given once daily at the same time of day and glulisine was given in three equally divided doses before each meal. Glargine was given at the full dose independently of food intake, but to prevent hypoglycemia, the dose of glulisine was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal. Patients treated with NPH and regular insulin received two-thirds of the TDD before breakfast and one-third of the TDD before dinner. The insulin dose was given as two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the morning with breakfast and two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the evening with dinner. To prevent hypoglycemia, regular insulin was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal; in addition, the dose of NPH was reduced by 50% if a patient was kept NPO all day. Insulin dosage was adjusted daily according to glucose values to maintain target blood glucose < 140 mg/dl before meals. The insulin dose was adjusted, and supplemental insulin was given based on blood glucose levels (supplementary Table B, available in an online appendix).

The primary outcome of the study was the determination of differences in the rate of hypoglycemic events (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl) during the transition period between treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included differences in the time to resolution of DKA and hyperglycemia, average blood glucose during intravenous insulin infusion, mean daily blood glucose after resolution of DKA, length of hospital stay, and hospital complications between treatment groups.

### Prospective randomized trial of insulin glargine in acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department: a pilot study [^115k7Nk1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine the efficacy of coadministration of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin glargine in combination with intravenous (IV) insulin for treating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing coadministration of insulin glargine and IV insulin (experimental) with IV insulin (standard care control). The setting was emergency departments (EDs) in two hospitals in Houston, Texas. Patients presenting with blood sugar ≥ 200 mg/dL, pH ≤ 7.3, bicarbonate (HCO3) ≤ 18 mg/dL, ketonemia or ketonuria, and anion gap ≥ 16 between November 2012 and April 2013 were enrolled. All patients received IV insulin. Additionally, the experimental group was given SQ insulin glargine within 2 hours of diagnosis. Upon closure of anion gap, patients in the control group were subsequently transitioned to long-acting insulin. In the study group, IV insulin was discontinued and long-acting SQ insulin was reinstituted 24 hours after initial introduction. The primary outcome of time to closure of anion gap (TCAG) was compared between groups using a general linear model (GLM), adjusting for initial anion gap, etiology, and presence of comorbidities. Similarly, the secondary outcome hospital length of stay (LOS) was adjusted for age, etiology, and hospital site in the GLM. Rate of hypoglycemia and intensive care unit (ICU) admission was compared using Fisher's exact test while ICU LOS was compared using Wilcoxon's two-sample test.

Results

A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this pilot trial. The estimated mean TCAG was 10.2 hours (SE ± 6.8 hours) in the experimental group and 11.6 hours (SE ± 6.4 hours) in the control group (p = 0.63). The estimated mean hospital LOS was 3.9 days (SE ± 3.4 days) in the experimental group and 4.8 days (SE ± 3.6 days) in the control group (p = 0.66). Incidents of hypoglycemia, rates of ICU admission, and ICU LOS were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

Coadministration of glargine in combination with an insulin infusion in the acute management of DKA is feasible. Further study is needed to determine the true efficacy in terms of TCAG and hospital LOS.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114xaF6V]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Based on previous reports, the rate of hypoglycemic events (primary end point) in patients treated with subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin was estimated to be 37%. The rate of hypoglycemic events with basal bolus insulin was estimated to be < 10%. Using two-sided χ² tests and a type I error of 0.05, we calculated that 32 patients per group were needed to have 80% power to detect the difference in hypoglycemia rate of 30%. Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up, we recruited a total of 74 patients with DKA, of which 34 patients per group completed the study.

All data in the text, tables, and figures are means ± SD. Two-sample Wilcoxon tests or Pearson's χ² tests were used to compare patient demographic and clinical characteristics as well as outcomes measures between treatment groups. Cross-sectional analyses based on two-sample Wilcoxon tests were used to assess the group differences in blood glucose and acid-based parameters during DKA treatment and mean daily blood glucose after DKA resolution. In addition, we used repeated-measures linear models to examine the group differences while adjusting for subject's age, sex, race, and BMI. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues in mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114BnDRC]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is commonly treated with intravenous (IV) regular insulin. However, patients with less severe DKA may benefit from a subcutaneous (SC) scheme.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SC rapid-acting insulin analogue (RAIAs) with IV regular insulin. Risk ratios (RR) were used to compare treatment effects for binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We used the R version 4.3.2 for statistical analyses.

Results

Our meta-analysis included eight RCTs encompassing 415 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between RAIAs and IV regular insulin in the treatment of mild to moderate DKA in the pediatric and adult population in the primary outcome of time until DKA resolution (MD 0.00 h; 95% CI -1.27 to 1.28; P = 1.00). Both treatments showed comparable results in the secondary outcomes total insulin usage (P = 0.65), time until hyperglycemia resolution (P = 0.22), length of hospital stay (P = 0.11), the incidence of hypoglycemia (P = 0.15) and DKA recurrence (P = Not estimable). There were no reports of death, cerebral edema, or venous thrombosis in the studies.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis of eight RCTs we found that SC RAIAs and regular IV insulin are comparable in resolving mild to moderate DKA in children and adults. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023485032.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^116TBvUR]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Of 48,110 eligible patients with type 1 diabetes, 26,639 individuals were aged ≤ 20 years with a diabetes duration of ≥ 2 years. Subjects with continuous subcutaneous insulin injections (n = 4,553), change in basal insulin during the last 18 months (n = 9,334), less than three injections per day or no documented basal insulin (n = 1,053), missing documentation of insulin therapy (n = 792), or the use of zinc intermediate-acting insulin (n = 225) were excluded. In effect, 10,682 individuals (mean age 14.2 ± 4.1 years, median 15.3) were included in the analysis.

Clinical characteristics of patients using long-acting basal insulin analogs (n = 5,317) or NPH insulin (n = 5,365) are summarized in Table 1. The overall number of DKA events in the entire cohort was 549 during the recent treatment year, corresponding to a DKA incidence of 5.14 ± 0.22 (SE/100 patient-years).

Table 1
Clinical characteristics and incidence of DKA in 10,682 patients with type 1 diabetes from 271 centers

Patients using long-acting insulin analogs had higher DKA risk than patients with NPH insulin (Table 1). Multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for A1C, diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset, sex, migration background, insulin therapy (dose of short-acting insulin analogs, daily insulin dose, prandial/basal ratio), and treatment year confirmed higher DKA risk in the long-acting insulin analog group compared with the NPH insulin group (P = 0.015, OR 1.357 [95% CI 1.062–1.734]).

Independent variables associated with higher DKA risk were higher insulin dose (P < 0.001) and higher A1C level (P < 0.001). However, dose of short-acting insulin analogs, insulin ratio (prandial/basal), age at diabetes onset, diabetes duration, sex, migration background, and treatment year were not significantly associated with DKA risk.

### Review of subcutaneous insulin regimens in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults and pediatrics [^117BGft5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Summarize the studies evaluating the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults and pediatrics.

Data Sources

A PubMed literature search was conducted for articles published between 2000 and the end of May 2024 which contained the following terms in their title: (1) subcutaneous, glargine, or basal and (2) ketoa*.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, guidelines, meta-analysis, commentaries, studies not related to the acute management of DKA, studies evaluating continuous SQ insulin, animal studies, if the time to DKA resolution was not clearly defined, and studies where basal insulin was administered greater than 6 hours after the insulin infusion was started were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The electronic search identified 58 articles. Following the initial screening 38 articles were excluded and 3 were added after bibliography review. Of the 23 articles assessed for eligibility, 7 were excluded. Sixteen articles were included. Five studies compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and intravenous (IV) insulin infusions in adults, 4 compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and IV insulin infusions in pediatrics, 4 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in adults, and 3 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in pediatrics.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

In comparison with IV insulin infusions, rapid/short-acting SQ insulin regimens were associated with reduced ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. IV insulin infusion regimens that included a single SQ basal insulin dose upon therapy initiation were associated with reduced concurrent IV insulin infusion durations.

Conclusion

Studies reviewed suggest that SQ insulin regimens may be as effective and safe as IV insulin infusions in the management of DKA and are associated with the conservation of resources. Providers may refer to this review when establishing or modifying their DKA management protocols.

### Evaluation of an alternative approach to managing diabetic ketoacidosis: combination rapid-acting and basal subcutaneous insulin (CRABI-DKA) [^1117pEGW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines recognize the utility of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin regimens in the management of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the need to administer SQ insulin every 1–2 hours may discourage their use due to frequent lab testing and admission to higher level of care units.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the proportion of patients whose mild to moderate DKA resolved within 12 hours after receiving the new SQ insulin order set and the institution's intravenous (IV) insulin infusion order set.

Methods

The SQ order set included single doses of glargine (0.2 units/kg) and lispro (0.2 units/kg) upon therapy initiation, followed by lispro (0.1–0.2 units/kg) given every 3 hours until DKA resolution. The IV order set included a nurse-managed titratable infusion. Glucose and labs were checked every 3 hours in the SQ group, whereas glucose was checked hourly and labs were checked every 2 hours in the IV group. Patients were managed on units with a RN to patient ratio of 1:4–5 and 1:2–3 in the SQ and IV groups, respectively.

Results

The percentage of patients whose DKA resolved within 12 hours was 78% in the IV group and 90% in the SQ group (P = 0.1). The time to DKA resolution and rates of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our study highlights the utility of combining rapid-acting and basal SQ insulin in the management of DKA and adds to the limited literature evaluating this approach.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^1159y2Lx]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

### Management of diabetic keto-acidosis in adult patients admitted to intensive care unit: an ESICM-endorsed international survey [^114uPFzk]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

More than half of respondents reported lowering the continuous intravenous insulin dose after the disappearance of ketones, while 35% did so when blood glucose dropped below a defined threshold, as recommended. Although ketones monitoring is recommended in patients with DKA, relying solely on urine ketones may delay the assessment of treatment efficacy, as it only detects acetoacetate but not β-hydroxybutyrate, which is oxidized to acetoacetate and eliminated in the urine. Whatever the timing for lowering the continuous intravenous insulin dose, it is crucial to administer continuous intravenous insulin until DKA resolution to block lipolysis and prevent further ketones generation. The timing of the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin was also heterogeneous and 23% of respondents never resumed subcutaneous insulin in ICU. Nevertheless, adding subcutaneous basal insulin to continuous intravenous insulin may hasten DKA resolution, shorten the duration of intravenous insulin administration, and prevent rebound hyperglycemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or other metabolic disorders.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes. DKA most commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes; however it can also present among people with type 2 diabetes with concomitant insulin deficiency and among people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes, DKA is a common presentation in the emergency room and an indication for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Ramphul et al. recently showed that the incidence of hospitalizations due to DKA in the United States increased from 2003 to 2017, with the incidence per 10,000 admissions rising from 32.04 in 2003 to 61.60 in 2017 according to the 2017 National Inpatient Sample.

The diagnostic criteria for DKA includes the triad of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, increased total serum ketone concentration and metabolic acidosis. DKA commonly presents with a precipitating cause, such as an acute illness or increased physiological stress. DKA management includes treating the precipitating cause, correcting dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids, managing electrolyte abnormalities, and administering insulin to correct the ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. The standard of care for managing DKA is through the administration of a continuous IV insulin infusion. DKA is usually treated in a monitored setting, such as the resuscitation area in the emergency department or the ICU. As per Diabetes Canada, IV insulin is the standard of care for DKA management. On the other hand, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends IV insulin administration for moderate-to-severe DKA and suggests the possibility of using subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin for mild and uncomplicated DKA.

There are few observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of using a subcutaneous insulin protocol in managing DKA outside of a monitored setting. To our knowledge, the last systematic review conducted on this topic was done by Andrade-Castellanos et al. in 2016. The studies presented in this previous review demonstrated that insulin therapy is effective in managing DKA regardless of the route of administration in selected patients. However, it only included RCTs, excluding observational studies. Given that additional studies have been conducted on this topic since 2016, we performed an updated systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA compared to IV insulin. The main purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin among adult patients with mild to moderate DKA.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^114K1pfj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

DKA is a severe metabolic derangement characterized by dehydration, loss of electrolytes, hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, acidosis and progressive loss of consciousness that results from severe insulin deficiency combined with the effects of increased levels of counterregulatory hormones (catecholamines, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone). The biochemical criteria for diagnosis are: blood glucose > 200 mg/dl, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, ketonemia > 3 mmol/L and presence of ketonuria. A patient with DKA must be managed in an emergency ward by an experienced staff or in an intensive care unit (ICU), in order to provide an intensive monitoring of the vital and neurological signs, and of the patient's clinical and biochemical response to treatment. DKA treatment guidelines include: restoration of circulating volume and electrolyte replacement; correction of insulin deficiency aiming at the resolution of metabolic acidosis and ketosis; reduction of risk of cerebral edema; avoidance of other complications of therapy (hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic acidosis); identification and treatment of precipitating events. In Brazil, there are few pediatric ICU beds in public hospitals, so an alternative protocol was designed to abbreviate the time on intravenous infusion lines in order to facilitate DKA management in general emergency wards. The main differences between this protocol and the international guidelines are: intravenous fluid will be stopped when oral fluids are well tolerated and total deficit will be replaced orally; if potassium analysis still indicate need for replacement, it will be given orally; subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog is administered at 0.15 U/kg dose every 2–3 hours until resolution of metabolic acidosis; approximately 12 hours after treatment initiation, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day, and it will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

Frequency and Risk Factors

DKA with New-Onset Diabetes

The frequency of new-onset diabetes presenting as DKA varies widely by geographic region, and correlates inversely with the regional incidence, and therefore the level of awareness in the community of pediatric diabetes. In Europe this frequency varies from 11% to 67%. In Australia the frequency between 1985 and 2000 was 26%, and in New Zealand 63% in 1988/89 and 42% in 1995/96. Children < 5 years of age are more likely to have DKA at diagnosis as are those who are in social or economic situations that do not permit ready access to medical care.–In patients from Colorado, DKA was seen at onset in 28.4%; the odds ratio for uninsured patients compared with insured patients was 6.2, with significantly greater severity in the uninsured group. Long-term reductions in frequency of DKA at onset have been reported following intensive education of the medical and lay community.–DKA at the time of diagnosis has been estimated to occur in as many as 25% of children with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

It is not uncommon for previously undiagnosed patients in DKA to have been seen in physicians' offices or emergency rooms without adequate history and laboratory study that could have made the diagnosis before they became critically ill. A high index of suspicion is particularly warranted for infants and young children whose symptoms may be nonspecific.

Recurrent DKA

Among 1243 patients in Colorado, the risk of recurrent DKA was eight episodes per 100 patient years; 20% of the patients accounted for 80% of the episodes. The risk factors for recurrent DKA were poor metabolic control or previous episodes of DKA, female gender (peripubertal or adolescent), psychiatric disorders including eating disorders, difficult or unstable family circumstances, limited access to medical services, and insulin pump therapy. Only rapid- or short-acting insulin is used in pumps, so that interruption of insulin delivery for any reason rapidly leads to insulin deficiency. In the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment of treatment teams with intensive education of families on sick day management and 24-hour availability demonstrated a profound reduction in recurrent DKA, which is almost invariably due to intentional omission of insulin administration.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111wL2rY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Research Design and Methods

In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with DKA to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of DKA. After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34). Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).

Results

There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin. After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of DKA. A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of DKA resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin. Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116vxCdp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours <br/> - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL <br/> - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116yT14n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3units/kg SC within 3h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25h (7.75h, IQR 6.00–9.00h vs. 11.00h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in-hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Differential evolution of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with pre-existent versus newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117LaKgT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most common acute complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). The mortality rates secondary to DKA have significantly improved over time (from around 15% in the 1980s to < 1% in 2020). However, it remains a common cause of mortality in patients with DM, especially type 1 DM (T1D), with up to 76% of deaths related to DKA. The prevalence of DKA in patients with T1D is variable, ranging from 10 to 128 episodes per 1000 people per year, with higher rates reported in poorly controlled DM. Patients with type 2 DM (T2D) are insulin-resistant rather than deficient, which is why DKA is less commonly seen in this population. However, insulin resistance results in the inability of the body to fully respond to the glucogenic and lipolytic effects of insulin, leading to a relative insulin deficiency. The inadequacy of insulin function is further potentiated in the presence of certain precipitating factors. Illness or infections can precipitate DKA in patients with T2D via a surge of counter-regulatory hormones (such as glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone), rendering the body unable to adequately control lipolysis. Hyperglycaemia in patients with T2D also amplifies the effects of these hormones, making the body prone to DKA. The hyperglycaemic state also reduces insulin response at the molecular level by curbing the transcription of insulin gene. Additionally, insulin deficiency is not uncommon in progressed T2D and can lead to DKA even without a precipitating factor.

The true prevalence of DKA in T2D remains unknown. However, an increasing number of DKA cases are seen in T2D. There are multiple potential factors behind the increasing incidence of DKA. First, more patients are now diagnosed with DM. This increasing prevalence of DM, which indirectly increases the occurrence of DKA, may be secondary to diagnosis at a younger age which is associated with worse outcomes in both T1D and T2D. Rising risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and poor dietary habits, among other factors, are also responsible for the increasing prevalence of T2D. Additionally, DKA affects the younger population who are not routinely screened for DM-2 and go unrecognized. Hence, DKA becomes the presenting symptom in this undiagnosed population, usually secondary to a precipitating factor. A third reason is that the younger onset of Diabetes is associated with rapid progression in beta-cell failure and insulin deficiency, making those patients DKA-prone when faced with any precipitating factor such as infections.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^111noq6t]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of long-acting insulin analogs was not associated with a lower DKA incidence in our study population, representing ≥ 80% of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes of ≥ 2 years' duration in Germany and Austria. In this cohort of 10,682 individuals, we found 5.14 DKA events/100 patient-years, similar to previous observations. Patients using long-acting insulin analogs had higher DKA incidence than individuals using NPH insulin. In a previous smaller study, a nonsignificant trend of less DKA episodes was described in children injecting long-acting insulin analogs, but mean patient age (6.5 years) and overall DKA risk were lower in that series, which may account for the differences to our findings.

Our results were derived from an observational nonrandomized prospective study. In the study population, patients injecting long-acting insulin analogs were older, had poorer metabolic control, and more frequently used short-acting insulins than those injecting NPH — all factors potentially increasing DKA risk. However, after adjusting for these factors, higher DKA risk in patients with long-acting insulin analogs persisted, suggesting that observed differences are indeed related to insulin therapy. A variety of additional factors may influence the risk of DKA in type 1 diabetic patients, including treatment adherence, socioeconomic status, infections, or residual β-cell function. In our population-based study, these variables could not be separately assessed. DKA is frequently caused by omission of particularly the long-acting component of a basal-bolus insulin regimen. Missing a once-daily injection of a long-acting insulin analog may potentially contribute to a greater DKA risk than missing one of two or three NPH injections.

In conclusion, despite their long-acting pharmacokinetic profile, the use of long-acting insulin analogs was not associated with a lower incidence of DKA compared with NPH insulin. The possibility of increased DKA risk in pediatric patients injecting insulin glargine or detemir warrants further attention.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^11265aVb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first prospective randomized trial to compare the use of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with DKA. During the initial treatment phase, we observed no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of intravenous insulin administration until resolution of DKA between regular and glulisine insulin. After resolution of ketoacidosis, the transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine insulin resulted in glycemic control similar to that for NPH and regular insulin; however, treatment with glargine and glulisine insulin is safer and is associated with a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemia. A total of 14 patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had one or more episodes of hypoglycemia (P < 0.03).

The comparable response to intravenous glulisine and regular insulin during the acute resolution of DKA in this study is in line with previous reports of generally equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs (glulisine, aspart, and lispro) and regular insulin in animal and human studies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic studies comparing the intravenous administration of glulisine and regular insulin have shown a similar onset of action within 20 min, a similar distribution and elimination profile, and equivalent glucose utilization and disposal on a molar, unit-per-unit basis. The present study confirms these observations and provides evidence of the equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs and regular insulin in patients with severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Their comparable in vivo potency is attributable to their similar receptor binding affinity and receptor-mediated clearance. Our study and these previous reports indicate that treatments with intravenous glulisine and regular insulin are equally safe and efficacious in the acute management of patients with DKA. However, intravenous regular insulin is more cost-effective and should be preferred over rapid-acting insulin analogs during the acute intravenous treatment phase of DKA.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of care in adults with diabetic ketoacidosis pre-COVID-19 and during-COVID-19 at a tertiary, referral hospital in nairobi, Kenya [^111GBThE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial in DKA management to avert prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality. The mainstay of treatment remains rehydration, early insulin initiation, identification and treatment of precipitants, and management of electrolyte imbalance. In our study, the mean amount of insulin used was 110 units, including both basal and short-acting. We had a 100% uptake of basal insulin during the duration of DKA, which could have contributed to a lower overall use of insulin for DKA resolution compared to other similar studies. The mean amount of insulin used in the study by Desse et al. was 136.85 ± 152.41 units till the resolution of DKA/ HHS, and they did not specify the use of basal insulin.

Our study's most frequently used fluid for DKA management was normal saline, followed by dextrose-saline (DNS) when the sugars were lower than 14 mmol/l. However, of note is that almost two-thirds of our patients received ringers' lactate at some point during DKA management. The current guidelines still recommend normal saline as the first choice of fluids for DKA management, but there is emerging evidence on the role of balanced crystalloids like Plasmalyte and Ringer's lactate as the fluid of choice for rehydration in DKA to reduce hyperchloremia and improve renal functions. A small, randomized clinical trial conducted in South Africa, comparing Normal Saline with Ringer Lactate for DKA management revealed no difference in time to DKA resolution and that it took longer for glucose normalization with Ringer Lactate compared to Normal Saline.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111JB2Pu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Early administration of insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting basal insulin analogue, in combination with IVII within 3 h of DKA diagnosis resulted in faster DKA resolution and lower CBG levels at 72 h among patients experiencing rebound hyperglycaemia after transitioning to full SC insulin treatment, without increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia. This approach may reduce the utilisation of personnel, laboratory testing, and intensive care resources in DKA management. It may be considered for all types of diabetes and DKA severity, particularly in patients with prior degludec use and insulin‐naïve individuals experiencing DKA for the first time who are planned to receive degludec for long‐term glycaemic control.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^116DNLPT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Although SQ regular insulin has not been accepted as a therapy for DKA given its pharmacokineticsand slower attainment of effective plasma insulin concentrations, rapid-acting SQ insulin lispro has a substantially earlier and greater peak serum insulin concentration. Prior studies, have reported large IV insulin doses in DKA treatment, with 1 study showing an average administration of 216 units within the first 3 hours of treatment. Our protocol included a dose of long-acting insulin glargine administered up front along with SQ insulin lispro at every 4 hours, which is an approach used in United Kingdom DKA guidelines. We found that the protocol was effective with a similar time needed to reach a glucose less than 250 mg/dL and, more importantly, to anion gap closure without evidence of increased adverse outcomes. More recently, another studyhas found that short-acting insulin given SQ up to every 2 hours was safe and effective in treatment of DKA.

Given that the insulin is administered SQ, factors that affect absorption into the bloodstream, including obesity, the use of vasoconstricting drugs, and blood pressure, are important to consider in identifying the right patients for SQ insulin treatment. Typically, 100-unit insulin volumes of no greater than 0.5 mL are injected into a discrete area because a larger volume of insulin may impede absorption. Although the protocol used in this study did not have a specific weight limitation, we have recently revised our protocol to exclude patients whose weight is 166 kg or more out of concerns related to insulin absorption.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111Xg7Co]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although positive therapeutic responses to low-dose insulin therapy have been established in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), none of these studies and guidelines for the treatment of DKA, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus and Position Statements, has ever assessed or addressed the use of a continuous insulin infusion without a loading dose of insulin. In the current study, we used a dose of 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose instead of the recommended 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 with a loading dose. This insulin regimen was chosen because one study in a pediatric population used a dosing regimen of 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose that resulted in a total plasma insulin level of 50–60 μU/ml. This level proved to be too low for optimal suppression of hepatic glucose output and optimal glucose uptake. In addition, bolus doses of insulin may result in hypokalemia as well as other undesirable effects, especially when used in a routine hospital setting.

The efficacy of low-dose insulin without a priming dose has not been established in a prospective randomized study. Thus, the following questions have remained unanswered in the treatment of DKA: 1) Is an insulin bolus needed before a continuous insulin infusion? 2) What is the optimal insulin infusion rate if a bolus dose is not used? and 3) What is the dose response of continuous insulin infusion used alone in regard to decremental changes in glucose, metabolic parameters, cortisol, and free fatty acids (FFAs)? Therefore, we evaluated responses to three low-dose insulin regimens in 37 consecutive patients with DKA in a prospective randomized fashion to address these issues. Changes in plasma free insulin, serum potassium levels, and outcome recovery measures were assessed using a higher infusion dose (0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose) compared with a lower infusion dose (0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1) with and without a loading dose (0.07 unit/kg) of insulin.

### The rate of hyperglycemia and ketosis with insulin degludec-based treatment compared with insulin detemir in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes: an analysis of data from two randomized trials [^113du5j9]. Pediatric Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Control of hyperglycemia is a key focus of diabetes management and insulin is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Insulin deficiency leads to hyperglycemia and elevated ketones (ketosis) and, if not managed correctly, progresses to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) has developed specific guidelines for the assessment and monitoring of glycemic control in children and adolescents with diabetes. 1 While ketone levels ≤ 0.6 mmol/L are considered normal, elevated levels > 0.6 mmol/L indicate mild ketosis, > 1.5 mmol/L represents the level at which there is a high risk of progression to ketoacidosis, and ketoacidosis is imminent with ketone levels > 3.0 mmol/L. 1 DKA is a major health concern in children with T1D and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 2, 3 Despite this concern, there is a lack of systematic collection of the rate of ketosis in pediatric populations with T1D. Unchecked, ketosis will progress to DKA. In children with established diabetes, 4.9% to 7.1% of children and adolescents experienced at least one episode of DKA in the previous year. 4, 5

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116CPzLg]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total of 74 patients with DKA were randomly assigned in this study. Of them, six patients were excluded because four withdrew consent before or shortly after initiation of insulin therapy, one patient received glargine insulin before resolution of DKA, and one patient was treated with intravenous aspart insulin instead of regular insulin. The remaining 68 patients served as the study population. The diagnosis of DKA was established by standard criteria. We excluded patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after the administration of 1 l of normal saline, patients in a comatose state, and patients with acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, dementia, and pregnancy. This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, and at Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was approved by dual institutional review boards.

Patients with DKA were randomly assigned in the emergency department to receive treatment with regular (n = 34) or glulisine (n = 34) insulin intravenously until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to receive subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily. Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to glargine once daily and glulisine before meals.

Treatment protocols

Patients were managed by members of the internal medicine residency programs of the respective institutions, who received copies of the assigned treatment protocol (supplementary Table A in an online appendix, available at). Orders for intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were similar in both groups and followed current American Diabetes Association guidelines. Initial orders for intravenous regular and glulisine insulin included an initial bolus of 0.1 unit/kg, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion calculated to deliver 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 until blood glucose levels decreased to < 250 mg/dl (< 13.8 mmol/l). At that time, intravenous fluids were changed to dextrose-containing solutions, and the insulin infusion rate was decreased to 0.05 unit · kg −1 · h −1 to maintain blood glucose of ∼200 mg/dl (∼11.1 mmol/l) until resolution of DKA. DKA was considered resolved when blood glucose was < 250 mg/dl, the serum bicarbonate level was ≥ 18 mmol/l, and venous pH was > 7.30.

### Is diabetic ketoacidosis a good predictor of 5-year metabolic control in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes? [^116AJS9x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The study aimed to evaluate whether the presence of DKA at diabetes diagnosis was associated with poorer metabolic control during a 5-year follow-up.

Methods

The study included children treated due to newly diagnosed T1D complicated with DKA between 2010 and 2014 with a complete 5-year follow-up. In every case we performed individual matching for age, gender and BMI with a person without DKA (nDKA) on recognition. We collected data regarding treatment modality, HbA 1C, total daily insulin dose, basal insulin and BMI-SDS.

Results

85 children at the median age of 7.93years had DKA at diabetes diagnosis. The median pH was 7.19. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was used in 87% of participants in each group. No differences in HbA 1C level (7,3%vs7,2%; p = .413) were noted after 5years of disease duration. The severity of ketoacidosis exerted no significant effect on HbA 1C. The method of insulin delivery at baseline was significantly associated with HbA 1C levels after 5years of observation, β CSII = -1.46,95%CI[-2.01 to -0.92], p < .001.

Conclusions

The presence of DKA at diabetes diagnosis is not associated with deteriorated long-term metabolic control in children using modern technologies. The early implementation of CSII into diabetes treatment may change the effect of DKA and lead to a long-term HbA 1C improvement.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^113gMQcv]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The clinical characteristics of study patients on admission are shown in Table 1. The mean age, duration of diabetes, and precipitating cause for DKA were similar between treatment groups. Poor adherence with insulin therapy was the most common precipitating cause of DKA and was recorded in 59% of patients treated with glulisine and in 79% of patients in the regular insulin group. The length of hospital stay was similar between patients treated with glargine and glulisine (2.9 ± 2.2 days) and NPH and regular insulin (3.3 ± 2.2 days) (NS).

Table 1
Patient characteristics on admission

Biochemical parameters on admission and during treatment were similar in patients treated with intravenous glulisine and regular insulin (NS). Changes in blood glucose and acid-base parameters during treatment are shown in Fig. 1. As suggested by the repeated-measures analyses, the rate of decline of blood glucose concentration and changes in acid base parameters during treatment were not significantly different between treatment groups with adjustment for age, sex, race, and BMI (NS). The mean duration of treatment until resolution of ketoacidosis was not statistically different between those treated with glulisine (8.9 ± 4.7 h) and regular insulin (10.5 ± 6.3 h) (NS). At resolution of DKA, the mean blood glucose concentration and acid-base parameters in patients treated with glulisine insulin (glucose 153 ± 61 mg/dl, bicarbonate 20 ± 3 mmol/l, pH 7.33 ± 0.04, and anion gap 8.3 ± 2.1 mEq/l) were similar to those in patients treated with intravenous regular insulin (glucose 185 ± 58 mg/dl, bicarbonate 19.5 ± 3.7 mEq/l, pH 7.32 ± 0.04, and anion gap 9 ± 3 mEq/l). During the insulin infusion, six patients treated with glulisine and four patients treated with regular insulin developed one or two episodes of blood glucose < 70 mg/dl, but none of them were < 40 mg/dl. The amount of insulin administered until resolution of DKA (70 ± 33 and 76 ± 46 units) and the mean total duration of insulin infusion (15.7 ± 4.5 and 20.5 ± 12 h) were not different between glulisine and regular insulin, respectively (NS). There was no mortality, and none of the patients had a recurrence of DKA during their hospital stay.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Thbzw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Figure 14.1 — Management of new-onset diabetes in youth with overweight or obesity with clinical suspicion of type 2 diabetes begins by "initiate lifestyle management and diabetes education", then branches by A1C and acidosis/ketosis status. For A1C < 8.5% with no acidosis or ketosis, metformin is used and titrated up to 2,000 mg per day as tolerated. For A1C ≥ 8.5% with no acidosis with or without ketosis, metformin is used and long-acting insulin is started at 0.5 units/kg/day and titrated every 2–3 days based on blood glucose monitoring (BGM). For acidosis and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), manage DKA or HHS and give intravenous insulin until acidosis resolves, then subcutaneous, as for type 1 diabetes until results of antibody testing are known. After pancreatic autoantibody testing, if negative continue or start metformin and, if on insulin, titrate guided by glucose values; if positive continue or initiate multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin or pump therapy, as for type 1 diabetes, and discontinue metformin. If A1C goals are not met, continue metformin and consider adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor approved for youth with type 2 diabetes; if on insulin therapy, consider prioritizing and maximizing noninsulin medications to minimize weight gain before escalating insulin doses, and titrate or split insulin; if using long-acting insulin only and glycemic goals are not met with escalating doses, add prandial insulin; total daily insulin dose may exceed 1 unit/kg/day. A1C 8.5% = 69 mmol/mol.

Post-episode care after diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) includes social and access screening and referral, and consideration of technology access: Individuals who have experienced DKA or HHS should be screened for social determinants of health that can contribute to or trigger these complications, including inadequate access to insulin, other glucose-lowering medications, and diabetes-durable medical equipment, and referred to appropriate health care and/or community services. Access to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may also decrease risk of DKA recurrence.

Insulin

Basal insulin therapy is the only remaining licensed treatment option if metformin and liraglutide are insufficient or not tolerated. Insulin resistance is characteristic in CYP going through mid-late puberty and might require higher doses of basal insulin up to 1.5 units/kg/day to achieve glycaemic control. A single daily long-acting insulin analogue (e.g. glargine, detemir or degludec) is preferred as studies show that compliance with insulin can be a challenge in CYP. Higher concentrations of basal insulin (U-300 glargine, U-200 degludec) may be required to avoid large-volume injections that may further diminish medication adherence.

Additional meal-time rapid-acting insulin (e.g. aspart) may be needed if basal insulin cannot achieve glycaemic control. Doses should be titrated based on pre- and post-prandial readings and should be done in discussion with a dietitian who is supporting the young person on lifestyle changes, including diet and weight management.

The main side effects of insulin treatment are hypoglycaemia and weight gain. The incidence of hypoglycaemia is low however all patients should be educated on its treatment, including the use of glucagon.

SGLT-2 inhibitors

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of SGLT 2 inhibitors in CYP. They can be considered for post-pubertal youth not achieving adequate control with licensed medications in collaboration with adult diabetologists.

There is a risk of euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis(DKA) and patients should be counselled on the symptoms and advised to seek immediate medical advice if these develop. Baseline C-peptide should be measured in those not on insulin to ensure adequate endogenous insulin production to protect against DKA. Treatment should be discontinued if DKA is suspected or confirmed and not restarted unless the cause of DKA is proven to be unrelated.

Other agents

There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations on sulphonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors and orlistat (Appendix).

### Insulin glargine supplementation during early management phase in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blinded randomised controlled trial [^1121Gf6J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early supplementation with insulin glargine (GI) during the acute management of paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Design

Double-blinded randomised controlled trial conducted from July 2022 to June 2023.

Setting

Emergency department and paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India.

Participants

Children between > 1month and ≤ 12 years presenting with DKA.

Intervention

Participants were randomised to receive a single subcutaneous dose of GI (0.3U/kg) or volume-matched placebo within 1hour of initiating intravenous regular insulin infusion.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included the rate of blood glucose decline, incidence of hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, rebound hyperglycaemia, treatment failure and total regular insulin dose received.

Results

82 children were enrolled (glargine: n = 42; control: n = 40). The mean (SD) time to DKA resolution was 11 (6.4) hours in the glargine group versus 13.9 (7.4) hours in the control group (adjusted HR 1.05, 95%CI 0.65 to 1.69, p = 0.84). Rebound hyperglycaemia (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.57, 95%CI 0.35 to 0.92, p = 0.02) and treatment failure (ARR 0.14, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.56, p = 0.005) were significantly lower with glargine. Other secondary outcomes were similar across groups.

Conclusions

While early glargine supplementation did not accelerate DKA resolution, it was associated with reduced treatment failure and improved glycaemic stability post resolution. Its use was safe, feasible and not linked to increased adverse events.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^113LT6Ht]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathophysiology of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)–associated ketoacidosis (DKA) differs from type 1 diabetes (T1D) DKA. T1D DKA is driven by absolute insulin deficiency, leading to ketosis and hyperglycemia. In contrast, SGLT2i DKA occurs due to reduction in plasma glucose (PG) from urinary glucose losses, which reduces insulin secretion and stimulates glucagon secretion, leading to ketosis. Accordingly, PG levels in SGLT2i DKA are often normal or mildly elevated. The implication is that glycemia and ketosis are less closely linked than in T1D DKA. Despite these differences, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology recommends treatment with the same protocols as T1D. This may result in hypoglycemia when patients receive fixed-dose insulin infusion or inadequate insulin dosing and reduced ketone clearance when patients receive dynamic insulin infusions.

Insulin Therapy in T1DM

In the absence of obesity, all patients less than 30 years old should be treated as for T1DM unless they are less than 1 year old, have no ketones, have optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, deafness, or other systemic illness. T1DM is treated with insulin. Treatment focuses on preventing complications by managing blood glucose levels with insulin, diet, and lifestyle modification. Multiple daily injections of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin analogues, given 0–15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulins, are used. The basal-bolus regimen includes basal insulin (insulin degludec, insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and NPH) and bolus insulin (rapid-acting: insulin aspart, insulin lispro, or insulin glulisine; or short-acting: Regular/Neutral). Patients with severe decompensation (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA) require intensive therapy, usually using short-acting insulin under close supervision. In the DCCT study in which short-acting and intermediate-acting human insulins were used, intensive therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) improved glycemia and resulted in better long-term outcomes.

### Addressing pitfalls in management of diabetic ketoacidosis with a standardized protocol [^113YCWWn]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-Power Plan (PP) for guiding intravenous (IV) insulin infusions prior to anion gap (AG) closure and administering subcutaneous (SC) insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuing IV insulin. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with DKA before (pre-PP) (n = 60) and following (post-PP) (n = 60) implementation of a DKA-PP. Groups were compared for percentage of patients for whom IV insulin therapy was continued until AG closure, the percentage of patients receiving SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin, and percentage of patients with rebound DKA during the index hospitalization. Results: Admission plasma glucose (514 mg/dL vs. 500 mg/dL; p = 0.36) and venous pH (7.2 vs. 7.2; p = 0.57) were similar in pre- and post-PP groups. Inappropriate discontinuation of IV insulin occurred less frequently in post-PP patients (28% vs. 7%; p = 0.007), with a lower frequency of rebound DKA (40% vs. 8%; p = 0.001) following acute management. More post-PP patients received SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin (65% vs. 78%; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Implementation of a DKA-PP was associated with appropriate discontinuation of IV insulin in more patients, more frequent administration of SC insulin ≥ 1 hour prior to discontinuation of IV insulin, and fewer episodes of rebound DKA.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

Increased risk of late postprandial hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is a common and potentially dangerous adverse effect of insulin therapy, fueled by use of exogenous insulin with pharmacokinetics that imperfectly mimic the physiologic response. The International Hypoglycaemia Study Group has classified hypoglycemia into three levels, with level 1 defined as blood glucose levels below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), level 2 with blood glucose levels < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) indicating severe, clinically important hypoglycemia, and level 3 defined as severe hypoglycemia requiring external assistance for recovery. Hypoglycemia can have severe neurological and cardiovascular consequences, including death. Particularly, in pediatric insulin therapy, hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis pose a high risk to the developing brain and are a critical hazard. At the same time, diabetes management in very young children is complicated by their inability to reliably communicate symptoms, and variability in insulin requirements with growth, which increases the risk of imprecise insulin dosing. Older individuals represent another group with a greater risk of hypoglycemia with potentially fatal consequences, especially as their perception of hypoglycemia can be limited by nonspecific or individually less perceptible symptoms.

### Subcutaneous insulin lispro for treating DKA… [^112kFGVU]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is the use of low-dosage intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular insulin. Although all routes of administration have been shown to be effective, the preferred method is intravenous because of concern about delayed response to subcutaneous or intramuscular insulin. Treatment with intravenous insulin usually requires admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring of the patient. However, the development of insulin lispro and aspart insulin provides another option for treating DKA. Both of the newer insulins have a more rapid onset of action, usually 10 to 20 minutes, and peak within 30 to 90 minutes. Umpierrez and associates compared the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous insulin lispro with low-dosage continuous intravenous regular insulin in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated DKA.

The study was a prospective, randomized, open trial of patients admitted for uncomplicated DKA. Participants were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous insulin lispro in the general medical ward or intermediate care unit, or intravenous regular insulin in the intensive care unit. The insulin lispro regimen was 0. 3 units per kg followed by
0. 1 units per kg per hour until correction of hyperglycemia. The regular insulin regimen was 0. 1 units per kg followed by continuous infusion of
0. 1 units per kg per hour until correction of hyperglycemia. Treatment for both groups was followed with 0. 05 to
0. 1 units per kg per hour until resolution of DKA. The primary outcomes measured were time required to resolve hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis and the rate of hypoglycemia during insulin therapy. Forty patients enrolled in the trial and were assigned to treatment. On admission, the two groups had similar biochemical parameters.

The time to resolution of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis, length of hospital stay, amount of insulin used until resolution of DKA, and rate of hypoglycemia were similar between the groups. Hospital expenses for patients treated in the intensive care unit were 39 percent higher than those for patients treated with insulin lispro. The authors conclude that hourly treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro is a safe alternative to intravenous regular insulin for adults with uncomplicated DKA. They add that treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro is more cost-effective than intravenous regular insulin because treatment with insulin lispro can be performed in a non-intensive care setting.
