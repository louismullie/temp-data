## Question

What is the antihypertensive drug of choice in a patient with CKD and hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive drug should be chosen for a patient with chronic kidney disease and hypertension, and how to justify that choice with clinical references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guidelines that speak directly to CKD. Then, I should verify whether there is a true "drug of choice" versus a class preference. Next, I will examine the evidence base for renin–angiotensin system blockade in CKD, including albuminuria considerations. After that, I need to check for any exceptions or caveats, such as dual RAAS blockade, hyperkalemia, and advanced CKD. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and confirm the monitoring plan and alternatives if RAAS inhibitors are not tolerated.

> Let me first confirm the guideline consensus before jumping to conclusions. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same answer: in CKD with hypertension, an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is preferred to slow kidney disease progression, especially when albuminuria is present, and dual RAAS blockade should be avoided [^117ApdJX] [^1138SmpY] [^115CA32Y].

> Wait, let me verify the exact wording so I don't overstate it. KDIGO 2021 explicitly recommends initiating an ACEi or ARB and titrating to the maximum tolerated dose in patients with CKD and moderate to severe albuminuria, and to avoid combining ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor therapy [^115CA32Y]. The 2025 multisociety guideline similarly recommends RAAS inhibition with either an ACEi or ARB, but not both, in adults with CKD and albuminuria to reduce cardiovascular events and delay kidney disease progression [^117ApdJX]. ESH 2023 likewise prioritizes ACEi/ARB initiation in CKD with albuminuria and cautions against dual RAAS blockade [^1138SmpY] [^117FCXRG].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and not conflate drug choice with target blood pressure debates. The consistent signal across trials and meta-analyses is that RAAS blockade reduces proteinuria and slows CKD progression beyond blood pressure effects, with the clearest benefit in patients with albuminuria, which is why guidelines elevate ACEi/ARB to preferred status in this subgroup [^113WZ33u] [^112W1F7M].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about the "drug of choice" phrasing. Strictly speaking, there is no single molecule mandated; the class is preferred, and within the class, either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is acceptable, selected based on tolerability, cough, angioedema risk, and patient-specific factors. So the correct answer is a class preference for RAAS blockade with ACEi or ARB, not both, rather than a single branded agent [^117ApdJX] [^1138SmpY].

> But wait, what if there is no albuminuria? Let me consider that nuance. In CKD without albuminuria, the relative advantage of RAAS blockade over other first-line agents is less pronounced, and guidelines allow initiation with other classes; however, many patients with CKD ultimately develop albuminuria, and RAAS blockade remains reasonable, particularly given its cardiovascular benefits in high-risk CKD populations [^113WZ33u].

> Next, I should review important caveats so I don't oversimplify. Dual therapy with an ACEi plus an ARB is not recommended due to harm, including hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury, and direct renin inhibitors should not be combined with ACEi/ARB in CKD. I should also confirm monitoring: after starting or uptitrating RAAS therapy, check serum creatinine and potassium in 1–2 weeks, anticipate a modest eGFR decline of about 10–20% that is usually acceptable if asymptomatic, and reassess if the decline exceeds that threshold or if hyperkalemia develops [^115CA32Y] [^1141MaYJ].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation. For a patient with CKD and hypertension, I would initiate an ACE inhibitor or an ARB as first-line antihypertensive therapy, favoring RAAS blockade especially when urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is 30 mg/g or higher, titrate to the maximally tolerated dose, avoid combining ACEi and ARB, and monitor renal function and potassium closely after initiation and dose changes. If cough or angioedema occurs with ACEi, I would switch to an ARB; if neither is tolerated, I would select an alternative class and consider nephrology input for resistant hypertension strategies [^1138SmpY] [^117ApdJX] [^114m4ECM].

> I should double-check the bottom line to ensure alignment with the highest-credibility sources. The drug of choice is a renin–angiotensin system blocker, either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, but not both, with selection tailored to patient tolerance and albuminuria status, and with vigilant lab monitoring to mitigate hyperkalemia and kidney function changes [^117ApdJX] [^1138SmpY].

---

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the **first-line antihypertensive therapy** for CKD patients with hypertension because they reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^111E8giM] [^113WZ33u]. Use **ACE inhibitors first**, switching to ARBs if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated. Avoid combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs [^115CA32Y] due to harm. Add a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone preferred) or a calcium channel blocker if additional control is needed [^112xDQoo] [^114JVgoG], and consider mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for resistant hypertension with close potassium monitoring [^114EidhK]. Target **BP < 130/80 mmHg** if tolerated, and use standardized office BP measurement [^116ExCuQ] [^11798PFD].

---

## First-line antihypertensive therapy

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the **preferred initial therapy** for CKD patients with hypertension because they reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^1138SmpY] [^113WZ33u]. ACE inhibitors are generally preferred initially; ARBs are appropriate alternatives if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated [^113WZ33u].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting ACE inhibitors and ARBs

ACE inhibitors and ARBs provide **renoprotective effects** by reducing intraglomerular pressure, proteinuria, and fibrosis, thereby slowing CKD progression [^112W1F7M]. Major trials and guidelines consistently support their use in CKD with hypertension [^113WZ33u].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often required to achieve BP targets in CKD [^117FCXRG]. Thiazide-like diuretics (particularly chlorthalidone) or calcium channel blockers are recommended as **add-on therapy** if BP remains uncontrolled with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^112xDQoo] [^114JVgoG]. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone) may be considered for resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia [^114EidhK].

---

## Blood pressure targets

Recommended BP targets for CKD patients include:

| **Guideline** | **Recommended bp target** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2021 | < 120 mmHg (standardized office BP) if tolerated [^11727Ntj] |
| ESC/ESH 2023 | < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^116ExCuQ] |
| VA/DoD 2025 | < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^notfound] |

---

Individualize targets based on tolerance, comorbidities, and **patient-specific factors** [^112WfqhF].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium closely, especially when using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^notfound].
- **Renal function monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, particularly after initiating or adjusting therapy [^114m4ECM].
- **Resistant hypertension**: Common in CKD; consider secondary causes and optimize multidrug regimens [^1168MVZZ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^116VhNKh].
- **Add-on therapy**: Thiazide-like diuretics or calcium channel blockers [^112xDQoo].
- **Resistant hypertension**: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists with close monitoring [^114EidhK].
- **BP targets**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; consider < 120 mmHg in selected patients [^116ExCuQ] [^11798PFD].

---

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the **preferred first-line antihypertensive therapy** for CKD patients with hypertension, with thiazide-like diuretics or calcium channel blockers as add-on therapy. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are considered for resistant hypertension, and BP targets should be individualized based on tolerance and comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION

According to 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, nearly half of US adults have hypertension (48.1%, 119.9 million) and this prevalence is even higher, approximately 60–90%, in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and mortality as well as poor kidney outcome. Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD results in better CVD and all-cause mortality as well as CKD progression and is a core goal for the treatment in published guidelines. However, only one in four US adults with hypertension have their BP under control for several reasons, including lack of awareness, access to healthy lifestyle, healthcare and medications. Resistant hypertension is a phenomenon that identifies subset of hypertensive patients who have inadequately controlled BP despite intensive treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications and is associated with substantially higher risk of poor outcomes. Due to complex interplay of physiologic factors and more stringent systolic BP (SBP) goals in CKD (ACC/AHA guidelines' target < 130/80 mmHg and 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] guidelines' target of < 120 mmHg), the prevalence of resistant hypertension is much higher in CKD and requires increasing involvement of nephrologists to manage this condition. This review discusses the pathophysiology, definition, identification and treatment strategies for resistant hypertension in individuals with CKD.

### Systematic review: blood pressure target in chronic kidney disease and proteinuria as an effect modifier [^111SyKe7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal blood pressure target in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear.

Purpose

To summarize trials comparing lower versus higher blood pressure targets in adult patients with CKD and focus on proteinuria as an effect modifier.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (July 2001 through January 2011) were searched for reports from randomized, controlled trials with no language restriction.

Study Selection

Authors screened abstracts to identify reports from trials comparing blood pressure targets in adults with CKD that had more than 50 participants per group; at least 1-year follow-up; and outcomes of death, kidney failure, cardiovascular events, change in kidney function, number of antihypertensive agents, and adverse events.

Data Extraction

Reviewers extracted data on study design, methods, sample characteristics, interventions, comparators, outcomes, number of medications, and adverse events and rated study quality and quality of analyses for proteinuria subgroups.

Data Synthesis

Three trials with a total of 2272 participants were included. Overall, trials did not show that a blood pressure target of less than 125/75 to 130/80 mm Hg is more beneficial than a target of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Lower-quality evidence suggests that a low target may be beneficial in subgroups with proteinuria greater than 300 to 1000 mg/d. Participants in the low target groups needed more antihypertensive medications and had a slightly higher rate of adverse events.

Limitations

No study included patients with diabetes. Trial duration may have been too short to detect differences in clinically important outcomes, such as death and kidney failure. Ascertainment and reporting of adverse events was not uniform.

Conclusion

Available evidence is inconclusive but does not prove that a blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg improves clinical outcomes more than a target of less than 140/90 mm Hg in adults with CKD. Whether a lower target benefits patients with proteinuria greater than 300 to 1000 mg/d requires further study.

### Analysis of dual combination therapies used in treatment of hypertension in a multinational cohort [^113KMNcm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, contributing worldwide to more than 7 million deaths and 57 million disability-adjusted life-years annually. In 2015, approximately 1.13 billion adults had hypertension, yet fewer than 30% had achieved their blood pressure control goal. Notably, the burden of hypertension is particularly salient in the Asia Pacific region, given that this region has 60% of the world's population and has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence of hypertension since 1980.

Approximately 70% of patients with hypertension cannot achieve their blood pressure control goal with monotherapy. Despite the wide availability of antihypertensive agents, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the optimal choice for a second agent for use in escalation from monotherapy. Clinical trials lack head-to-head comparisons of second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy, and only 2 trials (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension [ACCOMPLISH]and Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events [COPE]) directly compared combination regimens in patients with hypertension who required 2 drugs. These trials, however, provided comparisons between few agents, not drug classes; included primarily patients from Western countries; and did not systematically assess heterogeneity in patient subgroups. The absence of head-to-head comparison in clinical trials has limited the ability of clinical guidelines to provide recommendations about the preferred choice of second medication for treatment escalation. However, it is plausible that not all dual combination therapies have the same mean risks and benefits. Moreover, some combinations may be associated with better outcomes in particular patient subgroups. Evidence about the choice of medication in escalating treatment to 2 agents may better inform clinical decisions and provide needed evidence for practice guidelines.

### Resistant hypertension in dialysis [^115F6ZH1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most common finding in chronic kidney disease patients, with prevalence ranging from 60% to 90% depending on the stage and etiology of the disease. It is also a significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage kidney disease and mortality. According to the current guidelines, resistant hypertension is defined in the general population as uncontrolled blood pressure on three or more antihypertensive drugs in adequate doses or when patients are on four or more antihypertensive drug categories irrespective of the blood pressure control, providing that antihypertensive treatment included diuretics. The currently established definitions of resistant hypertension are not directly applicable to the end-stage kidney disease setting. The diagnosis of true resistant hypertension requires confirmation of adherence to therapy and confirmation of uncontrolled blood pressure values by ambulatory blood pressure measurement or home blood pressure measurement. In addition, the term "apparent treatment-resistant hypertension", defined as an uncontrolled blood pressure on three or more antihypertensive medication classes, or use of four or more medications regardless of blood pressure level was introduced. In this comprehensive review we focused on the definitions of hypertension, and therapeutic targets in patients on renal replacement therapy, including the limitations and biases. We discussed the issue of pathophysiology and assessment of blood pressure in the dialyzed population, management of resistant hypertension as well as available data on prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension in end-stage kidney disease. To conclude, larger sample-size and even higher quality studies about drug adherence should be conducted in the population of patients with the end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis. It also should be determined how and when blood pressure should be measured in the group of dialysis patients. Additionally, it should be stated what the target blood pressure values in this group of patients really are. The definition of resistant hypertension in this group should be revisited, and its relationship to both subclinical and clinical endpoints should be established.

### Optimal targets for blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: the debate continues [^113pNdkq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often an exclusion criterion for large randomized trials of the management of hypertension, clinical decision making for these patients has relied on a few small, specific studies and much extrapolation. Several blood pressure treatment guidelines have recently been reissued. This review explores the applicability of the revised recommendations to CKD.

Recent Findings

Many new publications are meta-analyses, guidelines and debates about guidelines. New data from trials are scant. Three revised guidelines (KDIGO, JNC8, KHA-CARI) recommend a target of less than 140/90. Most antihypertensive drugs are equally effective - but this rule may not apply to advanced CKD. Proteinuric renal disease is seen as an exception; all three guidelines set a target of 130/80 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (but not both) is preferred.

Summary

There is no shortage of new commentary and advice, but evidence strength and generalizability diminish as the kidneys fail and the impact of calcified vessels and salt and water overload increases. A risk-based approach to intervention may be no less valuable than targets. Clinical trials of individuals with advanced CKD will be needed to identify effective treatments and may see a resurgence of the role of spironolactone.

### Use of antihypertensive agents and association with risk of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^114YhouE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects over 85 million Americans, and > 15% of patients with hypertension also have chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 Yet the class or classes of antihypertensive medications that should be used to optimize outcomes in the CKD population remain unclear. 1 Use of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, ACEIs and ARBs are currently the preferred agents in the CKD population. 2, 3, 4, 5

While there are data to support the benefit of ACEI and ARB use during the early stages of CKD (stage 3) for both renal and cardiovascular benefit, 6 especially among patients with diabetes mellitus, 7 less data are available to support the benefit of ACEI and ARB use on outcomes in more advanced CKD (stage 4 or 5). There are also sparse data about how calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or β‐blockers (BBs) may be associated with risk of cardiovascular outcomes or death in the CKD population. Few head‐to‐head comparisons of the effect of different classes of antihypertensive medications on renal or nonrenal outcomes have been conducted, and many of the trials of the use of different antihypertensive classes have been placebo controlled. 6, 7

The objectives of this study were to examine patterns and predictors of the class of antihypertensive medications used across CKD stages 2 to 5 in a well‐characterized cohort of participants with CKD followed longitudinally in the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study, with a focus on ACEI and ARB use. We also examined the association of ACEI and ARB, CCB, or BB use with risk of adjudicated heart failure (HF) events and all‐cause mortality, and determined whether these associations varied based on the severity of CKD (early versus advanced stages).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^112xDQoo]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease with uncontrolled hypertension on ACEI/ARB — second-line antihypertensives are suggested as follows: We suggest the addition of a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to reduce blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension not controlled on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). A meta-analysis of five small trials with a total of 214 participants with CKD stage G3b-G5 not on dialysis found that the addition of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics effectively reduced BP. The largest trial in this meta-analysis randomized 160 individuals with uncontrolled BP and CKD stage G3b-5 not on dialysis to either placebo or chlorthalidone added to existing BP-lowering medications, and almost all trial participants were taking ACEI or ARB and 60% were taking loop diuretics; the reduction in 24-hour BP after 12 weeks was -11.0 mmHg [95% confidence interval [CI]: -13.9 to -9.1] in the chlorthalidone group and -0.5 mmHg (95% CI: -3.5 to 2.5) in the placebo group. The evidence review for the 2020 VA/DoD Hypertension CPG included data that thiazide-type diuretics were superior to other drug classes for preventing heart failure outcomes, and a thiazide diuretic may also reduce the risk of hyperkalemia associated with ACEI or ARB, enabling continuation of these kidney protective agents. While not part of the evidence base, the ACCOMPLISH trial, conducted in 2008, randomized 11,506 patients with hypertension at high risk for CVD events.

### Definition, identification and treatment of resistant hypertension in chronic kidney disease patients [^1157nJ4n]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension, the inability to achieve goal blood pressure despite the use of three or more appropriately dosed antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic), remains a common clinical problem, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While the exact prevalence and prognosis of resistant hypertension in CKD patients remain unknown, resistant hypertension likely contributes significantly to increased cardiovascular risk and progression of kidney disease in this population. We review the identification and evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension, including the importance of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the identification of 'white-coat', 'masked' and 'non-dipper' hypertension, the latter of which has particular clinical and therapeutic importance in patients with resistant hypertension and CKD. We then discuss treatment strategies for resistant hypertension that target the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying resistance to treatment, including persistent volume excess, incomplete renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and inadequate nocturnal blood pressure control. Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm for evaluation and treatment of resistant hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Clinical pharmacology of antihypertensive therapy for the treatment of hypertension in CKD [^115qWDuQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

CKD is common and frequently complicated with hypertension both predialysis and in ESKD. As a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in this high-risk population, treatment of hypertension in CKD is important. We review the mechanisms and indications for the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β -adrenergic blocking agents, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, direct vasodilators, and centrally acting α -agonists. Recent evidence suggests that β -adrenergic blocking agents may have a greater role in patients on dialysis and that thiazide diuretics may have a greater role in patients with advanced CKD. We conclude with sharing our general prescribing algorithm for both patients with predialysis CKD and patients with ESKD on dialysis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension 2021 [^112WfqhF]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 4 years, several evidence-based, national, and international guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension have been published, mostly with concordant recommendations, but in some aspects with discordant opinions. This in-depth review takes these guidelines into account but also addresses several new data of interest. Although being somewhat obvious and simple, accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement with validated devices is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of hypertension, but out-of-office BP measurements are of crucial importance as well. Simplified antihypertensive drug treatment such as single-pill combinations enhances the adherence to medication and speeds up the process of getting into the BP target range, a goal not so far adequately respected. Recommended (single-pill) combination therapy includes diuretics as part of the first step of antihypertensive therapy, and updated analysis does not provide evidence to exclude diuretics from this first step because of the recently discussed potential risk of increasing cancer incidence. Target BP goals need to be individualized, according to comorbidities, hypertension-mediated organ damage, coexistence of cardiovascular risk factors (including age), frailty in older patients, and individual tolerability. There are also concordant recommendations in the guidelines that an office BP between 120 and 140 mm Hg systolic and between 70 and 80 mm Hg diastolic should be achieved. The BP target of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease are not applicable for clinical practice because they heavily rely on 1 study that used a study-specific, nontransferable BP measurement technique and excluded the most common cause of chronic kidney disease, namely, diabetic nephropathy. Actual data even from a prospective trial on chronotherapy have to be disregarded, and antihypertensive medication should not be routinely dosed at bedtime. Rigorously conducted trials justify the revival of renal denervation for treatment of (at least, but not only) uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease-treatment standard 2023 [^115TfUpd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is very common and remains often poorly controlled in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction is often overlooked, but can improve BP control, especially among patients treated with an agent to block the renin-angiotensin system. In the presence of very high albuminuria, international guidelines consistently and strongly recommend the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker as the antihypertensive agent of first choice. Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics are reasonable second- and third-line therapeutic options. For patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, guidelines recommend the addition of spironolactone to the baseline antihypertensive regimen. However, the associated risk of hyperkalemia restricts the broad utilization of spironolactone in patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Evidence from the CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial indicates that the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone is effective and serves as an alternative therapeutic opportunity for patients with stage 4 CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension. Chlorthalidone can also mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia to enable the concomitant use of spironolactone, but this combination requires careful monitoring of BP and kidney function for the prevention of adverse events. Emerging agents, such as the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ocedurenone, dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan and the aldosterone synthase inhibitor baxdrostat offer novel targets and strategies to control BP better. Larger and longer term clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these novel therapies in the future. In this article, we review the current standards of treatment and discuss novel developments in pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

Hypertension management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — during medication uptitration to the recommended systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of < 130 mm Hg, we recommend home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to avoid hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg), and after adding or titrating drugs affecting electrolytes or kidney function, it is reasonable to check a basic metabolic profile within 2 to 4 weeks; patients should be trained to perform HBPM and instructed to hold or reduce antihypertensive doses when oral intake is decreased or with vomiting or diarrhea because volume depletion and acute kidney injury (AKI) could occur, and we recommend clinic follow-up every 6 to 8 weeks until the BP goal is safely achieved, after which laboratory monitoring and clinic follow-up should occur every 3 to 6 months based on medications used and patient stability.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112Qpr2B]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease with microalbuminuria — In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and a GFR greater than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2, studies demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the 2 agents in slowing loss of kidney function, and follow-up in most studies of microalbuminuric patients generally was in the range of 2 to 4 years. Because no trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria have demonstrated a reduction in such clinical outcomes as CKD stage 5, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death, the Work Group concluded that evidence for treatment of microalbuminuric patients with these medicines is moderate, representing a change in level of evidence grading from "strong" in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD; in the absence of participation in such a clinical trial, the Work Group recommends this treatment despite moderate evidence.

### Chronic kidney disease care delivered by US family medicine and internal medicine trainees: results from an online survey [^116Bzm2B]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Blood pressure goal and therapy choices

The vast majority of respondents chose a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mmHg for a hypothetical patient with CKD and a creatinine clearance of 40 ml/min (Figure 3A). The question posed was: "Which class of antihypertensive medication was considered a first-line agent to slow the progression of kidney disease in a patient with mild to moderate CKD?" (Figure 3B). The responses from family medicine trainees, internal medicine trainees, and attendings were not statistically different for the data shown in Figures 3A, B, and were therefore pooled. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were the first-line medications chosen by 90% and 48% of respondents, respectively, and only 6% chose neither of the two. Respondents were then given a case scenario of a 37-year-old man with hypertension, microalbuminuria, and a blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg, who is only treated with a thiazide diuretic. Asked if they would add an ACEi to this patient's regimen, a decreasing number of respondents opted to do so as the patient's serum creatinine increased (Figure 3C). Family medicine trainees were significantly less likely to choose an ACEi once the serum creatinine was greater than 1.4 mg/dl (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the response whether the scenario was given for an African-American or a Non-Hispanic Caucasian man (data not shown).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^115LuDKt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

KDOQI clinical utility — targets and agents for blood pressure control in CKD: Based on meta-analyses of well-designed clinical trials, an SBP target ≤ 130 mm Hg seems reasonable for individuals with CKD stages 1, 2, 3a, and 3b, with stronger evidence for persons without DM or persons with moderate to severely increased urine albumin excretion; in contrast, although potentially reasonable, the DBP target remains opinion based. For individuals with CKD stages 4 and 5 not receiving dialysis, there are insufficient data because most trials, including SPRINT, excluded patients with advanced CKD. The recommendation for treatment with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is graded as IIa and IIb, respectively, meaning that the strength of the recommendation is moderate for ACE-inhibitor use and weak for ARB use. Meta-analyses have shown that use of an ACE inhibitor compared to placebo significantly reduces the risk for kidney failure, but this benefit appears driven by trials limited to persons with high levels of urine albumin excretion. For individuals without moderate or severely increased urine albumin excretion, any first-line BP-lowering agent can be used, and among patients with CKD, often multiple medications will be required. Options for BP reduction, even at low eGFRs, may include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or CCBs. In addition, volume control with the use of loop diuretics may be needed in patients with advanced CKD with signs of volume overload and in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. The initial selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on an assessment of potential risks and benefits, particularly in patients with advanced CKD (Fig 1).

### Is the KDIGO systolic blood pressure target [^1166ERae]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Meticulous management of hypertension is important in chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, mortality, and progression of CKD. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on blood pressure (BP) management in CKD stresses the importance of standardized BP measurement and strict control of BP. This is a useful document that will help to improve the management of hypertension in CKD globally. However, the recommendation of systolic BP target of < 120 mmHg by KDIGO is controversial. It is based on weak evidence derived mainly from a single randomized controlled trial and its CKD subgroup analysis. Here, we review the current evidence surrounding BP target in CKD. We argue that the target recommended by KDIGO is not generalizable to the majority of people with CKD. Standardized BP measurements are challenging to implement outside specialist hypertension and research clinics, and the target of < 120 mmHg BP systolic cannot be extrapolated to routine clinic BP measurements. If applied to routine BP measurement, this target will expose the multimorbid and frail CKD patients to the risk of adverse events including falls and fractures. Furthermore, it will not be achievable in the majority of CKD patients. The target recommended by KDIGO is an outlier among contemporary major international hypertension guidelines and is likely to perplex clinicians. We believe the KDIGO-recommended target systolic BP < 120 mmHg for CKD is inappropriate in the majority of CKD patients and it may even be harmful for patients managed in routine clinical practice.

### What should be the goal blood pressure in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease? [^11289RHG]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the available evidence on whether a lower blood pressure (BP) treatment target can ameliorate the progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD), and prevent cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

Recent Findings

The three prospective, randomized controlled trials which addressed the question of progression of CKD suggest that a lower BP treatment goal (< 130/80mmHg) may lead to better preservation of renal function, but only in those patients with proteinuria of more than 300mg/day. However, the evidence is not conclusive. We are not aware of adequately powered, randomized trials that have assessed the efficacy of lower target BP levels for the prevention of cardiovascular events specifically in nondiabetic CKD patients. The available circumstantial evidence (e.g., subgroup analyses of CKD patients in cardiovascular trials) fails to reveal a clear benefit of a lower BP goal.

Summary

There is currently no convincing evidence to recommend a lower than standard BP treatment target of less than 140/90mmHg for all patients with nondiabetic CKD. A lower treatment target of less than 130/80mmHg may delay renal disease progression but only in patients with proteinuria.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^111bTQCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Onco-hypertension in patients with kidney disease [^111pwvs5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer, hypertension, and kidney disease are closely interrelated. Knowledge of the potential hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of antineoplastic medications is critical to minimizing interruptions in cancer treatment.

Summary

Antineoplastic medications can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and kidney injury, often mediated by common mechanisms. Notably, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway have the strongest association with both hypertension and proteinuria, typically acute in onset and often reversible after drug discontinuation. The abrupt rise in blood pressure can cause clinically significant hypertensive syndromes and contribute to overall morbidity. Significant proteinuria can herald kidney failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function during antineoplastic therapy and appropriate hypertension treatment are important. This article reviews available literature and proposes a step-by-step approach to manage cancer patients with concurrent hypertension and kidney disease.

Key Messages

For antineoplastic medications with known hypertensive effect, blood pressure should be checked at baseline and serially during cancer treatment. Hypertensive crisis with end-organ damage, significant proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, or unexplained acute kidney injury necessitates drug cessation until further evaluation and resolution. In patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer therapy-related hypertension, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker is the preferred antihypertensive choice. Finally, multidisciplinary collaboration in these patients will yield the best results.

### Management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus [^114qpKHb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease aims at controlling blood pressure, optimizing blood glucose levels, and providing renoprotection. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus are prevalent causes of cardiovascular disease owing to associations with major cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, and they are substantial health burdens. Even mild-to-moderate CKD and prehypertension increase cardiovascular risk. First-line agents for reducing cardiovascular risk are inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). In clinical trials, treatment of high-risk patients with ACE inhibitors and ARBs delays or prevents the onset of diabetes and prevents progression of renal disease and cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular mortality. Current evidence indicates that the clinical efficacy of these end points includes effects that may be beyond blood pressure reduction.

### The role of combination antihypertensive therapy in the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease [^113y2qtJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The failure to achieve blood pressure (BP) control in the general population makes a substantial contribution to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequent renal failure. Each year, in the United States, more than 94,000 people develop end-stage renal disease; about 65% of these cases are directly attributable to hypertension and diabetes. Like hypertension, CKD does not produce symptoms for many years, and therefore its detection, prevention, and treatment are largely dependent on the vigilance of physicians and other health care providers. Current therapeutic advances make it possible to slow the progression of CKD and to improve clinical outcomes for these patients. Large, randomized, clinical hypertension trials have shown that tighter BP control, compared with less tight BP control, can reduce progression of renal disease by 30% to 50% and cardiovascular disease by 40% to 70%. Achieving BP levels of < 130/80 mm Hg, as currently recommended for patients with diabetes or CKD, will often require three or more antihypertensive medications. Furthermore, reduction of BP should be accompanied by reductions in albuminuria and proteinuria to maximize potential benefits to the kidney. Evidence from numerous randomized controlled trials mandate that agents that block the renin-angiotensin system should always be included in the antihypertensive regimens of patients with CKD, particularly with the excellent safety data with serum creatinine levels < 3 to 4 mg/dL. Fixed-dose combination agents are useful in bringing high-risk hypertensive patients to appropriate BP goals, primarily by simplifying the complex medical regimens in these patients.

### Should diuretics always be included as initial antihypertensive management in early-stage CKD? [^112ps9YR]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the need for combined antihypertensive therapy drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease and the relevance of diuretics.

Recent Findings

Chronic kidney disease is a high-risk situation characterized by the presence of volume overload-related hypertension, micro/macroalbuminuria and other traditional and nontraditional risk factors. To achieve the blood pressure goal in these patients, combined antihypertensive therapy (including diuretics) is usually required.

Summary

Extracellular volume expansion is an important, if not the most important, contributing factor to hypertension seen in chronic kidney disease. Protection against progression of renal dysfunction has two main requirements: strict blood pressure control and lowering proteinuria to values as near to normal as possible. Diuretics have been a useful tool to manage volume overload and to achieve strict blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease. Albeit other blood pressure-lowering agents offer additional favorable effects independently of blood pressure changes, diuretics will continue to be used in these patients.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with CKD. Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials. First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects. Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the current place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation. We endorse use of such a systematic approach to improve recognition and care for this vulnerable patient group that is at high risk for future kidney and cardiovascular events.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease [^11727Ntj]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease for patients not receiving dialysis represents an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline on this topic. Development of this guideline update followed a rigorous process of evidence review and appraisal. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence. The strength of recommendations is based on the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, such as optimal blood pressure targets, lifestyle interventions, antihypertensive medications, and specific management in kidney transplant recipients and children. Some aspects of general and cardiovascular health, such as lipid and smoking management, are excluded. This guideline also introduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressure measurement since all large randomized trials targeting blood pressure with pivotal outcomes used standardized preparation and measurement protocols adhered to by patients and clinicians. Based on previous and new evidence, in particular the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) results, we propose a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg using standardized office reading for most people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, the exception being children and kidney transplant recipients. The goal of this guideline is to provide clinicians and patients a useful resource with actionable recommendations supplemented with practice points. The burden of the recommendations on patients and resources, public policy implications, and limitations of the evidence are taken into consideration. Lastly, knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are provided.

### The effect of antihypertensive drugs on chronic kidney disease: a comprehensive review [^116sF6ad]. Hypertension Research (2013). Low credibility.

Data from randomized clinical trials and epidemiological evidence identify systemic hypertension as the second most common modifiable risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression after diabetes mellitus. CKD may progress silently over the years and early diagnosis and control of hypertension is of major importance in delaying renal function decline. Recent guidelines for the treatment of hypertension suggest the use of a variety of antihypertensive drugs in order to achieve the desired blood pressure levels. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have been undoubtedly studied the most and are suggested by guidelines and experts as first choice in patients with hypertension and renal injury, particularly in those with diabetes, as they have repeatedly shown to significantly reduce proteinuria. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs have been studied to a lesser extent and they have their own unique properties and effects. However, it is now common knowledge that adequate blood pressure control is the most important factor for the preservation of renal function, so every drug that effectively lowers hypertension is believed to be renoprotective. The present article will review the latest data on the role and properties of each class of antihypertensive drugs on CKD.

Eighth Joint National Committee evidence‐based algorithm for the treatment of hypertension. Reproduced with permission from: James et al. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thereby, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (130/80 mmHg or lower) to standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or lower). Participants were adults with CKD and elevated blood pressure documented in a standard way on at least two occasions, or already receiving treatment for elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our critical outcomes were: total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Important outcomes were: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects, and number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level or at least a 50% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the end of the study. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the critical outcomes. This review received no funding.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that contributed data for meta-analysis, involving 7348 participants overall (range 840 to 4733 people per study). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range 1.0 to 8.0 years). Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding. All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies blinded participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure target. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all studies. Critical outcomes. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets likely result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.06; 6 studies, 7348 participants), total serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 7348 participants), and total cardiovascular events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 5 studies, 6508 participants), all with moderate-certainty evidence. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 6 studies, 7348 participants) and progression to end-stage renal disease (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4788 participants), both with low-certainty evidence. Important outcomes. We found little to no differences in: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects; and the number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level, or at least a 50% reduction in GFR at the end of the study. Exploratory outcomes. Compared to the standard blood pressure target groups, participants in the lower target groups achieved lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after one year, and required a higher number of antihypertensive drugs at the end of the studies. A higher proportion of participants in the standard blood pressure target groups achieved the targets they were assigned than did participants in the intensive target groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a standard blood pressure target, lower blood pressure targets probably result in little to no difference in total mortality, total serious adverse events, and total cardiovascular events, and may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or in the progression to end-stage renal disease in people with hypertension and CKD. However, the evidence underpinning these conclusions has several limitations. All studies were open design, blood pressure measurement was performed at a medical office, and there was scant information about adverse events. Future research should include high-quality adverse event data, report results for people with different levels of proteinuria, and consider out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Several studies are ongoing, and may provide new evidence for this topic in the near future.

### Resistant hypertension in people with CKD: a review [^116k6F8G]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is common in the chronic kidney disease population and conveys increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and the development of kidney failure. Recently, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association published a revised scientific statement on the definition and management of resistant hypertension, which codified the long-debated differences between pseudoresistant hypertension and true resistant hypertension. We review this distinction and its importance to nephrologists, who frequently encounter patients for whom antihypertensive therapy fails due to difficulty adhering to complex multidrug regimens. Second, we discuss the evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension, including appropriate screening and diagnostic testing for causes of secondary hypertension. Third, we examine the management of established resistant hypertension, including medication optimization, recent clinical trials supporting lifestyle modifications, and the evidence behind the routine use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Special attention is given to the vital role of diuretics in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease. We propose an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of these cases. Finally, we briefly discuss the current state of antihypertensive device therapies, including kidney denervation and baroreceptor-directed therapies.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^1139xS8B]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤ 140mmHg systolic and ≤ 90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤ 130mmHg systolic and ≤ 80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

Hypertension in chronic kidney disease — blood pressure and renin–angiotensin system management are stated as follows: We suggest intensive blood pressure management to reduce mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2. In patients with hypertension and albuminuria (i.e., urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] > 30 mg/g), we recommend the use of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. We suggest the addition of a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to reduce blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension not controlled on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker. In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) currently on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, we suggest continuing therapy, unless there is drug intolerance or other adverse event.

### Aggressive blood pressure reduction and renin-angiotensin system blockade in chronic kidney disease: time for re-evaluation? [^116qea5Q]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were considered the cornerstones of treatment against progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), following important background and clinical evidence on the associations of hypertension and RAAS activation with renal injury. To this end, previous recommendations included a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg for all individuals with CKD (and possibly < 125/75 mmHg for those with proteinuria > 1 g/day), as well as use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension in all CKD patients. However, long-term extensions of relevant clinical trials support a low-BP goal only for patients with proteinuria, whereas recent cardiovascular trials questioned the benefits of low systolic BP for diabetic patients, leading to more individualized recommendations. Furthermore, our previous knowledge of the specific renoprotective properties of RAAS blockers in patients with proteinuric CKD is now extended with data on the use of these agents in patients with less advanced nephropathy and/or absence of proteinuria, deriving mostly from subanalyses of cardiovascular trials. This review discusses previous and recent clinical evidence on the issues of BP reduction and RAAS blockade by type and stage of renal damage, aiming to aid clinicians in their treatment decisions for patients with CKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113LADsQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of hypertension in diabetes and chronic kidney disease — ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a greater antiproteinuric effect than other antihypertensive classes in hypertensive patients with DKD. (Strong) A systematic review demonstrates that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have substantially greater antiproteinuric effects than dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, translating into greater slowing of kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular event rates in those with proteinuria greater than 300 mg/d. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB can reduce proteinuria more than either agent alone, and in the opinion of the Work Group, it is reasonable to use a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in hypertensive patients with DKD; combination therapy should be considered for those with controlled blood pressure, but who have persistent high-level macroalbuminuria or ACR greater than 500 mg/g.

### Managing kidney disease with blood-pressure control [^112W1F7M]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1141MaYJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — chronic kidney disease (CKD) targets, diuretics, and monitoring — Current evidence suggests that in patients with CKD, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg and towards 130/80 mmHg, and loop diuretics should replace thiazide diuretics when the estimated GFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2. In non-diabetic CKD, one meta-analysis showed the slowest progression of CKD with a treated SBP of 110–119 mmHg in patients with albuminuria ≥ 1 g/day, whereas in those with proteinuria < 1 g/day the lowest risk was with an SBP of < 140 mmHg. In a large retrospective cohort of 398 419 treated hypertensive patients, the nadir SBP and DBP for the lowest risk were 137 and 71 mmHg, with a clear increase in mortality risk at SBP < 120 mmHg. Because BP lowering reduces renal perfusion pressure, it is expected and not unusual for eGFR to be reduced by 10–20% after initiation; careful monitoring of blood electrolytes and eGFR is essential, the decline usually occurs within the first few weeks of treatment and stabilizes thereafter, and if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe, the treatment should be stopped and renovascular disease investigated.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### The double challenge of resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease [^1168MVZZ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite adherence to a combination of at least three optimally dosed antihypertensive medications, one of which is a diuretic. Chronic kidney disease is the most frequent of several patient factors or comorbidities associated with resistant hypertension. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease, while chronic kidney disease is associated with an impaired prognosis in patients with resistant hypertension. Recommended low-salt diet and triple antihypertensive drug regimens that include a diuretic, should be complemented by the sequential addition of other antihypertensive drugs. New therapeutic innovations for resistant hypertension, such as renal denervation and carotid barostimulation, are under investigation especially in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. We discuss resistant hypertension in chronic kidney disease stages 3–5 (ie, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) and not on dialysis), in terms of worldwide epidemiology, outcomes, causes and pathophysiology, evidence-based treatment, and a call for action.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### Management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^112drtUz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired kidney function. The kidney exerts a marked degree of control over blood pressure through various mechanisms, such as by regulating sodium balance and hormone secretion through the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The kidney is susceptible to injury, and if already damaged can be at risk of further loss of function as a consequence of elevated blood pressure. Once elevated blood pressure is identified, a combination of sensible lifestyle measures, such as sodium restriction and weight loss, with pharmacological intervention to reduce blood pressure will usually achieve blood pressure goals. In this Review, we outline the importance of blood pressure control for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the mechanisms that affect blood pressure control, and the basis for non-drug and drug therapies. We further discuss the rationale for < 140 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic targets for blood pressure in patients with CKD, with consideration for tighter targets in the setting of proteinuria.

### Blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: is less really more? [^112LPh8V]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

BP control is critical in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent guidelines now recommend a BP goal of < 130/80 mmHg. Clinical trials using a randomized, intention-to-treat design have not established the benefits of this goal; rather, observational data and secondary or subgroup analyses drove the development of the new guidelines. A variety of observations suggest potential adverse events associate with achieving too low a BP in patients with chronic kidney disease, and ongoing randomized trials will have to establish the benefits or risks of meeting this goal.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent developments in the management and monitoring of hypertension in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), not on dialysis.

Recent Findings

Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and self-measured BP monitoring can classify abnormal BP patterns better than clinic BP readings. Self-measured BP monitoring lowers BP and allows tailoring of antihypertensive treatment. Dosing of antihypertensive medication at night improves nocturnal hypertension. Recent guidelines recommend a BP target less than 140/90mmHg for patients with CKD without proteinuria and less than 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. Lower salt intake is associated with a greater effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockage in CKD. Lifestyle modification resulting in weight loss reduces BP in individuals with CKD. Of overweight or obese CKD patients, 8% report taking weight loss medication, which is a potential safety concern. Weight loss from intensive lifestyle modification in individuals with diabetes prevents CKD.

Summary

Although we have effective tools to monitor and lower BP, we still need clinical outcome studies to inform BP targets for specific age groups, types of CKD disease, and comorbidities. How to treat obesity to improve hypertension and other comorbidities in patients with CKD remains another important area of research.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.
