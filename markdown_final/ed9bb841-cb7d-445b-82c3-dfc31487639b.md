## Question

is ovarian cancer ck7 ck20?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ovarian cancer typically expresses CK7 and/or CK20 (i.e., the CK7/CK20 immunophenotype of ovarian cancer). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic CK7/CK20 patterns used to localize adenocarcinoma primaries. Then, I should verify the typical profile across epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes, especially high-grade serous and mucinous tumors. Next, I will consider key differentials such as colorectal and gastric primaries that metastasize to the ovary. After that, I need to check for exceptions and overlapping profiles that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I should confirm how to integrate other markers (PAX8, WT1, ER, SATB2, CDX2) and guideline-based pathology standards to increase diagnostic confidence [^113AjXtL] [^112AjUoA] [^112D7fCE] [^1142DYHs].

> Let me first confirm the general rule of thumb for epithelial ovarian primaries. The canonical phenotype for primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma is CK7 positive and CK20 negative, which reflects the CK7-rich profile of Müllerian epithelium and its neoplasms, and this pattern is particularly consistent in serous carcinomas [^113AjXtL] [^111jyFm8]. Wait, let me verify this in contemporary data: high-grade serous carcinoma commonly shows CK7 positivity alongside Müllerian-lineage markers such as PAX8 and WT1, reinforcing the CK7+/CK20− expectation for ovarian primaries [^112c1hJL].

> I will now examine high-grade serous carcinoma specifically. Serous papillary ovarian tumors have been reported as uniformly CK7 positive and CK20 negative in classic series, and cytology-based immunopanels in HGSC consistently show CK7 positivity with PAX8 and WT1 coexpression, aligning with a Müllerian immunophenotype [^113AjXtL] [^112c1hJL]. But wait, what if CK20 shows up in serous tumors? Hold on, I should verify exceptions: focal or low-level CK20 reactivity can rarely occur in ovarian serous carcinomas, which means that isolated CK20 positivity does not by itself exclude an ovarian primary, although it should prompt careful panel-based interpretation [^111vxBBn].

> Next, I should review mucinous ovarian carcinoma, because this is where CK20 can confuse the picture. Let me think about the frequencies: ovarian mucinous carcinomas are CK7 positive in the majority, but they show more heterogeneity in CK20 expression compared with serous tumors, with studies showing CK7 positivity in 79% or more and variable CK20 that can be negative or positive in a subset, necessitating correlation with morphology and other markers [^116tjn9t] [^113AjXtL]. I should double-check diagnostic aids here: SATB2 helps flag lower gastrointestinal origin, so CK7 with SATB2 assessment can improve accuracy when distinguishing primary mucinous ovarian carcinoma from colorectal appendiceal metastases, though pancreatobiliary primaries remain challenging and may share CK7 positivity [^111i6Um9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "ovarian = CK7+/CK20−" without addressing colorectal metastases. The classic metastatic colorectal carcinoma phenotype is CK7 negative and CK20 positive, typically with CDX2 positivity, which contrasts with the Müllerian CK7+/CK20− profile and supports a colorectal origin when present in ovarian masses that mimic primaries [^114YGJYg] [^112D7fCE]. I should confirm this with metastatic series: patterns in large cohorts and ovarian metastasis datasets reinforce CK7−/CK20+ as the predominant colorectal signature, bolstering its discriminatory value against primary ovarian tumors [^112rCXKC].

> Let me consider exceptions that can derail interpretation. I need to ensure I account for gastric carcinoma, because a substantial minority of gastric tumors metastatic to the ovary can be CK7+/CK20−, thereby mimicking an ovarian primary and demanding broader panels and clinico-radiologic correlation; borderline mucinous ovarian tumors also lack a clear CK7/CK20 pattern and can be particularly problematic [^112rCXKC] [^113AjXtL]. Hmm, wait a minute, if CK7+/CK20− can be both primary ovarian and some gastric metastases, then reliance on CK7/CK20 alone is risky and must be supplemented with markers like PAX8, WT1, ER, SATB2, and CDX2 alongside imaging and endoscopic evaluation when indicated [^112D7fCE] [^111i6Um9].

> Next, I should review the optimal panel-based approach and pathology standards. I should confirm that PAX8 and WT1 strongly support Müllerian origin when positive and help separate ovarian from many non-gynecologic primaries, while CDX2 and SATB2 favor lower GI origin and TTF-1 favors lung; integrated panels yield higher sensitivity and specificity than any single marker, which is the recommended strategy for metastatic adenocarcinoma site assignment [^112D7fCE] [^112c1hJL]. Let me verify guideline context: current ESMO guidance emphasizes expert gynecologic pathology and WHO 2020 classification for diagnosis, implicitly endorsing comprehensive immunohistochemical workups rather than single-marker conclusions, which is crucial when CK7/CK20 patterns overlap across sites [^1142DYHs].

> Synthesis and final interpretation: To answer "is ovarian cancer CK7 CK20?", primary epithelial ovarian cancers are typically CK7 positive and CK20 negative, especially high-grade serous carcinomas, but mucinous ovarian carcinomas show more CK20 variability, and rare serous cases can exhibit focal CK20 expression; therefore, CK7/CK20 should be interpreted within a full immunopanel and clinical context to distinguish ovarian primaries from mimics such as colorectal (classically CK7−/CK20+/CDX2+) and some gastric metastases that can be CK7+/CK20− [^113AjXtL] [^112c1hJL] [^116tjn9t] [^114YGJYg] [^112rCXKC] [^112D7fCE].

Ovarian cancer is typically CK7 positive [^111jyFm8] and CK20 negative (CK7+/CK20−), especially in high-grade serous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas [^113AjXtL] [^112c1hJL]. Mucinous ovarian carcinomas can be CK20 positive, but usually show CK7 positivity as well (CK7+/CK20+ or CK7+/CK20−) [^113AjXtL] [^111i6Um9]. CK7/CK20 staining helps distinguish primary ovarian tumors from metastases [^112AjUoA], but should be interpreted with clinical and histologic context [^11193xaL].

## CK7 and CK20 expression in ovarian cancer

CK7 and CK20 are intermediate filament proteins that help **identify the origin of epithelial tumors** [^112D7fCE]. CK7 is commonly expressed in ovarian, breast, lung, and endometrial carcinomas, while CK20 is typically expressed in gastrointestinal (GI) and urothelial carcinomas.

---

### CK7 expression in ovarian cancer

- **High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)**: CK7 positive [^111jyFm8] in nearly all cases [^113AjXtL].
- **Endometrioid carcinoma**: CK7 positive in most cases [^113AjXtL].
- **Clear cell carcinoma**: CK7 positive in most cases [^113AjXtL].
- **Mucinous carcinoma**: CK7 positive in most cases, though less consistently than other subtypes [^113AjXtL] [^111i6Um9].

---

### CK20 expression in ovarian cancer

- **High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)**: CK20 negative [^113AjXtL] [^112D7fCE].
- **Endometrioid carcinoma**: CK20 negative [^113AjXtL].
- **Clear cell carcinoma**: CK20 negative [^113AjXtL].
- **Mucinous carcinoma**: CK20 positive in some cases, but usually CK7 positive as well [^113AjXtL] [^111vxBBn].

## CK7/CK20 expression patterns in ovarian cancer subtypes

| **Ovarian cancer subtype** | **CK7 expression** | **CK20 expression** |
|-|-|-|
| High-grade serous carcinoma | Positive | Negative |
| Endometrioid carcinoma | Positive | Negative |
| Clear cell carcinoma | Positive | Negative |
| Mucinous carcinoma | Positive (most cases) | Positive (some cases) |

## Diagnostic utility of CK7/CK20 staining

CK7/CK20 staining is useful in **distinguishing primary ovarian tumors from metastases**, particularly those originating in the gastrointestinal tract [^114YGJYg]. Primary ovarian tumors typically exhibit a CK7+/CK20− pattern [^112D7fCE], while metastatic colorectal carcinomas usually show a CK7−/CK20+ pattern [^112AjUoA]. However, CK7/CK20 staining alone is **not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis** [^11193xaL]. It should be interpreted alongside clinical history, imaging studies, and other immunohistochemical markers such as PAX8, WT1, and CA-125 [^112AjUoA] [^112c1hJL] [^113EZZnv].

---

## Limitations and exceptions

While CK7/CK20 staining is helpful, there are **limitations and exceptions**:

- **Mucinous ovarian carcinomas**: These tumors can occasionally exhibit CK20 positivity, making it challenging to distinguish them from metastatic gastrointestinal tumors [^113AjXtL] [^111i6Um9].
- **Metastatic tumors**: Some metastatic tumors may mimic primary ovarian tumors, necessitating careful interpretation of CK7/CK20 staining results [^112AjUoA] [^11193xaL].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding CK7/CK20 expression patterns in ovarian cancer has **important clinical implications**:

- **Diagnosis**: Helps differentiate primary ovarian tumors from metastatic tumors, guiding appropriate treatment strategies [^112D7fCE].
- **Prognosis**: Certain CK7/CK20 expression patterns may be associated with specific ovarian cancer subtypes, which have different prognostic outcomes [^113AjXtL].
- **Treatment**: Accurate identification of primary versus metastatic tumors influences surgical and chemotherapeutic management decisions [^11193xaL].

Ovarian cancer is typically **CK7 positive and CK20 negative**, particularly in high-grade serous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas [^113AjXtL] [^111jyFm8]. Mucinous ovarian carcinomas can occasionally exhibit CK20 positivity, but they are usually CK7 positive as well [^111i6Um9]. CK7/CK20 staining is a valuable diagnostic tool [^112D7fCE], but it should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical, histological, and other immunohistochemical findings [^11193xaL].

### Expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 in ovarian neoplasia [^113AjXtL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

To further delineate specific staining patterns and refine the differential usefulness of cytokeratin (CK) 7/20 staining, we studied multiple ovarian tumors and primary nongynecologic neoplasms likely to metastasize to the ovary. Immunohistochemical analysis with semiquantitative grading to give quartile scores (0–4) was performed on 127 cases. Subsequent analysis indicated that a more informative diagnostic segregation could be achieved with a biphasic grading system (> 50% staining, positive; 50% or less, negative). Lower intestinal tumors were CK7- and usually CK20+, while upper gastrointestinal tumors, including those of pancreatobiliary origin, were mostly CK7+ and CK20-. Serous papillary ovarian tumors were all CK7+ and CK20-. Mucinous ovarian carcinomas were all CK7+ and slightly more often CK20-, whereas the small number of ovarian borderline mucinous tumors studied were the most problematic, with no clear pattern. Multiple different tumor types from all nonovarian gynecologic sites were fairly consistently CK7+ and almost always CK20-. Differential CK staining of mucinous tumors of the female genital tract using CK7 and CK20 is useful for predicting the site of origin, provided samples are adequate in size. The most specific usefulness is the identification of lower gastrointestinal vs "other" neoplasms.

### Morphologic and immunocytochemical features of high-grade serous carcinoma of ovary in ascitic fluid effusion and fine-needle aspiration cytology [^112c1hJL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common ovarian malignancy, and the role of cytopathology in obtaining a tissue diagnosis before the institution of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was evaluated.

- **Methods**: All histopathology-proven HGSC specimens between 2015 and 2018 with prior cytopathologic diagnosis by ascitic fluid evaluation or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the ovarian mass were reviewed with cell block immunocytochemistry for CK7, CK20, PAX8, WT1, and p53.

- **Results**: Of 288 cases of HGSC, pre-NACT cytology diagnoses were established in 32% (93/288), with specific HGSC diagnoses made on ascitic fluid in 88% (82/93) and by ovarian mass FNA in 12% (11/93). The ascitic fluid showed moderate to high cellularity with papillary clusters in 76% (71/93) of cases. Cell block immunocytochemistry showed tumor cells positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT1. p53 showed mutant or null-type positivity in 65% (33/51) and 33% (17/51) of cases, respectively, with 100% concordance with subsequent histopathology specimens. A poor to intermediate response to chemotherapy was shown in 75% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Combined assessment of cytomorphology, cell block histomorphology, and ancillary immunohistochemical testing, including PAX8, WT1, and p53, allows for specific pre-NACT diagnoses of HGSC in ascitic fluid and ovarian FNA cytology. This practice permits the initiation of chemotherapy and the diminution of disease burden prior to definitive surgical therapy.

### Metastatic neoplasms involving the ovary: A review with an emphasis on morphological and immunohistochemical features [^112AjUoA]. Histopathology (2005). Low credibility.

The ovary is a common site for metastatic tumors. In many cases of ovarian metastasis, there is a known history of malignancy. However, in other cases, the ovarian tumor is the first manifestation of the disease. This review discusses metastatic colorectal, appendiceal, gastric, breast, pancreatic, biliary tract, hepatocellular, renal, transitional, and cervical carcinomas, as well as metastatic malignant melanoma involving the ovary. The issue of synchronous ovarian and endometrial carcinomas is also addressed.

- **Peritoneal tumors**: This includes primary peritoneal carcinoma, mesothelioma, and intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor involving the ovary. A variety of other rare metastatic ovarian neoplasms are also discussed.

Many metastatic adenocarcinomas involving the ovary, especially those exhibiting mucinous differentiation, closely mimic primary ovarian adenocarcinomas. Morphologically bland areas can simulate benign and borderline cystadenoma, a phenomenon referred to as maturation. In recent years, immunohistochemistry, particularly differential cytokeratin (CK7 and CK20) staining, has been widely used to distinguish between primary and secondary ovarian adenocarcinoma.

While immunohistochemistry has a valuable role in diagnosis, especially in mucinous tumors, the results must be interpreted with caution and within the relevant clinical context. The significance of differential cytokeratin staining is not always understood by histopathologists, which can lead to misinterpretations.

### Characterization of twenty-five ovarian tumour cell lines that phenocopy primary tumours [^111jyFm8]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

The putative cells of origin of ovarian cancer include the normal ovarian surface, ovarian inclusion cysts, and fallopian tube epithelia, which are almost uniformly cytokeratin-7 (CK7) positive. In addition, a majority of inclusion cysts and fallopian tube epithelium, along with a minority of ovarian surface epithelium, are composed of CK7/PAX8 double-positive cells. This distinctive profile helps distinguish normal ovarian and fallopian tube epithelium from other tissues. Consistent with this, almost 90% of epithelial ovarian cancers are keratin 7 and/or PAX8 positive, and 70% are oestrogen receptor (ER) positive. Reassuringly, we found that the great majority of OCI lines we examined (86%) are also positive for ER, PAX8, and/or CK7 as expected.

In contrast, some SOC lines such as OV90 and TOOV-112 do not express any of the ovarian-specific markers, while others, like A2780 and ES2, express only one of the three markers we examined, raising some doubt about the differentiation state of these lines.

- **mRNA profile of OCI lines correlates with patient outcomes**: We compared the mRNA expression profile of the cell lines with primary human tumours. Clustering analysis of the OCI and SOC cell lines with 285 primary human ovarian tumour specimens reveals two distinct patient clusters: patient cluster 1, which includes only OCI lines, and patient cluster 2, which includes all of the SOC lines. The complete data set is available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE9899).

Significantly, the distribution of the cell lines within the two human tumour clusters is identical to the in vitro results.

### Expression of differentiation and proliferation related proteins in epithelium of prophylactically removed ovaries from women with a hereditary female adnexal cancer predisposition [^1175iP8q]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

To investigate the occurrence of preinvasive neoplastic lesions in ovarian surface epithelium and ovarian inclusion cyst epithelium, women with a hereditary predisposition to the development of female adnexal (ovarian and fallopian tube) carcinoma were assessed. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of differentiation and proliferation related proteins within putative sites of origin of serous ovarian carcinoma, specifically focusing on the ovarian surface epithelium and ovarian inclusion cyst epithelium.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one ovaries, prophylactically removed from 11 women predisposed to developing female adnexal cancer (cases), were compared with 22 ovaries from 11 women without such predisposition (controls). Archival histological specimens were screened for hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelial lesions. In both the ovarian surface and inclusion cyst epithelia, the percentage of cells positively stained for Ki67, p21, p27, p53, cyclin A, cyclin D1, bcl-2, and the presence of HER-2/neu, oestrogen (ER-alpha), and progesterone receptors (PR) was determined.

- **Results**: No preinvasive neoplastic lesions were detected. However, hyperplastic areas were found in three cases and four controls (NS). ER-alpha (P = 0.013), PR (P < 0.001), bcl-2 (P = 0.008), p21 (P = 0.046), and p27 (P = 0.008) were expressed in a significantly higher percentage of cells in inclusion cyst epithelium than in ovarian surface epithelium (both groups). The latter showed higher bcl-2 expression in cases (P = 0.05) compared with controls. The inclusion cyst epithelium of cases showed higher expression of bcl-2 (P = 0.006) and PR.

### Therapeutic options for mucinous ovarian carcinoma [^115ovEeb]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Mucinous ovarian carcinoma (MOC) is an uncommon ovarian cancer histotype that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy regimens. Although long overall survival outcomes can occur with early detection and optimal surgical resection, advanced disease is associated with extremely poor survival. There are no guidelines specifically for the systemic management of MOC. We analyzed data from a large cohort of women with MOC to evaluate the potential for clinical utility from a range of systemic agents.

- **Methods**: We analyzed gene copy number (n = 191) and DNA sequencing data (n = 184) from primary MOC to evaluate signatures of mismatch repair deficiency and homologous recombination deficiency, as well as other genetic events. Immunohistochemistry data were collated for ER, CK7, CK20, CDX2, HER2, PAX8, and p16 (n = 117–166).

- **Results**: Molecular aberrations noted in MOC that suggest a match with targeted therapies include amplification of ERBB2 (26.7%) and BRAF mutation (9%). Observed genetic events that suggest potential efficacy for agents currently in clinical trials include KRAS/NRAS mutations (66%), TP53 missense mutation (49%), RNF43 mutation (11%), ARID1A mutation (10%), and PIK3CA/PTEN mutation (9%). Therapies exploiting homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may not be effective in MOC, as only 1 out of 191 had a high HRD score. Mismatch repair deficiency was similarly rare (1 out of 184).

- **Conclusions**: Although genetically diverse, MOC has several potential therapeutic targets. Importantly, there is a lack of response to platinum-based therapies.

### Panels of immunohistochemical markers help determine primary sites of metastatic adenocarcinoma [^112D7fCE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although identification of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma has a profound clinical impact, diagnosing the organ of origin is frequently difficult. Because none of the individual immunohistochemical markers used for tissue identification are both site-specific and sensitive, multiple markers are needed to improve the prediction of primary sites.

To develop an effective approach to immunohistochemically evaluate metastatic adenocarcinoma for the assignment of a likely primary site of origin, expression profiles of CDX2, cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC2, MUC5AC, SMAD4, estrogen receptor (ER), and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) were generated in adenocarcinomas from 7 primary sites. This was followed by the construction of a decision tree and the design of multiple-marker panels. Expression of these markers was evaluated immunohistochemically in 314 primary adenocarcinomas (50 cases each of colorectal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, bile duct, and breast, and 14 cases of ovarian origin) using the tissue array method. Results were validated using 60 cases of metastatic adenocarcinoma with known primaries.

- **Results**: Organ-specific immunostaining profiles using multiple markers provided high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value in detecting primary adenocarcinomas, as follows: colorectal, TTF-1-/CDX2+/CK7-/CK20+ or TTF-1-/CDX2+/CK7-/CK20-/(CEA+ or MUC2+); ovarian, CK7+/MUC5AC+/TTF-1-/CDX2-/CEA-/GCDFP-15-; breast, GCDFP-15+/TTF-1-/CDX.

### Potential markers that complement expression of CA125 in epithelial ovarian cancer [^1128qhq4]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

When ovarian carcinoma is diagnosed in stage I, up to 90% of patients can be cured with surgery and currently available chemotherapy. At present, less than 25% of cases are diagnosed at this stage. To increase the fraction of ovarian cancers detected at an early stage, screening strategies have been devised that utilize a rising serum CA125 level to trigger the performance of transvaginal sonography. One limitation of CA125 as an initial step in such a screening strategy is that up to 20% of ovarian cancers lack expression of the antigen. Serum tumor markers that can be detected in ovarian cancers that lack CA125 expression might improve the sensitivity for early detection.

- **Methods**: From 296 ovarian cancers, 65 (22%) were found to have weak or absent CA125 expression on immunoperoxidase staining. Tissue expression of CA125 was compared to serum CA125 levels. Using immunoperoxidase staining of tissue arrays, we have assessed expression of 10 potential serum tumor markers in the 65 epithelial ovarian cancers with little or no CA125 expression and in ovarian cystadenomas, tumors of low malignant potential, normal ovaries, and 16 other normal tissues.

- **Results**: Low or absent expression of CA125 in surgical specimens of epithelial ovarian cancer was associated with low levels of serum CA125 in pre-operative serum specimens. In ovarian cancers that lacked CA125, all specimens (100%) expressed human kallikrein 10 (HK10), human kallikrein 6 (HK6), osteopontin (OPN), and claudin 3. A smaller fraction of CA125-deficient ovarian cancers expressed DF3 (95%), vascular endot…

### Pax8 expression in ovarian surface epithelial cells [^113EZZnv]. Human Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is usually diagnosed at a late stage and is associated with a poor prognosis. Understanding early-stage disease biology is essential in developing clinical biomarkers to detect HGSOC earlier. While recent studies indicate that HGSOCs arise from fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells, a considerable body of evidence suggests that HGSOC can also arise from ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSECs). PAX8 is overexpressed in HGSOCs and expressed in fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells, but there are conflicting reports about PAX8 expression in OSECs.

The purposes of this study were to comprehensively characterize PAX8 expression in a large series of OSECs and to investigate the role of PAX8 in early HGSOC development. PAX8 protein expression was analyzed in the OSECs of 27 normal ovaries and 7 primary OSEC cultures using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent cytochemistry. PAX8 messenger RNA expression was quantified in 66 primary OSEC cultures. Cellular transformation was evaluated in OSECs expressing a PAX8 construct. PAX8 was expressed by 44% to 71% of OSECs. Calretinin and E-cadherin were frequently coexpressed with PAX8.

Expression of PAX8 in OSECs decreased cellular migration (P = 0.028), but had no other effects on cellular transformation. In addition, PAX8 expression was significantly increased (P = 0.003) in an in vitro stepwise model of neoplastic transformation. In conclusion, PAX8 is frequently expressed by OSECs, and endogenous levels of PAX8 expression are non-transforming. These data indicate that in OSECs, PAX8 expression is prevalent yet not inherently transformative.

### Non-epithelial ovarian cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116EgqXV]. Annals of Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ovarian cancer, particularly in patients with non-epithelial ovarian cancer, the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend offering bleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin for 3 cycles or carboplatin/paclitaxel for 6 cycles as postoperative chemotherapy. This applies particularly to the management of recurrent disease in patients with sex cord-stromal tumors.

### Differentiation of ovarian mucinous carcinoma and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma by immunostaining with beta-catenin [^116tjn9t]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

To investigate whether localization of beta-catenin is helpful in differentiating primary ovarian mucinous carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the ovary, it is important to note that extra-ovarian cancers which metastasize to the ovaries, especially from colorectal adenocarcinoma, frequently mimic primary ovarian carcinomas, particularly endometrioid and mucinous types. Distinguishing primary ovarian carcinoma from metastatic colorectal carcinoma is crucial for both therapeutic and prognostic reasons. Even after thorough histological examination, metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas are often mistaken for primary ovarian adenocarcinomas. Although some tumor markers have been advocated and are helpful in most cases, sometimes the distinction between primary mucinous carcinoma and metastatic colorectal carcinoma remains a problem. Activation of Wnt signaling through mutations of APC or beta-catenin is a key event in the development of colorectal cancer. These mutations lead to nuclear localization of beta-catenin, which can be demonstrated immunohistochemically.

- **Methods and results**: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 43 primary ovarian mucinous carcinomas and 23 metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas were included in this study. Sections were immunostained with antibodies to beta-catenin, cytokeratin (CK)7, CK20, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Nuclear localization of beta-catenin was found in 83% (19/23) of metastatic colorectal cancers and 9% (4/43) of ovarian mucinous carcinomas. Ovarian mucinous carcinomas were usually positive for CK7 (34/43, 79%).

Each year in the United States, over 15,000 women die of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and 22,000 are diagnosed with the disease. The incidence of ovarian cancer has remained stable over the past decade; however, survival rates have improved steadily. Increases in survival rates can be attributed to advances in surgical management, the development of effective cytotoxic drugs, and the route of administration of chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer survival rates could also be improved through screening and early detection.

Disappointingly, effective screening methods have not been established and remain elusive. Historically, the goal of a screening test was to achieve a positive predictive value (PPV) greater than 10% to be considered cost-effective and have an acceptable risk for the population being screened. Despite the inability of currently available screening algorithms to achieve the desired PPV, there may be an advantage in producing a stage migration to lower stages at the time of diagnosis, thus resulting in improved survival.

Equally important, recent studies have demonstrated that women who have their initial surgery performed by gynecologic oncologists and women who have their surgeries at centers experienced in the treatment of ovarian cancer have higher survival rates. For these reasons, it is essential that all women at high risk for ovarian cancer receive their initial care from gynecologic oncologists and at centers with multidisciplinary teams experienced in the optimal care of ovarian cancer patients.

### Cytokeratin and CD30 expression in dysgerminoma [^114rDgqy]. Human Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Dysgerminoma is a malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary that shares morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic features with its testicular counterpart, seminoma. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that seminoma can differentiate into non-seminomatous germ cell tumor types. The progression of these tumors can be measured by their acquisition of the potential to express cytokeratin intermediate filaments, a characteristic specific to epithelial differentiation. Although testicular seminomas have been widely investigated, little is known about cytokeratin or E-cadherin expression in dysgerminomas.

We investigated 26 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ovarian dysgerminomas with immunohistochemical stains for CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, high-molecular-weight keratin, and E-cadherin. In addition, we investigated the CD30 and vimentin immunoreactivity of these tumors. Immunoreactivity for CAM5.2 and for AE1/AE3 was present in more than 10% of neoplastic cells in 5 (19.2%) of 26 cases and in 2 (7.7%) of 26 cases, respectively. Cytokeratin 7 showed only focal positivity and never showed positive staining in greater than 10% of dysgerminoma cells. E-cadherin staining was positive in 2 cases showing weak membranous immunostaining in more than 10% of cells. Vimentin immunoreactivity was observed in only 2 dysgerminomas, both of which had less than 10% of the neoplastic cells staining. Cytokeratin 20, epithelial membrane antigen, high-molecular-weight keratin, and CD30 were consistently negative in all cases.

### Microenvironmental niche divergence shapes BRCA1-dysregulated ovarian cancer morphological plasticity [^113xErdJ]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

We then estimated CK7, CD3, and SMA positivity and calculated their spatial correlation with cancer, lymphocyte, and stroma ratios estimated from the H&Es, respectively. We observed a positive spatial correlation between CK7 and cancer ratio (average Pearson corr = 0.74 (± 0.03)) calculated from 7 IHC samples. Similarly, we observed a positive spatial correlation between CD3 positivity and lymphocyte (average Pearson corr = 0.67 (± 0.09)) calculated from 7 IHC samples. Lastly, we observed a positive spatial correlation between SMA positivity and stroma ratio (average Pearson corr = 0.70 (± 0.06)) calculated from 7 IHC samples. The lowest correlation was observed between lymphocyte and CD3 as expected, since only a subset of lymphocytes were T cells. Because the CD20 stain was largely negative across all these samples, and CD8 was mainly used to confirm its presence among CD3 + cells, we did not use them for quantitative analysis.

- **Spatial analysis of tumor morphology**: Spatial partitioning of tumor sections into tumor regions was achieved using Voronoi tessellation. Because Voronoi tessellation mimics naturally emerged patterns, it is particularly useful for studies of ecology, and we have recently demonstrated its applicability in histology analysis. Randomly selected cancer cells were used as seeds to create polygons that contain all their closest neighbors. Let K be a set containing all cancer cells, and let (C k) k ∈ K be the coordinates of a cancer cell k. A Voronoi region R k generated by cancer cell C k contains all cells P that are (1) not seeds and…

### European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) guidelines for ovarian cancer surgery [^114Ym4rX]. International Journal of Gynecological Cancer (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ovarian cancer, specifically in the context of advanced disease and primary cytoreductive surgery, the ESGO 2017 guidelines recommend viewing the risk-benefit ratio as favorable for primary surgery in patients with stage III-IV OC under the following criteria:

- **No unresectable tumor extent**.

- **Complete debulking feasibility**: Complete debulking to no residual tumor seems feasible with reasonable morbidity, taking into consideration the patient's status. Decisions should be individualized based on multiple parameters. Examples of potentially resectable extra-abdominal disease include inguinal or axillary lymph nodes, retrocrural or paracardiac nodes, focal parietal pleural involvement, and isolated parenchymal lung metastases. Examples of resectable intra-abdominal parenchymal metastases include splenic metastases, capsular liver metastases, and a single deep liver metastasis, depending on the location.

- **Acceptance of supportive measures**: The patient accepts potential supportive measures such as blood transfusions or stoma.

### Atypical sigmoid metastasis from a high-grade mixed adenocarcinoma of the ovary [^116tiP2V]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Intraperitoneal seeding is the most common form of dissemination of epithelial ovarian cancer. Metastasis to the bowel mucosa can occur by invasion from the serosal surface or infiltration of the submucosal capillary network. Hematogenous dissemination usually occurs in the presence of advanced peritoneal disease.

A 39-year-old gravida 3 para 2 woman was diagnosed in October 2000 with a large pelvic mass. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy with multiple abdominal and pelvic biopsies. She was diagnosed with an ovarian tumor of low malignant potential, and no further treatment was recommended. Six months later, she developed abdominal discomfort and constipation. A colonoscopy was performed, and a biopsy showed metastatic carcinoma of ovarian origin.

The patient presented to The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in September 2001 for consultation. The surgical pathology evaluation from her previous surgery indicated high-grade ovarian carcinoma. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, right pelvic lymph node sampling, and segmental resection with primary end-to-end sigmoid colon anastomosis.

The tumor within the colon was a polypoid mass arising from the mucosa with no involvement of the colonic wall. Microscopically, the tumor was a high-grade ovarian papillary serous carcinoma with areas of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The colonic tumor was immunohistochemically positive for cytokeratin-7 and negative for cytokeratin-20.

### WT1 is an integral component of an antibody panel to distinguish pancreaticobiliary and some ovarian epithelial neoplasms [^111vxBBn]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We investigated whether a panel of antibodies, including WT1, could differentiate between pancreaticobiliary and ovarian carcinomas by applying these antibodies to 64 pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas, 41 ovarian serous carcinomas, and 12 primary ovarian mucinous neoplasms. The panel included WT1, cytokeratin (CK) 17, CK20, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA-125. A positive result was defined as moderate or strong intensity reactivity in more than 25% of cells.

Of the ovarian serous carcinomas, 38 (93%) were WT1 reactive, with 22 (54%) testing WT1 positive. Additionally, 9 (22%) had CK20 reactivity and 3 (7%) were CK20 positive in fewer than 50% of cells. All ovarian serous carcinomas were CK17 or CEA nonreactive. Meanwhile, all ovarian mucinous neoplasms were nonreactive for WT1 and CK17. Among these, 11 (92%) were reactive for CEA, with 8 (67%) testing positive for CEA, 10 (83%) reactive for CK20, and 6 (50%) positive for CK20.

For pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas, 19 (30%) tested CK20 positive, 27 (42%) CK17 positive, and 52 (81%) CEA positive. None were WT1 reactive. A panel including WT1, CK17, CK20, and CEA proves useful in distinguishing between pancreaticobiliary and ovarian serous carcinomas. Extensive CK17 reactivity suggests pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinoma, particularly when the differential diagnosis includes ovarian mucinous neoplasm. None of the antibodies were effective in positively identifying ovarian mucinous neoplasms.

### Immunohistochemical biomarkers of value in distinguishing primary ovarian carcinoma from gastric carcinoma: A systematic review with statistical meta-analysis [^115VkM6N]. Histopathology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to compare the relative risk of antigen expression being detected immunohistochemically in ovarian and gastric carcinoma, aggregated from studies performed for diagnostic purposes, with the relative risks of their expression in all patients in the English literature.

- **Methods and results**: Both types of series indicated that cytokeratin (CK) 7 expression was greater, and that of CK20 and carcinoembryonic antigen was less in ovarian than in gastric carcinoma (P < 0.05). Synthesis of all data available for MUC-2 suggested it was more commonly expressed in ovarian carcinoma, whereas the relative risk in papers that directly compared its expression suggested that it was more common in gastric carcinoma (P = 0.2, NS). Aggregating all possible data suggested villin was more likely to be expressed in ovarian cancers, whereas studies in which its expression was compared directly in both tumors suggested the opposite. Although statistically significant, patient numbers were small.

- **Conclusion**: Provided sufficient numbers of cases are studied, analysis of studies comparing antigen expression for diagnostic purposes in tumors from two body sites is likely to be supported in the wider literature. The design of such comparative studies is informed by aggregating data from single tumor studies.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer: The role of cytology in pretreatment diagnosis [^116fDcbH]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the role of cytology in the pretreatment evaluation of women with clinical findings consistent with ovarian cancer who are being considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

- **Methods**: Pretreatment cytology slides were available for review from 60 of 72 consecutive patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy who were believed to have ovarian cancer based on clinical findings. Fifty of the 72 patients had evidence of both intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal tumor spread prior to treatment. Fifty-three of 66 patients had CA125 values > 500 U/mL, with 34 being > 1500 U/mL. Pretreatment cytology was compared to surgical specimens obtained following chemotherapy.

- **Results**: Cytologic findings were consistent with ovarian cancer in 55 patients, not consistent with ovarian cancer in 4 cases, and insufficient for diagnosis in one case. Forty-seven of the 60 patients underwent surgery. Forty-two of 43 patients with cytology consistent with ovarian cancer had epithelial ovarian cancers at surgery, while one had no pathologic evidence of disease. Three of the 4 patients thought not to have cytology consistent with ovarian cancer underwent surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy; two had ovarian epithelial cancers, and one had a mesonephric adenocarcinoma. The one patient with cytology insufficient for diagnosis also had an epithelial ovarian cancer at diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Cytology proved to be extremely helpful in supporting the clinical impression of apparent advanced ovarian cancer. When the cytologic diagnosis does not match the clinical presentation, it may require further investigation or reevaluation to confirm the diagnosis.

### Metastatic malignancies to the ovaries [^11193xaL]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

A significant proportion of malignant neoplasms involving the ovary, ranging from 5% to 30%, are metastatic. Various neoplasms, originating from sites such as the colorectum, endometrium, breast, appendix, stomach, and cervix, can metastasize to the ovary.

- **Objective**: To summarize the clinical, gross, and histologic features that aid in distinguishing primary ovarian neoplasms from metastatic neoplasms. Additionally, to discuss the immunohistochemical features that help identify the primary site of origin.

- **Data sources**: Sources include a literature review and cases identified from the authors' practice.

- **Conclusions**: Numerous features assist in differentiating primary ovarian neoplasms from metastatic lesions. The patient's clinical symptoms and history may suggest the primary site. On radiology, the absence of ascites is indicative of metastasis. Laboratory tests, such as cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), are useful in distinguishing primary from metastatic neoplasms. Gross features favoring metastasis include bilaterality and small tumor size. Metastatic lesions often exhibit multinodular growth and involve the surface or superficial cortex. Histologic features favoring metastasis include a nodular or infiltrative pattern, stromal desmoplasia, hilar involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and an absence of benign or borderline components. The presence of extracellular mucin and signet ring cells also suggests metastasis. Distinct histologic features can indicate the primary site. Immunohistochemical stains, such as cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, and SATB homeobox, are informative.

### Unusual lesion on the vulva of a postmenopausal woman [^117XzbLQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Which immunohistochemical marker is useful to distinguish between the primary and secondary forms of EMPD?
	- A. CK7
	- B. CK14
	- C. CK20
	- D. S100
	- E. p63

- **Answers**:
	- A. CK7 – Incorrect. In general, CK7 staining is often positive in the primary form of EMPD; however, it may be positive in EMPD secondary to underlying urothelial carcinoma.
	- B. CK14 – Incorrect. CK14 staining is negative in both primary and secondary EMPD.
	- C. CK20 – Correct. CK20 staining is positive in the majority of patients with the secondary form of EMPD with underlying gastrointestinal or genitourinary adenocarcinoma and, conspicuously, negative in the primary form. Therefore, CK20 can help identify the subset of patients with a guarded prognosis.
	- D. S100 – Incorrect. S100 is negative in EMPD and helps to differentiate it from melanoma in situ (S100+).
	- E. p63 – Incorrect. p63 is a marker of squamous cell differentiation and is useful to distinguish EMPD (p63−) from pagetoid Bowen disease (p63+).

### Multivariate analysis of the prognostic significance of DNA-ploidy and S-phase fraction in ovarian cancer determined by flow cytometry following detection of cytokeratin-labeled tumor cells [^1168nkwt]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The outcome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer is poor despite aggressive therapy, including surgery and multiagent chemotherapy. Valid prognostic factors are necessary to estimate the course of the disease and to define biologically similar subgroups for the analysis of therapeutic efficacy.

This study is the first published prospective study concerning the prognostic significance of DNA-ploidy and S-phase fraction in ovarian cancer following the enrichment of tumor cells by cytokeratin labeling. Epithelial cells were labeled by FITC-conjugated cytokeratin antibody (CK 5, 6, 8, and 17) prior to flow cytometric cell cycle analysis in 129 fresh specimens of primary ovarian cancer.

Recurrence-free survival of patients with DNA-diploid primary ovarian cancer was significantly better compared to that of patients with DNA-aneuploid tumors in the univariate analysis (47% vs. 18%, P = 0.01). The tumor-dependent overall survival of patients with DNA-diploid tumors was 57% compared to 30% with DNA-aneuploid tumors (P = 0.04). In FIGO stage III ovarian cancer, DNA-ploidy, optimized by cytokeratin gating for tumor cells, achieved independent prognostic significance. No significance was found for S-phase fraction. However, despite convincing methodological advantages in the detection of DNA-aneuploid subpopulations, the clinical significance of cytokeratin gating of epithelial cells was only marginal.

DNA-ploidy has been shown to be as powerful or even more so in comparison to postoperative residual tumor in multivariate analysis for predicting clinical outcomes.

### Cellular origins of mucinous ovarian carcinoma [^111i6Um9]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Low credibility.

One of the important issues in the diagnosis of MOC, particularly in higher‐stage (III/IV) disease, can be the misclassification of primary disease versus metastases that involve the ovaries but have arisen from other sites. The most common primary mucinous tumors that metastasize to the ovary include the lower gastrointestinal tract (colon/appendix; ~45%), upper gastrointestinal tract (pancreas/stomach/biliary; 20%), and uterus (cervix/endometrium; 18%). Sometimes, the ovarian tumor is the initial presentation. In this setting, characteristics of the tumor presentation can aid diagnosis. Stage I, primary MOC is more likely to have a tumor size greater than 10 cm (mean 20 cm) and show unilateral involvement (79%), whereas metastases to the ovary from elsewhere tend to be smaller (mean 7–10.6 cm), present in both ovaries, and display a nodular infiltrative growth pattern with ovarian surface involvement. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines suggest routine abdominal imaging and upper and lower endoscopy to rule out a gastrointestinal primary as well as measuring CEA and CA19‐9 levels. An observation that strongly favors a primary MOC is an associated teratoma, while signet ring cells (Krukenberg tumor) strongly favor a gastrointestinal (usually gastric) origin.

Immunohistochemical panels can also aid the diagnosis of primary compared to metastatic MOC. Markers that most efficiently distinguish ovarian from lower gastrointestinal metastases (with an accuracy of 95%) are CK7 and SATB2. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are especially challenging.

### Expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 in primary carcinomas of the stomach and colorectum and their value in the differential diagnosis of metastatic carcinomas to the ovary [^112rCXKC]. Human Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The expressions of cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 have been studied in various primary and metastatic carcinomas, and their determination may help distinguish the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. However, little is known about the factors that determine variations in their expression patterns in primary gastric and colorectal carcinomas. We investigated the expressions of CK7 and CK20 in 289 cases of gastric carcinoma and 225 cases of colorectal carcinoma using a tissue microarray. To evaluate CK7 and CK20 expression patterns of ovarian metastases from gastric or colorectal carcinomas, 54 cases of metastatic carcinomas to the ovary were examined.

It was found that 71% (207 of 289) of the gastric carcinomas stained positively for CK7, whereas only 9% (21 of 225) of the colorectal carcinomas proved to be CK7 positive and that 41% (117 of 289) of the gastric carcinomas and 73% (165 of 225) of the colorectal carcinomas were CK20 positive. The proportion of CK7+/CK20- was highest in the gastric carcinomas at 46% (132 of 289), and was independent of the histologic classification of Lauren (46% of the intestinal type, 45% of the diffuse type). The CK7 and CK20 expression patterns were different in colorectal carcinomas according to the histologic grade and location of the tumor. CK7-/CK20+ had the greatest proportion (68%) in colorectal carcinomas, and this was dependent on the tumor's histologic grade (75% of low-grade versus 52% of high-grade) and location (46% of right-sided versus 76% of left-sided). Moreover, 42% (18 of 43) of gastric carcinomas metastatic to the ovary were CK7+/CK20-.

### Violaceous nodules in a patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma [^1115idBT]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which immunohistochemical findings support the endometrial origin of metastasis?

- **A. CK 7 +, CK20 −, ER/PR +, CEA +** — Incorrect. This immunohistochemical profile is typical of breast adenocarcinoma. While both breast and endometrial carcinomas are CK 7 +, CK20 −, and ER/PR +, breast carcinoma can be differentiated by CEA, mammoglobin, and gross cystic disease fluid protein expression.

- **B. CK 7 +, CK20 −, ER/PR +, CEA −, WT1 +** — Incorrect. This immunohistochemical profile is seen in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma. While both ovarian and endometrial adenocarcinomas are CK7 +, CK20 −, ER/PR +, and CEA −, ovarian carcinoma can be differentiated by WT1 and mesothelin positivity.

- **C. CK 7 +, CK20 −, ER/PR +, CEA −, vimentin +** — Correct. While there are no specific antibody stains for endometrial adenocarcinoma, immunohistochemistry can support an endometrial origin and exclude more common sources of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Endometrial adenocarcinoma is CK7 + and ER/PR + but CK20 −. CEA, GATA-3, and CDX2 are negative in endometrial adenocarcinoma. CEA is overexpressed in gastrointestinal, lung, and breast carcinomas, and GATA-3 is sensitive and specific for breast and urothelial carcinomas. CDX2 is frequently expressed by intestinal tumors.

### Proteomic characterization of epithelial ovarian cancer delineates molecular signatures and therapeutic targets in distinct histological subtypes [^1132c9nj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Obtaining a fresh specimen involves several critical steps. Cut small blocks of tissue, 1 cm x 2 cm x 0.4 cm, and place them in a histological/tissue processing cassette. Caution is advised: (1) The ovarian tissue should be removed gently by an expert gynecologist to avoid trauma; (2) The specimen must not dry out prior to fixation; (3) Avoid contaminating fresh specimens with foreign chemicals or substances such as disinfectants; (4) Each specimen should be properly identified, and details such as name and pathology number must be recorded as soon as possible; (5) Fixation should always be carried out promptly. If a specimen must remain unfixed for a short period, it should be refrigerated at 4 °C.

For fixation, add 20× the tissue volume of 10% neutral formalin. Take the following precautions: (1) Ensure the specimen is placed in formalin, which will slowly penetrate the tissue, causing chemical and physical changes that harden and preserve it, protecting it against subsequent processing steps; (2) Use an adequate volume of fixative (a ratio of at least 20:1) in a container of appropriate size to prevent distortion of the specimen and ensure good quality fixation; (3) Specimens should remain in fixative long enough to allow it to penetrate every part and for the chemical reactions of fixation to reach equilibrium. Generally, this means the specimen should fix between 6 and 48 hours.

Dehydration is necessary because melted paraffin wax is hydrophobic (immiscible with water), so most of the water in a specimen must be removed before proceeding.

### Tubular carcinoids of the appendix: The CK7/CK20 immunophenotype can be a diagnostic pitfall [^1168mSCT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Tubular carcinoid is a rare variant of appendiceal well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumour. Although considered benign lesions, the small infiltrating tubules that characterise the tumour may raise concern for metastatic adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, the cytokeratin 7 (CK7)/cytokeratin 20 (CK20) expression profile of these neoplasms remains unexplored.

- **Methods**: The authors characterised the CK7/CK20 immunophenotype and Ki-67 expression of the eight available tubular carcinoids seen at their institution from 1991 to 2011.

- **Results**: CK7 and CK20 staining was variable, ranging from none to focal staining for either or both CK7 and CK20, to diffuse expression of CK7 or CK20.

- **Conclusions**: The CK7/CK20 expression profile is of limited value when the differential diagnosis includes primary tubular carcinoid and well-differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. In such cases, careful attention to the location of the neoplasm, mitotic count, and presence or absence of an associated classic carcinoid component are more useful for arriving at the correct diagnosis.

### Guideline no. 403: Initial investigation and management of adnexal masses [^1129NDzc]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, more specifically with respect to tumor markers, the SOGC 2020 guidelines recommend acknowledging that CA-125 is a nonspecific glycoprotein. It can be elevated in both benign and malignant gynecologic conditions as well as non-gynecologic conditions. It should be recognized that only half of all patients with early-stage ovarian cancer (OC) and 80% of patients with advanced-stage OC exhibit elevated CA-125 levels.

### A living biobank of ovarian cancer ex vivo models reveals profound mitotic heterogeneity [^114YtzTK]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

To determine whether the OCMs possess the expected hallmarks of ovarian cancer, we characterised the cultures using an array of molecular cell biological approaches (Fig. 1b). Tumour and stromal fractions were morphologically differentiated, with the epithelial appearance of the tumour cells contrasting the fibroblastic stromal cells (Fig. 2a). Time-lapse microscopy and Ki67 expression confirmed both fractions were proliferative, and the veracity of the separation workflow was confirmed with immunological markers and p53 profiling (Supplementary Figs. 1a and 2a). Tumour cells were typically positive for PAX8, EpCAM, and CA125, and failed to elicit a functional p53 response upon Mdm2 inhibition. Consistently, tumour cells expressed p53 mutants and frequently overexpressed MYC. Some tumour cells, however, were negative for one or more tumour markers despite harbouring TP53 mutations, possibly reflecting tumour heterogeneity and/or epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In light of these exceptions, tumour cultures were defined as such if they had an epithelial morphology, expressed PAX8, EpCAM and/or CA125, and/or had a TP53 mutation, while stromal cells were defined as having a fibroblastic morphology, strong vimentin staining, and wild-type TP53.

### Expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 in carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract [^114YGJYg]. Histopathology (2003). Low credibility.

The differential expression of cytokeratin (CK) 7 and 20 by carcinomas may assist in determining the primary site of a metastatic tumor. The aim of this study was to extend the published data on CK7 and CK20 expression in epithelial neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract by considering the degree of differentiation and including some unusual neoplasms.

- **Methods and results**: Cases referred to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology were studied prospectively for immunohistochemical expression of CK7 and CK20. Lesions from 105 patients were analyzed. Adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract were positive for both CK7 and CK20 in 78% of cases, with only poorly differentiated lesions being CK7 negative. Well-differentiated and moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas of the large intestine, including the appendix, were CK7-/CK20+ in the great majority of cases, as were goblet cell carcinoids. However, half of the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas exhibited aberrant expression, as did most of the mixed goblet cell carcinoid/adenocarcinomas. All five high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas were negative for both CK7 and CK20.

- **Conclusions**: Not only the site but also the grade and histological type of a gastrointestinal carcinoma should be considered when assessing cytokeratin phenotype.

### Reliability of PAX8 in clinical practice to accurately determine primary site of origin in female pelvic or abdominal lesions [^114XLuF4]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Female patients with gynecological malignancies can harbor peritoneal pelvic or abdominal lesions, however, other primary tumors can involve the peritoneum as well. Since sampling of the peritoneum can now be easily performed by fine needle aspiration or percutaneous biopsy, we have noticed an increase in such procedures as initial attempts to establish a diagnosis. PAX8 has been used alone or in combination with other tumor markers to accurately classify these lesions and determine the primary site of origin. However, prior published studies determined the expression of PAX8 within historically diagnosed cases. We reviewed the reliability of PAX8 to determine tumor type or primary site in 135 clinical pelvic or abdominal lesions and highlight several pitfalls in its routine use. In particular, we examined the reliance on the presumed expression pattern (positive or negative) within a given primary tumor, noting that poorly differentiated endometrial endometrioid carcinomas or undifferentiated carcinomas may have patchy PAX8 expression or even lose expression within the primary tumor or the metastasis.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^116pTvA1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

With some exceptions, ovarian cancer is generally a disease of older age, with more than 88% of cases diagnosed after age 45 years. For children and young adults, the incidence of malignant ovarian cancer of any type is very low. Girls and young women aged 0–14 years, 15–19 years, and 20–24 years have incidences of only 3.7, 13.7, and 17.3 cases per 1,000,000 females, respectively. Overall incidence of ovarian cancer increases over a woman's lifetime, peaking in the seventh decade of life, with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years. The age at peak incidence varies significantly by histologic type; for germ-cell ovarian cancers, it is in the second decade of life; for sex cord–stromal ovarian cancers, it is in the sixth decade; for epithelial ovarian cancers, peak incidence occurs in the seventh and eighth decades.

No specific diet has been consistently associated with increases or decreases in the risk of ovarian cancer. Data do not show an increased risk of ovarian cancer with alcohol use. Although a number of reviews and individual studies of obesity and the risk of ovarian cancer have shown an association, results have been inconsistent, possibly because of unmeasured obesity-related confounding risk factors. Increased physical activity has been associated with decreased risk of ovarian cancer, and inactivity has been associated with increased risk. The strongest data supporting an inverse association between physical activity and the risk of ovarian cancer come from case–control studies.

### Cytokeratin 5/6 expression, prognosis, and association with estrogen receptor α in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma [^1159wGRJ]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma remains one of the most lethal malignancies in women. For histopathologic differentiation from mesothelioma, cytokeratin 5/6 immunohistochemistry is widely used. Another preferred marker for differential diagnosis to mesothelioma is estrogen receptor α (ER-α). In this study, we determined the rate of cytokeratin 5/6-positive cells in primary high-grade serous carcinoma.

A cohort of 215 patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma was evaluated immunohistochemically for the protein expression of cytokeratin 5/6. Most tumors demonstrated at least partly positive results for cytokeratin 5/6 (n = 148; 68.3%), showing different staining patterns from scattered stained cells to a diffuse staining, at times with a distinctive tumor-stroma border motif. Sixty-seven patients (31%) were entirely negative. No correlation of cytokeratin immunoreactivity score (IRS) with conventional staging parameters could be demonstrated. From the different IRS values for cytokeratin 5/6, IRS = 12 (n = 6; 2.9%) seemed to indicate a worse prognosis, albeit not statistically significant.

An association with ER-α expression could not be detected; however, the combination of cytokeratin 5/6 IRS = 12 and ER-α negativity resulted in a significant negative prognostic marker (overall survival: P = 0.003 and progression-free survival: p < 0.0001). We substantiate cytokeratin 5/6 protein expression as a frequent feature of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with various staining patterns, an important fact for the routine differential diagnosis with mesothelioma.

### Molecular characteristics of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors and comparison with testicular counterparts: Implications for pathogenesis [^111co81W]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Additional proteins have also been tested with limited success as biomarkers for YST, including keratin type II cytoskeletal 7 (used to differentiate between primary and metastatic ovarian adenocarcinomas) and epithelial membrane antigen (previously tested in TGCT). Most recently, however, glypican-3 (GPC3) has emerged as a contender. Our summary revealed GPC3 to be more often expressed in YSTs compared with DGs, albeit small sample sizes (P = 3 × 10−3) (Figure 5 A). In studies including both ovarian and testicular YSTs as well as other GCT subtypes, GPC3 is shown to have higher sensitivity than AFP. However, the specificity for YST is still disputed because GPC3 is also reported to stain, albeit mostly focally, other GCT types, including EC, teratoma, SS, and syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Interestingly, in the identification of hepatocellular carcinoma, higher sensitivity and specificity has been shown for serum GPC3 than for AFP, which raises the possibility of a similar noninvasive test for YST — of particular interest for monitoring patients for relapse.

The two other proteins more frequently expressed in YSTs than in DGs, again with the caveat of small sample numbers, were γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 1 (GGT1) (P = 1 × 10−4) and the epithelial staining antibody mixture AE1/AE3, which recognizes most acidic and all basic cytokeratins (P = 3 × 10−5) (Figure 5 A). GGT1 was studied to ascertain the extent of expression in GCT and clinical response, because it has been found to be essential for the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin in animal models; however, its activity was not required for the nephrotoxicity observed in clinical settings.

### Detection of tumor circulating cells by cytokeratin-20 in the blood of patients with granulosa cell tumors [^117JeWQu]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Cytokeratins (CKs) are constituents of the intermediate filaments of epithelial cells and are expressed in various combinations depending on the epithelial type and the degree of differentiation. Utilizing the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, we have previously demonstrated that cytokeratin-20 (CK-20), the most recently discovered cytokeratin, is expressed in endometrial carcinoma tumors, blood, and lymph nodes with micrometastases of patients treated for endometrial carcinomas. However, CK-20 expression could not be demonstrated in the endometrium of patients with benign diseases, in peripheral blood, in lymph nodes of healthy subjects, or in normal blood cells. The aim of this study was to examine whether CK-20 expression in blood can be used as a biomarker for the detection of the dissemination of malignant cells in patients treated for granulosa cell tumors (GCTs).

- **Methods**: In this study, we used RT-PCR to determine the expression of CK-20 in the following groups: (i) blood of patients (n = 14) treated for GCTs, (ii) GCT samples (n = 4), (iii) lymph nodes (n = 2) of patients treated for GCTs, (iv) blood from subjects with benign sex-cord-stromal tumors (n = 2), (v) normal ovaries of two menstruating women (n = 4), (vi) tumor specimens of epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs) (n = 14), and (vii) blood samples (n = 18) and lymph nodes (n = 11) of healthy women.

- **Results**: In Group I, CK-20 was positive in the blood in 86% (12/14) of the patients. In Group II, CK-20 was positive in 100% (4/4) of the GCT samples. In Group III, CK-2

### Yolk sac ovarian cancer with mesenteric metastases [^111mFLiY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Immunohistochemistry is a valuable tool for validating the diagnosis of YST. AFP, cytokeratin pan, sal-like protein 4, placental alkaline phosphatase, and glypican-3 are the predominant immunohistochemical markers in YSTs. It is particularly advantageous to differentiate YST from clear cell cancer. The identification of germ cell tumours necessitates the use of certain serum tumour markers.

Serum AFP plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of YSTs. AFP is a glycoprotein typically synthesized by the yolk sac of the developing fetus. It is also derived from the yolk sac or embryonic carcinoma components of germ cell carcinomas. Elevated serum AFP levels are frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, liver inflammation caused by cirrhosis or hepatitis, and embryonic tumours. Serum AFP levels are high in over 90% of YSTs. In our case, AFP levels increased to 103.488 ng/mL. Serum AFP serves as a marker to assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy and predict the prognosis of YSTs. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network advises that patients who have successfully finished the clinical programme should undergo regular monitoring of AFP levels for two years.
