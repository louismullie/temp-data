Asthma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition and pathophysiology to anchor the rest of the reasoning. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and how to distinguish asthma from mimics. Next, I will review chronic stepwise management, including the preferred and alternative tracks, and I need to ensure I reconcile any apparent discrepancies in the sources. After that, I will examine acute exacerbation management, including ED care, oxygen targets, adjuncts, and disposition. Then, I should confirm post-exacerbation follow-up and self-management strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, severe asthma phenotyping and biologics, and close with implementation and quality-improvement principles, making sure each step is supported by current guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition and pathophysiology so I don't build on a shaky premise. Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by variable airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, with symptoms of wheeze, cough, chest tightness, and dyspnea, and it is fundamentally an inflammatory disorder even when symptoms are infrequent, which is why anti-inflammatory therapy changes outcomes even in so-called "mild" disease [^114DDMqv].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach before moving to treatment. Diagnosis relies on a characteristic symptom pattern plus evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, typically by spirometry demonstrating an obstructive pattern with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase of at least 12% and 200 mL; in children under 5, diagnosis is clinical and supported by response to a trial of controller therapy, and I need to remember that symptoms alone are insufficient because control and risk can be discordant, so I should also assess exacerbation history and risk factors during diagnosis and follow-up [^114Ex3pw].

> Wait, let me verify the stepwise framework so I don't misstate the preferred track. GINA 2025 recommends a preferred track using as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol as reliever across Steps 1–2, escalating to maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) at Step 3 and higher, which reduces exacerbations compared with higher-dose ICS-LABA strategies; the alternative track uses SABA reliever with daily ICS or ICS-LABA, but I should emphasize that SABA-only therapy increases exacerbation risk and should be avoided outside of carefully selected scenarios with ICS co-use, and I need to ensure I reconcile that some earlier summaries listed SABA-only as Step 1, which GINA now discourages as monotherapy [^111LDEbp] [^115znEFm] [^1127cufW].

> I will now examine the practical stepwise details and make sure I align dosing with current guidance. For adults and adolescents, Steps 1–2 favor as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol; Step 3 uses low-dose ICS-formoterol MART; Step 4 moves to medium-dose ICS-formoterol MART; Step 5 adds LAMA, considers high-dose ICS-formoterol, and evaluates for biologic therapy based on phenotype; for children 6–11, low- or medium-dose ICS with as-needed SABA is standard, with MART considered in some settings, and I should double-check that any escalation is justified by poor control or exacerbation risk rather than symptoms alone [^111LDEbp] [^116aZEEc] [^114Ex3pw].

> Let me consider the acute exacerbation pathway carefully, and I should confirm first-line therapy and delivery method. In acute care, rapid recognition and early intervention are critical; administer frequent inhaled SABA, with pMDI plus spacer as the most cost-effective and efficient delivery method, and give controlled-flow oxygen titrated to SpO2 93–95% in adults and adolescents; early systemic corticosteroids are indicated for most exacerbations, with oral preferred if feasible, ideally within 1 hour of presentation, and I need to ensure I document lung function when it does not delay care and reassess at 1 hour to guide disposition [^117WaQ1z] [^112VhsBR] [^116KTsTS] [^113GzsoZ] [^113d8vdw].

> Hold on, I should verify adjuncts and when to escalate beyond SABA and steroids. For moderate-to-severe exacerbations, add ipratropium to SABA to reduce hospitalizations and improve PEF/FEV1; consider IV magnesium sulfate for severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy, particularly when FEV1 remains below 60% predicted after 1 hour or is very low at presentation, and I should double-check that routine use of IV or nebulized magnesium is not recommended outside these contexts; do not routinely use antibiotics unless there is strong evidence of bacterial infection, and avoid routine chest radiography unless indicated by red flags or alternative diagnoses [^117YNbRp] [^113scWj1] [^111AQcah] [^113fpqzA] [^113PWQWx].

> I need to ensure disposition criteria are explicit and tied to objective measures. Discharge is reasonable when symptoms have improved, oxygenation is adequate, and lung function is at least 60% of predicted or personal best; continued treatment is warranted if FEV1 or PEF is 60–80% or if there is an incomplete response, and ICU transfer is indicated for severe features such as altered mental status, silent chest, or ongoing deterioration despite therapy, with continuous monitoring during any transfer [^113d8vdw] [^113PWQWx].

> Next, I should review post-exacerbation care and make sure I don't miss key steps. Before discharge, optimize controller therapy, review and correct inhaler technique, provide or update a written asthma action plan, and schedule follow-up within 2–7 days, sooner for children; after any exacerbation, review triggers, adherence, and the action plan, and consider stepping down maintenance therapy to pre-exacerbation levels after 2–4 weeks if control is good, escalating only if poor control persists; refer for specialist assessment if there are recurrent exacerbations or ICU-level care [^111EpqPw] [^111R7mUx] [^116aFjD9] [^1118dsUs].

> Let me verify self-management principles because they materially change outcomes. Education on trigger recognition, inhaler technique, and adherence should be reinforced at every visit, and a personalized written action plan should specify how to recognize worsening control, when to increase reliever/controller use, when to start oral steroids, and when to seek urgent care; supported self-management reduces severe exacerbations and hospitalizations, and I should confirm that digital or paper formats are acceptable if they are accessible and actionable for the patient [^11392SEF] [^116UhykY] [^116GWX3b].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where standard pathways differ. In pregnancy, maintain ICS-containing therapy and treat exacerbations aggressively with SABA and systemic steroids as indicated; in young children, diagnosis is clinical and treatment relies on ICS with as-needed SABA, with careful attention to growth monitoring; in older adults, I should double-check for COPD overlap and avoid LABA or LAMA monotherapy, favoring ICS-containing regimens to mitigate exacerbation risk [^notfound].

> I should confirm the approach to severe or difficult-to-treat asthma and phenotype-directed therapy. Severe asthma is defined retrospectively as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA or that requires such therapy or biologics to maintain control; before labeling as severe, I need to verify the diagnosis, inhaler technique, and adherence, and address comorbidities and modifiable factors; phenotype assessment guides add-on therapy, including LAMA, LTRA, low-dose azithromycin, and biologics for type 2 inflammation, and I should avoid maintenance OCS except as a last resort due to cumulative harms [^11429RT8] [^114FRaZc] [^116eivKt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought LAMA could be added to ICS alone as a general recommendation, but I should double-check the comparative evidence. The NAEPP update concluded that adding LAMA to ICS did not outperform adding LABA to ICS on key outcomes and raised a small safety signal in some populations, so LAMA is reasonable as an add-on in Step 4–5 when LABA is already included or not tolerated, but LABA add-on remains preferred for most patients uncontrolled on ICS alone; I need to ensure device teaching and contraindication screening when prescribing LAMA [^113SpPtY] [^112qZJF3].

> Let me reconsider the role of biomarkers so I don't overstate their utility. FeNO-guided strategies reduce exacerbations in adults and children, though improvements in control and quality of life are modest and no universal cutoff algorithm exists, so FeNO is reasonable to incorporate where available, particularly for patients with frequent exacerbations; sputum eosinophils can reduce exacerbations in experienced centers but access is limited, and I should avoid overpromising biomarker-guided care where resources are constrained [^111jDgh2] [^111tX1kK].

> I should double-check implementation and quality-improvement levers because best practices often fail without systems support. High-impact strategies include ensuring access to ICS, embedding inhaler technique checks, providing action plans, and using care pathways; after ED visits or hospitalizations, structured education and follow-up reduce readmissions, and referral to specialists for recurrent events improves outcomes; I need to ensure these elements are documented and audited to close the loop on quality [^114tT71Z] [^112X2Ymh] [^111R7mUx].

> Finally, let me synthesize the throughline to ensure internal consistency. Asthma care hinges on anti-inflammatory controller therapy to reduce exacerbation risk even when symptoms are mild, a stepwise approach that favors ICS-formoterol MART where available, rapid escalation with SABA, early systemic steroids, and adjuncts in acute care, meticulous post-exacerbation follow-up with action plan review, and phenotype-guided management for severe disease; I should confirm at each step that my recommendations align with GINA 2024/2025 and the 2020 NAEPP update to maintain fidelity to current standards [^111LDEbp] [^1128E6hX] [^116bjrAR].

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease with **variable airflow obstruction** and **reversible airway hyperresponsiveness**, presenting with wheeze, cough, chest tightness, and dyspnea [^111z5dgd]. Triggers include allergens, infections, pollutants, and exercise; management centers on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for control [^111MY3VB], with short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) for relief [^1127cufW], and stepwise escalation based on severity and control [^1127cufW]. Exacerbations are treated with **rapid bronchodilation** [^117WaQ1z], **systemic corticosteroids** [^116KTsTS], and adjuncts such as ipratropium [^117YNbRp] or IV magnesium [^113scWj1] when indicated. Poor control increases risk of severe attacks and permanent lung function loss [^116BVtrs]; **regular follow-up**, **self-management education** [^11392SEF], and **trigger avoidance** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^114tT71Z].

---

## Pathophysiology

Asthma involves **complex interactions** among inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and structural changes:

- **Inflammation**: Chronic airway inflammation with eosinophils, mast cells, T lymphocytes, and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) [^115uS8E2].

- **Airway hyperresponsiveness**: Exaggerated bronchoconstrictive responses to triggers [^115uS8E2].

- **Airway remodeling**: Thickening of airway walls, mucous hypersecretion, and smooth muscle hypertrophy, contributing to persistent airflow limitation [^113mjD3j].

---

## Clinical presentation

Asthma presents with **recurrent respiratory symptoms** and characteristic signs:

| **Symptoms** | **Signs** |
|-|-|
| Wheezing | Expiratory wheeze |
| Cough (especially at night) | Chest tightness |
| Shortness of breath | Accessory muscle use |
| Chest tightness | Prolonged expiration |
| Symptoms vary in frequency and severity | Cyanosis (severe cases) |

---

## Triggers and risk factors

Common **triggers and risk factors** include:

- **Allergens**: Pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold [^113pHAH1].

- **Respiratory infections**: Viral infections, especially rhinovirus [^115WE8dQ].

- **Environmental factors**: Tobacco smoke, air pollution, strong odors [^113pHAH1].

- **Exercise**: Especially in cold, dry conditions [^114LkfjF].

- **Occupational exposures**: Chemicals, industrial dusts [^notfound].

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, beta-blockers [^114FRaZc].

- **Emotional stress**: Anxiety, stress [^114FRaZc].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **clinical history**, **physical examination**, and objective testing:

- **Spirometry**: Demonstrates reversible airflow obstruction (FEV1 increase ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator) [^notfound].

- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF)**: Variable readings support diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Bronchial challenge tests**: Methacholine or histamine challenge for atypical cases [^notfound].

- **Allergy testing**: Skin prick or serum IgE for allergic asthma [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Asthma management is **stepwise**, individualized, and evidence-based:

### Long-term control medications

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: First-line therapy for persistent asthma [^111MY3VB].

- **Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)**: Add-on therapy with ICS [^1127cufW].

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)**: Alternative or add-on therapy [^116aZEEc].

- **Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA)**: Add-on for severe asthma [^111pT1nV].

- **Biologic therapies**: Anti-IgE, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-4/13 for severe, refractory asthma [^111LDEbp].

---

### Quick-relief medications

Quick-relief options include **short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)** as first-line rescue therapy [^117WaQ1z] and **short-acting anticholinergics** such as ipratropium, added for moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^117YNbRp].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **patient education** with self-management and written action plans [^11392SEF], **trigger avoidance** by identifying and minimizing exposures [^114FRaZc], and **regular follow-up** to monitor control and adjust therapy [^112EVSqA].

---

## Management of acute exacerbations

Acute exacerbations require **prompt, aggressive management**:

- **Rapid bronchodilation**: Repeated SABA doses via MDI with spacer or nebulizer [^117WaQ1z].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Oral or intravenous, early administration [^116KTsTS].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Ipratropium, IV magnesium sulfate in severe cases [^113scWj1].

- **Oxygen therapy**: Titrate to maintain SpO2 ≥ 93% [^112VhsBR].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent assessment of symptoms, lung function, and oxygen saturation [^113d8vdw].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Poorly controlled asthma can lead to **chronic airflow limitation** from airway remodeling, **respiratory failure** with acute severe exacerbations, and **reduced quality of life** due to persistent symptoms and activity limitation. Mortality risk is increased in severe, uncontrolled asthma [^113mjD3j].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent advances include **biologic therapies** targeting specific inflammatory pathways [^116eivKt], **digital health tools** for monitoring and self-management [^116UhykY], and **personalized medicine** using biomarkers and phenotyping to tailor therapy [^114uR6NB].

---

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease with variable airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness [^115uS8E2]. Effective management requires a **stepwise approach**, patient education, and regular monitoring to achieve control and prevent exacerbations [^111LDEbp] [^116UhykY].

## References

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^115WE8dQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### Towards a personalised treatment approach for asthma attacks [^116BVtrs]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma attacks (exacerbations) are common, accounting for over 90000 UK hospital admissions per annum. They kill nearly 1500 people per year in the UK, have significant associated direct and indirect costs and lead to accelerated and permanent loss of lung function. The recognition of asthma as a heterogeneous condition with multiple phenotypes has revolutionised the approach to the long-term management of the condition, with greater emphasis on personalised treatment and the introduction of the treatable traits concept. In contrast asthma attacks are poorly defined and understood and our treatment approach consists of bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids. This review aims to explore the current limitations in the description, assessment and management of asthma attacks. We will outline the risk factors for attacks, strategies to modify this risk and describe the recognised characteristics of attacks as a first step towards the development of an approach for phenotyping and personalising the treatment of these critically important events. By doing this, we hope to gradually improve asthma attack treatment and reduce the adverse effects associated with recurrent courses of corticosteroids.

### Management of the acute exacerbation of asthma [^112GJqdU]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having asthma exacerbations characterized by worsening symptoms, airflow obstruction, and an increased requirement for rescue bronchodilators. The goals of managing an asthma exacerbation are prompt recognition and rapid reversal of airflow obstruction to avert relapses and future episodes. Short-acting beta-agonists, oxygen, and corticosteroids form the basis of management of acute asthma exacerbation, but a role is emerging for anticholinergics and newer agents such as levalbuterol and formoterol. Initiation or intensification of long-term controller therapy, treatment of comorbid conditions, avoidance of likely triggers, and timely follow-up care prevent setbacks. Acceptance of current treatment guidelines by physicians and adherence to the recommended clinical regimens by patients are essential for effective management of asthma. The physician should strive to establish a constructive relationship with the patient by addressing the patient's concerns, reaching agreement on the goals of therapy, and developing a written action plan for patient self-management.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### Is the assessment of asthma treatment efficacy sufficiently comprehensive? [^112zitYG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The goal of asthma guideline therapy is to achieve disease control, by minimizing impairment and decreasing the risk of exacerbations and adverse effects of the disease and its treatment. The primary objective of most clinical trials of biologics for severe asthma is a reduction in exacerbation rate. Recently, studies with patients at the lower guideline steps have also selected exacerbation reduction as a primary objective. These trials in patients with milder disease frequently demonstrate statistically significantly fewer exacerbations, but their power calculations reflect larger sample size and smaller effect size. Exacerbations have a precise consensus definition, although a minimal clinically important difference has not been established. Reduction of exacerbations in severe asthma is commonly 10-fold greater than in mild disease. Further, reduction in exacerbations is not always associated with reduced impairment. If superior control is the objective, both domains should demonstrate consistent and parallel improvement. The disconnect may reflect the need for alternative tools for measurement of impairment or, possibly, different therapeutic mechanisms of action. Determining response to biologics or discussion of disease remission requires assessing symptoms that may occur daily rather than focusing on exacerbations that occur once or twice a year for patients at the highest steps of care according to the guidelines.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^114yaAj6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bjrAR]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial presentation during an acute exacerbation indicates that for "Initial asthma presentation is during an acute exacerbation", the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium-dose MART (Evidence D)". The alternative initial treatment (Track 2) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA (Evidence D)".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179T5GD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117UAZqk]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of oral or IV leukotriene receptor antagonists in acute asthma.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Acute asthma [^115ykJrg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^114V2FDA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

Future research priorities in acute exacerbations: "Although exacerbations of asthma are a very common problem, there is a surprising paucity of data regarding intervention in this situation". "Further research is desperately needed in children and adults". Study design "should consider the potential impact of the dose, timing and frequency of escalation of the intervention, and the population being studied". Moreover, "it is imperative that further research be undertaken to better define early predictors of asthma exacerbations (including markers of inflammation) and strategies to prevent airway remodeling".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aFjD9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HE3BK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112mHdrC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Asthma exacerbations. 5: assessment and management of severe asthma in adults in hospital [^113KwSff]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge discrepancy between the management of severe asthma recommended by evidence-based guidelines and that observed in clinical practice. The recommendations are relatively straightforward and have been widely promoted both in guidelines and reviews. Specialist physicians need to be more proactive in their implementation of such guidelines through the use of locally derived protocols and assessment sheets, reinforced by audit. The common occurrence of severe asthma and its considerable burden to the community would support such an approach.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^112415yg]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians play a key role in asthma and asthma exacerbation management worldwide because most patients with asthma are treated in primary care settings. The high burden of asthma exacerbations persists and important practice gaps remain, despite continual advances in asthma care. Lack of primary care-specific guidance, uncontrolled asthma, incomplete assessment of exacerbation and asthma control history, and reliance on systemic corticosteroids or short-acting beta 2 -agonist-only therapy are challenges clinicians face today with asthma care. Evidence supports the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + fast-acting bronchodilator treatments when used as needed in response to symptoms to improve asthma control and reduce rates of exacerbations, and the symptoms that occur leading up to an asthma exacerbation provide a window of opportunity to intervene with ICS. Incorporating patient perspectives and preferences when designing asthma regimens will help patients be more engaged in their therapy and may contribute to improved adherence and outcomes. This expert consensus contains 10 Best Practice Advice Points from a panel of primary care clinicians and a patient representative, formed in collaboration with the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), a clinically led charitable organization that works locally and globally in primary care to improve respiratory health. The panel met virtually and developed a series of best practice statements, which were drafted and subsequently voted on to obtain consensus. Primary care clinicians globally are encouraged to review and adapt these best practice advice points on preventing and managing asthma exacerbations to their local practice patterns to enhance asthma care within their practice.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MfK2d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.

Decision tree – investigate and manage difficult to treat asthma in adult and adolescent patients — applies to adolescents and adults with symptoms or acute exacerbations despite medium or high dose ICS-LABA, or taking maintenance OCS, and advises to consider referring to specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage. Confirm the diagnosis (asthma/differential diagnoses), then look for factors contributing to symptoms, exacerbations and poor quality of life, including incorrect inhaler technique, suboptimal adherence, comorbidities including obesity, GERD, chronic rhinosinusitis, OSA, modifiable risk factors and triggers at home or work (including smoking, environmental exposures, allergen exposures if sensitized; medications such as beta-blockers and NSAIDS), overuse of SABA relievers, medication side effects, and anxiety, depression and social difficulties. Optimize management, including optimize treatment (e.g. check and correct inhaler technique; add spacer; optimize adherence; switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, if available), consider non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, mucus clearance, influenza and COVID-19 vaccination), treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, and consider trial of high dose ICS-LABA, if not used. Review response after ~3–6 months; if the answer to "Is asthma still uncontrolled?" is yes, diagnosis is Severe asthma and, if not done by now, refer to a specialist, if possible. If no, consider stepping down treatment, OCS first (if used); if asthma becomes uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down, restore previous dose, otherwise continue optimizing management.

### Exacerbations of severe asthma [^116fDXVV]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Exacerbations occur frequently in severe asthma. They result in significant morbidity and can lead to hospitalization and death. Severe exacerbations can also lead to an accelerated decline in lung function. Phenotyping severe asthma can aid with both prognostication of exacerbation risk and maintenance treatment selection to minimize future risks of exacerbations in severe asthma. The rate of exacerbations differs by phenotype, and is most frequent in refractory eosinophilic asthma and early onset allergic asthma. Phenotype specific therapy can reduce exacerbations in both these forms of severe asthma. Exacerbations are multi-component events. Each exacerbation represents an opportunity to assess and target treatment to the domains of airway pharmacotherapy, self-management behaviour, risk factors, and relevant co-morbidities.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MY3VB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### Acute severe asthma: recent advances [^113mjD3j]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute severe asthma is challenging to the clinician both in terms of recognition and appropriate treatment. About 30% of these episodes need admission to the medical intensive care unit with a mortality of 8%. Relapse rates vary from 7 to 15% depending on how well the patient is managed. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in identification of risk factors, pathophysiology and management of acute severe asthma.

Recent Findings

Although the exact mechanism for acute severe asthma is unclear, some that are implicated include inflammation, airway remodeling and downregulation of beta-receptors. None of the environmental factors have been clearly related to the development of near fatal attacks. Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with severe asthma. Lack of steroid responsiveness has been linked to severe asthma attacks. Chemokines and basement membrane changes characteristic of severe asthma are reported in a few studies. Lack of symptom perception in a certain group of patients with acute severe asthma leads to delayed interventions. Specific treatment modalities and ventilator management is reviewed.

Summary

Severe asthma is a phenotype of asthma with variable pathology and clinical presentation. Early recognition and timely intervention is needed to prevent significant mortality and morbidity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113PWQWx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

### Does self-management prevent severe exacerbations? [^116UhykY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite effective therapies, asthma outcomes remain suboptimal. Education in self-management is crucial to maintaining control in a variable condition such as asthma and reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations and deaths. This review considers the evidence for supported self-management.

Recent Findings

Recent systematic reviews have clarified and confirmed the major benefits from effective self-management education, but have also shown that implementation is rare in routine practice, with consequent avoidable morbidity and mortality. Recent research has focused on the most effective ways of delivering and supporting self-management in different patient groups and has clarified the relative effectiveness of the different components. Self-management support using new digital technologies has been investigated.

Summary

All clinicians treating patients with asthma should be supporting their patients to understand and manage their own condition. Optimal self-management incorporates education, provision of a personalized asthma action plan and is supported by regular professional review. Action plans in a written or digital format should advise on recognizing deterioration and the actions to take, including when to seek professional help, appropriate changes in medication dose or commencing rescue oral steroids. Action plans should be personalized and agreed by the patient, and provided in a culturally tailored form.

Box 9–5 — follow up communication and appointment after acute care instructs to inform the patient's usual healthcare provider about the ED presentation/admission, instructions given on discharge, and any treatment changes; make a follow-up appointment within 2–7 days of discharge (1–2 days for children) to ensure that treatment is continued. The patient should be followed to ensure that asthma symptoms return to well controlled and that lung function returns to their personal best (if known), and refer for expert advice if ICU treatment was required or if there were one or more other exacerbations in the last 12 months.

Sidebar E: Asthma education and self-management support — Patients and caregivers should be informed of the diagnosis of asthma, their current understanding and treatment adherence should be assessed, they should be provided evidence-based education and materials/resources, and they should be given the opportunity to ask questions so they can fully understand their asthma; consistent follow-up should ensure confidence to self-manage and take a more active role with their healthcare team. Asthma education should include basic pathophysiology of asthma, typical asthma symptoms, how to identify well-controlled asthma, asthma patterns (exercise, nocturnal symptoms, and seasonal allergens) and risk factors, asthma exacerbations and precipitating triggers, goals of treatment and use of Asthma Action Plan, medication use (e.g., what it does, how to use it, potential side effects, and rationale for why each medication was selected) including assessment of device technique, how to recognize loss of asthma control and steps to take to regain control of symptoms, and when and how to seek emergency care for asthma exacerbations. The guideline further states to consider a personalized written asthma action plan and consider a team approach to asthma management, and to address lifestyle changes and psychosocial considerations.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1, as-needed-only combination ICS-short-acting β-blocker as usual treatment|- Take 2 inhalations of ICS-short-acting β-blocker as needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period|

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^112EVSqA]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115maK4T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117XBK4A]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-down to minimum effective treatment: Once good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the lowest treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations, provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely with a follow-up visit, and do not completely withdraw ICS unless needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113Qv6Zb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116VUbfz]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — mild asthma retrospective definition and risk: The page notes variability in criteria, including whether "FEV1 should be ≥ 80% predicted" and whether any exacerbation precludes a 'mild' label "for the next 12 months". By this definition, classification as 'mild' applies only after several months of ICS-containing treatment and only if well controlled on low-dose ICS or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, and studies indicated baseline features (daily reliever use, lower lung function, history of exacerbations, blood eosinophils or FeNO) did not identify patients who should instead receive daily ICS; decisions about ongoing treatment should rely on evidence for as-needed ICS-formoterol or daily ICS plus individualized assessment. The term 'mild asthma' may encourage complacency despite the fact that "up to 30% of asthma exacerbations and deaths occur in people with infrequent symptoms, for example, less than weekly or only on strenuous exercise".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11782icB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity terminology — variability across settings — explains that in the community and in primary care, 'severe' or 'mild' labels are commonly based on symptom or exacerbation frequency irrespective of treatment, whereas epidemiological studies and clinical trials often classify severity by prescribed treatment GINA or BTS Step regardless of asthma control. Most clinical trials of biologic therapy enroll patients uncontrolled despite taking medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA without routinely addressing contributory factors before enrolment. Some guidelines retain an older symptom-based classification distinguishing 'intermittent' and 'mild persistent' asthma with an untested assumption that patients with symptoms ≤ 2 days/week were not at risk and should be treated with SABA alone; however, patients with so-called 'intermittent' asthma can have severe or fatal exacerbations and their risk is substantially reduced by ICS-containing treatment compared with SABA alone. For low-resource countries, the World Health Organization definition of severe asthma includes 'untreated severe asthma', corresponding to uncontrolled asthma in patients not taking any ICS-containing treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114Ex3pw]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management — long-term goals: The goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient, encompassing long-term asthma symptom control that may include few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity, and long-term asthma risk minimization that may include no exacerbations, improved or stable personal best lung function, no requirement for maintenance systemic corticosteroids, and no medication side-effects. The patient's goals for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; ask the patient what they want from their asthma treatment, and when discussing the best possible asthma outcomes with a patient, consider their goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Assessing symptom control is NOT enough: the patient's risk factors, including history of exacerbations, should always also be assessed, and symptom control and risk may be discordant because patients with few or no symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to stepwise management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the alternative stepwise approach to the management of asthma in adult and adolescent patients, with as-needed inhaled-corticosteroid-short-acting β-agonist or as-needed short-acting β-agonist as the reliever in all steps:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose inhaled-corticosteroid whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers|
|Step 2. Symptoms 3–5 days per week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function|- Offer low-dose maintenance daily ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week, or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, or low lung function|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, <br/> -, OR medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist|
|Step 4. Daily symptoms or waking at night due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, and with low lung function or recent exacerbation|- Offer medium-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, OR high-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as another option <br/> - but adherence is worse than with combination ICS-LABA|
|Step 5.|- Offer add-on LAMAs <br/> - Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Consider offering high-dose maintenance ICS-LABA <br/> -; consider offering anti-IgE, anti-IL-5/5R, anti-interleukin 4-receptor, anti-thymic lymphopoietin|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS-long-acting β-agonis plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist|

Step 4 — Continue controller treatment and refer for expert assessment — when the Step 3 approach of doubling the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fails to achieve and maintain good asthma control, the guideline states to "carefully reassess inhaler technique and medication adherence", address environmental factors, and reconsider the diagnosis; as "the best treatment for this population has not been established", "options to consider, with specialist advice, are" to further increase the dose of ICS "for a few weeks", add leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) with counseling on neuropsychiatric adverse effects, add long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with ICS based on data "in children ≥ 4 years of age", add "a low dose of oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only)", or add "intermittent high-dose ICS at onset of respiratory illnesses" when exacerbations are the main problem, with monitoring for side-effects and re-evaluating the need for additional controller treatment at each visit.

### Asthma: 2015 and beyond [^115uS8E2]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is a multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The knowledge that asthma is an inflammatory disorder has become a core fundamental in the definition of asthma. Asthma's chief features include a variable degree of air-flow obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, in addition to the underlying chronic airways inflammation. This underlying chronic airway inflammation substantially contributes to airway hyper-responsiveness, air-flow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and disease chronicity. However, this underlying chronic airway inflammation has implications for the diagnosis, management, and potential prevention of the disease. This review for the respiratory therapy community summarizes these developments as well as providing an update on asthma epidemiology, natural history, cause, and pathogenesis. This paper also provides an overview on appropriate diagnostic and monitoring strategies for asthma, pharmacology, and newer therapies for the future as well as relevant management of acute and ambulatory asthma, and a brief review of educational approaches.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^112nWgzB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute loss of asthma control (yellow zone) — definition, goals, and cautions on systemic steroids: The yellow zone signifies the transition zone signaling the onset of loss of asthma control and may occur over hours to days, and the chief goal is to prevent progression to a full asthma exacerbation (red zone). The definition of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone should distinguish it from occasional asthma symptoms that do not indicate an impending exacerbation and from severe asthma symptoms that require administration of OCSs and immediate medical attention. Because there is generally a narrow window of opportunity for a yellow zone intervention to work, early identification of symptoms and aggressive intervention may optimize the chances for a good outcome, and although a "false" start may begin treatment when not needed, the risk of a "late" start may result in episode progression and the need for treatment with systemic corticosteroids. For established red zone exacerbations, OCSs have been shown to be effective if started early; however, their palatability and side effects, especially if repeated courses are given, limit their use in the yellow zone, and recent studies have suggested that systemic corticosteroids may not provide clinical benefit in preschool children with acute wheezing episodes.

Asthma management — fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) monitoring evidence summary — In the Expert Panel's judgment, the benefit of FENO monitoring is moderate, with FENO testing associated with a meaningful decrease in exacerbations, whereas the average benefit for asthma control and quality of life did not achieve the minimal clinically important difference and the certainty of evidence for these measures is low; for exacerbations defined as a composite end point, the certainty of evidence is high and the composite end point was defined as any of the following: unscheduled visits to the provider's office, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, oral corticosteroid use, reductions in FEV1 or peak expiratory flow, symptom-associated lung function decline, or Global Initiative for Asthma guideline definitions; studies comparing management strategies that include FENO monitoring with those that do not include 6 RCTs in 1536 adults (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.86) and 7 RCTs in 733 children (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.82), with adults showing an absolute risk reduction of 71 exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 108 to 25 fewer exacerbations) and children showing 116 fewer exacerbations per 1000; when exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids are used, based on 10 RCTs in 1664 adults and children the certainty of evidence is moderate with OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90 and an absolute risk difference of 67 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 104 to 19 fewer exacerbations); for exacerbations resulting in hospitalization, 9 RCTs in 1598 adults and children show OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32–1.55 and an absolute risk difference of 11 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 25 fewer to 19 more exacerbations); no evidence-based FENO cutoff points are available and the Expert Panel has not provided an algorithm to use for this purpose.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — interim advice on severity descriptors for clinical practice and education: The document states that GINA "continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled". It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pHAH1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations — definition, triggers, and risk identification — are episodes with a progressive increase in symptoms and progressive decrease in lung function sufficient to require a change in treatment; they may occur in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis or as the first presentation. Exacerbations usually occur due to external agents and/or poor adherence with ICS-containing medication, though a subset present acutely without known risk factors, and severe exacerbations can occur in patients with mild or well-controlled symptoms. Common triggers include viral respiratory infections, allergen exposure (including soybean dust) and fungal spores, food allergy, outdoor air pollution, seasonal changes or returning to school in fall, and poor adherence with ICS; epidemics have been reported with springtime thunderstorms with rye grass pollen or fungal spores and with environmental exposure to soybean dust. Some features are specifically associated with increased risk of asthma-related death, and patients with such risk factors should be encouraged to seek urgent medical care early in an exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (use, safety, and counseling for LAMA): The Expert Panel makes suggestions that a LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma as part of Step 4 therapy, but add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile; individuals at risk of urinary retention and those who have glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy; the small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Blacks; LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices and clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices appropriately; when clinicians prescribe LAMA therapy, they should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting and that LAMA therapy does not have a role in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in the ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings; and clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.
