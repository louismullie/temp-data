## Question

Hypotension in hyperkalermia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between hypotension and hyperkalemia, including mechanisms, clinical implications, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and thresholds for hypotension and hyperkalemia. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological links between hyperkalemia and blood pressure regulation. Next, I will examine clinical evidence for co-occurrence and causality, including medication-related effects. After that, I need to assess prognostic implications and guideline-directed management, including when to prioritize calcium, insulin/glucose, dialysis, and medication adjustments. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach and highlight special populations and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check any numerical figures I cite against the sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't anchor on ambiguous terms. Hypotension is generally defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg in adults, though some trials and labels operationalize symptomatic hypotension or thresholds like SBP less than 100 mmHg depending on context, so I should keep both clinical and trial definitions in mind when interpreting data [^db68bb51] [^924ad004]. Hyperkalemia is typically defined as serum potassium greater than 5.0–5.5 mmol/L, with severity bands of mild 5.5–5.9, moderate 6.0–6.4, and severe 6.5 mmol/L or higher, and many guidelines emphasize that severity should also incorporate ECG changes and clinical context rather than potassium alone [^ebc248cf] [^9bb0abf4].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiological links between hyperkalemia and blood pressure. Hyperkalemia impairs vascular smooth muscle function and can reduce systemic vascular resistance, while simultaneously depressing cardiac conduction and contractility, which together can precipitate hypotension in severe cases; this is particularly concerning in the setting of cardiac arrest or peri-arrest physiology where hyperkalemia is a reversible cause of arrest [^d6f4f757] [^f0611566]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these effects are most pronounced at higher potassium levels and with ECG evidence of cardiotoxicity, so the clinical impact is dose- and context-dependent rather than linear across the spectrum of hyperkalemia [^ebc248cf].

> Next, I should review medication-related co-occurrence, because this is where confounding is common. RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and MRAs, both lower blood pressure and increase serum potassium; thus, hypotension and hyperkalemia frequently coexist in patients on these therapies, especially with CKD, heart failure, diabetes, or intercurrent illness [^e618a29f] [^d2ae4f43]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude — finerenone in FINEARTS-HF increased hypotension and hyperkalemia versus placebo, and spironolactone in moderate CKD increased hypotension episodes and hyperkalemia, reinforcing that these effects are real and clinically meaningful in real-world populations [^f82d0ddf] [^01e69393]. I should also note that ARNI therapy can cause symptomatic hypotension and hyperkalemia via RAAS modulation, which complicates titration in heart failure [^924ad004].

> I will now examine direct clinical evidence for co-occurrence outside of drug effects. In an ED cohort with severe hyperkalemia, 15% had documented SBP less than 90 mmHg, and hypotension did not predict earlier treatment, suggesting under-recognition and potential hemodynamic vulnerability in this population [^9b342814]. But wait, what if this reflects selection bias — yes, it's observational, yet it aligns with physiologic plausibility and underscores the need to check vitals and anticipate hemodynamic collapse in severe hyperkalemia, particularly with ECG changes or peri-arrest features [^9b342814].

> Let me consider prognostic implications, because coexisting hypotension and hyperkalemia may signal worse outcomes. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality, and when combined with hypotension, the risk of arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and need for ICU care rises; delays in treatment are common in ED settings, which compounds risk [^1492cdc9] [^9b342814]. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines frame this as an emergency — UKKA recommends urgent treatment for severe hyperkalemia or any hyperkalemia with ECG changes, and continuous monitoring in higher-acuity settings, reflecting the potential for rapid deterioration including hypotension and arrest [^33e4176d] [^297b3ff2].

> Next, I should review acute management priorities when hypotension and hyperkalemia coexist. First, stabilize the myocardium with IV calcium if there are ECG changes or peri-arrest features; calcium chloride is preferred in arrest settings, while calcium gluconate is reasonable otherwise, and this should proceed in parallel with resuscitation for hypotension and arrhythmias [^760303f2] [^0cfb0933]. Second, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin and dextrose, adding dextrose infusion if baseline glucose is low to mitigate hypoglycemia, and consider beta-agonists if appropriate; these measures can improve hemodynamics by restoring vascular tone and cardiac output [^b3db2024] [^64490df8]. Third, remove potassium with binders and, if available, urgent dialysis for refractory cases or in dialysis-dependent patients with severe hyperkalemia, recognizing that binder choice and dialysis access influence speed and safety [^8a41aa1c] [^02a59765]. I should double-check that UKKA supports urgent dialysis for potassium 6.5 mmol/L or higher — yes, that is correct and time-sensitive in the hypotensive patient [^fb2c3802].

> For chronic and medication-related cases, I need to ensure I'm aligning with guideline-directed therapy adjustments. KDIGO advises that hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors can often be managed with potassium-lowering strategies rather than automatically stopping RAAS blockade, but to consider dose reduction or discontinuation for symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite treatment; this balances cardiorenal benefit against safety [^d2ae4f43] [^f5d6df1c]. Let me reconsider the practical steps — monitor BP, creatinine, and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiating or up-titrating RAAS therapy, address volume status, and use binders to preserve RAAS benefit when feasible, especially in heart failure or CKD where RAAS inhibition improves outcomes [^e618a29f] [^b6c70ed5].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In hemodialysis patients, severe hyperkalemia warrants urgent dialysis and IV calcium if there are toxic ECG changes, even if dialysis is imminent, because hemodynamic collapse can occur rapidly; potassium binders can be used interdialytically to reduce recurrence risk [^fb2c3802] [^0ccee52b] [^19bffe3d]. In heart failure, hypotension on discharge is a poor prognostic sign; GDMT should be optimized with attention to volume, timing of doses, and cautious titration of agents with hypotensive effects, reserving dose reduction for persistent symptomatic hypotension after other causes are addressed [^f0b66d06]. For older adults, both hypotension and hyperkalemia are more frequent with MRAs and ARNI, so I should start low, go slow, and monitor closely to avoid iatrogenic harm [^f82d0ddf] [^01e69393].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety nets. Obtain a 12-lead ECG urgently when potassium is 6.0 mmol/L or higher, and use continuous cardiac monitoring for potassium 6.5 mmol/L or higher or when ECG changes are present; repeat potassium frequently during acute treatment to detect rebound and guide next steps [^9cc47d1c] [^297b3ff2] [^3788d5f1]. Hold on, I should verify whether point-of-care blood gas potassium is acceptable in emergencies — yes, UKKA supports using blood gas analyzers for rapid potassium while awaiting formal lab results in acute settings, which helps expedite care in hypotensive patients [^7b9b8d1e].

> Putting this together, my clinical approach is as follows. First, assess severity and hemodynamics simultaneously: check potassium, obtain an ECG, and measure BP with orthostatics. Second, if there are ECG changes or peri-arrest features, give IV calcium immediately and initiate ACLS as indicated. Third, administer insulin with dextrose and consider beta-agonists, then remove potassium with binders and arrange urgent dialysis if potassium is 6.5 mmol/L or higher or if hypotension persists despite stabilization. Fourth, in medication-related cases, prioritize correcting volume, adjusting interacting drugs, and using binders to maintain RAAS therapy when possible, reducing or stopping RAAS blockade only for symptomatic hypotension or refractory hyperkalemia. Finally, monitor closely for rebound hyperkalemia and hypotension, and address underlying contributors such as AKI, acidosis, and drug interactions to prevent recurrence [^760303f2] [^b3db2024] [^fb2c3802] [^d2ae4f43] [^3788d5f1].

> In summary, hypotension and hyperkalemia co-occur via direct cardiovascular toxicity of potassium and, more commonly, through shared medication effects, particularly with RAAS inhibitors. Clinically, this combination signals high risk and mandates rapid stabilization, intracellular potassium shifting, and definitive potassium removal, with careful attention to preserving disease-modifying RAAS therapy whenever safely possible. I need to ensure I remain vigilant for delays in recognition and treatment, as both hypotension and hyperkalemia are frequently under-treated in real-world settings, and early, protocolized care improves outcomes [^9b342814] [^33e4176d].

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is uncommon but can occur due to **cardiac conduction depression** and **arrhythmias** that reduce cardiac output, and from **vasodilation** from impaired vascular smooth muscle function [^d6f4f757]. It is more likely with severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L) or when combined with factors such as renal failure, heart failure, or RAAS inhibitors [^1492cdc9] [^e618a29f]. Management is **urgent**: stabilize the heart with IV calcium, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin/dextrose and beta-agonists, and remove potassium with binders or dialysis; monitor ECG and blood pressure continuously, and treat hypotension with fluids and vasopressors as needed [^760303f2] [^b3db2024] [^fb2c3802] [^297b3ff2].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hyperkalemia and hypotension

Hyperkalemia affects both **cardiac and vascular systems**, which can lead to hypotension:

- **Cardiac effects**: Elevated potassium depolarizes cardiac myocytes, causing conduction delays, bradycardia, and arrhythmias (e.g. asystole, ventricular fibrillation), reducing cardiac output and causing hypotension [^d6f4f757].

- **Vascular effects**: Hyperkalemia impairs vascular smooth muscle function, causing vasodilation and reduced systemic vascular resistance, contributing to hypotension.

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Hyperkalemia can impair autonomic regulation, further compromising vascular tone and blood pressure.

---

## Clinical evidence of hypotension in hyperkalemia

Although hypotension is not the most common manifestation of hyperkalemia, it can occur, particularly in severe cases or when hyperkalemia is associated with other complicating factors. Clinical studies and case reports have documented hypotension in patients with severe hyperkalemia, especially in the context of **renal failure**, **heart failure**, or **medications** that potentiate hyperkalemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) [^1492cdc9] [^e618a29f].

---

## Factors influencing the severity of hypotension in hyperkalemia

Several factors influence the likelihood and severity of hypotension in hyperkalemia:

| **Factor** | **Influence on hypotension** |
|-|-|
| Severity of hyperkalemia | More severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L) significantly increases the risk of hypotension due to pronounced cardiac and vascular effects [^notfound]. |
| Underlying comorbidities | Renal failure, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus exacerbate hypotension risk by impairing potassium excretion and cardiovascular compensation [^notfound]. |
| Concurrent medications | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics increase hyperkalemia risk and can compound hypotension [^e618a29f]. |
| Rate of potassium rise | Rapid increases in potassium levels can precipitate acute hypotension due to sudden cardiac and vascular impairment. |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is a **medical emergency** requiring immediate intervention:

- **Stabilize cardiac membranes**: Intravenous calcium (calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) is administered to counteract the cardiotoxic effects of hyperkalemia and stabilize blood pressure [^760303f2].

- **Shift potassium intracellularly**: Insulin with dextrose and beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol) are used to promote intracellular potassium shift, reducing serum potassium levels and improving cardiovascular function [^b3db2024].

- **Remove potassium from the body**: Potassium binders (e.g. sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, patiromer) and dialysis are employed to effectively reduce total body potassium, particularly in cases of renal failure or refractory hyperkalemia [^8a41aa1c] [^fb2c3802].

- **Supportive measures**: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors may be necessary to manage persistent hypotension, while continuous cardiac and blood pressure monitoring is essential [^297b3ff2].

---

## Preventive measures and monitoring

Preventing hypotension in hyperkalemia involves **regular monitoring** of serum potassium, especially in patients with risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or those on RAAS inhibitors [^d2479fef]. Early detection and management of hyperkalemia can prevent progression to severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse [^33e4176d].

---

Hypotension in hyperkalemia is a rare but serious complication resulting from cardiac and vascular impairment. It requires **immediate recognition and aggressive management**, including cardiac stabilization, intracellular potassium shifting, and removal of potassium from the body.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^f043ec85]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^3888412a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^01e69393]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Safety

In total, 455 participants randomized to spironolactone had treatment withdrawn because of safety concerns. The most common reason (n = 239, 35.4%) was a decrease in eGFR that met the prespecified stop criteria, followed by 128 (18.9%) participants being withdrawn due to potential treatment side effects.

The frequency of adverse events is shown in Table 4 (with classification by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes shown in Supplementary Table 1). An additional 33 participants who were randomized to spironolactone but who did not take any medication were included in the comparator usual care arm in this analysis. There were significantly more episodes of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing) experienced across all individuals in the spironolactone versus the control arm (49 versus 32, adjusted treatment effect 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04–2.46), P = 0.034), with 11 participants citing hypotension as a reason for withdrawal from treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Participants who received spironolactone experienced significantly more episodes of hyperkalemia (24.7%) overall versus 13.4% in the control arm, defined by a potassium of ≥ 5.5 mmol l⁻¹. Most of these were mild (potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol l⁻¹) in both arms, but 11% of the raised potassium events that occurred were levels of ≥ 6 mmol l⁻¹ and therefore required dose suspension or adjustment, and 8.0% (n = 54) of participants were withdrawn from spironolactone treatment for reasons related to hyperkalemia. Among patients who experienced hyperkalemia, the mean baseline eGFR was 41.9 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻² (s.d. 7.08) compared to a mean baseline eGFR of 43.9 mL min⁻¹ 1.73 m⁻² (s.d. 6.92) among those who did not experience hyperkalemia.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^6bc2a25a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Hyperkalemia… [^265d4441]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Causes of Hyperkalemia The first step in the evaluation of a patient with elevated serum potassium is to exclude spurious potassium elevation. HYPERKALEMIA CAUSED BY DECREASED EXCRETION OF POTASSIUM Effective excretion of potassium is dependent on aldosterone and sufficient distal delivery of sodium and water within the nephron. Hyperkalemia may occur when one of these mechanisms is impaired because of renal failure, renal hypoperfusion, or hypoaldosteronism. Hypoaldosteronism may be the cause of hyperkalemia in patients who do not have advanced renal failure or hypoperfusion. 11 Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, a syndrome associated with type IV renal tubular acidosis, may be part of the mechanism behind hyperkalemia in patients with mild renal failure, particularly diabetic nephropathy.

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism can cause patients who have diabetic nephropathy to develop acute elevations of potassium because of medications or stress.
12. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY The possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in all patients with hyperkalemia. Clinical suspicion is increased by the presence of hyponatremia and muscular weakness. 17 Primary adrenal insufficiency is best screened for with a standard cosyntropin-stimulation test, 18 in which 0. 25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin is given as an intravenous bolus. Plasma cortisol is measured 45 to 60 minutes later, and values less than 20 mcg per dL suggest adrenal insufficiency.
19. CONGENITAL CAUSES OF HYPERKALEMIA Congenital abnormalities of aldosterone synthesis also can lead to potassium elevation and excessive sodium loss. Severe forms of these disorders lead to electrolyte imbalances in neonates that can be fatal if not corrected promptly.

If these patients survive infancy, the disorder tends to be less severe as they get older. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism should be considered in patients with diabetes and hyperkalemia, who generally have a low serum aldosterone. A trial of oral fludrocortisone is generally the most practical way to empirically establish this diagnosis; if the patient has hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, potassium levels will return to normal in a day or two after initiation of fludrocortisone.

Hyperkalemia

RAASi and MRA use require close monitoring for hyperkalemia, particularly in the setting of kidney dysfunction, and hyperkalemia may be mitigated through the use of SGLT2i. Patients with mild hyperkalemia can be treated without a change in RAASi or MRA therapies if other causes of hyperkalemia are addressed. For persistent hyperkalemia without a reversible cause, potassium binders can be introduced. Downtitration of RAASi is associated with an increased risk of cardiorenal events, and in the case of MRA, an increase in all-cause mortality, but may be considered with persistent hyperkalemia. A serum potassium > 6.0 mEq/L should prompt withholding of therapy. Even so, a rechallenge is recommended at 2 to 4 weeks if kidney function and/or potassium have improved(Table 6).

Hypotension

Hypotension on hospital discharge is a poor prognostic indicator that should prompt evaluation of underlying causes and, when appropriate, discussion of advanced therapies or advanced care planning. Common causes of symptomatic hypotension include volume depletion or congestion and medications. Antihypertensive medications other than GDMT should be discontinued. As HF advances, RAASi/ARNI and BB doses can be staggered to avoid simultaneous peak effect. When necessary, doses of ARNI can be downtitrated and subsequently switched to ACEI/ARB.SGLT2is and MRAs have minimal blood pressure effect at the doses used in HF and are reasonable to maintain without dose adjustment. The downtitration and discontinuation of GDMT should be a last resort and considered only after addressing other causes of hypotension. GDMT remains associated with improved outcomes in patients with hypotension, though this effect is attenuated when hypotension is compounded by significant kidney dysfunction.

Second-line therapies such as ivabradine (if the patient is in sinus rhythm) or digoxin — both of which reduce HHF in ambulatory HFrEF — may be considered in the setting of hypotension that limits use of first-line GDMT classes, but these have not been tested in hospitalized patients. Vericiguat should not be considered among second-line therapies in the setting of hypotension, as such patients may be more prone to progressive symptomatic hypotension and syncope.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy — initiation, monitoring, titration, and combination risks — should include reassessment of blood pressure, renal function, and potassium "within 1 to 2 weeks" after starting, with closer follow-up after dose changes; patients with "systolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg" warrant particular surveillance. Titration "is generally achieved by doubling doses", and "for stable patients, it is reasonable to add therapy with beta-blocking agents before full target doses of either ACEIs or ARBs are reached". Risks of "hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia are greater when combined with another inhibitor of this axis, such as ACEIs or aldosterone antagonists".

Conclusions

In patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF, the beneficial effects of finerenone on reducing the risk of total worsening HF events and cardiovascular death and on improving symptoms were not modified by frailty status. The effects of finerenone on experiencing hypotension, elevated creatinine level, hyperkalemia, or hypokalemia did not differ by frailty status. The favorable benefit-risk balance related to frailty for finerenone should challenge any clinical reluctance to introduce this new treatment in patients considered to be frail.

Adverse effects related to angiotensin suppression in heart failure (HF) with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy include hypotension and dizziness, and symptomatic hypotension with first doses may not recur with repeated administration; the doses of other hypotensive agents can be reduced or staggered, and most patients remain excellent candidates for long-term ACE inhibition if appropriate measures minimize recurrence. Severe hyponatremia is identified as a risk factor, defined as serum sodium concentration less than 130 mmol per liter. Worsening renal function is described, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (greater than 0.3 mg per dL) observed in 15% to 30% of patients with severe HF and in only 5% to 15% of those with mild to moderate symptoms; renal function usually improves after reduction of concomitantly administered diuretics, and if diuretics cannot be reduced because of fluid retention, mild to moderate degrees of azotemia may need to be tolerated to maintain ACEI therapy. Hyperkalemia can occur and may be sufficiently severe to cause cardiac conduction disturbances, particularly when renal function deteriorates or with oral potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists, especially in diabetes mellitus.

### The cardiovascular implications of hypokalemia [^e827e3ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The role of potassium in the progression of cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial. Animal and human data suggest that increases in dietary potassium, decreases in urinary potassium loss, or increases in serum potassium levels through other mechanisms have benefits in several disease states. These include the treatment of hypertension, stroke prevention, arrhythmia prevention, and treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, the discovery that aldosterone antagonists not only decrease sodium reabsorption and decrease potassium secretion in the nephron, but also decrease pathological injury of such nonepithelial tissues as the myocardium and endothelium, has generated great controversy regarding the actual mechanisms of benefit of these agents. We review the available data and draw conclusions about the relative benefits of modulating potassium balance versus nonrenal effects of aldosterone blockade in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^ebc248cf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Safety and cardiovascular efficacy of spironolactone in dialysis-dependent ESRD (SPin-D): a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial [^16697bf3]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of spironolactone is uncertain in end-stage renal disease. We randomized 129 maintenance hemodialysis patients to placebo (n = 51) or spironolactone 12.5 mg (n = 27), 25 mg (n = 26), or 50 mg (n = 25) daily for 36 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial to assess safety, tolerability and feasibility and to explore cardiovascular efficacy. The primary safety endpoints were hyperkalemia (potassium > 6.5 mEq/L) and hypotension requiring emergency department visit or hospitalization. Diastolic function was assessed by Doppler echocardiography. 125 participants (97%) completed dose escalation, with no significant difference in permanent study drug discontinuation between the groups (27.5% in placebo versus 16.7% in the combined spironolactone groups and 28% in the 50 mg group). Hyperkalemia frequency was similar between spironolactone and placebo (0.49 versus 0.50 events per patient-year) but demonstrated a significant linear trend due primarily to an increased event rate at the 50 mg dose (0.89 events per patient-year). The primary hypotension outcome was infrequent and similar with spironolactone and placebo (0.11 versus 0 events per patient-year). Gynecomastia was rare and did not differ significantly between groups. Change in diastolic function was similar with spironolactone and placebo. Spironolactone appears safe in carefully monitored maintenance hemodialysis patients, but did not affect cardiovascular parameters in this small study. Hyperkalemia occurs more frequently as dosage increases to 50 mg daily.

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^9b342814]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia and to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of ED patients with the laboratory diagnosis of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or who were referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed to find whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and, if so, what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 175 ED visits that occurred over a 1-year time period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). The 7 cases in which hyperkalemia was not treated include 4 cases in which the patient was discharged home, with a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite initiation of specific therapy for hyperkalemia in 168 cases, 2 patients died of cardiac arrhythmias. Among the patients who received treatment, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% of treated patients were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). The predominant complaints were dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%). Thirty-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were abnormal in 83% of patient visits, including 24% of ECGs with nonspecific ST abnormalities. Findings of peaked T-wave morphology (34%), first-degree atrioventricular block (17%), and interventricular conduction delay (12%) did not lead to early treatment. Vital sign abnormalities, including hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), were not associated with early treatment. The chief complaint of "unresponsive" was most likely to lead to early treatment; treatment delays occurred in patients not transported by ambulance, those with a chief complaint of syncope and those with a history of hypertension.

Conclusions

Recognition of patients with severe hyperkalemia is challenging, and the initiation of appropriate therapy for this disorder is frequently delayed.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1492cdc9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^48fd8fe1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

After identifying the articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the data was extracted using a predetermined data extraction form. The form encompassed the following elements: the author of the study, the name of the trial, the type of heart failure experienced by the participants, their New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, the drug used for comparison, mortality rates (including all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality), hospitalizations due to heart failure, and any adverse events reported (such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and angioedema). The selected trials included a definition of hypotension, which encompassed either clinical hypotension or a systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurement below 90 mm Hg.

The methodological rigor of the papers included in the analysis was evaluated by employing the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias assessment. This instrument incorporates several criteria, namely randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of follow‐up. The risk of bias for each item was assessed and categorized as high, low, or uncertain.

2.4 Quantitative data synthesis

The meta‐analysis was conducted using Review Manager (RevMan, Version 5. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration. 2020). The risk ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval were computed based on the absolute participant counts in both the intervention and control groups.

The researchers performed meta‐analyses utilizing a random‐effects model, specifically the Mantel–Haenszel method. To evaluate the variability among the studies included in the analysis, the I 2 statistic was employed. The I 2 values were categorized as follows: values below 25% indicated low heterogeneity, values between 25% and 50% indicated moderate heterogeneity, and values exceeding 50% indicated high heterogeneity. Forest plots were generated, and a statistically significant result was seen with a p < .05. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to examine the association between the type of heart failure (HFrEF, HFpEF, and HFmrEF) and the specific side effects. A funnel plot was employed to investigate the presence of publication bias, wherein the log risk ratio for each study was plotted against its corresponding standard error.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^c4c010b2]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Association between antihypertensive treatment and adverse events: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0cf8fbd0]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

As this review focused on adverse events, selective outcome reporting might also have been a problem. Evidence was found of publication bias for certain outcomes (hyperkalaemia and hypotension), confirming the findings of previous studies that showed adverse events are more likely to be reported in randomised controlled trials when they are statistically significant. This is understandable in the context of single trial reporting, but it would be better for the evidence base if all adverse events were reported in clinical trials to enable more complete meta-analyses in the future. It is a limitation of this review that original study authors were not contacted for these additional data.

This review focused on large randomised controlled trials with the aim of including those with at least 50 adverse events (and therefore 650 patient years of follow-up). This restriction on study size was chosen to make the review more manageable in terms of screening and analysis and avoid inclusion of numerous small early phase mechanistic studies of varying methodological quality. The cut-off for this inclusion was chosen to ensure studies provided adequately powered estimates of association between treatment and outcomes. It is possible that some useful trials could have been excluded, although many relevant trials were still available for inclusion.

Across all included trials, adverse events were poorly defined and probably varied across studies. For instance, many studies referred to syncope as an outcome, but did not say what type of syncopal event this might have included. A conservative approach to inclusion of outcomes was taken when possible, and only those explicitly stating the outcome of interest were included. For example, trials reporting hypotension or acute kidney injury were included, but those reporting hypotension or dizziness or renal impairment were excluded. Despite this approach, some studies were included that did not specify the thresholds used to define hypotension or acute kidney injury. This could have resulted in some relevant data for certain outcomes being missed, but this meant those that were included were likely to be sufficiently similar to enable pooling in a meta-analysis. Although the quality of adverse event ascertainment is likely to have varied between trials, it would not be expected to vary between treatment arms within trials. Thus it is unlikely that differences in the quality of adverse event ascertainment would have affected the relative treatment effects presented in this review.

KDIGO 2021 — benefits and harms of intensive SBP lowering in CKD note that in SPRINT the reduction in the absolute risk of all-cause mortality in the CKD subgroup was 0.6% per year (1.61% and 2.21% in the intensive and standard SBP groups, respectively), and if this trend continues linearly, the risk reduction would be substantial over 20 or 30 years. Intensive SBP lowering in CKD patients did not cause more serious adverse events, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or injurious falls than targeting SBP < 140 mm Hg in SPRINT, but the Work Group places lower values on the higher risks of mild acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia because they are largely mild, transient, and manageable.

### Sacubitril and valsartan [^924ad004]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

Sacubitril and valsartan lowers blood pressure and may cause symptomatic hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), are at greater risk. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of sacubitril and valsartan or start at a lower dose. If hypotension occurs, consider dose adjustment of diuretics, concomitant antihypertensive drugs, and treatment of other causes of hypotension (e.g., hypovolemia). If hypotension persists despite such measures, reduce the dosage or temporarily discontinue sacubitril and valsartan. Permanent discontinuation of therapy is usually not required.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreases in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In patients whose renal function depends upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. Closely monitor serum creatinine, and down-titrate or interrupt sacubitril and valsartan in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As with all drugs that affect the RAAS, sacubitril and valsartan may increase blood urea and serum creatinine levels in patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis. In patients with renal artery stenosis, monitor renal function.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Through its actions on the RAAS, hyperkalemia may occur with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia such as severe renal impairment, diabetes, hypoaldosteronism, or a high potassium diet. Dosage reduction or interruption of sacubitril and valsartan may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### Combined blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduced all-cause but not cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients: a mediation analysis and systematic review [^f6aabd56]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Full blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is believed to decrease morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic kidney disease. In non-dialysis patients, combined RAAS blockade with two different RAAS blockers causes more adverse events without improving survival, but its role in maintenance dialysis patients is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and mediation analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of combined RAAS blockade in dialysis patients.

Methods

Comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library database to June 2017 to identify relevant studies. Studies comparing combined with single RAAS blockade and reporting all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hypotension or hyperkalemia in dialysis patients were included. Effect sizes were calculated with randomized effects model and summarized as odd ratios (OR).

Results

A total of 9 studies with 13,050 dialysis patients were included. Compared with single blockade, combined blockade significantly reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.54–0.93, p = 0.01), while cardiovascular mortality remained unchanged (0.85, 0.45–1.59, p = 0.61). Combined blockade tended to increase odd of hypotension but not odd of hyperkalemia (1.54, 1.00–2.38, p = 0.05; 0.89, 0.76–1.05, p = 0.17). Further mediation analysis indicated that hypotension might exert a suppression effect on the survival benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor plus angiotensin receptor blocker treatment on cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusions

Combined RAAS blockade might be a promising treatment in dialysis patients to further reduce mortality if blood pressure was well controlled.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^d6f4f757]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

MR blockers, including the new agent esaxerenone, have antihypertensive activity and organ protective effects. However, a careful approach to therapy and proper management of serum potassium is required to ensure safe clinical use of these agents. This includes awareness of at-risk patient groups, choosing appropriate dosages for therapy initiation and dosage titration, and monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. It is important that physicians take these important factors into consideration to optimize MR blocker therapy in patients with hypertension.

### The safety of eplerenone in hemodialysis patients: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^bfc33940]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, but the safety of these drugs in patients receiving dialysis is unclear. This study evaluated whether hyperkalemia and/or hypotension limited the use of eplerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, in hemodialysis patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a randomized controlled trial of prevalent patients receiving hemodialysis at five Canadian centers. Participants were randomly allocated to 13 weeks of eplerenone titrated to 50 mg daily (n = 77) or a matching placebo (n = 77). The primary outcome was permanent discontinuation of the drug because of hyperkalemia or hypotension. Secondary outcomes included hyperkalemia, hypotension, and cardiovascular events.

Results

Seventy-five eplerenone-treated patients and 71 placebo-treated patients were included in the per protocol population. The primary outcome occurred in three patients (4.0%) in the eplerenone group and two (2.8%) in the placebo group, for an absolute risk difference of 1.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -4.7 to 7.1 percentage points). Eplerenone was interpreted as noninferior to placebo with respect to the primary outcome (i.e., a discontinuation rate for these reasons > 10% was excluded). In the eplerenone group, nine patients (11.7%) developed hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.5 mEq/L), compared with two patients (2.6%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 20.2). There was no significant effect on predialysis or postdialysis BP.

Conclusion

Eplerenone increased the risk of hyperkalemia but did not result in an excess need to permanently discontinue the drug. Further trials are required to determine whether mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving long-term dialysis.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^990ce8ca]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings

In patients with hyperkalemia and impaired mechanisms for excreting potassium the administration of potassium salts can produce hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. This occurs most commonly in patients given potassium by the intravenous route but may also occur in patients given potassium orally. Potentially fatal hyperkalemia can develop rapidly and be asymptomatic.

The use of potassium salts in patients with chronic renal disease, or any other condition which impairs potassium excretion, requires particularly careful monitoring of the serum potassium concentration and appropriate dosage adjustment.

Note: There is no conclusive evidence that potassium supplements lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.

### Evolving therapeutic strategies for patients hospitalized with new or worsening heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^de245571]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several practical considerations are worth noting for deployment of these lifesaving therapies in clinical practice. Although hypotension remains source of clinical hesitancy, MRA and SGLT2i have had virtually no important impact on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in clinical trials among those with lower baseline BP. Although ARNI introduction is associated with more significant hypotension and orthostasis, it is usually tolerable and safe with appropriate patient education. Evidence‐based β‐blockers without α adrenergic effects may also be prioritized to augment tolerance of other agents. The risk of incident hyperkalemia may be managed by transitioning from ACEI/ARB to ARNI and initiation of SGLT2i, which both have been shown to reduce hyperkalemia risks. Introduction of potassium binders may further augment tolerance of RAAS inhibitors, a strategy being investigated in the REALIZE‐K (NCT04676646) and LIFT (NCT05004363) trials, and recently shown to be effective in DIAMOND (NCT03888066). CKD constitutes an important comorbidity for those facing worsening HF; however, evidence and labeling have supported use of therapies such as the SGLT2i down to eGFR 20 ml/minute/1.73 m². The safety and efficacy of SGLT2i in hemodialysis populations is being in the RENAL LIFECYCLE and EMPA‐HD (NCT05179668) trials.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^c5f72174]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Practice points for RAS inhibitors in CKD hypertension: It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi, and continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low eGFR.

### Novel therapeutics for the treatment of hypertension and its associated complications: peptide-and nonpeptide-based strategies [^90b9580d]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is responsible for maintaining blood pressure and vascular tone. Modulation of the RAAS, therefore, interferes with essential cellular processes and leads to high blood pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Consequently, these conditions cause fatal cardiovascular and renal complications. Thus, the primary purpose of hypertension treatment is to diminish or inhibit overactivated RAAS. Currently available RAAS inhibitors have proven effective in reducing blood pressure; however, beyond hypertension, they have failed to treat end-target organ injury. In addition, RAAS inhibitors have some intolerable adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia and hypotension. These gaps in the available treatment for hypertension require further investigation of the development of safe and effective therapies. Current research is focused on the combination of existing and novel treatments that neutralize the angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptor-mediated action of the angiotensin II peptide. Preclinical studies of peptide- and nonpeptide-based therapeutic agents demonstrate their conspicuous impact on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in animal models. In this review, we will discuss novel therapeutic agents being developed as RAAS inhibitors that show prominent effects in both preclinical and clinical studies. In addition, we will also highlight the need for improvement in the efficacy of existing drugs in the absence of new prominent antihypertensive drugs.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^9bb0abf4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^a71d2537]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

Tolerability and Safety According to Age Category

The occurrence of prespecified laboratory safety measures and hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg) according to age group are shown in Table 4. Older patients were more likely to have hypotension than younger patients, but there was no notable age gradient in the predefined laboratory safety measures. Patients randomized to finerenone were more likely to experience hypotension and hyperkalemia than those assigned to placebo, but less likely to experience hypokalemia. These between-treatment differences did not vary across age categories.

### Hyperkalemia and blood pressure regulation [^ca8bf6d2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is common in the general population. Management of hypertensive patients at risk of hyperkalemia is challenging due to potential life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrest. Chronic hyperkalemia is often associated with impaired renal ability to excrete excessive potassium ions (K+). This may refer to chronic kidney disease or certain pharmacological interventions, including broadly used renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and calcineurin inhibitors. Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms permitting kidney adaptations to hyperkalemia is critical for choosing therapeutic strategies. Valuable insights were obtained from the analysis of familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt) syndrome, which became a classic model for coincidence of high blood pressure and hyperkalemia. FHHt can be caused by mutations in several genes, all of them resulting in excessive activity of with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs) in the distal nephron of the kidney. WNKs have been increasingly recognized as key signalling enzymes in the regulation of renal sodium ions (Na+) and K+ handling, enabling adaptive responses to systemic shifts of potassium homoeostasis consequent to variations in dietary potassium intake or disease. The WNK signalling pathway recruits a complex protein network mediating catalytic and non-catalytic effects of distinct WNK isoforms on relevant Na+- or K+-transporting proteins. In this review article, we summarize recent progress in understanding WNK signalling. An update of available models for renal adaptation to hyperkalemic conditions is presented. Consequences for blood pressure regulation are discussed. Pharmacological targeting of WNKs or their substrates offers promising options to manage hypertension while preventing hyperkalemia.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^996a24a3]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD — renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) use and monitoring: Based on these benefits, RASi are the preferable first-line agents for treating high BP in people with ADPKD. For implementation, RASi should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated, and changes in blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine (SCr), and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose increase. Dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered only for symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia, and RASi do not need to be discontinued in CKD G4–G5 in the absence of hypotension or uncontrollable hyperkalemia.
