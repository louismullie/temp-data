## Question

Work up flank pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup of flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the focused history and exam elements that narrow the differential. Next, I will review first-line labs and their interpretive pitfalls. After that, I need to check the imaging algorithm, including when to use ultrasound versus noncontrast CT and how to handle special populations. Then, I will consider key alternative diagnoses that mimic nephrolithiasis and how to distinguish them. Finally, I will outline management pathways, disposition, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first few minutes: screen for shock, sepsis, and life-threatening causes of flank pain, because hemodynamic instability or peritoneal signs change everything and mandate immediate resuscitation and surgical or interventional consultation rather than a routine workup [^f006f9e1].

> Next, I should review the focused history to refine pretest probabilities. I need to check onset and character (sudden colicky pain suggests stones, constant pain suggests infection or ischemia), radiation to the groin supports ureteral colic, associated nausea and vomiting are common with stones, fever and dysuria point toward infection, and recent trauma or anticoagulation raise concern for hemorrhage or renal injury. I should also ask about risk factors such as prior stones, atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulability, sickle cell trait, pregnancy, and malignancy, and I must not forget medications that can precipitate stones or renal injury, including NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and agents like indinavir or zoledronic acid [^2d0265d3] [^809fb38f].

> On exam, I will now examine for costovertebral angle tenderness, abdominal or flank masses, ecchymoses, and signs of peritoneal irritation. I should confirm blood pressure because new or uncontrolled hypertension can accompany Page kidney or renal ischemia, and I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on nephrolithiasis when the story deviates from classic colic [^e0f5b39b] [^d6838515].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before basic labs. I should double-check that urinalysis is obtained in essentially all patients to assess for hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria, recognizing that hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific for stones and that pyuria without bacteria suggests sterile inflammation or partial obstruction. A CBC and CMP help identify infection, renal function, and electrolyte disturbances, and LDH is particularly important when I suspect renal infarction or ischemia, where LDH is typically markedly elevated [^294e0532] [^f2929210] [^e0390613].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy because this is where practice varies and evidence matters. In nonpregnant adults with suspected first-time stone disease, noncontrast helical CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the first-line test due to its high sensitivity and specificity for ureteral stones and its ability to reveal alternative diagnoses. Ultrasound is reasonable first-line in children, pregnant patients, and those with recurrent stones or when radiation avoidance is prioritized, with CT reserved if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or suspicion remains high [^9797ba89] [^8eb6f68b] [^4b81d1a3] [^1d3e5163].

> I should confirm the role of contrast when the noncontrast CT is negative but suspicion persists for vascular, infectious, or neoplastic causes. Contrast-enhanced CT or CT urography can identify renal infarction, renal vein thrombosis, tumor, or complicated infection, and MR urography is an alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated. Importantly, contrast-enhanced CT can still exclude obstructing stones with high negative predictive value, though noncontrast CT remains standard for direct stone visualization [^501c6465] [^9459b520].

> Let me consider the differential beyond stones, because missing these carries real risk. Renal infarction presents with sudden severe flank pain, nausea, and often LDH elevation; risk factors include atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, or hypercoagulable states, and contrast-enhanced CT shows wedge-shaped nonenhancing defects. Renal vein thrombosis can mimic colic with hematuria and flank pain, and calcified RVT may be mistaken for a stone on ultrasound or noncontrast CT, so I should keep a high index of suspicion and use contrast-enhanced imaging when the story does not fit. Pyelonephritis and complicated infections, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, can present with flank pain and systemic toxicity and may require urgent drainage when obstruction is present. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage from spontaneous renal or adrenal sources can cause severe pain with or without shock. And in women, gynecologic emergencies such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy can masquerade as flank pain, so pregnancy testing and pelvic ultrasound are essential when appropriate [^f2929210] [^6fd963d4] [^9e42ee16] [^85cdd8de] [^9347322a] [^a0b790dd] [^3ed23374].

> But wait, what if the patient has ADPKD or is on anticoagulation. I need to ensure I differentiate cyst hemorrhage or infection from stone disease, because fever, leukocytosis, and CRP elevation push me toward cyst infection, whereas gross hematuria without fever favors hemorrhage. In ADPKD, direct trauma or vigorous activity can precipitate cyst rupture, so counseling and activity modification are part of management, and imaging may require MRI to characterize complex cysts when infection is suspected [^2d884389] [^48589676] [^e56163ac].

> I will now examine management pathways once the diagnosis is established. For confirmed ureteral stones, NSAIDs are first-line analgesia, opioids are second-line, and tamsulosin can facilitate passage of larger distal stones. Indications for urgent urology consultation include obstructed solitary kidney, bilateral obstruction, intractable pain or vomiting, sepsis, or deteriorating renal function. For renal infarction, anticoagulation is standard unless contraindicated. For infected or obstructed systems, timely antibiotics and decompression are critical. And for suspected renal trauma or hemorrhage, contrast-enhanced CT is indicated to guide intervention, with angioembolization for active extravasation [^2d0265d3] [^430f4f97] [^f2929210] [^9347322a].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition and follow-up plans. Many stable patients with small stones can be discharged with analgesia, antiemetics, straining instructions, and strainer if needed, with return precautions for fever, intractable pain, or oliguria. Follow-up imaging is generally unnecessary if symptoms resolve, but patients with persistent pain, large stones, or high-risk features warrant urology follow-up. In children, ultrasound-first strategies and careful metabolic evaluation are emphasized given the higher prevalence of occult stones and the risks of radiation [^2d0265d3] [^86fdf543].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Stabilize and screen for red flags, obtain a focused history and exam, order urinalysis with CBC and CMP plus LDH when ischemia is on the table, choose imaging based on pregnancy status and prior stone history with noncontrast CT as first-line in most adults and ultrasound prioritized in children and pregnancy, actively search for alternative diagnoses when the presentation is atypical or the initial studies are negative, and tailor management to the specific etiology with clear return precautions and follow-up. This approach balances diagnostic yield, radiation safety, and timely recognition of dangerous mimics [^9797ba89] [^8eb6f68b] [^1d3e5163].

---

Flank pain workup should start with a **focused history and exam** to identify red flags and guide testing [^2d0265d3]. Order **urinalysis, CBC, and renal function tests** to screen for infection, hematuria, and renal impairment [^2d0265d3]. Use **non-contrast CT** as first-line imaging for suspected stones or when the diagnosis is unclear, reserving ultrasound for pregnancy, children, or recurrent stones [^9797ba89] [^8eb6f68b] [^4b81d1a3]. If CT is negative or contrast is needed, consider contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to evaluate for vascular, infectious, or neoplastic causes [^501c6465]. Always consider alternative diagnoses — such as renal infarction, pyelonephritis, renal vein thrombosis, or musculoskeletal pain — and tailor imaging accordingly [^e12d7f2b] [^f2929210] [^6fd963d4] [^543dccb1].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough **clinical history and physical examination** are essential to narrow the differential diagnosis and guide appropriate testing:

- **Onset and duration**: Sudden onset suggests renal colic, renal infarction, or vascular events; chronic pain suggests musculoskeletal, chronic renal, or gastrointestinal causes [^notfound].

- **Pain characteristics**: Colicky pain radiating to the groin suggests nephrolithiasis; constant pain suggests infection, inflammation, or malignancy [^2d0265d3].

- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, dysuria, or urinary frequency suggest infection; nausea and vomiting are common with renal colic; hematuria suggests stones or renal parenchymal disease [^2d0265d3].

- **Risk factors**: Prior stones, urinary tract infections, trauma, malignancy, or anticoagulation use should be elicited [^notfound].

- **Physical examination**: Costovertebral angle tenderness supports renal pathology; abdominal masses or peritoneal signs may indicate alternative diagnoses [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are essential to identify **infection, renal impairment, and metabolic abnormalities**:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Urinalysis | All patients | - Hematuria <br/> - Pyuria <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Bacteriuria [^2d0265d3] |
| CBC | Suspected infection or inflammation | Leukocytosis suggests infection or inflammation [^notfound] |
| Renal function tests (BUN, creatinine) | Suspected renal impairment | Elevated levels indicate renal dysfunction [^notfound] |
| Electrolytes | Suspected metabolic disturbances | Abnormalities may indicate endocrine or renal causes [^notfound] |
| LDH | Suspected renal infarction | Markedly elevated LDH is suggestive of renal infarction [^f2929210] |

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging is critical to identify the **cause of flank pain**. The choice depends on clinical suspicion, patient factors, and resource availability:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast CT (NCCT) | First-line for suspected nephrolithiasis or unclear diagnosis | - High sensitivity and specificity for stones <br/> - Detects alternative diagnoses [^8eb6f68b] [^e12d7f2b] | Radiation exposure [^c7c9227e] |
| Ultrasound | - Pregnancy <br/> - Children <br/> - Recurrent stones <br/> - Contrast allergy | - No radiation <br/> - Detects hydronephrosis <br/> - Stones > 5 mm [^4b81d1a3] [^8eb6f68b] | Lower sensitivity for small stones [^8eb6f68b] |
| Contrast-enhanced CT | Suspected vascular, infectious, or neoplastic causes | - Detailed vascular and soft tissue assessment <br/> - Detects tumors and abscesses [^501c6465] | Radiation and contrast risks [^notfound] |
| MRI | - Contrast allergy <br/> - Pregnancy (second trimester) <br/> - Detailed soft tissue assessment | - No radiation <br/> - High soft tissue contrast [^notfound] | Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time [^notfound] |

---

## Common alternative diagnoses

Flank pain has a broad differential; **important alternatives to nephrolithiasis** include:

- **Renal infarction**: Sudden severe pain, elevated LDH, wedge-shaped defects on contrast CT [^f2929210].

- **Pyelonephritis**: Fever, dysuria, leukocytosis, positive urinalysis [^notfound].

- **Renal vein thrombosis**: Flank pain, hematuria, risk factors such as nephrotic syndrome or hypercoagulable states [^9e42ee16].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Localized tenderness, reproducible with movement [^notfound].

- **Gastrointestinal causes**: Pancreatitis, diverticulitis, appendicitis [^e12d7f2b].

---

## Special populations

Certain populations require **tailored approaches**:

- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound first-line; MRI or low-dose CT if ultrasound is inconclusive [^4b81d1a3].

- **Children**: Ultrasound first-line; CT reserved for inconclusive cases [^2d0265d3].

- **Elderly**: Higher suspicion for malignancy, vascular events, and complicated infections [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and management

Management depends on the **identified cause**:

- **Nephrolithiasis**: Analgesia, hydration, medical expulsive therapy, and urology referral if indicated [^2d0265d3].

- **Infection**: Antibiotics, hydration, and close follow-up [^notfound].

- **Vascular events**: Anticoagulation, vascular consultation, and monitoring [^e80bbbd6].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Conservative management, physical therapy, and analgesia [^notfound].

---

A structured approach to flank pain — history, exam, targeted labs, and judicious imaging — ensures **accurate diagnosis and timely management** while minimizing unnecessary radiation and costs [^9797ba89].

### Acute flank pain secondary to urolithiasis: radiologic evaluation and alternate diagnoses [^af229c45]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

This article discusses the radiologic management of the patient who has acute flank pain. It describes the evolution of radiologic imaging in patients who present with acute symptoms caused by suspected urolithiasis, the advantages of unenhanced helical CT and the limitations of abdominal radiography, intravenous urography, and ultrasonography in this setting, and the alternative diagnoses encountered within the urinary tract, abdomen, and pelvis.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^294e0532]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Pulmonary embolism presenting as flank pain: a case series [^ae59f1fd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease that can be effectively treated once diagnosed. Due to insidious and often cryptogenic presentations, the diagnosis of this disease can easily elude clinicians. Over the last several years the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning has improved the clinician's ability to diagnose PE. In addition, the widespread use of CT to investigate other complaints such as flank and abdominal pain could theoretically result in radiographic findings not previously identified that could point to the diagnosis of PE. The current case series reveals the unexpected and initially unrecognized CT finding of a pulmonary infarct in two patients presenting with flank pain; a third patient presented with flank pain and was also found to have a PE.

Objective

We describe three cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

Case Reports

The cases reported here discuss patients who presented with flank pain and were ultimately diagnosed with PE. In the first two cases, the patients had incidental findings of pulmonary infiltrates on abdominal CT scans, which prompted further diagnostic investigation. In the third case, the patient had risk factors for PE and presented with flank pain and the diagnosis was quickly made by CT imaging.

Conclusion

Physicians should consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with isolated flank pain. Additionally, unexpected pulmonary findings on abdominal CT scans may help suggest the diagnosis of PE in the appropriate clinical setting.

### What do we miss without contrast in patients with flank pain? [^3f41dbff]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Flank pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, and the most frequent cause of flank pain is urolithiasis. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and renal artery thrombosis are rare causes of abdominal pain which can result in renal parenchymal injury. They are mostly difficult to diagnose and treat in the emergency setting. The present report describes 2 patients admitted to the emergency department because of acute flank pain who were diagnosed with renal infarction.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^9da89a27]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. The most frequent cause is urolithiasis, but many other entities can cause the same clinical presentation. In many institutions unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is used in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

### SONO case series: 35-year-old male patient with flank pain [^33db7039]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of obstructing nephrolithiasis by emergency physicians has undergone great advancements in the past few years. No longer do all patients with suspected renal colic need a CT scan and an immediate urology consult. In this case presentation, we present a classic case of obstructing nephrolithiasis along with the associated point-of-care ultrasound images. We will walk with the reader through a series of questions and answers discussing the patient's diagnosis based on the most current evidence-based recommendations.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as bilateral flank pain and hematuria: a case report [^c1434a89]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease whose incidence is now increasing. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with bilateral flank pain and hematuria, subsequently diagnosed with TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has classically been characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of the disease has been a mystery until recently. We review the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and management of this disorder. Our discussion focuses on the importance of understanding this disease while considering the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia because the common pitfall of rapidly administering platelets to a patient with TTP may lead to a disastrous outcome.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^e6210545]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for the investigation of patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls, that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some of the common pitfalls, together with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^e0f5b39b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with flank pain and hematuria are common emergency department presentations of nephrolithiasis. We may anchor on this etiology and potentially miss other less common differentials. We present a case of a patient with hematuria and flank pain typical of nephrolithiasis who was diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension. A 50 year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. We pursued a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and found a left renal subcapsular hematoma on non-contrast CT. A CTA was done with no active hemorrhage found. The patient had no history of recent trauma and was found to be hypertensive on evaluation. Urology was consulted and management for the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page Kidney and admitted to medicine for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Page Kidney is a diagnosis that describes compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass causing secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment may involve conservative measures including hypertension management, or more invasive measures like evacuation or nephrectomy. We describe the case of a patient presumed to have nephrolithiasis presenting with typical left-sided flank pain, diagnosed with Page kidney, and treated conservatively.

### Acute renal artery infarction secondary to dysfibrinogenemia [^4379fd68]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The patient's initial presentation of flank pain has a broad differential diagnosis. Early in the case, nephrolithiasis was the leading diagnosis given the exquisite flank pain that did not resolve with position changes. However, urinalysis did not reveal microscopic haematuria, and recent non-contrast CT was negative for calculi or hydronephrosis. Given the patient's medical history of rhabdomyolysis and recent intense exercise, acute rhabdomyolysis was also considered but excluded based on a normal creatine kinase level. With no acute urinary complaints of hesitancy, frequency or dysuria and no objective evidence of infection (no fever, no leucocytosis, benign urinalysis and no fluid collections on radiography), acute urinary tract infection or occult abscess was low on the differential diagnosis. Prior to the contrast CT, musculoskeletal exacerbation of a previous injury, such as an insult to the psoas or quadratus lumborum muscles, was also considered.

On follow-up imaging, radiology suggested a possible aneurysm, which expanded the differential diagnosis to also include infarction due to dissection in addition to the diagnosis of renal artery infarction due to thrombus formation or embolism. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and/or aneurysm is quite rare, with an incidence of < 0.05% with approximately only 180 cases having been reported. In a longitudinal study of 438 patients with renal infarction, 21 patients had renal artery dissection or aneurysm, and 29 patients had hypercoagulable states. Given the rarity of the spontaneous dissection and aneurysm and the high prevalence of thrombus formation in natural history of congenital dysfibrinogenemia and no evidence of dissection on initial contrast-enhanced study, renal artery infarct due to thrombus formation or embolism was more likely. Furthermore, further review of the imaging demonstrated a vessel at the level of incident with the same diameter before and after the severe stenosis, less indicative of aneurysm or dissection.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^85cdd8de]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

### Sexually active cisgender female adolescent with red urine and abdominal pain [^101d1af0]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical Course

A sexually active cisgender female adolescent with a two-week history of back pain presented to clinic with red urine, dysuria, nausea, and diarrhea. On examination, she was found to have CMT and negative STI screens. She was diagnosed with PID. The patient visited the ED for continued abdominal pain three days after initiating treatment for PID. Imaging ruled out tubular ovarian abscess (TOA). She later returned to her PCP's office with improved nausea and pain.

Final Diagnosis

Pelvic inflammatory disease.

Making a Diagnosis of PID

PID is a clinical diagnosis, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends presumptive treatment for women at risk of STIs with pelvic or lower abdominal pain AND at least one of the following four criteria: (1) no other cause for the illness can be identified, (2) CMT, (3) uterine tenderness, or (4) adnexal tenderness.

Supportive examination and laboratory findings include fever, vaginal discharge with white blood cells (WBCs) on microscopy, elevated CRP and ESR, and positive STI tests. These are not required for diagnosis. This patient had abdominal pain, CMT, and mildly elevated ESR. Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment should not wait for laboratory results and are imperative to avoid complications. Frequently, as with this patient, STI results may be negative as testing for many implicated pathogens is not readily accessible (see section "Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female") and the available STI testing is conducted on a sample collected from the lower reproductive tract, not the upper reproductive organs.

Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female

Several diagnoses were considered for this patient (Table 1). The differential diagnosis for PID can be even more broad.

### Imaging of flank pain: readdressing state-of-the-art [^c7c9227e]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pain resulting from renal and ureteral stones is a common cause for patients presenting in the acute setting. Since the late 1990s, computed tomography (CT) has been the initial imaging method of choice to evaluate patients with suspected ureteral stones; however, concerns regarding both radiation dose and cost-effectiveness have prompted investigations into a different imaging algorithm. Studies utilizing ultrasound have provided evidence indicating that it may be a more appropriate first step, with selective use of CT in selected cases, in the diagnostic work-up. Techniques have evolved with low-dose CT, dual-energy CT, and magnetic resonance urography emerging as useful in imaging of renal colic patients. This manuscript reviews the current literature on state-of-the-art imaging for acute flank pain and proposes a new imaging algorithm in the evaluation of patients with acute flank pain and suspected ureteral stones.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^9797ba89]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain unenhanced CT for the initial imaging of acute-onset flank pain in patients with suspected urolithiasis and with no history or remote history of stone disease.
Consider obtaining ultrasound, with or without color Doppler, of kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal in these patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain unenhanced CT as the follow-up imaging for recurrent symptoms of stone disease in patients with acute-onset flank pain with known current stone disease diagnosed on recent imaging.
Consider obtaining color Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT in these patients.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and therapy for acute loin pain [^8ad0a3c7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and flank pain in combination with acute elevation of blood pressure should raise high suspicion of renal infarction. However, because of its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis may be delayed. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a 2-day history of right flank pain that was treated initially as a renal stone. He had a background history of atrial fibrillation. Further investigations confirmed this as a case of renal infarction. Renal infarction is underdiagnosed because of the similarity of its presentation to other renal pathology. Renal infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of loin pain, particularly in a patient with atrial fibrillation.

### Spontaneous adrenal haemorrhage after catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^ec08c12a]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation is established as a first-line therapy for most patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with high success rates and very low complication rates. A 60-year-old woman developed severe right flank pain following straightforward catheter ablation for SVT. This was caused by a spontaneous right adrenal haemorrhage, which, after much delay, was eventually recognised as the cause of her symptoms. Adrenal haematomas are rare and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous adrenal haemorrhage occurring after any interventional cardiac procedure. Clinicians should be aware of this rare but potentially serious complication and consider it as a differential diagnosis in any patient with severe flank pain following interventional cardiac procedures, to prevent delays in diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^8eb6f68b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Noncontrast CT (NCCT) is the imaging study of choice for initial evaluation of patients with acute onset of flank pain and suspicion of stone disease without known prior stone disease. NCCT can reliably characterize the location and size of an offending ureteral calculus, identify complications, and diagnose alternative etiologies of abdominal pain. Although less sensitive in the detection of stones, ultrasound may have a role in evaluating for signs of obstruction. Radiography potentially has a role, although has been shown to be less sensitive than NCCT. For patients with known disease and recurrent symptoms of urolithiasis, NCCT remains the test of choice for evaluation. In pregnancy, given radiation concerns, ultrasound is recommended as the initial modality of choice with potential role for noncontrast MRI. In scenarios where stone disease suspected and initial NCCT is inconclusive, contrast-enhanced imaging, either with MRI or CT/CT urogram may be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^501c6465]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining magnetic resonance urography, contrast-enhanced CT, or contrast-enhanced CT urography as the next imaging in patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease if unenhanced CT is inconclusive for the presence of stones.

### Sudden onset flank pain: a case report of retroperitoneal hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured adrenal hemangioma [^17a5fd00]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a common complaint of patients presenting at the emergency department (ED). It can be caused by a broad spectrum of diseases. Providing care for patients with acute abdominal pain requires familiarity with the epidemiology, prevalence, and presentation of abdominal pathology, as well as a working knowledge of the differential diagnoses.

Case report

In this article, we discuss a case of spontaneous rupture of adrenal hemangioma with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage in a 31-year-old female.

Discussion

Emergency physicians regularly encounter uncommon causes of abdominal pain. Spontaneous rupture of adrenal hemangioma is an extremely rare cause of abdominal pain, but proper understanding of the disease process will aid clinicians to make a final diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment. In this study, presentations and risk factors for spontaneous, atraumatic rupture of adrenal hemangioma as well as ED management and definitive treatment options are discussed.

### Wunderlich syndrome: wonder what It is [^a0b790dd]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Wunderlich syndrome (WS) refers to spontaneous renal or perinephric hemorrhage occurring in the absence of known trauma. WS is much less common than hemorrhage occurring after iatrogenic or traumatic conditions. Lenk's triad of acute onset flank pain, flank mass, and hypovolemic shock is a classic presentation of WS but seen in less than a quarter of patients. The majority of patients present only with isolated flank pain and often imaged with an unenhanced CT in the emergency department. The underlying etiology is varied with most cases attributed to neoplasms, vascular disease, cystic renal disease and anticoagulation induced; the etiology is often occult on the initial exam and further evaluation is necessary. Urologists are familiar with this unique entity but radiologists, who are more likely to be the first to diagnose WS, may not be familiar with the imaging work up and management options. In the last decade or so, there has been a conspicuous shift in the approach to WS and thus it will be worthwhile to revisit WS in detail. In our review, we will review the multimodality imaging approach to WS, describe optimal follow up and elaborate on management.

Practice point 2.2.1 — evaluation of chronic kidney pain in ADPKD advises that chronic flank, abdominal, or lumbar pain in people with ADPKD should be investigated to rule out causes other than ADPKD or complications from ADPKD, with examples including mechanical or spinal back pain, malignancy in older people, and chronic or recurrent cyst infection.

### Chronic back pain: recognising twelfth rib syndrome [^543dccb1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Chronic back pain is commonly attributed to musculoskeletal or spinal issues, but rarer conditions like twelfth rib syndrome can often be overlooked, leading to ineffective treatments. This case presents a male in his 50s with persistent left-sided flank pain, initially attributed to low back pain and degenerative disc disease. Despite conservative treatments, his symptoms persisted, prompting further investigation. A physical examination revealed localised tenderness over the twelfth rib, and a trigger-point injection provided immediate pain relief, confirming the diagnosis of twelfth rib syndrome. Differential diagnoses, including musculoskeletal pain, slipping rib syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, pleuritis, renal pathology and costochondritis, were considered but ruled out. The patient's treatment involved trigger-point injections and physical therapy, resulting in significant symptom improvement. This case emphasises the importance of considering twelfth rib syndrome in patients with unexplained flank pain, especially when standard treatments fail and highlights the role of targeted interventions in improving patient outcomes.

Practice points 2.6.3 and 2.6.4 — UTIs in ADPKD need differentiation from noninfectious processes and specific clinical features should trigger workup for kidney cyst infection: differentiate from cyst hemorrhage or kidney stone; overlapping presentations necessitate history, exam, labs and imaging; fever, abdominal or flank pain, elevated white blood cells, and elevated C-reactive protein suggest cyst infection or pyelonephritis, whereas gross hematuria without fever can occur with hemorrhage or stone and should not be treated with antibiotics absent proven infection; people with fever, acute abdominal or flank pain, and increased white blood cells and/or C-reactive protein should be worked up for kidney cyst infection.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain ultrasound of kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal as the initial or follow-up imaging of pregnant patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease.
Consider obtaining color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance urography, or unenhanced CT in these patients.

### Atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas in a young, healthy female [^84502ebb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinomas are rare and generally result from trauma to any part of the urinary collecting system. Appropriate imaging is crucial in the timely diagnosis and management of urinomas and for ruling out other etiologies such as subcapsular renal hematomas and perinephric abscesses.

Case Report

A 31-year-old woman with no past medical history or known trauma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a week of right flank pain, abdominal pain, and intermittent fevers. On point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), she was found to have a complex right perinephric collection, later confirmed with computed tomography (CT) imaging. She was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged after a 3-day hospital admission with instructions to follow up with Urology. A day later, she was readmitted with worsening bilateral flank pain and persistent fevers. Image-guided percutaneous aspirations of her bilateral perinephric fluid collections revealed both urine and blood. A right ureteral stent was then placed with ultimate resolution of her symptoms. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Urinomas without history of trauma are rare and should be on the differential for patients presenting with flank pain and infectious symptoms. Urinomas or other expanding perinephric fluid collections can result in superimposed infection, rupture, secondary hypertension, and renal failure. Here, we present an atypical case of atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas with hemorrhagic components in a young and healthy woman. Our case further outlines the utility of POCUS in the ED for the timely diagnosis and management of this disease process.

### A rare case of page kidney in a young man with flank pain [^d6838515]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Page kidney is a rare condition in which an external compression of the kidney as a result of a hematoma or mass causes renal ischemia and hypertension. In a patient with flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and recent trauma, this condition should be considered. Since this condition was first described in 1939, more than 100 case reports have surfaced.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain, vomiting, and elevated blood pressure. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a perinephric hematoma, and the interventional radiology team was consulted to resolve the Page kidney. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Symptoms seen in Page kidney may be similar to other more common diagnoses encountered in the emergency department. It is important to maintain a high suspicion and order imaging studies as needed, especially in the setting of trauma, or a recent procedure in the vicinity of the renal parenchyma.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^6fd963d4]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) with flank pain, and hematuria, is often mistaken with renal colic originating from ureteric or renal calculus. Especially in young and otherwise healthy patients, clinicians are easily misled by clinical presentation and calcified RVT.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old woman presented with flank pain and hematuria suggestive of renal calculus on ultrasound. She underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy that failed, leading to the recommendation that percutaneous lithotomy was necessary to remove the renal calculus. In preoperative view of the unusual shape of the calculus without hydronephrosis, noncontrast computed tomography was taken and demonstrated left ureteric calculus. However computed tomography angiography revealed, to our surprise, a calcified RVT that was initially thought to be a urinary calculus.

Conclusion

This case shows that a calcified RVT might mimic a urinary calculus on conventional ultrasonography and ureteric calculus on noncontrast computed tomography. Subsequent computed tomography angiography disclosed that a calcified RVT caused the imaging findings, thus creating a potentially dangerous clinical pitfall. Hence, it is suggested that the possibility of a RVT needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever one detects an uncommon shape for a urinary calculus.

### An easily missed diagnosis: flank pain and nutcracker syndrome [^d64e38f2]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care doctor's office with left flank pain. CT of the abdomen showed an isolated left renal vein thrombus. The clot was initially attributed to her oral contraceptive use; however, closer inspection of CT images revealed nutcracker phenomenon (compression of the renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta). Intravascular ultrasound imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Nutcracker syndrome is a rare condition, which if left untreated may cause damage to the left kidney. Although under diagnosed, there are several treatment options available ranging from simple surveillance to surgical resolution.

### Sudden onset flank pain: a case report of retroperitoneal hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured adrenal hemangioma [^1bb2afbf]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is cited as the most common reason for visiting the emergency department (ED) in the 18- to 64-year age group and is the third most common reason in the population older than 65 years. A patient's age, sex, risk factors, and comorbid conditions help guide differential diagnoses, risk stratification, and management. However, atypical presentations of serious pathology may share many symptoms with more benign causes of abdominal pain (Table 1). In this article, we discuss a case of a 31-year-old female presenting with sudden onset of right flank pain and hypotension (85/50 mmHg), which was initially suspected as abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture but was confirmed to be a case of spontaneous rupture of adrenal hemangioma with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Appropriate treatment options and ED management vary based on patient risk factors, stability, and etiology of hemorrhage, which are discussed in this report.

### Unusual solution to abdominal pain with contrast enhanced ultrasound [^00fb23da]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Splenic infarction might be the symptom onset of an important underlying disease. The possibility of splenic infarction must be inserted into differential diagnosis in all those patients who have pain in the upper left quadrant and/or on the left flank. When faced with a case of splenic infarction in a patient who has flown or climbed to high altitudes, it is appropriate to consider the possibility of an haemoglobinopathy. The diagnosis is far from being obvious for emergency physicians. For these reasons, it is very important to proceed as a multidisciplinary team with appropriate diagnostic examinations. The European Guidelines for non-hepatic applications of contrast enhanced ultrasound suggest the usage of this tool for investigation of suspected ischaemic lesions of the spleen.

### Modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain: review of all imaging modalities [^31abc95f]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common and complex clinical problem which might be caused by a variety of urinary and extraurinary abnormalities among which ureterolithiasis being the most frequent cause. Plain abdominal radiographs combined with intravenous urography (IVU) have been the standard imaging procedures of choice for the evaluation of acute flank pain over the last decades. Direct detection of even small ureteral calculi is achieved in 40–60%, whereas using indirect signs such as ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation stone detection is possible in up to 80–90% of all cases. However, IVU might be hampered by poor quality due to lack of bowel preparation, by nephrotoxicity of contrast agents, by serious allergic and anaphylactic reactions in 10% and 1% of the patients, respectively, and by significant radiation exposure. The use of ultrasonography (US) in the management of acute flank pain has been growing and when combining the findings of pyeloureteral dilatation, direct visualization of stones, and the absence of ureteral ejaculation, the sensitivity to detect ureteral dilatation can be as high as 96%. Recently, unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) has been introduced as imaging modality with a high sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of acute flank pain. UHCT has been demonstrated to be superior since (1) it detects ureteral stones with a sensitivity and specificity from 98% to 100% regardless of size, location and chemical composition, (2) it identifies extraurinary causes of flank pain in about one third of all patients presenting with acute flank pain, (3) it does not need contrast agent, and (4) it is a time saving imaging technique being performed within 5min. Based on the data published, one can predict that UHCT will become the imaging procedure of choice for evaluation of acute flank pain within the next years. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the role all imaging modalities available for a modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain with regard to their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and their complications, toxicicty and morbidity.

### Abstract… [^3f130dc3]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Occupational Dermatitis Occupational skin exposure is the second most common cause of occupational disorders, with a rate of 2. 3 injuries per 10, 000 workers. Occupational Musculoskeletal Disorders Occupational musculoskeletal disorders are injuries or disorders of the muscles, tendons, joints, cartilage, and nerves that are caused or exacerbated by sudden exertion or prolonged exposure to physical factors such as repetitive movement, force, vibration, or awkward positions. Common upper-limb disorders include shoulder disorders, lateral epicondylitis, wrist tendinitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome, in addition to nonspecific strains, sprains, muscle tears, back pain, and hernias. Approximately one-half of occupational musculoskeletal disorders occur in those working in the manufacturing and services industries. Family physicians should inquire about routine heavy lifting, daily exposure to vibrations, routine overhead work, and repetitive forceful tasks.

Workers at risk of occupational musculoskeletal disorders should be encouraged to engage in physical activity and maintain a healthy weight to reduce disease progression. Workplace adaption is critical for prevention and treatment of occupational musculoskeletal disorders. Ideally, the hazard should be removed. Engineering controls should alter factors of applied force, fixed body position, and pace of work. Administrative controls can protect workers through job rotation, forced breaks, and alteration of work pace. A systematic review of workplace-based interventions for the prevention of upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders showed a positive effect of resistance exercise.
38. Treatment is mainly conservative with rest, activity modification, splinting at the wrist/elbow, physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroid injections. Using a differently configured keyboard may be beneficial.

41 General recommendations with poor evidence include modifying duties, evaluating the workstation, and decreasing exposure to hand vibration. 41 Surgery is reserved for severe, refractory cases.
42. EPICONDYLITIS Epicondylitis occurs with medial or lateral repetitive motion injuries. Lateral epicondylitis is characterized by pain over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and is commonly referred to as tennis elbow. Medial epicondylitis occurs on the medial epicondyle and is commonly referred to as golfer's elbow. Workers with medial epicondylitis have an increased risk of other associated upper-limb musculoskeletal disorders. Forceful work, such as wrist bending/twisting and forearm twisting/rotating, is a risk factor for medial epicondylitis and is common in assembly-line workers.

### Arteriovenous malformation mimicking a renal-cell carcinoma [^baee50c1]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a renal arteriovenous malformation in a patient with a 1-month history of flank pain. Imaging studies were interpreted as being consistent with renal-cell carcinoma. However, Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated turbulent blood flow, and selective renal angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation. Embolization relieved the pain. This case calls attention to the need to consider arteriovenous malformations in the differential diagnosis of central homogenously enhancing renal lesions.

### CT for the evaluation of flank pain [^a1184e2e]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologist and urologist, but a number of signs are highly predictive of stone. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to convey an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan requires no contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost effective. It behooves both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Sudden onset flank pain: spontaneous renal rupture [^a76059cb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Undifferentiated abdominal pain is a common condition encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's age, risk factors, and comorbidities often aid in risk stratification and guide emergency department evaluation, atypical presentations of serious disease may still occur suddenly in young otherwise healthy patients.

Case Report

In this vignette we discuss a case of spontaneous, atraumatic renal rupture with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich's Syndrome) in a 22year old male.

Discussion

Emergency physicians regularly encounter uncommon causes of abdominal pain. Wunderlich's syndrome is rare but proper understanding of the disease process will aid in decision making and improve disposition and outcomes for patients. Likely presentations and risk factors for atraumatic renal rupture will be discussed as well as ED management and definitive treatment options.

### Urolithiasis in children: medical approach [^cde0dcb4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The classic adult presentation of acute, severe flank pain, which radiates to the groin is uncommon in children, particularly in children younger than 5 years. Although adolescents present similarly to adult patients, younger children have varied presentations including nonspecific pain localized to the abdomen, flank, or pelvis. In infants, symptoms of stones may be confused with colic pain. Macroscopic or microscopic hematuria can occur in up to 90% of children with urolithiasis. Ureteral stones are much more likely to cause obstruction that leads to pain. Renal stones may be found incidentally and remain present for years without causing symptoms. Approximately 10% of calculi can present with dysuria and urinary frequency and are usually localized to the lower urinary tract. UTI may also complicate nephrolithiasis, although pyuria may also be present without bacteriuria or infection. Rarely, a urethral stone can present with acute urinary obstruction.

### Ureterolithiasis: classical and atypical findings on unenhanced helical computed tomography [^5d6fa105]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Evaluation of patients with acute flank pain using helical computed tomography (CT) is a well-accepted, rapid, and safe procedure in the emergency setting. Various primary and secondary signs are described in the literature for evaluation of these patients. Our purpose is to demonstrate both the classical findings associated with ureteral calculi on unenhanced helical CT and atypical findings and potential pitfalls. We also provide readers with a systematic approach to interpreting unenhanced helical CT scans performed for acute flank pain.

### Mimics of renal colic: alternative diagnoses at unenhanced helical CT [^e12d7f2b]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

During the past decade, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the standard of reference in the detection of urinary calculi owing to its high sensitivity (> 95%) and specificity (> 98%) in this setting. Numerous diseases may manifest as acute flank pain and mimic urolithiasis. Up to one-third of unenhanced CT examinations performed because of flank pain may reveal unsuspected findings unrelated to stone disease, many of which can help explain the patient's condition. Alternative diagnoses are most commonly related to gynecologic conditions (especially adnexal masses) and nonstone genitourinary disease (eg, pyelonephritis, renal neoplasm), closely followed by gastrointestinal disease (especially appendicitis and diverticulitis). Hepatobiliary, vascular, and musculoskeletal conditions may also be encountered. Vascular causes of acute flank pain must always be considered, since these constitute life-threatening emergencies that may require the intravenous administration of contrast material for diagnosis. Radiologists must be familiar with the typical findings of urinary stone disease at unenhanced CT, as well as the spectrum of alternative diagnoses that may be detected with this modality, to accurately diagnose the source of flank pain.

### Inferior lumbar triangle hernia with incarceration [^a8d24d8f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lumbar hernia is a rare condition in which intra or extraperitoneal tissue protrudes through a defect in the posterolateral region of the flank. Incarceration is uncommon but represents a surgical emergency when present. A 54-year-old-male presented to the ED after sudden onset left flank pain after coughing. He was in significant distress secondary to pain and vomiting, and his physical exam revealed a tender mass in his left lateral lumbar region near the site of a previous stab wound. Bedside ultrasound revealed a fluid-filled structure, and CT scan demonstrated herniation of small bowel though the inferior lumbar triangle with associated small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent emergent surgical reduction with mesh repair and recovered uneventfully. Incarcerated lumbar hernia represents a rare diagnosis that may not be at the forefront of most practitioners' differential diagnoses. CT scan is useful to distinguish hernia from solid mass, abscess, or other pathology, while bedside ultrasound may prompt an attempt at immediate reduction. The presence of incarcerated bowel or obstruction warrants immediate surgical consultation.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^22fcefa9]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Presentation and diagnosis of RCC — symptom patterns, incidental detection, and examination findings are characterized: The "classic triad" of symptoms associated with a malignant renal mass includes hematuria, flank pain and abdominal mass, and these symptoms are uncommon in clinically localized disease; in fact, less than 5 percent of patients in contemporary series present with these symptoms and greater than 50 percent of renal masses are diagnosed incidentally during an evaluation for unrelated signs or symptoms; physical examination has a limited role in the diagnosis of clinically localized disease, while paraneoplastic syndromes (i.e., hypertension, polycythemia, hypercalcemia) are present in approximately 10–20 percent of patients with metastatic RCC.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: a report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^d462ba93]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not an uncommon disease in an emergency department (ED). It manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation of pain to the back and flank region. Isolated left flank pain being the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Having negative findings on an ultrasound initially, she was misdiagnosed as having possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography showed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collected extending to the left peri-renal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also discussed the clinical pitfalls in this case.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^1fb3657c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Non-obstructing kidney stones with flank pain — elective surgery: For adult patients with flank pain and non-obstructing kidney stones on the ipsilateral side who have no other identifiable source of pain, clinicians may offer elective surgical treatment (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The relationship between non-obstructing kidney stones and pain remains uncertain, and several studies have shown a reduction in pain for patients undergoing surgery for this indication; accordingly, the Panel believes that patients with pain and non-obstructing kidney stones, which would otherwise be left untreated, may be offered surgical intervention when the pain is consistent with stone-related symptoms and other causes have been reasonably excluded, and clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD — chronic kidney pain evaluation and management: Chronic flank, abdominal, or lumbar pain in people with ADPKD should be investigated to rule out causes other than ADPKD (e.g., mechanical or spinal back pain or malignancy in older people) or complications from ADPKD (e.g., chronic low-grade infection or stones). Refractory chronic kidney pain in people with ADPKD is best managed by a multidisciplinary team as indicated, including nephrology, radiology, algology, psychology or psychiatry, physiotherapy, urology, and hepatology. Shared decision-making between the healthcare provider and the person with ADPKD or their caregiver should guide pain management strategies in ADPKD.

### Spontaneous urinary extravasation: detection rate with 64-row multidetector computed tomography in patients presenting with acute abdomen [^9212eef4]. Emergency Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to detect the rate of spontaneous urinary extravasation (SUE) with computed tomography (CT) in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Seven hundred thirteen abdominal CT examinations with i.v. contrast media requested mainly from the emergency department and urology clinics for sudden onset abdominal pain, flank pain, nonspecific abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, and renal colic between September 2007 and August 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Only adult patients were included in the study. Three patients with SUE were detected. One had a mid-ureteral stone while the etiology for the other two patients was unknown. Two of the patients were treated conservatively; one was treated with stenting with a double-j catheter. SUE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute abdomen and perinephric-periureteral fluid collection inconsistent with stone size and who are occasionally stone free. Early and precise diagnosis of SUE plays an important role in the management protocol of patients presenting with acute abdomen.

### Renal infarction in the ED: 10-year experience and review of the literature [^f2929210]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to describe clinical and radiologic features of acute renal infarction (RI).

Methods

Clinical, computed tomography (CT), and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed for patients diagnosed from 1999 to 2009 with CT proof of acute RI. Possible etiology of infarction was recorded. All available published series of RI were reviewed.

Results

Thirty-eight patients with acute RI met inclusion criteria; 127 cases of RI from 7 previous series were pooled for analysis. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain, flank pain, nausea, and vomiting. Leukocytosis (> 10 × 10(9)/L) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (> 620 IU/L) were the most prominent laboratory findings. Computed tomography features included wedge-shaped hypodensities in the renal parenchyma in 35 (92%) and global renal ischemia in 3 (8%) patients; 13 patients (34%) had concomitant splenic infarction. The most common etiology was atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography determined the specific cause for RI in 5 patients (13%) and a possible etiology in 17 (45%). Exact correlation with previous series was limited by methodological diversity.

Conclusion

Renal infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal or flank pain. Laboratory workup should include lactate dehydrogenase levels. After ruling out stone disease, contrast-enhanced CT examination is essential for the diagnosis.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: case report [^9845aac6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), pyelonephritis is a fairly common diagnosis, especially in patients with unilateral flank pain. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare type of pyelonephritis that is associated with unique features, which may lead to its diagnosis.

Case Report

A 30-year-old male patient presented to the ED for evaluation of right-sided abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past 24 hours. He noted the pain was located predominantly in the right flank and described it as sharp in nature. The pain was nonradiating and was associated with scant hematuria. He stated that he had similar pains approximately 1 month earlier that resolved after a few days. The patient underwent a bedside ultrasound and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an enlarged, multiloculated right kidney with dilated calyces and a large staghorn calculus, findings that represent XGP. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights an unusual variant of pyelonephritis, a relatively common ED diagnosis. XGP should be considered in patients with recurrent pyelonephritis, as treatment for XGP may require surgical intervention in addition to traditional antibiotic management.

### Flank pain as a symptom of COVID-19 [^d738a3d7]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 disease is spreading rapidly worldwide, and no vaccine or very effective drug has been found yet. However, the transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by taking precautions. Therefore, it is essential to detect the patients early to prevent the spread of the disease. 1, 2 We report a case of 26-year-old male patient who was admitted to our urology outpatient clinic with the complaint of flank pain and had incidental findings of COVID-19 in the lung bases on abdominal CT.

### The journey and barriers to treatment of patients with renal nutcracker syndrome [^1b8560fd]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To better understand renal nutcracker syndrome (NCS) from a patients' perspective starting at presentation and followed through to diagnosis and management METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted on a national level via a self-selected online survey distributed via river sampling by a post on the Facebook Page 'Renal Nutcracker Syndrome Support Group'.
Results

Of the 22 responses collected, 95.5% were female and 91% self-identified as White. 43% experienced symptoms as teenagers and 62% were diagnosed as young adults. Prior to receiving a definitive diagnosis, over half of the respondents were worked up for kidney stones (57%) and ovarian cysts (48%) and saw at least 10–15 providers. Nearly 80% experienced constant pain throughout the day. Pain management included prescription oral pain relievers (38%), prescription patches (29%), and physical therapy (19%). Surgical procedures included nephrectomy with auto transplant (38%), left renal vein transposition (10%), and laparoscopic extravascular stent placement (10%). Respondents had high healthcare utilization for management of NCS. Nearly 30% were unable to work and had filed for disability.

Conclusion

Awareness of NCS should increase among healthcare providers of all specialties to improve quality of care to those living with NCS. It is crucial to keep NCS within the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with gross hematuria and unusual abdominal and/or flank pain.

### Rare case of atypical crescentic glomerulonephritis and interstitial lung disease with negative Anti-GBM antibody and positive anti-MPO antibody [^e212f7be]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for gross haematuria is broad and begins with a urinalysis (UA) to confirm the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and rule out mimickers such as myoglobin from rhabdomyolysis. In this case, the UA showed 11–50 RBCs per high-powered field, suggesting that blood, not myoglobin, was being lost in the urine.

In addition, a complete blood count was obtained and showed an anaemia with haemoglobin (Hgb) of 67 g/L and haematocrit of 20.3% (table 1). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly elevated at 102 FL; however, the patient's baseline MCV was high in the 90s, and repeat testing was within the normal limits. As a precaution, causes of macrocytic anaemia such as folate and vitamin B 12 deficiency were ruled out by lab testing. Overall, the patient's normocytic anaemia was interpreted as a combination of anaemia of CKD exacerbated by blood loss in the urine.

Table 1
Complete blood count

The next step depends on if acute onset unilateral flank pain is present. If so, a workup for nephrolithiasis is indicated. The patient described an insidious onset of mild right-sided flank pain, which is atypical of nephrolithiasis, nevertheless a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in the ED to evaluate for stones. The imaging did not show any evidence of obstructions or hydronephrosis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 0.2 cm non-obstructing stones in the lower left pole of the kidney but no hydronephrosis.

The next diagnosis to workup is a urinary tract infection (UTI). The UA from the ED was positive for nitrates and trace leucocyte esterase, so a urine culture was sent to evaluate for infection. The culture came back positive for more than three organisms, which was considered to be the result of contamination. A second UA was negative for both nitrates and leucocyte esterase. Given the lack of clinical suspicion for UTI, repeat culture testing was withheld while more likely alternative diagnoses were pursued.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^8c6f7e82]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Kidney Cancer — initial evaluation and staging describe typical and less common presentations and specify recommended assessments. Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with "a suspicious mass involving the kidney that has been visualized using a radiographic study, often a CT scan," and with wider imaging use "the frequency of incidental detection of RCC has increased… and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain)."

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^9e42ee16]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

RVT is defined as thrombus formation in the main and/or branch renal veins. This may result in full or partial blockage of renal veins and, subsequently, to a series of pathological changes and clinical manifestations. RVT is the most frequent vascular abnormality in newborns. In most infants, RVT is bilateral and is accompanied by dehydration after diarrhea or vomiting. RVT is rarely observed in healthy adults; in most affected adults, it is unilateral and may be accompanied in 15–20% of patients by nephrotic syndrome. RVT is associated with abdominal surgery, including laparoscopic cholecystectomy, trauma, tumor invasion of the renal vein or invasion by primary retroperitoneal diseases.

The pathophysiology of venous thrombosis has been reported to involve a combination of three interrelated factors: endothelial damage, stasis, and hypercoagulability. Although a single abnormality may precipitate thrombosis, most venous thromboses are triggered by at least two of these factors. The causes and mechanisms of RVT are no different from venous thromboses elsewhere in the body (Table 1).

Table 1
Causes of renal vein thrombosis

RVT often commences in small intrarenal veins and subsequently extends via larger interlobar veins to the main renal veins and even to the inferior vena cava, where it may cause pulmonary embolism. The clinical presentation of RVT in adults depends on the rate, extent, and completeness of thrombus formation. Patients may be asymptomatic, have minor nonspecific symptoms such as nausea and weakness, or have more major nonspecific symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, flank pain, and hematuria. RVT is likely underreported, as some patients may go undiagnosed due to a lack of clinical manifestations. Establishing the diagnosis is essential because of the possible sequelae, including pulmonary embolism and progressive renal impairment related to vascular compromise, and the risks of potentially harmful treatment (anticoagulation or thrombolysis). In young patients, flank pain and hematuria are usually regarded as symptoms of renal and ureteric calculi; and similar clinical presentation due to other causes is often overlooked in the emergency room. Pulmonary thrombosis may occur in as many as 50% of patients with RVT, and RVT complicated by pulmonary embolism can have similar symptoms, suggesting a high index of differential diagnosis not to miss the diagnosis of RVT.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) urinary tract infection practice points — Recurrent UTIs in people with ADPKD should be investigated for a possible underlying predisposition. A urine culture should be obtained before antibiotics are started for UTI, especially for upper UTI and/or suspected kidney cyst infection. Blood cultures should be obtained if an upper UTI or kidney cyst infection is suspected. UTIs in people with ADPKD need to be differentiated from noninfectious processes such as cyst hemorrhage or kidney stone. People with ADPKD who present with fever, acute abdominal or flank pain, and increased white blood cells and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) should be worked up for kidney cyst infection (Figure 16).

### Type 2 calyceal diverticulum with an unusual appearance in the lower pole of the kidney [^6d37c769]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented to our clinic with intermittent left flank pain. The family physician referred her for renal cystic mass with a calcified appearance. The non-contrast spiral abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated the mass-like cystic lesion with a densely calcified lesion in the lower pole of the kidney. A detailed history revealed that she underwent shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for the lower pole renal stone one year ago. After SWL, the stone fragments migrated to the dependent diverticulum region and produced the misleading appearance of a Bosniak type III lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was done for further evaluation, and finally, the diagnosis of the calyceal diverticulum was confirmed in the lower pole of the kidney. Calyceal diverticula are the outpouching of the pyelocalyceal system lined by non-secretory transitional epithelium. It is a rare condition that occurs in less than 0.5% of the population. Most patients are asymptomatic and have been discovered incidentally in routine imaging modalities. As most of the patients are asymptomatic, many do not need intervention. However, in some instances, patients present with flank pain, hematuria, urinary tract infection, and stone formation in the diverticulum. They are in the differential diagnosis of renal cystic lesions such as simple renal cyst, renal cortical abscess, and parapelvic cyst. In renal cystic lesion besides of simple renal cyst or renal cystic mass, we should keep the differential diagnosis of the calyceal diverticulum type 2, especially in patients that underwent SWL for renal stones; the fragmented residual stone may have migrated to this dilated region and produce the deceptive appearance of a Bosniak type III lesion.

### Chronic flank pain, fever and an unusual diagnosis [^e6907e08]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare, serious, debilitating illness characterised by an infectious renal phlegmon. Most cases of XGP are unilateral and are often associated with urinary tract obstruction, infection, nephrolithiasis, diabetes, and/or immune compromise. This disease process ultimately results in focal or diffuse renal destruction and is characterised pathologically by lipid-laden foamy macrophages. XGP occurs in approximately 1% of all renal infections. The kidney is usually non-functional. XGP displays neoplasm like properties capable of local tissue invasion and destruction and has been referred to as a pseudotumour. Adjacent organs including the spleen, pancreas or duodenum may be involved. The gross appearance of XGP is a mass of yellow tissue with regional necrosis and haemorrhage, superficially resembling renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma may be indistinguishable from XGP radiographically and clinically. The treatment of XGP is almost universally extirpative and can pose a formidable challenge to the surgeon.

### Cocaine-induced renal infarction: report of a case and review of the literature [^652814b0]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine abuse has been known to have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. Its toxicity has been associated with myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents and mesenteric ischemia. The pathophysiology of cocaine-related renal injury is multifactorial and involves renal hemodynamic changes, alterations in glomerular matrix synthesis, degradation and oxidative stress, and possibly induction of renal atherogenesis. Renal infarction as a result of cocaine exposure, however, is rarely reported in the literature.

Case presentation

A 48 year-old male presented with a four-day history of severe right flank pain following cocaine use. On presentation, he was tachycardic, febrile and had severe right costovertebral angle tenderness. He had significant proteinuria, leukocytosis and elevated serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase. Radiographic imaging studies as well as other screening tests for thromboembolic events, hypercoagulability states, collagen vascular diseases and lipid disorders were suggestive of Cocaine-Induced Renal Infarction (CIRI) by exclusion.

Conclusion

In a patient with a history of cocaine abuse presenting with fevers and flank pain suggestive of urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis, cocaine-induced renal infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the prior reported cases of CIRI and thoroughly review the literature available on this disorder. This is important for several reasons. First, it will allow us to discuss and elaborate on the mechanism of renal injury caused by cocaine. In addition, this review will demonstrate the importance of considering the diagnosis of CIRI in a patient with documented cocaine use and an atypical presentation of acute renal injury. Finally, we will emphasize the need for a consensus on optimal treatment of this disease, for which therapy is not yet standardized.

### Renal medullary carcinoma: unsuspected diagnosis at stone protocol CT [^38459644]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive neoplasm occurring almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell (SC) hemoglobinopathies, usually sickle cell trait (SCT) or hemoglobin SC disease. The most common presentations are hematuria and flank or abdominal pain. It is a highly malignant tumor, and responses to chemotherapy are rare and transient resulting in a dismal prognosis. A high level of suspicion is necessary when evaluating at risk patients presenting with hematuria or flank pain, as currently it appears that only early diagnosis could potentially alter the outcome of this disease. We report a case of RMC in a young male patient with SCT, who presented to the emergency department with low back pain and microscopic hematuria, clinically mimicking acute obstructing urolithiasis. Our case emphasizes the need to consider alternate diagnoses when evaluating computed tomography scans for acute flank pain.

### Ovarian torsion masquerading as a ureteral stone [^3ed23374]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is the most common complaint within the emergency department (ED) and has many varied etiologies. Some of these conditions can be medical emergencies, including ovarian torsion. While representing just 3% of gynecologic emergencies, ovarian torsion should be considered in all females presenting to the ED with abdominal or pelvic complaints.

Case

A 38-year-old G5P5 female with a past medical history significant for ureterolithiasis presented to a freestanding ED with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She developed sudden onset of right sided abdominal pain radiating to her right flank upon awakening. The initial differential diagnosis was for ureterolithiasis or appendicitis. Her complete blood count (CBC) was normal, and testing for pregnancy, infection, and hematuria was negative. Computed topography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 9 cm adnexal mass, consistent with a possible dermoid cyst. A pelvic ultrasound was ordered which showed a possible ovarian torsion. She was transferred to a tertiary care hospital where she had a laparoscopy with right-sided oophorectomy and salpingectomy performed.

Discussion

This patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and was first suspected to have ureterolithiasis or appendicitis. She was found to have an ovarian torsion with a dermoid cyst, which resulted in the loss of her ovary and fallopian tube. This case demonstrates the importance of including gynecologic emergencies in the differential on all female patients presenting with abdominal pain.

### Emergency department visits, use of imaging, and drugs for urolithiasis have increased in the United States [^09ca5069]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The reasons for the increased use of advanced radiologic evaluations in the ED for urolithiasis patients are unclear and cannot be determined from the study database. They may include increased sensitivity and specificity of CT evaluation for urolithiasis, pressures related to fear of medical malpractice claims, and patient demand. Physician time pressures, increased reliance on technology, and use of radiologic techniques as default measures for consultation gateways and admission decisions may constitute incentives to lower the threshold for use of such tests. Although CT evaluation can locate a stone and assess hydronephrosis, the clinical decision-making for a urolithiasis patient, especially a recurrent stone former, in the absence of radiologic assessment is often straightforward. After evaluation of flank pain by physical examination and exclusion of other causes of abdominal pain, urinalysis can suggest infection, and hydration and provision of analgesics can be instituted. This is especially true in patients with a history of urolithiasis. If a stone is not passed during a follow-up observation period, radiologic assessment can then proceed, perhaps with an ultrasound. The proper balance between traditional physical examination and use of advanced radiologic techniques in patients with suspected urolithiasis is uncertain, in part, because of the lack of evidence and practice guidelines to inform clinical approaches for such patients.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^1edb62d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration."

Abdominal computed tomography scan documented a right renal mass. A right nephrectomy was performed. The pathological report documents xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. He experienced an uneventful recovery. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with fever, weight loss, flank tenderness, and a renal mass.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^451fc699]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical manifestations of renal vein thrombosis (RVT) in adult patients vary, along with the rapidity and degree of venous occlusion. Symptoms of RVT can include acute flank pain, hematuria, and deterioration of renal function, although RVT is usually asymptomatic. RVT with flank pain and hematuria is often misdiagnosed as renal colic originating from a ureteric or renal calculus, especially in young and otherwise healthy patients. This report describes an unusual patient with RVT, who presented with flank pain and calcified RVT mimicking a urinary calculus.

### Modified whitaker test: a novel diagnostic for nephroptosis [^1b5ffdad]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 77-year-old woman presented with right flank pain radiating to the ipsilateral groin and associated nausea, consistent with renal colic. In the emergency department, a non-contrast CT scan revealed severe right-sided hydronephrosis but failed to demonstrate a calculus or ureteropelvic obstruction. The patient improved with fluids and followed up with a community urologist. Initial work-up with cystoscopy and ureteroscopy, voiding cystourethrogram and diuretic renography failed to deduce a diagnosis. At our hospital, we used a modified dynamic (supine and upright) Whitaker test in a novel fashion to diagnose nephroptosis, a rare hypermobility condition of the kidney.

### The evaluation and management of urolithiasis in the ED: a review of the literature [^2d0265d3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urolithiasis is a common condition in the U.S. Patients frequently present to the emergency department (ED) for care, including analgesia and treatments to facilitate stone passage.

Objective

With the new evidence concerning the evaluation and treatment of urolithiasis, this review summarizes current literature regarding the ED management of urolithiasis.

Discussion

Urolithiasis occurs primarily through supersaturation of urine and commonly presents with flank pain, hematuria, and nausea/vomiting. History, examination, and assessment with several laboratory tests are cornerstones of evaluation. Urinalysis is not diagnostic, but it may be used in association with other assessments. Risk assessment tools and advanced imaging can assist with diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) is often considered the gold standard. Newer low-dose CT imaging may reduce radiation. Recent studies support ultrasound as an alternate diagnostic modality, especially in pediatric and pregnant patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs remain first-line therapy, with opioids or intravenous lidocaine reserved for refractory pain. Tamsulosin can increase passage in larger stones but has not demonstrated benefit in smaller stones. Nifedipine and intravenous fluids are not recommended to facilitate passage. Surgical intervention is based upon stone size, duration, and modifying factors. Patients who are discharged should be advised on dietary changes.

Conclusion

Urolithiasis is a common disease increasing in prevalence with the potential for significant morbidity. Focused evaluation with history, examination, and testing is important in diagnosis and management. Understanding the clinical features, risk assessment tools, imaging options, and treatment options can assist emergency physicians in the management of urolithiasis.

### Can obstructive urolithiasis be safely excluded on contrast CT? A retrospective analysis of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast CT [^9459b520]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine if contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructive urolithiasis in patients with flank plain. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis to compare the negative predictive values of contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CTs for the detection of obstructing urolithiasis.

Methods

Through report analysis, we identified all non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis performed on adult patients in the emergency department at a single, multi-site academic medical institution in 2017 with an indication of flank pain. The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis in each group was calculated. We subsequently analyzed 200 consecutive studies from each of these groups (reported negative for obstructive urolithiasis) for negative predictive value calculation. Follow up abdominal imaging within 7 days from original presentation was used as a reference standard for analysis.

Results

In the noncontrast group, 1 study out of 200 was false negative (negative predictive value = 99.5%). In the contrast-enhanced group, there were no false negatives (negative predictive value = 100%). The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis was 44.0% (351/797) in the noncontrast group and 18.7% (86/459) in the contrast-enhanced group.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructing ureteral calculi in the setting of acute flank pain. This finding is of clinical relevance given the inherent benefit of IV contrast in diagnosing abdominopelvic pathology.

### Unilateral global renal infarction in a patient with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease in a resource limited setting: a case report [^e0390613]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute renal infarctions usually present with sudden abdominal or flank pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and sometimes fever. Skin color changes are seen in about one-third of cases. The condition can mimic other disorders, leading to delayed diagnosis. Some patients may be asymptomatic, contributing to underdiagnosis, and may be discovered incidentally during imaging for other reasons, as in this case where the patient was sent to have a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan to rule out acute pulmonary thromboembolism.

Renal thromboembolism should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute flank or abdominal pain, particularly when accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and/or hematuria. Laboratory findings typically reveal elevated LDH levels in nearly all cases, making this a key diagnostic indicator. Urinalysis often demonstrates hematuria (though not universally), while proteinuria is observed in approximately 45% of patients. Although serum creatinine levels usually show a slight increase without being significantly elevated initially, this case was different, marked by a sudden rapid increase in both creatinine and LDH levels, coinciding with the detection of complete renal infarction in previously normal lab results, highlighting the rarity of this occurrence. Imaging plays a crucial role in accurately diagnosing renal infarction, with angiography yielding positive results in all cases and renal isotope exams showing abnormalities in 97% of cases. CT scans are diagnostic in 80% of cases, while ultrasound is positive in only 3% of cases. Contrast-enhanced CT scans are the preferred diagnostic tool, as they reveal wedge-shaped, peripheral, non-enhancing areas, hypoattenuated regions with a mass effect, and occasionally a cortical rim sign, which helps differentiate between ischemia and pyelonephritis. Given the often vague presentation of renal infarction, maintaining a high degree of clinical suspicion is essential for diagnosis.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^62e81f90]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is important to distinguish that there are 2 related but distinct pathological conditions in our patient described above. Failure to realize this could yield an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and a poor patient outcome. Therefore, it was important to generate 2 separate differential diagnoses in this case, 1 for acute abdominal pain and 1 for chronic secretory diarrhea.

Regarding her abdominal pain the diagnoses in were considered (Table 1). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was less likely with a stable weight, normal ESR (of 3), normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and no inflammatory cells in the stool. Transglutaminase IgA and IgG were both negative, reducing the likelihood for celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was also unlikely as her ovaries were visualized and normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 RBCs making nephrolithiasis possible, but less likely than other entities. Urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E coli but patient denied dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, so unlikely to be urinary tract infection (UTI)/pyelonephritis. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was less likely due to the location and episodic nature of her abdominal pain unrelated to timing of meals. Malignancy was less likely due to the acute nature of the pain and lack of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Lipase and MRI were negative for acute pancreatitis. Intussusception was diagnosed via the abdominal ultrasound that captured the bowel telescoping.

Table 1.
Differential Diagnosis for Abdominal Pain for Preadolescent Female Patient.

Intussusception is defined as the slipping of a portion of bowel into the neighboring portion. This condition generally occurs in young children, and only 30% occur in individuals greater than 2 years of age. Risk factors for intussusception include young age, intestinal malformations, and any condition that leads to inflammation of the GI tract as identified in (Table 2). The rotavirus vaccine has also been associated with intussusception. In some cases, a pathologic lead point, which is an anatomic anomaly that predisposes the bowel to intussusception, is identified. Examples of pathologic lead points include Meckel's diverticulum, polyp, or tumor. In most cases of intussusception, no cause is discovered (idiopathic) and no lead point is identified.

### Utility of the digital rectal examination in the evaluation of undifferentiated abdominal pain [^3c294fe9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The digital rectal examination (DRE) is commonly recommended in the evaluation of individuals with undifferentiated abdominal pain (UAP) despite negligible evidence. We aimed to determine its clinical utility.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 893 UAP subjects in an observational, convenience sample study at our urban, academic emergency department. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, vaginal or rectal bleeding, pregnancy, and primarily flank pain or vaginal complaint. Data forms were completed before laboratory testing, imaging, or other diagnostic maneuvers; and structured telephone and chart follow-up was performed. Physicians were asked to document DRE findings contemporaneously as well as their perception of the DRE's diagnostic impact. Final diagnosis in each case was compared with DRE result.

Results

Five hundred thirty-eight of 893 (60%) subjects had a DRE performed at the discretion of the examining physician. The DRE was classified as "not useful" in 494 of 538 (92%). In the remaining 44 subjects, physicians reported having their differential diagnosis influenced by the DRE. Seventeen of 538 (3%; 0.95 confidence interval, 1.9%-5.0%) were diagnostically helped, and 12 of 538 (2%; 0.95 confidence interval, 1.3%-3.9%) were diagnostically harmed. Eleven of 538 (2%) were lost to final follow-up. Sensitivity analysis indicates that unless all 11 had diagnostically helpful DREs, the DRE was statistically as likely to be harmful as helpful.

Conclusion

Differential diagnosis was unaffected in most subjects undergoing DRE, and it appears as likely to be harmful as helpful in predicting final diagnosis. Given the discomfort and minimal predictive value of the DRE in this setting, highly selective use seems reasonable.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^2bb74b10]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging — patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

### Extra-adrenal myelolipoma in the renal hilum: a case report and review of the literature [^ee4133f2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Myelolipoma most commonly arises in the adrenal gland. Extra-adrenal myelolipomas are rare; to our knowledge, approximately 37 previous cases have been reported. We report a myelolipoma presenting as a localized mass in perirenal adipose tissue juxtaposed to the renal hilum in a 65-year-old Caucasian man who presented with back pain, weight loss, hematuria, and flank pain. The most likely diagnostic considerations were pyelonephritis or primary renal malignancy. However, histology revealed mainly mature adipose tissue along with multiple scattered islands of hematopoietic precursor cells. Representation of all the three hematopoietic cell lineages (granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic) was present. Perirenal masses such as morphologically identified myelolipomas are rarely, if ever, considered in differential diagnosis. The purpose of this report is to elicit consideration of extra-adrenal myelolipoma when formulating a differential diagnosis for perirenal and retroperitoneal tumors. Although primary and secondary malignant retroperitoneal tumors are much more common and aggressive neoplasms, establishing the correct diagnosis has important therapeutic and prognostic implications.

### Lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm in traumatic spinal cord injury: a case report [^3ba19b99]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare vascular complication of trauma. This case report concerns a 24-year-old man with a lumbar-level spinal cord injury (SCI) secondary to a gunshot wound who developed severe exacerbation of low back and flank pain during inpatient rehabilitation. Diagnostic investigations at an acute care hospital revealed a left lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm. This was treated by transcatheter embolization, which resulted in a marked reduction in pain. The patient resumed inpatient rehabilitation without further complications. This case report highlights the importance of early diagnosis of lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm, a potentially fatal complication that can occur in patients with traumatic lumbosacral SCI. Physiatrists should include lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm in the differential diagnosis for back, flank, or abdominal pain in this patient population.

### Multimodality imaging of renal lymphoma and its mimics [^ae59f36a]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Main text

Clinical manifestations

Clinically, patients are relatively asymptomatic however can present with flank pain, hematuria, night sweats, and fever. Acute renal failure rarely manifests as the initial finding in cases of diffuse involvement. And while renal lymphoma can respond to treatment similar to lymphoma elsewhere in the body, recurrent renal lymphoma carries a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, patients who present with acute renal failure in the setting of lymphocytic infiltration of the renal parenchyma can improve their renal function with the treatment of the underlying lymphoma, but typically not back to baseline.

Role of multimodality imaging

CT is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected lymphoma. The advantages of CT include high sensitivity for detection of renal lesions, extrarenal tumor extension, and involvement of other organs. Intravenous contrast is essential for the detection of subtle lesions; imaging in the late arterial phase is helpful in evaluating the vasculature and differentiating lymphoma from hypervascular primary renal tumors. The nephrographic phase is essential in detecting small lesions. Lymphomatous deposits tend to enhance less than the renal cortex and appear homogenous.

MRI is useful in demonstrating renal and perirenal disease, however, the role of MRI in evaluating renal lymphoma is less clearly defined in the literature. Renal lymphomatous tumors appear as T1 hypointense and T2 iso- or hypointense relative to the renal cortex. On post-contrast MRI, renal lymphoma enhances less than the renal parenchyma, with some lesions demonstrating progressive enhancement on delayed imaging.

Ultrasound is often the first imaging exam in patients presenting with renal insufficiency or flank pain. However, ultrasound is inferior to CT and MRI in detecting the presence of disease, number of lesions, and extrarenal disease. Lesions typically appear homogenous and hypoechoic. Color Doppler imaging may demonstrate little internal vascularity within the lesion, which tends to displace vessels rather than invade them. The presence of vascular thrombus in the renal vein or inferior vena cava is atypical for lymphoma and alternative diagnoses should be considered. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is useful in characterizing lesions and can differentiate between solid tumors, pseudo-lesions, and complex cysts. However, differentiating renal lymphoma from other malignant renal masses is typically not feasible.

PET/CT is currently the gold standard for the staging of lymphoma and the detection of recurrent disease. Its advantage in detecting the metabolic activity of tumors makes it more sensitive and specific than conventional anatomic imaging.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^09d741d2]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

Details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere. We identified consecutive patients presenting with acute abdominal pain for more than 2 h and less than 5 days at the emergency department (ED) of two university and four (large) teaching hospitals. Patients discharged from the ED by the treating physician without any diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, CT or plain radiographs), patients under 18 years, pregnant women, patients with a blunt or penetrating trauma, patients with distinctive flank pain, suspected with renal colic, as well as patients in haemorrhagic shock caused by a gastrointestinal bleeding or acute abdominal aneurysm were not invited. Two of the teaching hospitals included patients from Monday to Friday between 9 am and 5 pm. In all other hospitals, patients were included 7 days a week from 8 am until 11 pm.

Eligible patients were invited to the study after being informed orally about the study by the treating physician. An information brochure was provided to them. Consenting patients were included in the study. This study had been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of participating hospitals before its initiation.

All included patients were clinically evaluated at the ED by the treating physician, usually a surgical or emergency medicine resident, after which the patients underwent a full diagnostic protocol. The treating physician prospectively recorded patients' characteristics and the findings of clinical history and examination in a case record form.

### Prevalence and clinical importance of alternative causes of symptoms using a renal colic computed tomography protocol in patients with flank or back pain and absence of pyuria [^9e576827]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and clinical importance of alternative causes of symptoms discovered in patients undergoing flank pain protocol (FPP) computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with classic symptoms of kidney stone (flank pain, back pain, or both) without evidence of urine infection.

Methods

This was a retrospective observational analysis of all adult patients undergoing FPP CT scans at two emergency departments (EDs) between April 2005 and November 2010. All CTs (N = 5,383) were reviewed and categorized as "no cause of symptoms seen on CT", "ureteral stone as cause of symptoms", or "non-kidney stone cause of symptoms". Non-kidney stone scans were further categorized as "acutely important", "follow-up recommended", or "unimportant cause", based on a priori diagnostic classifications. All nonstone causes of pain and a random subset of subjects (n = 1,843; 34%) underwent full record review blinded to CT categorization to determine demographics, whether flank and/or back pain was present, and whether there was objective evidence of pyuria.

Results

Of all FPP CT scans during the study period, a ureteral stone was found to cause symptoms in 47.7% of CTs, with no cause of symptoms found in 43.3% of CTs. A non-kidney stone diagnosis was found in 9.0% of all CTs, with 6.1% being categorized as "acutely important", 2.2% as "follow-up recommended", and 0.65% with symptoms from an "unimportant cause". In the randomly selected subset undergoing full record review, categorizations were similar, with 49.0% of CTs showing kidney stone as cause of pain and 9.0% a non-kidney stone cause (5.9% "acutely important"). When subjects with evidence of urine infection or without flank or back pain were excluded, ureteral stone was identified as the cause of pain in 54.9% of CTs, while non-kidney stone cause of symptoms was found in 5.4% of scans and acutely important alternate causes in 2.8% of scans.

Conclusions

While a non-kidney stone cause for a patient's symptoms are found in nearly 10% of CTs done using a FPP, acutely important findings occur in less than 3% of scans done in patients with flank or back pain and absence of pyuria.

### Right flank pain: a case report of an interesting sonographic finding [^62546688]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Focused bedside ultrasound is a screening tool frequently used by emergency physicians to evaluate hepatobiliary and renal pathology in patients presenting with abdominal complaints in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

This case report describes a sonographic finding that was interpreted as free fluid in the right upper quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) was used to confirm the diagnosis.

Case Report

A 44-year-old man presented to the ED with the sudden onset of right-sided abdominal pain and exhibited right costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Focused bedside ultrasound of the right upper quadrant revealed severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and free fluid of either subcapsular, perinephric, or peritoneal location represented by an anechoic stripe in Morison's pouch. On CT evaluation, this patient was found to have perinephric fluid accumulation from a presumed ruptured renal calyx in the setting of chronic ureteropelvic junction obstruction with severe hydronephrosis.

Conclusion

The exact location of anechoic fluid in the abdomen is not always apparent on bedside ultrasound. To minimize misinterpreting focused bedside ultrasound examination findings, we recommend a number of sonographic techniques to identify possible mimics of free fluid. Suspected free fluid findings on bedside ultrasound should always be evaluated within the clinical context of the patient's presentation.

### Acute unilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of hemorrhagic cystitis [^06f9644a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute flank pain associated with hematuria and unilateral hydronephrosis is a classic presentation for an obstructing ureteral stone. However, in the setting of hemorrhagic cystitis, blood can acutely obstruct the distal ureter and infrequently result in hydronephrosis. We present a case of an adult female patient with hemorrhagic cystitis who presented with acute right flank pain associated with unilateral hydronephrosis and perinephric fluid on point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) in the absence of renal or ureteral abnormality on CT scan hours earlier. Her symptoms resolved, urine cultures showed no growth, and her outpatient follow-up was unremarkable. We suspect given the acute onset of right obstructive uropathy, an unremarkable CT just hours earlier, and the brief nature of her symptoms, that blood obstructed her distal UVJ leading to acute and transient obstructive uropathy.

### Incidental diagnosis of diseases on un-enhanced helical computed tomography performed for ureteric colic [^f3d077e9]. BMC Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients presenting in the emergency room with flank pain suggestive of acute ureteric colic may have alternative underlying conditions mimicking ureteric stones. An early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for other causes of flank pain is important. The majority of centers around the world are increasingly using un-enhanced helical CT (UHCT) for evaluation of ureteric colic. This study was conducted to determine the incidence and spectrum of significant incidental diagnoses established or suggested on UHCT performed for suspected renal/ureteric colic.

Methods

Urologist and radiologist reviewed 233 consecutive UHCT, performed for suspected renal/ureteral colic along with assessment of the medical records. Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities not suspected otherwise were analyzed. All other relevant radiological, biochemical and serological investigations and per-operative findings were also noted.

Results

Ureteral calculi were identified in 148 examinations (64%), findings of recent passage of calculi in 10 (4%) and no calculus in 75 examinations (32%). Overall the incidental findings (additional or alternative diagnosis) were found in 28 (12%) CT scans. Twenty (71%) of these diagnoses were confirmed by per-operative findings, biopsy, and other radiological and biochemical investigations or on clinical follow up.

Conclusion

A wide spectrum of significant incidental diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected renal/ureteral colic. In the present series of 233 consecutive CT examinations, the incidence of incidental diagnosis was 12%.

### Why we need a higher suspicion index of urolithiasis in children [^86fdf543]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Most children with symptoms of urolithiasis and urinary solute excretion abnormalities leading to stone formation have no calculi revealed by ultrasound or X-ray plain film ("occult urolithiasis"). This covers a large group of children presenting with common symptoms such as abdominal pain, hematuria, and dysuria, often faced by general practitioners and pediatricians. However, half or more of children with urolithiasis could present with abdominal/flank pain without specific urinary symptoms.

Study Design

We review the current evidence about prevalence, clinical presentation, and radiological detection of overt and "occult" urolithiasis in children, aiming to give readers the instruments to suspect and diagnose urolithiasis while avoiding cost-ineffective and undue diagnostic procedures.

Conclusions

It is important to investigate for urolithiasis first by ultrasound and, in specific cases, by urinary metabolic and different imaging studies in the following groups: 1) in children with non-glomerular hematuria or/and dysuria not presenting inflammation of external genitalia; 2) in children with acute/sub-acute or infrequent recurrent abdominal pain and family history of urolithiasis in first or second degree relatives or being at higher risk of developing stones although hematuria and dysuria are lacking; 3) in children under 8 years old, even though pain is central or diffuse to the whole abdomen; and 4) in children presenting risk factors or conditions predisposing to urolithiasis. Finally, it seems reasonable to repeat ultrasound 1–2 years later also in children with "occult" urolithiasis and high risk of developing stones to detect any (re-)appearance of calculi.

### Nontraumatic abdominal emergencies: acute abdominal pain: diagnostic strategies [^61223bee]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Common causes of acute abdominal pain include appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, urinary colic, perforated peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, and nonspecific, nonsurgical abdominal pain. The topographic classification of acute abdominal pain (pain in one of the four abdominal quadrants, diffuse abdominal pain, flank or epigastric pain) facilitates the choice of the imaging technique. The initial radiological evaluation often consists of plain abdominal radiography, despite significant diagnostic limitations. The traditional indications for plain films — bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, and the search of ureteral calculi — are questioned by helical computed tomography (CT). Although ultrasonography (US) is in many centers the modality of choice for imaging the gallbladder and the pelvis in children and women of reproductive age, CT is considered to be one of the most valued tools for triaging patients with acute abdominal pain. CT is particularly beneficial in patients with marked obesity, unclear US findings, bowel obstruction, and multiple lesions. The introduction of multidetector row CT (MDCT) has further enhanced the utility of CT in imaging patients with acute abdominal pain.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis with left renal venous infarction after vaginal delivery [^418532b1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A primipara in her late 20s presented with abdominal pain and pain in the left flank 14 days after a ventouse delivery. She was treated with antibiotics, antiemetics and analgesics with the initial differential diagnosis of cystitis, pyelonephritis or nephrolithiasis. Despite the treatment, the patient experienced increased colic pain and nausea. An ultrasound showed an enlarged left kidney, suggesting pyelonephritis, and thereby, the antibiotic treatment was adjusted accordingly. Despite additional pain medication, pain relief could not be achieved. The diagnosis of ovarian venous thrombosis was considered, and an abdominal CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy. Hypercoagulability work-up revealed a heterozygous mutation of the Factor V Leiden. Our patient awaits a haematologic follow-up.

### Acute flank pain: comparison of unenhanced helical CT and ultrasonography in detecting causes other than ureterolithiasis [^cd0eb20a]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several conditions can clinically mimic renal colic. We assessed the accuracy of non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and of ultrasonography (US) in offering an alternative explanation for flank pain. In a 3-year period, 181 patients with acute flank pain underwent US and non-contrast-enhanced helical CT in a blinded sequence. Their efficacy in detecting both alternative causes of pain and additional findings unrelated to the pain was assessed in 160 cases with a confirmed diagnosis. An alternative cause was found in 23 cases (14%). US gave 4 false-negative results (1 acute appendicitis, 1 ovarian cyst torsion, 1 diverticulitis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 2 false-positive results (1 acute pyelonephritis and 1 diverticulitis), with a 78% sensitivity and a 98% specificity for nonlithiasic causes. CT gave 5 false-negative results (1 complicated ovarian cyst, 1 pleuritis, 1 epididymitis, 1 acute pyelonephritis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 1 false-positive (1 simple ovarian cyst described as a complicated lesion), resulting in a 74% sensitivity and a 99% specificity for diagnosing alternative causes. There were 130 additional US findings in 68 patients and 151 additional CT findings in 77 patients. A wide spectrum of findings can be identified in subjects imaged for flank pain. Non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and US have comparable accuracy in diagnosing causes other than stone disease.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^82afdc3f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a complicated febrile urinary tract infection detected by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^9347322a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) include a spectrum of pathologies from uncomplicated pyelonephritis to urosepsis, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Most febrile UTIs are treated with antibiotics alone, but studies indicate nearly 12% of cases of presumed simple pyelonephritis require emergent urologic intervention. How to identify these individuals, while limiting unnecessary advanced imaging and delays in diagnosis, challenges all emergency providers. We review the diagnosis and management of XGP, as well as the evidence regarding the role of renal ultrasound in the identification of complicated presentations of febrile UTIs.

Case Report

We present a case of XGP, a complicated febrile UTI requiring immediate urologic intervention, diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound. A 40-year-old female presented in severe sepsis and complaining of flank pain. Prompt bedside ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis, expediting definitive urologic treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With a mortality rate exceeding 40%, obstructed pyonephrosis requires prompt decompression. Given its exceptional sensitivity for identifying hydronephrosis and ability to detect abscesses and emphysematous changes, we advocate a point-of-care ultrasound-first approach to screen for cases of complicated febrile UTIs in order to expedite treatment and limit radiation in uncomplicated presentations.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^e56163ac]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Practice Point 7.2.2 — ADPKD activity-related organ injury and hematuria: People with large kidneys and/or liver should be advised of the possibility of incurring direct injury to these organs during physical activity and exercise. Direct injury can cause hemorrhage and/or rupture of kidney and/or liver cysts, which causes sudden-onset, localized, sharp pain, and approximately 50% of people with ADPKD and ruptured kidney cysts have macroscopic hematuria, due to the ruptured cyst communicating with the collecting system. Direct trauma to the kidneys and/or liver is a particular concern for contact sports. For individuals, if a particular type of physical activity is consistently associated with macroscopic hematuria and/or flank pain (presumed cyst ruptures), the best approach is to avoid this activity.

### Adrenocortical carcinomas: molecular pathogenesis, treatment options, and emerging immunotherapy and targeted therapy approaches [^6740c47f]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

ACC has a variable clinical presentation. Around 30% have nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and/or fullness, flank pain, and early satiety. Diagnoses made following work up of adrenal mass incidentally found on imaging account for 20%-30% of cases. Hormonal excess is the most common presenting feature in approximately 40%-60% of patients which could be due to hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism. ACC that secretes cortisol may cause patients to present with diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, facial plethora, muscle atrophy, secondary hypertension, and/or hypokalemia. Conversely, aldosterone over-secretion that is manifested by hypertension and hypokalemia is rare in ACC. Patients may present with virilization, hirsutism, male pattern hair loss, and menstrual abnormalities. A few patients can present with clinical symptoms correlated to estrogen overproduction such as testicular atrophy and gynecomastia.

### Acute renal infarction: a diagnostic challenge [^e80bbbd6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute renal infarction is a relatively rare and scarcely reported condition. Contrast enhanced CT scan is essential for diagnosing this condition. The most common etiology of this condition is cardioembolic, however up to 59% of cases could be classified as idiopathic acute renal infarction. Here we present a case of a 41 year-old male who was admitted for acute onset right flank pain with fevers and rigors. A CT abdomen with contrast showed findings concerning for right pyelonephritis or renal infarction. Urinalysis was negative for infection. He did not respond to treatment with intravenous antibiotics and was thus diagnosed with acute renal infarction. Work-up for common etiologies was negative and the renal infarction was presumed to be idiopathic. He was discharged home on Enoxaparin. In conclusion, acute renal infarction is a rare condition which should be suspected in patients presenting with acute flank/abdominal pain in whom the more common etiologies have been ruled out.

### Acute flank pain: a modern approach to diagnosis and management [^809fb38f]. Seminars in Ultrasound, CT, and MR (1999). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, flank pain can be caused by acute diverticulitis, acute appendicitis, testicular torsion, adnexal torsion, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, splenic infarction, splenic rupture, splenic abscess, bacterial pneumonia, renal vein thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, ectopic pregnancy, renal cell carcinoma, choledocholithiasis, nephrolithiasis, acute pyelonephritis, pleurisy, acute pancreatitis, herpes simplex virus infection, retroperitoneal fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease, musculoskeletal pain, liver abscess, acute hepatitis, gastroenteritis, interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis, endometriosis, bowel obstruction, acute mesenteric ischemia, perinephric abscess, adrenal hemorrhage, adrenal tumor, ureteral obstruction, herpes zoster and ovarian cyst rupture. In addition, flank pain can be caused by medications such as zoledronic acid, citalopram, probenecid / colchicine, venlafaxine, mitomycin, glatiramer, ketorolac, naproxen DR, ziprasidone, vitamin C, naproxen sodium ER, voriconazole, sulopenem / probenecid, oxybutynin, naproxen, antithymocyte globulin (rabbit), ertapenem, indinavir, probenecid, tretinoin, fosinopril, enalapril, zonisamide, oxybutynin XL, enalaprilat and cefuroxime axetil.

### The nutcracker syndrome [^48df5307]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Left renal vein (LRV) compression, commonly referred to as the nutcracker syndrome or renal vein entrapment syndrome, is a rare and often overlooked condition. Anatomically, the LRV traverses the space between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta in close proximity to the origin of the artery. In affected individuals, the LRV is subjected to compression between these two structures, resulting in renal venous hypertension. A review of published data on this condition reveals either case reports or small case series. The classic symptoms of nutcracker syndrome include left flank pain with gross or microscopic hematuria. Patients are often children or young adults, with a slight predisposition for women who may also present with pelvic congestion symptoms such as pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Most patients have disease symptoms for many years and nondiagnostic investigations before proper diagnosis can be made. Appropriate diagnostic work-up and treatment may help alleviate patient morbidity from this chronic condition. Although surgical repair has been the standard of care, more recently endovascular intervention has become the first line of therapy. This tabular review compiles published cases in the adult population during the period between 1980 and 2009.

### Renal medullary carcinoma masquerading as renal infection: a case report [^68bf7f48]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Renal medullary carcinoma is an uncommon and aggressive disease. The tumor causes nonspecific manifestations in the patient including flank pain, hematuria and loss of body weight. These nonspecific symptoms were also present in our patient. Often, in the absence of a high index of suspicion, lack of specific manifestations leads to erroneous diagnoses such as collecting duct carcinoma and non-neoplastic diseases. One prominent symptom of our current case was persistent fever despite intensive antibiotics therapy. Though renal occupying lesion was detected by abdominal ultrasound imaging and subsequently by PET/CT scan, because of the non-specific manifestations including fever, flank pain and hematuria, infection was considered to be the most likely source of the patient's symptoms, leading to delays diagnosis and treatment. Leukocytosis and increased inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR also led the physicians to consider infection as the underlying cause of the patient's manifestations.
