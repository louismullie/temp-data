## Question

## Task $8 / 68$

A plane is divided into 56 parts by $n$ lines. None of the $n$ lines is parallel to another, and no more than two lines intersect at any point.

What is $n$?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many lines, n, divide a plane into 56 regions under the conditions that no two lines are parallel and no more than two lines intersect at any point. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic formula for the maximum number of regions created by n lines in general position. Then, I should verify that the given constraints match the assumptions of that formula. Next, I will set up the equation and solve for n. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any edge cases could invalidate the result.

> Let me first confirm the combinatorial formula. For n lines in the plane with no two parallel and no three concurrent, the maximum number of regions R(n) is given by R(n) = (n^2 + n + 2)/2; this is a standard result in discrete geometry and aligns with the constraint that each new line intersects all previous lines and creates one more region than the number of lines it crosses, which is exactly the setup here [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the problem constraints map to the formula's assumptions. The conditions "none of the n lines is parallel to another" and "no more than two lines intersect at any point" are precisely the hypotheses that ensure each pair of lines intersects exactly once and no three lines meet at a single point, which is the definition of general position for this problem; thus, the formula applies directly without modification [^notfound].

> I will now set up the equation. We are told the plane is divided into 56 regions, so R(n) = 56; substituting the formula gives (n^2 + n + 2)/2 = 56. Multiplying both sides by 2 yields n^2 + n + 2 = 112, and rearranging gives the quadratic equation n^2 + n − 110 = 0 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the solution to the quadratic. Using the quadratic formula, n = [−1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 × 110)] / 2 = [−1 ± sqrt(441)] / 2 = [−1 ± 21] / 2. The positive root is (20)/2 = 10, and the negative root is (−22)/2 = −11, which is not meaningful for a count of lines; thus, n = 10 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic by plugging n = 10 back into the original formula. R(10) = (10^2 + 10 + 2)/2 = (100 + 10 + 2)/2 = 112/2 = 56, which matches the given number of regions; this confirms the solution is correct under the stated assumptions [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the constraints were different, for example, if some lines were parallel or if three or more lines could concur? In those cases, the maximum number of regions would be strictly less than the value given by the general-position formula, so 56 regions would not be achievable with the same n; this reinforces that n = 10 is the unique answer under the given conditions [^notfound].

---

The maximum number of regions formed by (n) lines in a plane, with no two parallel and no three concurrent, is given by the formula (R(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2}). Setting (R(n) = 56), we solve (\\frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2} = 56), which simplifies to (n^2 + n - 110 = 0). The positive solution is (n = 10), so **10 lines** are needed to divide the plane into 56 regions under the given conditions.

---

## Formula for maximum regions formed by lines

The maximum number of regions (R(n)) formed by (n) lines in a plane, with no two parallel and no three concurrent, is:

[
R(n) = \\frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2}
]

This formula arises because each new line intersects all previous lines, adding (k + 1) new regions when the (k)-th line is added.

---

## Applying the formula to the problem

Given (R(n) = 56), we substitute into the formula:

[
\\frac{n^2 + n + 2}{2} = 56
]

Multiply both sides by 2:

[
n^2 + n + 2 = 112
]

Subtract 112 from both sides:

[
n^2 + n - 110 = 0
]

---

## Solving the quadratic equation

We solve (n^2 + n - 110 = 0) using the quadratic formula:

[
n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2–4ac}}{2a}
]

Here, (a = 1), (b = 1), and (c = -110). Substituting:

[
n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2–4(1)(-110)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 440}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{441}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 21}{2}
]

This gives two solutions:

[
n = \\frac{-1 + 21}{2} = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{-1–21}{2} = -11
]

Since (n) must be a positive integer, we discard (n = -11) and accept (n = 10).

---

## Verification

We verify by substituting (n = 10) back into the formula:

[
R(10) = \\frac{10^2 + 10 + 2}{2} = \\frac{100 + 10 + 2}{2} = \\frac{112}{2} = 56
]

This matches the given number of regions, confirming the solution.

---

## Conclusion

The number of lines (n) that divide a plane into 56 regions, with no two parallel and no three concurrent, is **10**.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap," where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

Basic notions and planar alignment representation

We consider alignments as a path that follows a sequence of pointsin a two-dimensional plane, where | A | shall denote the alignment length. With this plane, the reference R is on the x-axis and the query Q is on the y-axis, with | Q | < | R |. Please note: The sequences r 0, r 1,…, r | A | and q 0, q 1,…, q | A | are both monotonically increasing. Two consecutive points (r n, q n) and (r n +1, q n +1) are always associated in one of the following four ways:
Deletion: r n +1 = r n + 1, q n +1 = q n; visually this is equal to a horizontal path extension.
Insertion: r n +1 = r n, q n +1 = q n + 1; visually this is equal to a vertical path extension.
Match or Mismatch: r n +1 = r n + 1, q n +1 = q n + 1; visually both appear as diagonal path extensions.

For example, in Fig. 5 a complete alignment via the orange path follows the sequence: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7), (12, 8), (13, 9)]

The alignment process is decomposed into three separated stages: seeding, seed processing and dynamic programming (DP). In the following three sections, we will explain our approaches for all three stages in detail.

Geometry of Voronoi diagrams in curved surfaces

From the mathematical point of view, in order to model a tissue, we defined: the space, the metric, and, finally, the seeds. With these ingredients, we built a Voronoi diagram, whose cells will be a model for the epithelial cells in a curved tissue (Fig. 1c).

Regarding the space, we started with a given surface S, then for each point X (u.v) ∈ S, there exists a vector N(u, v) of length 1 that is orthogonal to the tangent plane in X(u, v) to S. Thus, for each λ∈ [0,1], it is possible to define a new surface S λ parallel to S in such a way that any point of S λ is X λ (u, v) = X(u, v) + λN(u, v) (a point in one of the surfaces has an equivalent point in each one of the parallel surfaces).

The metric in each one of the surfaces previously defined is just the length of the shortest geodesic joining two points. In the case of the cylinder, the geodesics are helices in the cylinder. In the case of the sphere, the geodesics are arcs of great-circles.

We defined every seed starting in a point on the apical surface. That point defined a segment between the basal and the apical surfaces by means of its normal (given the point X(u, v), the segment is X(u, v) + λN(u, v), λ∈ [0,1]). The intersection of these line segments with a given surface determined a seed. Thus, in order to generate all the seeds, in a first step we have chosen n points on the apical surface, then the n segments that were generated by them, and, finally, the intersection of those segments with every surface S λ defined the seeds for that surface.

The next step was to compute the Voronoi diagrams of the seeds obtained in each one of the parallel surfaces. We linked the Voronoi regions corresponding to seeds on the same segment obtaining a 3D figure. In some cases, we obtained figures with vertices not located neither in apical nor in basal surfaces. These solids are not prisms or frusta (Fig. 1f, g). Moreover, it must be pointed out that this geometrical figure does not need to be convex.

### Closed-loop two-photon functional imaging in a freely moving animal [^ec36c044]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Pong Scan

To record from a volume, all point scanning microscopes must move the point being scanned in a three-dimensional pattern. A common configuration for two-photon volumetric imaging combines a resonant galvanometer scanner (galvo) for a fast scan in one direction (the fast axis) in the objective focal plane and a conventional galvo for a slower scan in the orthogonal planar direction. Together, these allow imaging of a single plane at a rate given by the resonant frequency (e.g. 8 kHz) divided by the number of lines composing the plane (e.g. 256 lines, for a plane rate of 31 Hz). To image a volume, the objective or the sample is translated between each frame, or a remote focusing method (e.g. an electrotunable lens) is used to shift the focal plane of the objective (along the slow axis). In this configuration, hundreds of milliseconds can elapse between imaging the top and bottom plane of a sample. Movement perpendicular to the slow axis (in this example, parallel to the focal plane) distorts the image but can be compensated in post-processing. Motion parallel to the slow axis can result in over-sampling of some planes and under-sampling of others, which can not be corrected later. Most microscopes image a volume as a series of planes and hence have a slow axis, with light field microscopes and random access microscopes notable exceptions.

### Brain damage: neglect disrupts the mental number line [^3653f4cb]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

A popular metaphor for the representation of numbers in the brain is the 'mental number line', in which numbers are represented in a continuous, quantity-based analogical format. Here we show that patients with hemispatial neglect misplace the midpoint of a numerical interval when asked to bisect it (for example, stating that five is halfway between two and six), with an error pattern that closely resembles the bisection of physical lines. This new form of representational neglect constitutes strong evidence that the mental number line is more than simply a metaphor, and that its spatial nature renders it functionally isomorphic to physical lines.

### Connectome-driven neural inventory of a complete visual system [^72267670]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Defining column centre lines and ROIs

Column ROIs subdivide a neuropil ROI and are based on the centre lines of columns (pins) (Fig. 3). The basic idea of a column pin is that it is a smooth, slightly bent line that goes through the centre of synapses of specific neurons assigned to the same hexagonal coordinate (as described in previous sections). More formally, a pin is a list of 3D points (pin points, called ColumnPin in neuPrint) that start at the top of a neuropil ROI and end at the bottom.

Starting from a neuron to hexagonal coordinate assignment in the medulla (15 cell types, as described in the section 'Assigning neurons to medulla hexagonal coordinates'), we constructed pin α corresponding to hexagonal coordinates α according the following eight steps:
For all neurons assigned to the hexagonal coordinate α, we obtained the 3D positions r i of their presynapses and postsynapses in the medulla, where i runs from 1 to the number of synapses.
We identified the axes of biggest variation of r i using principal component analysis (PCA). We fixed the sign of the axis of biggest variation (PC1) such that PC1 points from the top to the bottom of the medulla ROI.
We computed the Euclidean distances l i of r i from their meanin the PC2–PC3 plane, and dropped the r i for which l i < f lat σ lat, whereis the root mean squared distance of all r i. The factor f lat = 2 was chosen manually such that the r i with l i ≥ f lat σf lat looked like they were part of a different column.
For the remaining r i, we defined their normalized projection onto PC1 as t i such that t i = –1 corresponded to the top and t i = 1 to the bottom of the medulla ROI. To clarify, this PC1 was computed in step (2), using all r i.
For those r i with t i < 0.1, we computed a new PC1 and found its intersection with the top of the medulla ROI. We denoted this 3D point as r top. If there were fewer than N PC points with t i < 0.1, then we took the points with the N PC smallest t i values instead to compute the new PC1. We chose the integer N PC = 800 manually to ensure a robust estimation of r top. In an analogous computation, using the points with t i > 0.2 or the points with the N PC largest t i values and the intersection of their newly computed PC1 with the bottom of the medulla ROI, defined r bottom.
We defined a list L ′ α, for which the first element was r top, the last element was r bottom and intermediate elements were determined by rank ordering the r i by t i. We defined another list L α for which the first element was r top, the last element was r bottom and the intermediate elements were the averages of the elements in L ′ α with their N avg neighbours. The integer N avg = 260 was determined manually such that the elements in L α formed approximately a smooth line. This line was often helical and typically did not go through the centre of the r i.
To create a line that went through the centre of the r i, we found the shortest sublist O α of L α, for which the first element was r top, the last element was r bottom and the 3D Euclidean distance between neighbouring points was at most d max. We defined d max as the 3D Euclidean distance between r top and r bottom divided by N tang. We selected the integer N tang = 7 such that O α corresponded to a line that went approximately through the centre of the r i. Note that the minimal length of O α is N tang + 1.
For each of the three spatial coordinates of points in O α, we used a spline interpolation (a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP)) to uniformly sample O α with N samp points. This list of length N samp defined pin α. We manually determined N samp = 121 by checking whether the synapse distributions along a pin looked approximately smooth and did not change much with small changes in N samp.

### Chirality encoding in resonant metasurfaces governed by lattice symmetries [^b023b5d7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In two dimensions, there are only five distinct variants of periodic lattices. These five 2D Bravais lattice typesare hexagonal (6), square (4), centered rectangular (2), primitive rectangular (2), and monoclinic (0), where the number in parentheses indicates number of in-plane mirror symmetry lines, m. The only arrangement that is chiral for any shape of meta-atoms on a substrate is monoclinic lattice, which was described theoretically and verified experimentally very recently. However, it gives little room for an efficient chirality parametrization.

Two sets of in-plane mirror symmetry lines (m from lattice arrangement and n from meta-atom) give us an easily parameterized system, which is chiral for the particular relative orientations. The relative angle of meta-atom rotation β with respect to the arrangement lattice is the parameter of choice. By figuring out when exactly there is at least one match between symmetry lines from m -set and n -set, we derive the chiral selection rules, Table 1 (see Supplementary Note 1 for the detailed derivation). For specific angles β the metasurface is achiral and hence must provide null for any chiral optical response. The angular period of these symmetry-induced zeros folds down to an elegant and compact formulawhere lcm(m, n) is the least common multiple of two integers m and n. These symmetry induced zeros can serve as "anchors points" for any chiral design in general, including metasurfaces with gradient design, which is the showcase of our choice in this work. The later one is the showcase of our choice in this work.

Sister cells can divide in different planes.

a Model of cells undergoing division showing the previous (blue line), current (red line) and next (green D shape) division planes. Left image: if cells divide in three consecutive orthogonal planes then sister cells will inevitably divide in the same plane, perpendicular to the previous and current division planes. Right image: if the future division plane is not the same in both sister cells, then the orthogonal geometry of division is not respected in at least one of the sister cells, as exemplified by the left hemisphere where the next division will occur in a plane that is perpendicular to the current plane of division (in red) but not to the previous one (in blue). b Top panel: top view of 3D rendering of a Z-stack of images of COL EzrA-sGFP cells.

### A spatially resolved timeline of the human maternal-fetal interface [^91c9399c]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Second, define the inner circles comprising the onion layers by dividing the radius a of the outer circle into I equal sections of length n, creating layers along the radial r axis. The radii of the inner circles are then defined as 0,1 × n,2 × n,… (I – 1) × n.

Third, divide the onion into k equal sectors along the ø axis. k is a user-defined integer.

Fourth, subdivide each sector into segments. The sectors are internally divided by the circles, creating parts with four corners and four sides, with the two sides being straight (sector dividers), and the two sides being arcs (parts of circle circumferences). The arcs are replaced with secants (straight line connecting the ends of the arc), turning the segment into a trapezoid. The parameters n = 10 pixels and k = 100 were used to allow for segments large enough to contain a sufficient number of pixels to average the expression over.

FIGURE 1
A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

### Young children intuitively organize numbers on straight, horizontal lines from left to right before the onset of formal instruction [^5fdf7cd6]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

The number line estimation task is frequently used to measure children's numerical magnitude understanding. It is unclear whether the resulting straight, horizontal, left-to-right-oriented estimate patterns indicate task constraints or children's intuitive number-space mapping. Three- to six-year-old children (N = 72, M age = 4.89, 56% girls, 94% German citizenship) were asked to explain the meaning of numbers to a teddy by laying out a rope and attaching cards showing non-symbolic numerosities (dots) to it. Most children intuitively created straight, horizontal, and left-to-right-oriented representations. Characteristics of the line correlated with age, mathematical competencies, and home numeracy. This demonstrates the usefulness of the number line estimation task for assessing how children intuitively map numbers onto space.

### Number representations drive number-line estimates [^6bf63201]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The number-line task has been extensively used to study the mental representation of numbers in children. However, studies suggest that proportional reasoning provides a better account of children's performance. Ninety 4- to 6-year-olds were given a number-line task with symbolic numbers, with clustered dot arrays that resembled a perceptual scaling task, or with spread-out dot arrays that involved numerical estimation. Children performed well with clustered dot arrays, but poorly with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays. Performances with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays were highly correlated and were related to counting skill; neither was true for clustered dot arrays. Overall, results provide evidence for the role of mental representation of numbers in the symbolic number-line task.

### Rigidly flat-foldable class of lockable origami-inspired metamaterials with topological stiff States [^5d435cc3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To understand the relation between the total number of post-bifurcation modes and the sides of the unit chain primitive N, Fig. 2e plots the total number of lockable modes c L and flat-foldable modes c F versus N. The best curve fits are included to provide phenomenological closed-form relations that characterize folding paths and differentiate lockable modes from flat-foldable modes as a function of N for a generic. The results show that the number of regular modes grows exponentially, hence providing a rich platform to program lockable paths (Supplementary Table 1).

Symmetry and topology

From a single multilayered unit chain, we now turn to its periodic and multilayered tessellation forming a material system. Multilayered unit chains are connected to follow a tessellation pattern (Supplementary Discussion "Tessellations") that replicates a crystallographic arrangement of atoms. Figure 3 shows the top view of representative patterns for N = 4, 6, 8, and 10. While several others exist, here we focus on tessellations with the most compact pattern. The goal is to show that upon folding along a given path our material systems undergo switches in symmetry and apparent topology, both hallmarks of in situ programmability.

Group points using Schoenflies notation are shown for all modes. C n refers to an n -fold rotation axis, C nh refers to C n with the addition of a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and C s denotes a group with only a mirror plane (C 1 h). Edge and face connectivity are only shown for lockable modes. Z e is the number of edges that meet at a point (joint). Z f represents the number of faces that meet at an edge. The values of Z e and Z f for each configuration are shown after a vertical line separating them from their Schoenflies notation; parentheses are used whenever more than one connectivity value exists. For each configuration, multiple values of Z e and Z f may exist for a given joint and edge within the lattice. In these cases, all the values are reported in parentheses.

### Lines and stripes: where did they go? – from conventional radiography to CT [^bbc884b4]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Frontal and lateral radiography has traditionally been used to evaluate the chest, although computed tomography (CT) and high-resolution CT are increasingly being used as an adjunct to conventional radiography for the evaluation of parenchymal and mediastinal disease. Nevertheless, radiography remains a very important modality in this context, and use of chest radiography alone can provide a vast amount of useful information. This information is derived from the configurations and interrelationships of the anatomic structures in the lung, mediastinum, and pleura and forms the basis of the "lines and stripes" concept, which plays a valuable role in establishing a diagnosis before proceeding to CT. The inability to recognize that a chest radiograph is abnormal owing to displacement of one of these lines or stripes may lead to failure to request a potentially valuable CT examination. Radiologists must be familiar with the anatomic basis of these mediastinal lines and stripes and be able to recognize their normal and abnormal appearances. In this way, they can develop an appropriate differential diagnosis prior to obtaining additional information with chest CT.

### Content-based estimation of brain MRI tilt in three orthogonal directions [^0feda9a2]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Estimating the pitch angle: (a) relationship between the AC-PC line and line joining the Nasion (N) and Inion (I) point, (b) estimation of pitch angle (ω) with respect to the line joining the Nasion (N) and Inion (I), and (c) in anterior, Nasion (N) is the point that has a minimum distance from Centroid (C), and in posterior, Inion (I) is the point that has the maximum distance from the Centroid (C) (the Nasion and Inion point marked by visual inspection)

The pitch angle is the angle of rotation observed about X -direction. Evaluation of this angle considers the mid-sagittal slice that shows the midbrain structures (like medulla oblongata and pons) and corpus callosum with AC and PC. Dividing the total number of sagittal slices of 3D-volumetric brain MRI data by 2 can obtain a mid-sagittal slice. The histogram of MR images showed the bimodal distribution due to which mid-sagittal slice is subjected to Otsu thresholding to get the head contour. The head contour's centroid is computed based on the number of pixels (of value 1) within the head contours. There are three points in the head contour's anterior part with a minimum distance from the Centroid; they are Nasion, Philtrum, and labial Commissure. A percentage of pixels above and below the Centroid is obtained that encloses only Nasion. After several observations, we chose half of the section between the top of the contour and the Centroid, and from the Centroid to the half of the section between the Centroid and bottom of the contour. Suppose we choose the section beyond this limit; in that case, the section will include Philtrum and labial Commissure, which increases the ambiguity in choosing the correct Nasion point because Philtrum and labial Commissure also have a minimum distance from the Centroid. The range is considered based on the assumption that the Nasion point and Inion point lies within this range. Then, we computed Euclidean distance between the Centroid and the set of points located at the head contour's anterior boundary within this range. The Nasion (N) point is the one that has a minimum distance from Centroid (C) (as shown in Fig. 2 c). Compute Euclidean distance between the Centroid and the set of points located at the head contour's posterior boundary within this range. Anatomically, the Inion point is the crest present at the posterior part of the skull, so the Inion point is the one that has a maximum distance from the Centroid (C). Then, compute pitch angle (ω) by finding the angle made by the line joining the Nasion point and Inion point with horizontal (or Y -axis). The line joined the Nasion, and Inion varied by 15 mm ± 2.3 mm. The Nasion and Inion point identified by the proposed algorithm varied by 1 mm ± 0.5 mm and 3 mm ± 0.75 mm. Visual inspection of Nasion is easier than Inion because of the major depression felt between the eyes. To estimate the pitch angle using the proposed algorithm, one must ensure that MR volume should have a Nasion point. Figure 3 illustrates the pseudo-code for estimating the pitch angle.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f3e2d7fc]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 2D

In 2D, the location of an activity bump can be defined by considering any two non-collinear axes (denoted by unit vectorsand). An activity bump at phasein module i then maps onto an infinite series of periodic locations+, wherecan be any pair of integers. We initially assume, for simplicity, that the orientations of different grid modules are aligned, i.e.andare independent of i and that grid firing fields are circularly symmetric as opposed to elliptical, i.e. the scale s i is the same for directionsand(but see). In this case, the location of an activity bump within grid module i can be visualized on a cylindrical polar plot as, whererepresents the direction of the grid axes (e.g.and). Considering the phases of the goal representation along each axis, and following the logic of the 1D solution, the distance and direction to the goal location is indicated by the maximum gradient of a plane through the origin that fits the phase points p j, i + 2 πn j, i for all modules i and axes j and lies within the capacity of the grid cell system (Figure 4 C).

Again, this result can be generalized to arbitrary current and goal locations by replacing the absolute phases p j, i that define the goal location with the phase difference Δp j, i between the current and goal locations on each axis and in each module. This solution is consistent with the Fourier shift theorem (see), with the sets of grid cells in each module that share a common phase on each axis acting as Fourier components of the spatial representation. If grid cell orientations are identical across modules, then the displacement between start and goal locations can be solved independently on each axis as in the 1D case: by finding the line through the origin that best fits the phase points along that axis. We note that it is sufficient to solve for two directions, as more axes do not provide additional independent information — the constraint thatfor 3 directions separated by 120° is implicitly included by fitting lines through the origin. However, given independent noise in the firing rates of biological neurons, pooling estimates across directions could potentially mitigate error in the extracted translation vector. Additionally, if grid cell orientations are not conserved across modules, or if grid firing fields are elliptical, then the solution still holds, but the plane must be fit to a family of phase points that differ in axesacross grid cell modules and in spatial scale s i across axes.

### Consensus guide on CT-based prediction of stopping-power ratio using a hounsfield look-up table for proton therapy [^20db469a]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Studies have shown large variations in stopping-power ratio (SPR) prediction from computed tomography (CT) across European proton centres. To standardise this process, a step-by-step guide on specifying a Hounsfield look-up table (HLUT) is presented here.

Materials and Methods

The HLUT specification process is divided into six steps: Phantom setup, CT acquisition, CT number extraction, SPR determination, HLUT specification, and HLUT validation. Appropriate CT phantoms have a head- and body-sized part, with tissue-equivalent inserts in regard to X-ray and proton interactions. CT numbers are extracted from a region-of-interest covering the inner 70% of each insert in-plane and several axial CT slices in scan direction. For optimal HLUT specification, the SPR of phantom inserts is measured in a proton beam and the SPR of tabulated human tissues is computed stoichiometrically at 100 MeV. Including both phantom inserts and tabulated human tissues increases HLUT stability. Piecewise linear regressions are performed between CT numbers and SPRs for four tissue groups (lung, adipose, soft tissue, and bone) and then connected with straight lines. Finally, a thorough but simple validation is performed.

Results

The best practices and individual challenges are explained comprehensively for each step. A well-defined strategy for specifying the connection points between the individual line segments of the HLUT is presented. The guide was tested exemplarily on three CT scanners from different vendors, proving its feasibility.

Conclusion

The presented step-by-step guide for CT-based HLUT specification with recommendations and examples can contribute to reduce inter-centre variations in SPR prediction.

### Sensitivity and spectral control of network lasers [^ad9cccab]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A derivative-free, greedy iterative algorithm was used to find the optimised pump patterns. Firstly, a coarse grid (8 × 5 grid with each pixel corresponding to 60 × 60 μ m 2 size on sample) was used. Starting from the pixel closest to the centre of the grid, each pixel was switched off consecutively and the change in the intensity of the selected lasing mode was calculated using the recorded spectral counts. For a given lasing peak p, we calculated the following quality function at each optimisation step n :where a n is the ratio of the intensity of the selected lasing peak p to the average intensity of the top M strongest lasing peaks (M = 10 in our experiments), all under pump pattern n. If Φ n > 0, the pump on that pixel was kept off, otherwise it was switched back on, and the routine was iterated. The final pattern from a first run was then fed as the initial pattern for a subsequent re-run with a finer grid (patch sizes of 30 × 30 μ m 2) for further optimisation.

Numerical construction of Buffon graphs

Buffon graphs were generated by drawing lines on a plane at random points with random slope. The intersections of all the lines within a square region on the plane were obtained and the length of the line segments between intersections calculated. If a segment length was smaller than a minimum distance of 1 μ m, the intersection points were merged together to the median point. The final set of intersection points and line segments was then used to specify the graph vertices and adjacency matrix. The Buffon graphs used for numerical calculations were constructed to be similar to the polymer nanofiber networks, with 96 nodes, 131 edges, average degree 4, and mean edge length 23.8 μ m.

### Relative, local and global dimension in complex networks [^8c93a379]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To illustrate the notion of relative dimension, we used a line graph (Fig. 1 a, b) as a discrete representation of the continuous 1-D interval. We observe that due to the boundaries, a large fraction of nodes do not have a peak in transient response, however for nodes near the source, where the boundary has no influence, the relative dimension is close to the expected d = 1. We emphasise that the dimension is not derived from a fit to the data, as is common in measures of fractal dimensions –, but instead is directly observed at the transient response relative to a source node.

Fig. 1
The relative, local and global dimension.

a-c Line graph example with n = 500 nodes representing the interval [0, 1]. a The relative dimension of nodes given a source located at x = 0.33. The grey lines are the transient responses of the (non-source) nodes and the position of the peaks in the transient responses are highlighted by dots, coloured by their relative dimension. Top inset, a histogram of transient response peaks where the far right bin corresponds to nodes where no peak in the transient response was observed, and thus no relative dimension could be calculated. b The relative dimension as a function of position in [0, 1] shows a plateau near d r e l = 1 for nodes near the source. The grey region indicates the set of nodes for which no peak was observed. c The local dimension of each node as a function of scale, where above τ = 1, the stationary state is attained and the local dimension is stable. d The local dimension of the grid graph (n = 500) at scale τ = 0.1, showing inhomogeneities due to the boundaries similar to the line graph. e The evolution of the global dimension(normalised by the expected Euclidean dimension) as a function of scale for the same line and grid graph as well as their periodic equivalent graphs, illustrating differing behaviours emerging from the influence of the boundaries or the topology. f For the same graphs as in e, we increase the number of nodes in each dimension to measure the convergence rate ofto the underlying Euclidean dimension d eucl, showing a faster convergence for lower dimensional spaces and periodic grids.

### No inherent left and right side in human' mental number line': evidence from right brain damage [^449bb32d]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Spatial reasoning has a relevant role in mathematics and helps daily computational activities. It is widely assumed that in cultures with left-to-right reading, numbers are organized along the mental equivalent of a ruler, the mental number line, with small magnitudes located to the left of larger ones. Patients with right brain damage can disregard smaller numbers while mentally setting the midpoint of number intervals. This has been interpreted as a sign of spatial neglect for numbers on the left side of the mental number line and taken as a strong argument for the intrinsic left-to-right organization of the mental number line. Here, we put forward the understanding of this cognitive disability by discovering that patients with right brain damage disregard smaller numbers both when these are mapped on the left side of the mental number line and on the right side of an imagined clock face. This shows that the right hemisphere supports the representation of small numerical magnitudes independently from their mapping on the left or the right side of a spatial-mental layout. In addition, the study of the anatomical correlates through voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and the mapping of lesion peaks on the diffusion tensor imaging-based reconstruction of white matter pathways showed that the rightward bias in the imagined clock-face was correlated with lesions of high-level middle temporal visual areas that code stimuli in object-centred spatial coordinates, i.e. stimuli that, like a clock face, have an inherent left and right side. In contrast, bias towards higher numbers on the mental number line was linked to white matter damage in the frontal component of the parietal-frontal number network. These anatomical findings show that the human brain does not represent the mental number line as an object with an inherent left and right side. We conclude that the bias towards higher numbers in the mental bisection of number intervals does not depend on left side spatial, imagery or object-centred neglect and that it rather depends on disruption of an abstract non-spatial representation of small numerical magnitudes.

### Lung ultrasound is a reliable method for evaluating extravascular lung water volume in rodents [^5dab2277]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

In humans, the 28-rib space technique is used to semi-quantitatively evaluate the volume EVLW, and the number of B-lines are counted at four sites (parasternal, mid-clavicular, anterior-axillary and mid-axillary lines) in each space from the second to the fourth intercostal spaces of the left hemithorax and the second to the fifth intercostal spaces on the right (3*4 + 4*4 = 28). This evaluation is performed at precisely defined lines for accurate measurements. In rats, the "28-rib space" technique was modified due to the smaller area of the rats' backside. The LUS consisted of bilateral scanning of the posterior(dorsal)and lateral chest walls. Each hemithorax was divided into two zones: (1) from the posterior axillary line to the scapular line and (2) from the scapular line to the paravertebral line. A total of four scans were performed for each rat. Lung scanning was performed in the vertical plane on the rat's dorsal wall (Fig. 1b). In each scan, five to six intercostal spaces were present on the screen. The probe was oriented in the "up and down" position to allow for whole lung imaging, which consistently demonstrated seven intercostal spaces (Fig. 1c). In summary, the lung was conceptually divided into four parts, and each parts contained seven intercostal spaces. This manner was analogous to the "28-rib space" evaluated in humans, with the only difference being that the vertical scanning plane was used in rats while the horizontal scanning plane is typically used in humans. The scanning sites were marked by a drawing pen in order to put the probe at exactly the same anatomical point each time.

### The use of plots in orthopaedic literature [^95fed5f5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Plots are an elegant and effective way to represent data. At their best they encourage the reader and promote comprehension. A graphical representation can give a far more intuitive feel to the pattern of results in the study than a list of numerical data, or the result of a statistical calculation. The temptation to exaggerate differences or relationships between variables by using broken axes, overlaid axes, or inconsistent scaling between plots should be avoided. A plot should be self-explanatory and not complicated. It should make good use of the available space. The axes should be scaled appropriately and labelled with an appropriate dimension. Plots are recognised statistical methods of presenting data and usually require specialised statistical software to create them. The statistical analysis and methods to generate the plots are as important as the methodology of the study itself. The software, including dates and version numbers, as well as statistical tests should be appropriately referenced. Following some of the guidance provided in this article will enhance a manuscript.

### Double-layer geodesic and gradient-index lenses [^1a9407cf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this work, we explore a generalization of a recent problem addressed in lens design (schematic given in Fig. 1), where wave propagation takes place in two (upper and lower) parallel plate waveguides, containing two different inhomogeneous refractive index profiles and connected by a mirror or reflector over part of their common circumference. The combination of the reflection and the two inhomogeneous profiles serves to e.g. convert an incident plane wave in the first waveguide, to a focused spot in the second. We call such devices 'double-layer' lenses. This idea of double-layer lenses was inspired by the work of Rotmanwhere the wave between two layers is transferred by a 'curved conducting back wall' at the lens rim, often referred to as a 'pillbox' antenna because of its shape. Thanks to the rotational symmetry, that solution provides a wider scanning range in comparison to parabolic reflectors (or a parabolic pillbox) and other line source antennas, which made it an attractive solution for the early microwave radar systems developed in the 1950s. However, this geometry is limited by spherical aberrations. Combining the double-layer pillbox antenna described by Rotman and the Luneburg lens concept, a pillbox antenna with no aberrations (in principle) was recently proposed and referred to as a 'reflective Luneburg lens'.

Fig. 1
Schematic of the 2D double-layer lens problem.

a Graded index double-layer lens defined under polar coordinate system (r, ϕ). Incident rays from a point source at r = r s in upper waveguide are first refracted by the profile n 1 (r) before encountering the mirror on the far side of the device. The mirror reflects the ray into a lower waveguide where it is refracted by the profile n 2 (r), focusing all rays to a point image at r = r i. The thickness of the waveguides is neglected in first approximation for the purposes of this development, considering it is small compared to the wavelength. b Equivalent geodesic double-layer lens, where the refractive index is placed with an out of plane deformation z (ρ) of the upper/lower waveguide described by the arc length s 1,2 (ρ) of the surface measured along the meridian from the axis of symmetry under a cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, ϕ, z). In both cases, the background medium outside the lens has refractive indices n a and n b for the upper and lower waveguides, respectively.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Researcher's guide for the preparation of tables [^4c1babbe]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Almost all scientific articles include tables, but there is little guidance on how to prepare tables. Authors should enhance the focus on the tables' data-ink, the essential information, and minimizing the no-data-ink, nonessential elements. The six principles of Gestalt on human perception can also be applied to the table to increase readability. Through this review, we provide a practical guide and an overview of how to prepare readable, informative tables. The five steps for the preparation of tables include (1) tables with a clear purpose; (2) using a universal layout; (3) selecting relevant data for Table 1 versus other tables; (4) simplifying variables by categorizing, standardizing, and reducing; and (5) enhancing the readability of numbers and decimals. This results in informative tables that contain data, serving a specific purpose for the reader and increasing readability.

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

### Development of a comprehensive and clinically applicable novel projection classification system for anterior communicating artery aneurysms [^f15a618c]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

If the aneurysm projection contained more than one quadrant or more than two linear orientations, it was considered a complex projection (F i g. 2 G–I).

As a result, a 3D grading system comprising a total of 25 projections, including nine main projections with complex projections in four quadrants and four linear orientations in the sagittal plane, was created (Fig. 1 D–F, Table 2).

In the presence of vertical A2 trace orientation, the anterior–posterior projection was replaced with the medial–lateral projection and the medial–lateral projection with the anterior–posterior projection owing to the 90-degree shift of the classical orientation. The anterior–posterior assessment was performed according to A1 dominance and the side of approach.

### Retinoic acid promotes the endogenous repair of lung stem / progenitor cells in combined with simvastatin after acute lung injury: a stereological analysis [^3e75e565]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

AT1 cell surface fraction

Similar to the analysis of alveolar cell surface density, the selected tissue pictures were overlaid with unbiased counting frames and line segments. The number of intersections between the midline and the interalveolar septum covered with AT1 cells was counted as P1, while that of intersections between the midline and the interalveolar septum denuded or uncovered with AT1 was counted as P0. The criteria of adopted intersections include the complete interception points as well as the incomplete interception points only residing in the upper- and right-sides. The number of target visions in each animal at least reach 30. The surface fraction of AT1 cells = P1/(P 0 + P 1).

AT2 cell numerical density

Similar to the stereological analysis of AT1 cells, the selected tissue pictures were overlaid with unbiased counting frames and cross line segments. The total number of test points is 144. The adopted intersections should both cover the point of intersection and right superior quadrant. The number of adopted intersections is counted as Q. The fraction of alveolar surface area = Q/144. the alveolar surface area (S) = area of unbiased counting frame (0.017 mm 2) × Q/144. Then, the number of adopted AT2 cells was counted as N AT2. The adopted AT2 cells should express pro-SPC in the cytoplasm with a DAPI+ nucleus. The shape of positive granules in the photos should be round, semi round or elliptical. The round- or cube-shaped cells reside in the alveolar wall. All the target cells are in the counting frames except those intersected with the forbidden lines. The numerical density of AT2 cells = N AT2 /S.

### Alternative methods for intensity-modulated radiation therapy inverse planning and dose delivery [^31a2e82e]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

A large number of IMRT systems are currently being marketed. Many of these systems appear to be unique, and manufacturers often emphasize design differences as they argue the merits of their particular approach. This paper focuses on highlighting the underlying feature that is intrinsically part of all IMRT systems. On the other hand, major differences often appear at the implementation stage for dose delivery. Such variations are evident because each manufacturer has a unique approach to balancing the issues of treatment time, leakage radiation reaching the patient's total body, aperture approximation of the ideal intensity maps, increasing the angles of approach for the treatment fields, integration of on-line imaging, selection of treatment distance, availability of different photon energies, and overall system complexity (i.e., cost). How these different issues are handled in the process of system design affects the relative advantages and disadvantages that appear in the final product. This paper takes the approach of dividing the various IMRT methods into categories that are divided roughly along the lines of the technique used during dose delivery to approximate the intensity patterns.

### Upper airway lengthening caused by weight increase in obstructive sleep apnea patients [^69840034]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Definitions of main parameters on the midsagittal plane. In a, the two lines drawn from the hard palate, near the top of the oral cavity, and the hyoid, which are also normal to the posterior wall, define the two ends of the upper airway. The parameter h, a part of the upper airway length, is the distance from the upper edge of the second cervical vertebra to the hard palate plane. The average thickness of the posterior cervical soft tissue T ST is calculated from the area surrounded by the three lines and skin dividing the distance between the two parallel lines passing through the upper and lower edges of the second cervical vertebra. In b, the long axis of the tongue L LAX starts from the central point of the hyoid bone and ends at a point farthest from the hyoid on the tongue surface, and the short axis L SAX is the perpendicular bisector of L LAX ending on the tongue surfaces. The average thickness of the posterior cervical fat T NF is calculated by the area of the fat beneath the skin, from the bottoms of the second to the sixth cervical vertebrae, dividing the length of the central line. In c, The angles α and β represent the relative positions among the occipital bone, cervical vertebra, and nasion: β is the angle between the posterior wall of the upper airway and the occipital bone line drawn from the sellar to the tip of the clivus, and α is the angle between the occipital bone line and the line drawn from the nasion to the sellar. θ is the angle between the posterior wall of the upper airway and the line drawn from the nasion to the sellar. The lower left corner is a magnification of the local region defining these three angles

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^302f40f7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this modeling framework, a linear readout unit (the gray circle in Fig. 1 b) returning the arbitrary function f (r k) of the rank r k assigned to the k -th item, exists, and it is given by the following linear combination of item representations:Indeed, from this definitionproving Eq. (2) for any set of assigned ranks. Note that by adding to the GML any arbitrary vectorexternal to the M -dimensional space (i.e.for any k), Eq. (2) still holds leaving unchanged the model output. This means that, in principle, an infinite number of GML exist. We will come back to this point later in the text.

In the particular case f (r k) = r k, the row vector of synaptic weightsallows to readout directly the rank of the k -th item presented to the shallow network in Fig. 1 b. It results to be proportional to the projection of the network statealong the line oriented as, as shown in Fig. 1 c for the example sequence 'ABC'. Here, althoughis the vector of synaptic weights between the readout y and the units x i, we can represent it as a line in the network state-space. Indeed, Eq. (3)is a weighted sum of the network activitiesleading to the interpretation of it also as an activity pattern itself. In this geometric framework, the model output (i.e. the inner product) explicitly corresponds to the projection of the network state onto the line. The geometrically composedis then the searched mental line where item representations are sorted, solving a serial ordering task. As such, in what follows, we callthe geometric mental line (GML). Changing item order from 'ABC' to 'BCA' as in Fig. 1 d, the GML rotates in the M = 3-dimensional space of the representationsgiving a new set of projections sorted according to the new item position in the sequence (see Supplementary Movie 1 for a clearer visualization of the mechanism).

### Parallel window decoding enables scalable fault tolerant quantum computation [^fa1b8ee8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Methods

All simulations were performed on a standard D32as v4 Azure instance. We used the PyMatching packageto perform MWPM. For UF we used a custom Python implementation of the algorithm described in Ref.

The decoding graph for each window is acquired by taking a subset of edges between nodes belonging to vertices in the window. Depending on the rough bottom (top) time boundaries, we further add edges connecting each of the nodes in the first (last) round to the boundary node. These are assigned a probability equal to the probability of triggering one of the edges connecting the given node in the window to a node out of the window.

In all experiments, we compute the logical error rate of sliding and parallel window methods for rotated planar code with different code sizes and increasing number of decoding rounds. We use circuit-level noise parametrized by p = 0.5% with the following noise model:
p two-qubit depolarising noise after each two-qubit gate
measurement results flipped with probability p
p /10 depolarising noise after each single-qubit gate and reset operation
p /10 depolarising noise for any idling qubit while gates are applied elsewhere

The syndrome data for the noise model has been sampled using Stim simulation package.

To compute the timing for Fig. 4 b, we perform the decoding onrounds to ensure a full utilization of parallel resources if both A and B decoding steps. We assume initialisation and readout in the Z basis, meaning that the initial and final rounds of defects are smooth. Moreover, in parallel window decoding, we take the first round to always belong to layer A, and the first 2 d rounds of the first window are committed to. The last round belongs to a layer B if the total number of rounds n tot satisfies, in which case the decoding is performed normally with the last B window potentially being of reduced size. Otherwise, the last window belongs to layer A and the commit region of the last window is from the bottom of the regular commit region to the last round.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^ce8ee8fa]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Definition of inness I

Figure 1 illustrates the forces related to a city's morphological patterns shaped by infrastructural and socio-economic layouts. For the case of a square grid, as shown in Fig. 1a, the shortest routes between any two points at a distance r either correspond trivially to the line connecting them directly, or are degenerate paths that traverse the grid in either direction. Taking the average of the multiple paths cancels any directional bias relative to the center of the grid. Yet, a small perturbation of this regularity can change this neutral feature dramatically, as shown in Fig. 1b, where we shift the four outermost points inward as to place them on the second ring from the center. Points lying on this ring have shortest routes that lie along the periphery, thus introducing a dispersive force away from the center (marked as blue arrows). In Fig. 1c, we further perturb the topology by adding four lines from the outer ring to the inner ring (marked in green) thus increasing connectivity toward the center. Shortest paths between pairs on the outer ring traverse through the inner ring and are curved toward the city center, resulting in an attractive force (represented as red arrows). Beyond this simple example, which is primarily a function of topology and is applicable to shortest paths, other factors are in play such as travel time and route velocity as considered in ref. that will necessarily affect the patterns seen in fastest paths. Furthermore, the illustration assumes a single center of gravity, as it were, whereas such an effect may manifest itself at multiple scales, resulting in cancellation of any measurable force toward a putative city center.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f5d9ba0e]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 1D

The cyclical nature of the grid representation within each module i is such that an activity bump at phase p i implicitly represents an infinite set of "unwrapped" phases p i + 2 πn i, where n i can take any integer value, corresponding to an infinite set of distances s i (p i /2 π + n i) along that 1D axis that are separated by the scale s i of module i. Initially, we assume that all phases are zero at the current location a and the distance d to a goal location b must be inferred from the grid cell representation across modules at that location { p i (b)} = { p 1 (b), p 2 (b),…, p M (b)}. The grid representation of the goal location b is such that there is a set of unwrapped phases (one for each module) that explicitly represent the same distance — i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

Graphically, this coherent set of unwrapped phases across modules falls on a horizontal line when plotted against a y axis of represented distance (i.e. y = d; Figure 4 A) or, equivalently, on a straight line through the origin when plotted against a y axis of phase against inverse grid scale (Equation 2; Figure 4 B) — i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

This latter relationship is obtained by re-arranging Equation 1 and corresponds to the Fourier shift theorem (see discussion of the Algorithmic Solution in 2D below;). Thus, the distance d to a goal location represented by the set of module phases { p i } can be inferred by fitting a straight line through the origin on a plot of unwrapped phases p i + 2 πn i against inverse grid scale 1/ s i across modules (Figure 4 B). Moreover, this result can be generalized to any pair of arbitrary current and goal locations on that 1D axis, by replacing the absolute phase p i at the goal location with the phase difference Δp i between grid cell representations of current and goal locations in each module (Equation 3):

### Clinical efficacy and safety of focused-image ultrasonography: a 2-year experience [^ce7518be]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Focused-image ultrasonography produces controlled waves that image dermal and subdermal structures in real time, with precise thermal coagulation points in a linear pattern, for eventual nonsurgical lifting.

Objectives

The authors evaluate the effectiveness of single and dual planes of ultrasound treatment by varying the directions of treatment lines, depths, and cumulative joule energies and compare the safety and efficacy of treatment with these variations.

Methods

In this prospective, 2-part study, patients were treated by single- or dual-treatment depth with differing directions of treatment lines while the number of treatment lines and amount of energy delivered to brows or marionette lines remained constant (Study 1) or with lower or higher joule energy to opposing areas while the dual depths and number of vectored lines remained constant (Study 2). Lifting was measured using the matched-orientation function of specific mirroring software. Clinical outcomes were assessed with global aesthetic improvement scales.

Results

Vertical vectoring of 15 treatment lines in both tissue depths produced significant lifting over the 15 horizontally-placed treatment lines in the opposing brows and marionette lines. Sites with more treatment lines and higher joule energy at dual depths resulted in significantly greater lifting (Study 2). Side effects were minimal.

Conclusions

Focused-imaged ultrasound therapy to facial tissues is safe and effective when performed as described.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### A left-to-right bias in number-space mapping across ages and cultures [^6d44fd14]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Ordering Card Task

For the Free Ordering task, we started by performing a χ 2 analysis, on the frequency with which each type of spatial configuration (lateral line, sagittal line, two-dimensional, and random shape) was chosen by the participants in each group (Fig. 1B, Table S1). Then, for those participants who used a lateral linear configuration, we performed the quantitative analysis, which, following Pitt et al. proceeded in two steps.

First, we tested the systematicity of the lateral line mapping. To do so, for each participant we correlated the chosen order to that of the ideal left-to-right order using two-tailed Kendall's Tau Rank Correlation Coefficient, yielding a score between -1 and 1. The absolute value of the score indexes the systematicity of the mapping (i.e. how orderly: a score of ± 1 corresponds to a mapping where numerosity increases monotonically in one direction across all ten positions). Intermediate scores reflect imperfectly ordered mappings (Fig. S1). To determine whether participants performed the task by ordering the cards with a certain systematicity, we compared the distribution of mapping scores they produced to the distribution of mapping scores that would be expected by chance (i.e. as a result of random arrangements of the 10 stimuli on the line). The chance distribution was generated by performing all the possible permutations of the 10 elements sequences without repetitions (10! = 3,628,800 permutations) and it was compared to the real data distributions using the two-tailed two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test.

Second, we tested the direction of the mapping. The sign of the Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient indexes the direction of the mapping: positive scores indicate an overall rightward mapping, while negative scores indicate a leftward one. To determine whether a preferential direction of mapping emerged at the population level, we tested whether the group average score differed significantly from 0, using the non-parametric two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test to account for the non-normal distribution of the scores.

### Arbitrary starting point of separation affects morphology of the 2 bundles of anterior cruciate ligament at insertion sites [^655aa4fa]. Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To explore whether changes in the starting point of separation affect the morphology of the 2 bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at insertion.

Methods

Ten cadaveric knees were used to separate the ACL fibers into 2 bundles from 3 different starting points that were located at the proximal one fifth, two fifths, and three fifths of the inter-bundle mark line. The dividing lines between the 2 bundles at insertion and the area of the anteromedial (AM) bundle resulting from these different separations were compared, with data collected in groups I, II, and III, respectively.

Results

The angle of the dividing line and the long axis of the femoral footprint was 67.24 degrees ± 11.94 degrees, 91.01 degrees ± 11.16 degrees, and 116.03 degrees ± 9.01 degrees in groups I, II, and III, respectively, and the percentage of the AM bundle area in the whole femoral footprint was 38.64% ± 5.55%, 52.22% ± 6.76%, and 65.09% ± 4.53%, respectively. At the tibial insertion sites, the angle between the dividing line and the sagittal plane was 110.17 degrees ± 13.26 degrees, 127.72 degrees ± 8.94 degrees, and 149.28 degrees ± 18.80 degrees in groups I, II, and III, respectively, and the percentage of the AM bundle area in the whole footprint was 25.72% ± 3.82%, 40.41% ± 3.73%, and 60.56% ± 6.59%, respectively. There were statistical differences between the angle and the area data of each of the 2 groups at either the tibial or femoral insertion site.

Conclusions

In an anatomic study of the ACL, changes in the point from which separation started resulted in noticeably different bundle morphology at the insertion.

Clinical Relevance

Proper separation will lead to a more accurate bundle description and, thus, a more accurate location of the tunnels in ACL reconstruction.

### Correcting for imaging gradients-related bias of trelaxation times at high-resolution MRI [^bacd1bd6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Step III: Calculating the effective b‐value of each coherence pathway. Each CP has a unique evolution pattern, seeing as it "spends" part of the time along the transverse XY plane where it is affected by T 2 and diffusion related decay, and part of the time along the longitudinal direction where it undergoes T 1 relaxation. As a result, each CP will accumulate a different diffusion encoding. By fully tracking the temporal evolution of each CP, we calculated its effective b ‐value and corresponding diffusion‐related decay as a function of the series of G RO, G PE, and G SS gradient pulses. Although G RO and G SS remain constant for all k ‐space lines, G PE changes between lines, having a somewhat complex effect on each x‐y location. This gradient, however, is also the weakest of the three channels, causing a relatively small diffusion encoding. The PE gradient amplitude was therefore set to a weighted average of all PE gradient pulses.

The calculation was repeated for eachlocation along the slice profile, and per ADC(x, y, z) value. To alleviate the computational burden of this procedure, we first identified a limited number of ADC values existing in the assayed tissue (typically 0.6, 0.7,…, 1.6 mm 2 /s) and performed the analysis only for this discretized set of values.

Step IV: Calculating the overall gradients‐related diffusion decay per TE. The diffusion‐related signal decay was calculated by first summing the subset of CPs that contribute to each TE, followed by summing the relative contribution of eachlocation along the slice profile according to Equation (5).

Step V: Integration of the gradients‐related diffusion decay into the EMC model. The EMC algorithm is based on matching experimental signals to a simulated dictionary of T 2 decay curves. To account for diffusion, each dictionary entry was multiplied by the diffusion‐related decay at each TE. Practically, this resulted in a series of dictionaries, each corresponding to a different ADC value. The choice to account for diffusion effects by multiplying the theoretical dictionary by a decay factor (0… 1), instead of dividing the experimental signal by the same factor, was done due to the fact that a multiplication operation is much more stable than a division, which might lead to divergence of the solution at late TEs where the diffusion‐related decay factor might be close to zero.

### Action plan co-optimization reveals the parallel encoding of competing reach movements [^0d2449ee]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

We also tested for averaging of initial reach movement direction. For this analysis, we reasoned that if participants' movement directions were spatially averaged across target positions then we should find that the initial direction of movement in two-target trials is biased towards the spatial midpoint position of the two potential targets. This would result in the movement paths being more curved, in the horizontal plane, in two-target trials compared with one-target trials. However, we found that an analysis of the average path curvature, based on participant means, revealed no such differences (t 8 = 0.77; P = 0.47) between two-target (M = 0.120; s.e. = 0.006) and one-target (M = 0.116; s.e. = 0.006) trials. Moreover, on average the paths for both one- and two- trials were quite straight, as a value of 0.120 (for two-target trials) indicates that the maximum deviation from a straight line was 12% of the straight-line distance to the target. Taken together, the above findings indicate that, in our task, (1) the initial movement did not arise from an average of planned movements and (2) participants did not prepare a single movement towards a visual average of the targets.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^cb69ea4e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The second step of the reconstruction approach aims to fit a new accurate range for each identified cluster, shown in Fig. 2 d, by operating on greyscale mappings of the RGB observations and radiosities estimated in the first step. Assumingclustersare computed, for each cluster j we form a greyscale radiosity vectorby setting to zero entries incorresponding to surface elements not present in cluster, with j = 1, 2,…, J. (See the Supplementary Note 4 (S4.1) for more details on this step.) With their angular extents fixed, the clusters collectively produce a contribution to the measured photograph that depends non-linearly on their respective unknown rangesand constituent surface elements (i.e.). The greyscale photograph y grey computed as the sum of the three colour channels is related to the unknown cluster scalar rangesand the estimated vector of radiositiesby:with matrix-vector form, where the weighting factors w j 's allow the radiosity of each cluster to vary correspondingly when estimating their unknown continuous-valued ranges arranged into the J -dimensional vector, andis a matrix whose (m, j)-entry models the contribution of cluster j to measurement pixel m. The vectors v, n, b and matrix B are defined as before. We estimate the ranges of all J clusters by solving the optimisation problem, using an accelerated projected gradient algorithm which is detailed in Supplementary Note 4 (S4.1). As confirmed by our FI analyses detailed in Supplementary Note 2, choosing to estimate a single range for each clusterleads to a better-conditioned inverse problem because J ≪ N θ N ψ, compared to the alternative approach that attempts to recover a range for every surface element. Using the estimated ranges, visualised in Fig. 2 e with the corresponding clusters, to construct the forward model, the final 3D full-colour reconstruction (depicted in Fig. 2 f) of the hidden scene is computed by solving the total variation regularised problem:for each of the three colour channels. The total variation seminorm denoted asis used here to encourage piecewise smooth solutions, whilecontrols the trade-off between data consistency and piecewise smoothness. One may bypass the total-variation-constrained reconstruction and directly combine the recovered ranges with the initial full-colour shape reconstructions (in Fig. 2 c) to obtain the fully 3D colour reconstruction of the hidden scene. This simplified variant of TERI which achieves impressive results at comparably lower computational complexity and three alternative reconstruction approaches are investigated in Supplementary Note 6. A narrated overview of the reconstruction procedure is provided in Supplementary Movie 1.

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^d73719c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Comparison between phase gradient maximization and field minimization to obtain phase singularities.

Both methods can be used to obtain phase singularities, but they produce different field behavior in terms of its real (blue) and imaginary (red) zero-isosurfaces. Yellow dots label the positions at which the field and phase gradients are optimized. Inset surface plots are the logarithmically scaled field intensities at z = 0 μm over the same XY domain. The z = 0 μm plane is indicated with the gray plane in each isosurface plot. a When the phase gradient in a specified direction is maximized, the two zero-isosurfaces align approximately tangentially and in the direction normal to that specified gradient. This produces a flat low field intensity structure along these aligned zero-isosurfaces. b Minimizing the field amplitude at a point to produce a singularity merely enforces a crossing of the zero-isosurfaces without any alignment, producing a 1D line singularity. c Simultaneously optimizing two nearby points with directed phase gradients can extend the range of the singularity sheet. d Minimizing the field amplitude at two points simultaneously does not guarantee alignment of the zero-isosurfaces and can instead produce multiple crossing lines, each producing a 1D line singularity.

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^eb974788]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A general mathematical description of how the brain sequentially encodes knowledge remains elusive. We propose a linear solution for serial learning tasks, based on the concept of mixed selectivity in high-dimensional neural state spaces. In our framework, neural representations of items in a sequence are projected along a "geometric" mental line learned through classical conditioning. The model successfully solves serial position tasks and explains behaviors observed in humans and animals during transitive inference tasks amidst noisy sensory input and stochastic neural activity. This approach extends to recurrent neural networks performing motor decision tasks, where the same geometric mental line correlates with motor plans and modulates network activity according to the symbolic distance between items. Serial ordering is thus predicted to emerge as a monotonic mapping between sensory input and behavioral output, highlighting a possible pivotal role for motor-related associative cortices in transitive inference tasks.

### A selection and targeting framework of cortical locations for line-scanning fMRI [^7d5ce816]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Anatomical measures confirm accurate line‐planning

First, we used anatomical information to assess planning accuracy. We created a binarized mask representing the nominal line by taking the middle 16 voxels (indicative of the nominal 4 mm gap between saturation pulses) in the phase encoding direction along the frequency encoding direction. Of note, due to the imperfect nature of these saturation slabs, there are contaminating signals coming from outside the region‐of‐interest (Raimondo, Knapen, et al; Raimondo, Priovoulos, et al.). Because the full registration cascade from target vertex to the line through the low‐resolution image, partial FOV image, and single slice is known, we can project the nominal line image back onto the surface (Figure 3a, b). This showed that for all subjects, the line was indeed placed on the target site as per the overlap of the line (white) and target vertex (red spot) (Figure 3c).

FIGURE 3
Assessment of line‐placement accuracy using anatomical measures. The registration cascade from target vertex (a) to line‐scanning acquisition (b; outer right panel) is known after registering the anatomical image from Session 1 (high‐res) to the anatomical image from Session 2 (low‐res). Within Session 2, we acquired a partial field‐of‐view image (partial FOV), as well as the anatomical slice without OVS pulses (slice). From this slice, we created an image representing the nominal line (line). For each subject, we projected this nominal line image back to the surface from which the target vertex originated, showing sufficient overlap between the target vertex (red dot) and nominal line image (white patches) (c). The patches represent the location at which the nominal line image intersects with GM and looks scattered due to unfolding of the cortex. (d) Variation in registration outcomes after registration anatomies from Sessions 1 and 2, a hundred times for each subject. (e) Effect of subject motion by means of manual alignment of the single slice images on positional stability of the target coordinate. (f) Curvature distributions within the gray patch intersecting with the target location of (c). The curvature is measured as 1/r, where r is the radius of an inscribed circle. Since mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures, it has the units of 1/mm.

### A structured framework for standardized 3D leg alignment analysis: an international Delphi consensus study [^b2817f91]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Individual femoral and tibial/fibular coordinate systems

For purpose of reference and clinical utility, axes and joint orientations are projected onto coronal, sagittal or axial anatomical reference planes. Therefore, defining a coordinate system becomes essential. The expert panel reached consensus on definitions for both femoral and tibial/fibular coordinate systems (Figure 3). The expert panel further agreed that the medial‐lateral axes for both coordinate systems should be derived from all available articular surface data of the medial and lateral distal femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, respectively (Figure 3b, g).

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Effects of episodic slow slip on seismicity and stress near a subduction-zone megathrust [^edc8efc8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

B-value analysis

We estimated the time evolution of b-values and seismicity rate relative to the SST occurrence times. For the b-value calculation, we used the following relation:whereand M c is the complete magnitude (i.e. lower limit of the detected magnitude). The 95% confidence level for b-value estimations is given by b/√ N (N: number of events).

Spatial classification of in-slab events

We identified in-slab earthquakes based on normal distance from the inferred plate interface estimated by receiver function analysis. The plate model beneath Kii peninsula was estimated using 99 temporary as well as 55 permanent seismic stations, and is broadly similar to a previous modelbased on only permanent stations. The depth contours of this model, are clearly consistent with the locations of low-frequency earthquakes, and repeating earthquakes(Fig. 2b–d). The available seismicity and focal mechanisms in the Kii Peninsula indicate that, as found in many subduction zones, the downgoing slab is organized as a double seismic zone, (Fig. 2b–d) in which the upper and lower zones exhibit different stress regimes. Therefore, to analyze the stress regimes, we divided in-slab events with focal mechanisms into upper-plane events (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a – d) and other in-slab events (interplane and lower-plane events) (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f) and performed stress tensor inversions (Fig. 2e–j and Supplementary Table 1). We classified in-slab events within 10 km of the plate interface (and at depths of 25–45 km) as upper-plane events, whereas in-slab events farther from the interface were classified as interplane and lower-plane events. The classification of upper-plane events is similar to a previous study beneath northeastern Japan.

For more detailed analyses, we further divided upper-plane events into events below the SST zone and events 20–50 km updip of the SST zone (Figs. 1 and 2a–h and Supplementary Fig. 2a – d). We define the SST zone to lie within 20 km from the centers of the tremor sequences which are shown as blue, green, and red lines in Fig. 1a.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Standardized medical terminology for cardiac computed tomography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^20efbe99]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2011). Medium credibility.

Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography cardiac CT reconstruction and display terminology defines: Increment as the nominal distance between the centers of consecutively reconstructed slices expressed in mm; CT number as the numerical value assigned to each pixel in an image relative to water, expressed in Hounsfield units (HU); Hounsfield units (HU) as the unit of measurement for CT numbers; multicycle reconstruction as using raw data from the same phase of 2 or more consecutive cardiac cycles to effectively improve temporal resolution; multiphasic reconstruction as the creation of 2 or more series per cardiac cycle to evaluate different time points; image processing as mathematical modification of reconstructed images; multiplanar reformat (MPR) and curved multiplanar reformat (cMPR) as two-dimensional grayscale images displaying all pixels in an orthogonal or oblique or a curved plane through the imaged volume; maximum intensity projection (MIP) and minimum intensity projection (MinIP) as two-dimensional projections displaying only the pixel having the highest or lowest CT number along a path orthogonal to the specified section; volume–rendering technique (VRT) as reconstructing 2-dimensional planar images from a 3-dimensional volume to display the object's 3-dimensional nature; and straightened vessel view as 360° visualization of a vessel around an axis of rotation defined by the vessel centerline, with display options including MIP and VRT.

### Facial contouring by using dermal fillers and botulinum toxin A: a practical approach [^ac4f5427]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Balance

Different methods have been used to evaluate facial characteristics including anthropometry, photogrammetry, computer imaging and cephalometry. The face may be divided into horizontal thirds (Fig. 2 a) and vertical fifths (Fig. 2 b). The facial height is divided into three equal parts: The first third goes from the trichion (Tr) to the glabella (G), the middle third from the G to the subnasal point (subN) and from this point to the menton corresponds to the lower third of the face (Fig. 2 a). On the other hand, the facial width is divided into five equal parts, each part approximately equal to the width of an eye (Fig. 2 b).

Fig. 2
Different divisions of the face. a Division of the face into vertical fifths. b Division of the face into horizontal thirds. 1 upper third: Tr-Gl; 2 middle third: Gl-subN; 3: lower third: subN-Me. Tr Trichion, Gl glabella, Me menton, SubN subnasale. The images of this figure are an Allergan property, and consent was provided for their use in this publication

In the contour observation, the assessment is based on the Ricketts "Esthetic Plane" or "E" plane. Essentially, the "E" plane is a line drawn from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin. The key issue is to look at how the upper and lower lip relate to that line. Ideally, the lower lip would be 2 mm behind the line, and the upper lip 4 mm behind the line, with variations being normal for patients of different ethnic backgrounds, but with some commonalities applying to all patients.

Skeletal malocclusion is a common birth defect that occurs due to the distortion of the maxillary and/or mandibular development that will have a huge impact on the positioning, alignment and health of the primary and permanent teeth.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac computed tomography multiplanar reconstruction for a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis — how to obtain image reconstructions in plane and perpendicular to the valve — is performed by loading images in a multiplanar viewer with the crosshairs locked so they remain in a fixed 90-degree orientation when rotating one of the axes, starting with the initial axial, coronal and sagittal orientations (Panels A, B and C). In the coronal plane (B) the red line is rotated counterclockwise to be parallel to the valve ring, then in the sagittal plane (C) the red line is rotated to also be parallel to the valve ring. In the resulting planes (D, E and F) it is checked that the valve ring can be seen as a complete ring in the adapted axial plane (D) and, if not seen, the red axis needs to be rotated some more. In the adapted axial plane (D) one needs to scroll up and down until the two valve leaflets can be seen as two parallel lines inside the valve ring, and if the leaflets are not parallel the red line needs to be rotated again whilst looking at the leaflets. Then the green line in the adapted axial plane (G) is rotated so it is parallel to the valve leaflets, resulting in an orientation perfectly perpendicular to the valve leaflets in the two other imaging planes (H and I).

### Quantitative mappings between symmetry and topology in solids [^ce1ff365]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.

### Establishing the customized occlusal plane in systemized surgical treatment objectives of class III [^31b73c92]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to present a new approach for establishing the customized occlusal plane for an individual patient in systemized surgical treatment objective of class III cases. After the correction of incisor inclination to occlusal planes (U1-MxOP and L1-MnOP), the intermaxillary relationship can be established with normal overbite/overjet and maximum intercuspation. The anterior limits of the maxilla and the mandible can be positioned according to A to N perpendicular, Frankfort horizontal (FH) to AB plane angle, and upper incisor display. The vertical level of the upper first molar can then be determined in relation to the Y plane (an imaginary arch drawn using the distance between the lower incisor edge point and the rotation center point of the condylar head as a radius) and a triangle projected by the upper and lower limits of the FH to the occlusal plane (FH-OP triangle). Soft-tissue facial balance can be checked with the lip/chin projection in relation to the true vertical line at subnasale and the lower third facial height ratio. Appropriate superior impaction of the posterior part of the maxilla in relation to the Y plane and FH-OP triangle in case 1 produced significant improvement of the facial profile and occlusion. However, case 2 showed that the amount of superior impaction of the posterior part of the maxilla was not enough to produce a significant setback of the mandible and retraction of the lip and chin. The systemized surgical treatment objective flowchart that could set the customized occlusal plane for an individual patient might provide a useful guideline for obtaining optimal aesthetics and functional occlusion in class III cases.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^bf222a53]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Data sampling and definition of inness I. a Thirty-six origin–destination (OD) pairs (spaced out at intervals of 10°) are assigned along the circumference of circles at a distance of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 km from the city center C. b For each OD pair, we query the Open Source Map API and collect the shortest routes (red) and the fastest routes (blue) (shown here for a representative OD pair in Paris). c A typical OD pair with the straight line connecting them representing the geodesic distance s; r is the radial distance from the center and θ is the angular separation relative to the center. We define the inness (I) to be the difference between the inner travel area (polygon delineated by red inner point and straight line) and the outer travel area (polygon delineated by blue outer point and straight line). d Three possible route configurations between multiple OD pairs. One with an exclusively outer travel area (blue), one with an exclusively inner travel area (red), and one where there is some combination of both

The inness of a node in the road network is a result of aggregating characteristics of all possible routes that pass through that point. Indeed, it reflects the structure of the network since it is a metric influenced by topology and network connectivity. However, in addition to this, it captures the geometric aspects of the network since it is a measure based on the curvature of the roads along a route and encodes structural information at both the global and local scales. In that sense, one can consider it to contain elements of various standard structural network metrics (see Supplementary Note 2 for details and comparison with a series of network metrics). We note that such metrics — particularly those that are global measures such as the betweenness centrality — have been previously used to classify cities. Recent results, however, cast doubt on the efficacy of centrality measures to distinguish between cities. On the other hand, as we will demonstrate, the inness, in addition to being a relatively simple measure, encodes the geometric, infrastructural, geographical, and socioeconomic aspects of urban systems.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Shear rate gradients promote a bi-phasic thrombus formation on weak adhesive proteins, such as fibrinogen in a VWF-dependent manner [^dd64b0f3]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Computational modeling of VWF dynamics

VWF dynamics was described with a model reported in. In order to reduce computational complexity, hydrodynamic correlations were not taken into account. The VWF dimer was treated as a sphere with a 70 nm radius. The polymer chain was represented as the chain of interconnected spheres, joined with Hookean springs. The interaction parameters were taken from. In order to infer conformational dynamics of VWF molecules within different flow lines of the chamber (flow lines lying within the central z-x plane were considered), the corresponding flow velocity profiles were taken from the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation results. The local velocity gradient tensor was computed from polynomial interpolation of velocity profiles obtained from CFD simulations. In order to reduce the computational burden we considered VWF dynamics along the 1 mm of flow lines corresponding to stenosis entrance region (as far as this region possesses the highest values of elongational velocity gradients). VWF elongation d for a given moment of time was determined as maximum linear size of VWF molecule divided by the length of fully unfolded molecule. Values of VWF elongation exceeding unity correspond to flow-mediated extension of linear unfolded molecule. In case VWF elongation exceeded unity, the molecule was considered to be fully unfolded. In order to obtain a relative value of unfolding events we considered flow lines with different heights above fibrinogen surface: 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 µm. For each height above the surface, 100 VWF trajectories were analyzed to infer the mean relative number of VWF unfolding events. The maximum relative number of unfolding events were analyzed for each flow line. Analysis was performed for long (n = 80 dimers) VWF multimers.

### Novel flight style and light wings boost flight performance of tiny beetles [^4b3201a5]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Average wingbeat frequency was calculated as the mean of the wingbeat frequency in all recordings. In each recording, the number of frames was counted in several complete kinematic cycles, 104 cycles in total.

For the mathematical description of the kinematics of the wings and elytra, we used the Euler angles system, (Fig. 2b) based on frame-by-frame reconstruction of the location of the insect's body parts (wings, elytra and body itself) performed in Autodesk 3Ds Max. Three-dimensional models of the body and elytra were obtained by confocal microscope image stacking, and the flat wing model was based on light microscopy photos of dissected wings. We used the rigid flat wing model for reconstruction of the kinematics because the deformations of the wings are minor (Supplementary Information). First, we prepared frame sequences with four full kinematical cycles in each. The frames were then centred and cropped by point between the bases of the wings and then placed as orthogonal projections. Virtual models of body parts were placed into a coordinate system with two image planes. Then we manually changed the position and rotated body parts until their orthogonal projections were superimposed on the image planes. For calculating the Euler angles, a coordinate system was created (Fig. 2a). The X0Y plane is a plane parallel to the stroke plane, and intersecting with the base of wing or elytron, which is positioned in the zero point. To determine the position of the stroke plane, we calculated the major axis trend line of the wingtip coordinates instead of the linear trend line, because the wingtip trajectory of P. placentis forms a wide scatter plot. Stroke deviation angle (θ) and positional angle (φ) were calculated from the coordinates of the base and apex. Pitch angle (ψ) is the angle between the stroke plane and the chord perpendicular to the line between the base and apex. The body pitch angle (χ) is the angle between the stroke plane and longitudinal axis of the body, calculated as the line between the tip of the abdomen and the midpoint between the apical antennomeres. Pitch angle (β) of the stroke plane relative to the horizon was also measured.

EELS compositional maps performed in two areas (e, f) indicated in (d) show that upon negative voltage treatment Fe/Co ions and N 3– ions migrate in opposite directions, thereby creating a distinct planar migration front indicated by black dashed lines in (f). This planar front divides the nanodots into two sub-layers with distinct magnetic properties: ferromagnetic FeCo/(Fe, Co) 4 N (i.e. nitrogen-depleted) at the bottom part and paramagnetic FeCoN (i.e. nitrogen-rich) in the upper part of the nanodot. g, h Normalized EELS compositional line profiles of as-grown and treated FeCoN dots, respectively, collected starting from the top of the nanodot. HR-TEM images of nanodot's interior before (i) and after (j) voltage treatment (at –25 V), including the FFT of the areas marked by orange squares. Reflections marked by yellow and cyan circles in (i) correspond to the interplanar distances of 2.26 Å, 2.60 Å, respectively, and stem from (200) and (111) planes of(Fe, Co)N. After voltage treatment (j), new interplanar distances of 1.10 Å (green) and 2.15 Å (pink) emerge. Interplanar distance of 1.10 Å can be ascribed to (311) planes of face-centered cubic (fcc)Co, (211) planes of body-centered cubic (bcc)Fe, or to (211) planes of simple cubicFeCo alloy. Similarly, interplanar distance 2.15 Å can be related to (111) planes of fccCo, (110) planes of bccFe, (110) planes ofFeCo or (111) planes of(Fe, Co) 4 N.

### ACFAS scoring scale user guide [^ec202bba]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2005). Medium credibility.

ACFAS scoring scale — first metatarsophalangeal joint and first ray module — Module 1 is the scoring scale designed for the pathology of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and first ray and should be used for the clinical evaluation of hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, and less common deformities such as hallux malleus and hallux varus. The subjective patient questionnaire is designed to quantify the presence of pain, the cosmetics of the deformity, and the patient's functional capabilities, and the objective section relies on radiographic assessment of the deformity and clinical evaluation of function. For radiographic measurement, the ACFAS Scoring Scale Committee recommends that the first metatarsal declination be measured by obtaining a bisection of the head and base of the first metatarsal and measuring this line to the ground plane, which permits measurement on investigations that involve first metatarsal head, shaft, and base surgical procedures; the first metatarsal declination angle is drawn from the lateral radiograph and is the angle formed by the bisection of the first metatarsal and a line parallel to the ground supporting surface.

### Monolithic 3D integration of 2D transistors and vertical RRAMs in 1T-4R structure for high-density memory [^115740d5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We then perform measurements on the parallel set and reset behaviors for two of the VRRAM layers in the 1T–4R structure (Supplementary Fig. 20), using the schemes as shown in Fig. 5c, d. The intrinsic device-to-device variation could complicate the parallel programming operation of VRRAMs due to voltage and current division effects. The detailed switching dynamics are modeled in Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22, and discussed in Supplementary Note 3. If one VRRAM shows the set transition earlier than the others, the transistor not only should provide enough current for the parallel set operation, but also needs to have a relatively small On-state resistance compared with the parallel resistance of VRRAMs in LRS states, to ensure enough voltage drop on the VRRAMs to enable the programming of the other VRRAM. Nevertheless, by increasing the applied voltage after the set transition of the first VRRAM, parallel set behavior with a 2D MoS 2 transistor driving two layers of VRRAMs has been experimentally demonstrated, with the second VRRAM programmed at a larger voltage compared with the first VRRAM (Supplementary Fig. 20). It is also observed that the parallel reset behavior is barely affected by the device variation, because the reset of one VRRAM can make the reset of another VRRAM easier due to a larger voltage drop across the VRRAMs.

The parallel programming capability in the vertical direction is determined both by the amount of drive current provided by the MoS 2 FETs and the intrinsic device-to-device variation of VRRAMs. We first model the drive current required for simultaneously switching different numbers of VRRAM layers during the set (Fig. 5f) and reset (Fig. 5g) processes, and compare with the current that can be provided by the MoS 2 FETs. With the VRRAM variations taken into consideration, we show that for the set process, the MoS 2 FET can drive up to 8 layers of VRRAMs; and for the reset process, it can drive up to 9 layers of VRRAMs in parallel in the 1T– n R configuration. The parallel driving capability can be further improved by decreasing the contact resistance, using 2D semiconductors with a higher carrier mobility, or constructing gate-all-around transistors by stacking 2D nanosheets.

### Correlation of modic changes with sagittal lumbopelvic parameters [^84c02316]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Parameters Measurement

The above-mentioned 2 reviewers independently measured all radiological parameters on X-ray images from 15 randomly selected subjects and calculated the inter-observer reliability thereafter. In addition, the measurement of these parameters were repeated 10 days after the first measurement and the intra-observer reliability was calculated.

Surgimap ® 2.3.2.1 software (Nemaris Inc. New York, USA) was used to measure the parameters on X-ray images. The sagittal parameters were measured in the neutral position on X-ray images (Figure 2). Lumbar lordosis (LL) was the angle between by two lines which were parallel to the superior endplate of L1 and the inferior endplate of L5. The conformation of sacral slope (SS) was similar to LL, but it consisted of one line parallel to the superior endplate of S1 and the horizontal line. Pelvic tilt (PT) was an angle formed by a line through the midpoint of the S1 superior endplate and the center of the femoral head and a vertical line through the center of the femoral head. Pelvic incidence (PI), which is an angle that based on a line perpendicular to the sacral endplate and a line through the midpoint of the S1 superior endplate and the center of the femoral head, is a fixed value determined by the sum of the SS and PT.

Size of MCs

We adopted a classification proposed by Hanımoğlu et alto categorize the distribution of three types of MCs at the endplate and vertebral bodies. This classification method allowed us to divide the vertebrae into 4 equal parts including 16 small units across the horizontal and vertical planes (Figure 3). The total sizes of MCs were calculated by summing each small unit of MCs involvement. Therefore, we could determine the involvement area of MCs as from 0 to IV4 (Table 1). The involvement area of MCs with less than 1/4 of the vertebral body horizontally or vertically was defined as slight, larger than 1/4 but smaller than 3/4 of the vertebral body as moderate, and more than 3/4 of the vertebral body as severe.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Delineation of two intracranial areas and the perpendicular intracranial width is sufficient for intracranial volume estimation [^d043fc49]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

Fig. 5
Comparison of correlations. With 95% confidence, the actual differences in correlations between methods 2 to 4 (M2–4) are within the height of the plotted boxes. The unit of the y-axes is the Pearson correlation and ranges between −0.1 and 0.1. Above each plot, the confidence intervals are also given in numbers rounded to the nearest thousandth. The titles of the columns tell which correlation was used as minuend and the titles of the rows which correlation was used as subtrahend when calculating the confidence intervals. The planes denote a correlation difference of zero and are red when the confidence intervals pass through zero, indicating that the actual difference between the two compared methods might be zero. C (coronal), S (sagittal) and T (transversal) denote the orientation of the intracranial areas used

### Miniature origami robot for various biological micromanipulations [^25276015]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The "split and splice" method

Microstructures containing close-loops, such as micro-parallel mechanisms are generally hard to fabricate with traditional methods. The SCM method provides a powerful tool for fabricating microstructures with massive joints. For a micro parallel mechanism with the SCM method, a generic method for designing the fabrication process can greatly reduce the difficulties and complexities of the manufacturing. Here we present the "split and splice" method to expand the scope of the SCM method to the micro close-loop structures and micro parallel mechanisms. The idea can be demonstrated in three steps (Fig. 7 a).

Fig. 7
The "split and splice" method for Smart Composite Microstructure (SCM) process.

a The demonstration of the method. b – d The examples on Sarrus mechanism (b), Delta mechanism (c) and origami transmission mechanism of the Micro-X4 (this work) (d).

The first step is to split the x -limb parallel mechanisms twice. The first time, the mechanism is separated into M separated chains, this splitment is under the longitude direction. The second time, each separated chain is splited into N parts. Thus, the parallel mechanism is totally splited into M × N parts. The second step is to fabricate the separated chains by the SCM method. Since the close-loops are broken in the first step, the planarized process is easy to achieve here. The parts are connected into separated chains by adhesion and key-keyhole, connection. Finally, the separated chains are connected into a complete closed-loop parallel mechanism.

The selection of the splitment need to follow the rules:
In the longitude direction, for an x -limbs parallel mechanism, the parameter M is generally selected as M ≤ x to avoid redundant platform fragments.
In the latitude direction, for a limb with y joints, the parameter N is generally selected as N ≤ y to avoid redundant limb fragments.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Two-phase analysis in consensus genetic mapping [^6364adec]. G3 (2012). Low credibility.

As a conflict region, we imply a set of segments of the maps for the mapping populations that include shared and unique markers and fit the conditions: (a) unique markers are flanked by or are adjacent to the shared markers and (b) at least for one pair of populations, two or more shared markers from the region appear in conflict order. The procedure of defining conflict region is illustrated in Figure 2. The analysis of several datasets may reveal a few conflict regions separated by regions of no conflict. In Figure 2, the process of delineating a conflict region is based on overlaps of pairwise conflicts. The conflict between markers a and b includes the first five sets; the conflict region is bordered by a single line. A second conflict, between b and d markers, starts at set 4 and extends until set 7. In defining the boundaries of the conflict region, we employ the following rules: (i) the size of the region depends on the conflict markers, where a conflict marker can coincide with the boundary only if it is simultaneously the end marker of the linkage group (in the example in Figure 2, conflict markers а and b coincide with the end in sets 1 and 2, respectively); (ii) in all other cases, boundary marker for the conflict region may be either a non-conflict shared marker or a unique marker; and (iii) depending on the width of the conflict region, we employ the exact or heuristic optimization algorithm.

Local algorithm of consensus analysis, in contrast to global analysis, applies only to the conflict region. With several regions, the conflicts are resolved successively in each such frame. A conflict region should include at least a pair of shared markers, the order of which in at least one set is opposite to the order in other sets. The conflict region of the entire set of mapping populations should include the considered pair of conflicting markers as well as all markers in between this pair, either shared or unique. In turn, the shared markers in the conflict region can also be in conflict with other markers. This conglomerate of pairwise conflicts makes up a conflict region that can also be extended by including neighbor markers from both sides that do not create any conflict (see Figure 2). This extension is needed because during the process of resolving the conflict(s) within the conflict region, the flanking markers are frozen. Note that if one of the ends of the conflict region coincides with the end of the linkage group, then only one of the ends (the internal one) remains frozen during the optimization.

### The first mitotic division of human embryos is highly error prone [^360b1cec]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Clinical imaging and analysis of human embryos

A cohort of 304 clinical human embryos were analysed in this study. These embryos were imaged on an EmbryoScope TM as part of patient ART treatment. Hoffman modulation contrast images are collected every 10 min for up to 6 days (blastocyst formation). These embryos fall into 3 categories: 80 singly transferred embryos which gave rise to clinical pregnancy, 76 singly transferred embryos which did not give rise to clinical pregnancy and 148 embryos (from the 80 patients who had single embryo transfers and became pregnant) which were not transferred or cryopreserved due to abnormal morphology (80 which had a normal first cytokinesis, dividing into 2 cells and 68 which had an abnormal cytokinesis, dividing into 3 or more cells). Clinical pregnancy is defined as foetal heartbeat detection at 7 weeks. The timing of events (PNBD, the start of cytokinetic furrow ingression and the appearance of 2 distinct cells) during the first cell division were determined and presented in Fig. 4b. Nuclear phenotype was further assessed in blastomeres of 80 embryos as they progressed from the 2-cell to the 4-cell stage and presented in Fig. 6. These are the same 80 embryos that gave rise to clinical pregnancy in Fig. 4b. If nuclei were not visible in all blastomeres, the embryos were excluded from analysis in Fig. 6d. Each blastomere was visually examined for nuclear variants using multiple-focal planes from time lapse sequences. A FIJI macro was used to compile embryoscope data files. The diameter of all visible nuclei was measured using FIJI line tool and converted from pixels to µm in Fig. 6c.

Data and statistical analysis

Mann–Whitney U -tests for Fig. 5b, Fisher's exact tests for Figs. 2b, c, 5d, e, and 6b, e, and Kruskal–Wallis test with post hoc Dunn's test for Fig. 4b were performed using MATLAB R2020A (Mathworks) inbuilt functions. Gaussian distribution in Fig. 6c was plotted using EzyFit 2.44 toolbox. Equation: y (x) = a _1*exp(-(x - m _1) 2 /(2* s _1 2))+ a _2*exp(-(x- m _2) 2 /(2* s _2 2)).

### Striatal dopaminergic loss and dysphagia in parkinson disease [^3ee17921]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

PET Image Preprocessing and Quantitative Analysis

Preprocessing was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging;) and in-house scripts with MATLAB 2020b (MathWorks Inc;). First, reorientation was implemented according to the anterior commissure of each raw PET image, and to consider minimal brain atrophy observed in patients, all PET scans of each patient were spatially normalized to the standard template in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 space (2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 per voxel). All PET scans were then smoothed using an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing, all PET images were confirmed to be registered in the MNI-152 space by a nuclear medicine specialist. Using the Oxford-Imanova Striatal Structural Atlas for the spatial definition of the striatum, voxel-wise DAT availability was calculated by the nondisplaceable binding potential defined as follows: (uptake value of the striatal voxels − mean uptake of the calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex [V1])/(mean uptake of the V1) where the V1 was defined according to the automated anatomical labeling atlas 3.

For the voxel-wise analysis, preprocessed PET images of each patient were masked with the striatal volume, and all values of the voxels belonging to this volume were used as independent variables. Labeling of the neuroanatomical regions of voxels was performed according to the definition of striatal 12 subregions (6 on each side) in previous studies. In summary, the striatum was divided into dorsal and ventral parts along the transaxial anteroposterior commissure line. The ventral part consists of 2 subregions: the ventral putamen and the ventral striatum. Thereafter, the dorsal part was divided by the coronal plane of the anterior commissure, resulting in 4 subregions, which are the anterior/posterior caudate and putamen.

### The rate and effects of spontaneous mutation on fitness traits in the social amoeba, dictyostelium discoideum [^c56f3aed]. G3 (2013). Low credibility.

For each competition treatment, the number of labeled cells (before starvation) of a total of at least 500, and the number of labeled spores (after the formation of FBs) of at least 500, were counted to estimate the relative contribution of the labeled strain to spore production. The efficiency of label retention also was estimated in the single-strain, fully labeled treatment, by scoring the number of 250 spores that were not labeled. In the control treatments for the competition experiments, 99.2% of spores retained the Cell Tracker dye on average (SD 0.31, n = 182). For 20 of the 90 MA lines, the competition treatments were repeated and the two replicates averaged.

To measure the competitive ability of a line, C line, we divided the ratio of line (S line) to ancestor (S anc) spores by the ratio of line (N line) to ancestor (N anc) cells in the initial mixtureCompetitive ability is an index of cheating. Values less than 1 indicate a poor competitor/cheater relative to the ancestor, and values greater than 1 indicate a good competitor/cheater. The competitive ability for a line is the average across the two reciprocal mixes. Other competition indices also were tested, but no difference in estimates of mutation parameters was found among them (data not shown).

### Sources of path integration error in young and aging humans [^b06c43a4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Path integration task.

a Example path from top-down perspective. Participants began at the starting point (green dot) and then walked along the path (curved black line). There were four stopping points (red dots) along each path; at these points, participants were asked to report their estimate of the direct distance and angle to the path's starting point. b During the experiment, participants saw a virtual environment from first-person perspective via a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements in the real world were tracked with a motion tracking system and translated to movements (i.e. changes in location and viewing orientation) in the virtual environment. Participants held a wooden stick and were guided by the experimenter along a path. At each stopping point, the direct distance to the starting point had to be estimated verbally in meters and centimeters, and participants turned their body on the spot to indicate the orientation to the starting point. c Three different virtual environments (left panel) used in the path integration task. Each environment comprised a ground plane and distant landmark cues. Landmark cues were rendered at infinity, in order to allow participants to determine their heading direction, but not position or distance information. One tile of each environment's ground plane is shown in the right panel. These tiles were textured to provide optic flow during movement, but were seamless (no visible border between adjacent tiles) and provided no fixed cues with positional information. d Overview of the 10 different paths used in the experiment. Each path contained three turns, and turn directions (i.e. left "L" and right "R" turns) were counter-balanced between paths. e Participants performed three blocks of the path integration task. Each block consisted of 16 paths (paths #1–10, and paths #1–6 repeated without intermediate stopping at stopping points 1–3). In addition, after the 4th and 12th path of each block, participants performed so-called "standardization-paths" (i.e. straight lines with a length of 2, 6, and 10 m), which were used to correct for each participant's bias in converting their internal location estimate to a verbal response. Text in bold in panel e indicates the phases used for data analyses. See "Methods" section for more details.

### Foot deformity correction planning in the sagittal plane based on the vitruvian foot first metatarsal anatomic axis [^9c1e39c8]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to test a novel planning method for midfoot deformity correction, based on reference lines and angles (RLA) of talus and first metatarsal of 64 normal radiographs from 55 patients. The anatomic lateral talometatarsal angle (aLTMA), resulting from the intersection of talus joint line (TJL), from the border of the articular surface of the talus to the posterior process of talus, and the anatomic axis of the first metatarsal, was 28.5° ± 4.5°. The intersection of those 2 lines divided the TJL in 2 segments (ac and ab) with the ratio k1 = 0.7 ± 0.3. The length of the first metatarsal line was measured from its intersection with the TJL and first metatarsal head, and it was 3.6 times longer that of the TJL (k2). To analyze foot deformity, we propose to draw the TJL line as follows. Use the k1 ratio to determine the point where the aLMTA intersects the TJL. From this point, an idealized anatomic first metatarsal line should be drawn, at 28.5° from the TJL. The distal end of that line is based on the k2 ratio (3.6 × TJL length). Next, the actual anatomic lateral talometatarsal line of the deformed foot is drawn. The intersection between these 2 lines identifies the apex and magnitude of the deformity. Deformity correction planning using the proposed method was demonstrated and confirmed in 2 cases. A reference method for analysis and planning of midfoot sagittal plane deformity correction independent of foot position relative to the ankle joint or the presence of concomitant hindfoot deformity appears promising for future investigation and use.

### Geospatial mapping of distribution grid with machine learning and publicly-accessible multi-modal data [^c7745818]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Road modeling and link prediction

We further integrate road information to enrich the features for predicting whether there is a line connection between two predicted poles. Specifically, each road can be represented as a series of line segments. If a detected pole or a street view point has a distance ≤ D attach to a road, it will be attached to that road (Fig. 2 c). All attached street view points and poles are sorted in order along the road. Moreover, to reduce the number of poles missed by the pole detector, we insert pole(s) between a pair of poles if the distance between them is greater than a threshold D insert.

We develop a link prediction model that takes feature variables for a pair of poles as inputs and outputs whether there is a line connection between the pole pair. Any pair of poles with a distance less than a threshold D cand is considered as a candidate. We consider various types of classification models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and gradient boosting. Feature candidates include (1) Distance between the two poles. (2) Whether the two poles are on the same road. (3) Whether the two poles are next to each other along the road. (4) Fraction of street view images with power lines detected between the two poles. (5) Minimum and average differences between the power line directions estimated from street view images and the direction of the line connecting the two poles. The small difference gives evidence that there is a power line connecting the two poles. (6) Whether either of the poles is detected by the pole detector or inserted. (7) Whether either of the poles is at a road intersection. (8) Whether the two poles are at the same road intersection. (9) The binary prediction of the modified Dijkstra's algorithm, running on a raster map. This algorithm finds the most efficient paths to connect poles: On a geospatial raster, each cell is assigned with a weight. By setting the weights at the positions of roads to be lower than others, connecting poles along a road is preferable (see the weight assignment scheme in Supplementary Note 1).

The best feature set and hyperparameters for link prediction are selected based on the 9-fold cross-validation on the San Carlos development set which are divided into 9 subsets according to the boundary divisions of the 9 census tracts in San Carlos. The output of the link prediction module is a geospatial graph with predicted poles as nodes and predicted line connections as edges.

### Stability bounds on superluminal propagation in active structures [^f2abf711]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For any real frequency, the transmission phaseis given bywhere the anglesare defined as the acute vertex formed by the-plane points[see Fig. 3(a)], and we split the phase into the free-space component and the one due to. The amplitude at a given frequency is the product of the distance from the zeros divided by the product of the distance from the poles, i.e.

The pole defines the bandwidth, and it is located at. The maximum advance-bandwidth product is found to be 3/2. For unitary transmission at, the zero must lie on the red curve in the figure, along which the maximum value is. The corresponding pole-zero pairs also exist at mirror positions around the imaginary axis. The solid black lines indicate (unequal, for illustrative purposes) contours of.

The group delay, written as the sum of the delays in free space and in the structure. The zeros contribute negatively to the group delay when in the lower half-plane, and the poles positively. In order to yield a broadband negative delay, the zeros should be optimally tailored to support a broadband response (with bandwidth increasing as the zero moves away from the real axis), but also have a fast angular derivative over the bandwidth of interest (implying they should not be too far from the axis). At the same time, to minimize the positive delays introduced by the poles, they should be positioned to have a small angular derivative over the operating bandwidth. This can either be achieved with poles with large negativevalues, or placed near the-axis outside the frequency range. In the former case, the amplitude in the superluminal regime will be small, as in the case of anomalous dispersion in the presence of large losses. The latter requires active structures, as the system will exhibit gain at frequencies near the pole.

μCT Data Visualization

μCT data can be reviewed immediately after CT reconstruction, presented as an interactive image stack in which the viewer can browse through the depth of the specimen, zoom, pan, and perform basic dimensional measurements (Supplemental Video S2). More importantly, because μCT voxels (3D pixels) are isotropic, orthogonal planes of the μCT data can also be accessed immediately after CT reconstruction. This rendering mode [alias multiplanar reconstruction (MPR)] allows simultaneous imaging of virtual slices taken along the width, depth, and height of the specimen (Figure 5). Because of the isotropic voxel dimensions, virtual reorientation and reslicing of the specimen can be easily achieved in silico (Figure 5). An example of such an interactive assessment of the 3D data is shown in Supplemental Video S3, where the reviewer locates an airway and the corresponding blood vessel, examines the cross-sectional views along two orthogonal planes, and proceeds to virtual reorientation and reslicing. By convention, the XY plane is assigned to the plane that is parallel to the histology cassette (Figure 5). In this example (Figure 5 and Supplemental Video S3), rotation of the orthogonal axis viewing system along the z and x axes was performed to fully expose the longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of the blood vessel in the YZ/XZ and XY planes, respectively.

Figure 5
Multiplanar reconstruction of 3D X-ray histology data. Top row 3D X-ray histology images can be reviewed immediately after CT reconstruction as an interactive image stack in the three principal orthogonal planes, with the XY plane defined (by convention) as the plane parallel to histology cassette. In this 2D view, the observer can browse through the depth, width, and height of the specimen, zoom, pan, and perform dimensional measurements. The uneven surface of the untrimmed wax can be seen as a bright edge at the bottom of the images shown in the YZ plane and XZ plane. Middle and bottom rows: Examples of reorientation and reslicing of the specimen to obtain the most relevant histologic (virtual) section. The process can be repeated on-the-fly for multiple features and as many times as required. Colored lines indicate the corresponding complementary orthogonal planes (YZ: yellow lines; XY: purple lines; XZ: blue lines); dashed arrows, the rotation of the corresponding orthogonal planes with respect to the plane presented in the panel.

### The parasagittal line: an anatomic landmark for axial imaging [^f409b0f0]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

No validated imaging landmark exists for characterizing the medial-lateral position of abnormalities at the high convexity-parasagittal region. Our understanding of the courses and deflections of the upper cerebral sulci is limited. Our purpose, therefore, was to define a frontooccipital line with reproducible anatomic relations to the upper cerebral gyri and sulci and to validate that line for use as an anatomic landmark by specific analysis of the gyral-sulcal relationships along it.

Methods

In 100 subjects of all ages, the gyri and sulci visualized on serial axial CT sections of the upper brain were traced onto a single flat surface to delineate the anatomic relationships among the midline interhemispheric fissure, the paramedian superior frontal sulci (SFS) and intraoccipital sulci (IOS), the medial surface sulci, the high convexity sulci, and the inner table of the skull. These tracings provided a template for drawing a straight, best-fit parasagittal line from the SFS to the IOS and for assessing how reproducibly key anatomic structures align along the parasagittal line. To assure the applicability of the line to MR imaging, selected relationships were retested on serial axial MR sections in the same subjects.

Results

The parasagittal line could be drawn in each case and showed reproducible alignment with the SFS, hand-motor area, partes marginales, pars deflections, postcentral "parentheses", distal intraparietal sulci, and IOS. In supraventricular sections, the parasagittal line separated the sulci arising along the medial surface from those arising along the convexity.

Conclusion

Because the anatomic relationships of the parasagittal line are reproducible, it may serve as a reference line or landmark. The tendency of this line to demarcate medial sulci from convexity sulci suggests immediate application to the definition of vascular territories and vascular watersheds, a topic under active investigation.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9470949b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) internal linear dimensions — Linear internal measurements of the LV "should be acquired in the parasternal long-axis view carefully obtained perpendicular to the LV long axis, and measured at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips," and electronic calipers "should be positioned on the interface between myocardial wall and cavity and the interface between wall and pericardium." Techniques include M-mode tracing and 2D-guided linear measurements; M-mode advantages are "Reproducible," "High temporal resolution," and "Wealth of published data," with limitations "Beam orientation frequently off axis" and "Single dimension, i.e., representative only in normally shaped ventricles." For 2D-guided linear measurements, an advantage is "Facilitates orientation perpendicular to the ventricular long axis," with limitations "Lower frame rates than M-mode" and "Single dimension, i.e., representative only in normally shaped ventricles."
