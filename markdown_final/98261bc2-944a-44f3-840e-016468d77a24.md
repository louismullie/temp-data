## Question

Where does renin come from

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the origin of renin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical source of renin in the kidney. Then, I should verify the specific renal cell type and its developmental lineage. Next, I will examine extrarenal sources and whether they produce active renin or mainly prorenin. After that, I need to consider pathological or stress-induced renin sources. Finally, I will integrate these into a concise, clinically relevant answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the canonical source. Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume or renal perfusion, which anchors the kidney as the primary endocrine source of active renin in physiology [^113psLTV] [^112W2k3o].

> Wait, let me verify the exact cell type. The specialized renin-producing cells are juxtaglomerular (JG) cells located at the afferent arteriolar pole of the glomerulus. They are the principal site of active renin synthesis, storage, and regulated release, making the JG apparatus the canonical source in adult kidneys [^112UVd9A] [^1142VMKp].

> I need to check the developmental origin of these cells. Renin cells arise from pericytes and vascular smooth muscle precursors during nephrogenesis; lineage studies and human kidney pericyte work show that perivascular pericytes can differentiate into renin-expressing cells and that adult JG cells retain plasticity to re-express renin when homeostasis is threatened [^112UVd9A] [^112W8SvU] [^116vg3r8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exclusivity. While the kidney is the dominant source of active renin, extrarenal tissues can express renin and its precursor prorenin. However, most extrarenal sources predominantly secrete inactive prorenin rather than mature, enzymatically active renin, so their contribution to circulating active renin is limited under normal conditions [^117VLxHf] [^1138xhPB].

> Let me consider specific extrarenal sites. The brain, adrenal glands, ovaries, uterus, placenta, and eye express renin system components, but most produce prorenin. Intriguingly, recent work identified renin-expressing cholinergic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus, suggesting a local, functionally relevant brain source in select circuits, though circulating renin still largely reflects renal output [^1135Annz] [^116fCZiQ] [^1152KMbM].

> I should double-check the prorenin versus renin distinction. Prorenin circulates at 10–20 times higher levels than renin and is produced by multiple extrarenal tissues; it can be activated locally by acid or receptor binding, but the kidney remains the only proven site of regulated, active renin secretion into the circulation under physiologic control [^1138xhPB] [^1152KMbM].

> Next, I should review pathological or stress-activated sources. In critical illness and vasodilatory shock, renin levels can be markedly elevated, sometimes exceeding levels seen in renin-secreting tumors, implying broad RAAS activation beyond the classic JG source. Additionally, collecting duct cells can increase prorenin production in diabetes, contributing to urinary renin and potentially to local tissue RAS activity [^115vqjNy] [^114JKfMd].

> But wait, what if a tumor is the source. Reninomas are rare juxtaglomerular cell tumors that autonomously secrete renin, causing secondary hyperaldosteronism and severe hypertension; their existence underscores that the JG lineage itself can become a pathologic source of renin excess [^115ZgswT].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The primary source of active renin is the kidney, specifically JG cells derived from pericyte/vascular smooth muscle precursors. Extrarenal tissues mainly contribute prorenin, with rare exceptions like nucleus ambiguus neurons that may produce renin locally. Under stress or disease, renin can be further upregulated and extrarenal or non-JG renal sources may become more prominent, but physiologic circulating active renin remains predominantly renal in origin [^112UVd9A] [^112W8SvU] [^117VLxHf] [^116fCZiQ].

---

Renin is produced primarily by **juxtaglomerular cells** in the kidney [^112UVd9A], where it is stored in granules and released into the circulation in response to decreased renal perfusion, sodium delivery, or sympathetic stimulation [^117VLxHf]. The kidney is the **only organ that secretes active renin** into the bloodstream [^1138xhPB]; other tissues (adrenal, ovary, uterus, placenta, eye) mainly produce inactive prorenin [^1152KMbM], which contributes minimally to circulating renin activity [^1152KMbM]. Renin initiates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system by cleaving liver-derived angiotensinogen to angiotensin I [^113psLTV], thereby regulating blood pressure and fluid balance [^114q1vv3].

## Primary source: juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney

- **Location**: Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are specialized smooth muscle cells at the afferent arteriole wall, adjacent to the macula densa [^115oPguU].

- **Function**: JG cells synthesize, store, and secrete active renin into the circulation [^117VLxHf].

- **Regulation**: Renin release is controlled by three main mechanisms: macula densa sodium chloride sensing, renal baroreceptor pressure sensing, and sympathetic β-adrenergic stimulation [^1175hmYf] [^112UVd9A].

---

## Extrarenal sources of renin

Although the kidney is the **primary source of active renin**, other tissues produce renin or its inactive precursor, prorenin [^111js4mR]. These extrarenal sources contribute minimally to circulating active renin but may have local tissue effects [^111d7uX3].

| **Tissue** | **Renin/prorenin production** | **Contribution to circulating active renin** |
|-|-|-|
| Adrenal gland | Prorenin | Minimal |
| Ovary | Prorenin | Minimal |
| Uterus | Prorenin | Minimal |
| Placenta | Prorenin | Minimal |
| Eye (retina) | Prorenin | Minimal |

---

These tissues predominantly produce **prorenin**, which has minimal enzymatic activity unless activated locally [^111js4mR]. The kidney remains the **only organ that secretes active renin** into the bloodstream [^117VLxHf].

---

## Regulation of renin secretion

Renin secretion is tightly regulated by **physiological signals**:

- **Macula densa mechanism**: Decreased sodium chloride delivery to the macula densa stimulates renin release [^1175hmYf].

- **Renal baroreceptor mechanism**: Reduced renal perfusion pressure activates baroreceptors, increasing renin secretion [^112UVd9A].

- **Sympathetic nervous system**: β-adrenergic stimulation enhances renin release [^112UVd9A].

---

## Clinical significance of renin

Renin is central to the **RAAS**, a key regulator of blood pressure and fluid balance [^113psLTV]. Abnormal renin levels or activity contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113N1Cxq]. Therapies targeting renin — such as direct renin inhibitors (e.g. aliskiren) — are used to manage hypertension and related conditions [^112i21Ha].

---

Renin is **primarily produced by juxtaglomerular cells** in the kidney, with extrarenal tissues contributing mainly prorenin. This distribution underscores the kidney's central role in RAAS regulation and blood pressure homeostasis [^1152KMbM].

### Renin inhibitor… [^115cHhhH]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

These drugs inhibit the first and rate-limiting step of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, namely the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This leads to a totality in absence of angiotensin II based on the rationale that renin only acts to inhibit this step unlike Angiotensin Converting Enzyme which is also involved in other biochemical reactions. Since the 1970s, scientists have been trying to develop potent inhibitors with acceptable oral bioavailability. The process was difficult and took about three decades. The first and second generations faced problems such as poor bioavailability and lack of potency. Finally, the third generation was discovered. These compounds were nonpeptidic renin inhibitors, had acceptable oral bioavailability and were potent enough for clinical use. The first drug in this class was aliskiren, which received a marketing approval in 2007. As of June 2020, it is the only renin inhibitor on the market.

History In 1896, the Finnish physiologist Robert Tigerstedt and the Swedish physician Per Bergman did an experiment on kidneys and the circulatory system in rabbits. They observed that blood pressure rose in the rabbits when extracts of the kidneys were injected into their jugular veins. They also discovered this substance responsible for higher blood pressure was produced in the renal cortex, and they named it renin. Although this experiment laid the foundation for future investigations into the RAAS pathway, it had little impact on the scientific community at that time. In 1934, when Goldblatt published his work in renal ischaemia, renin came into focus again. The importance of renin in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease was, however, not fully understood until in the 1970s, and 20 years later the first renin inhibitors went to clinical trials.

Pepstatin, which was described in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as remikiren, enalkiren and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never completed clinical trials. The highly selective aspartic protease renin is secreted from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which is the only source of active renin, although its precursor, prorenin, can be secreted by other tissues, such as the salivary glands, brain, heart and blood vessels.

Renin is a circulating enzyme that acts on a circulating peptide, angiotensinogen. Renin cleaves the peptide at the Leu10–Val11 bond, and this reaction is the rate-determining step of the RAAS. This leads to the product angiotensin I which is a decapeptide. Ang I is broken down by the angiotensin-converting enzyme to the active octapeptide angiotensin II, which is the principal effector of the RAAS. It is suspected that essential hypertension, a heterogeneous disorder whose long-term effects can be end organ damage, can involve at least in some cases an overactivity of this system, which several types of medications attempt to counter. Renin concentration in blood plasma tends to be higher in younger people with hypertension when vasoconstriction may be the main reason for high blood pressure.

### The alternative renin-angiotensin system in critically ill patients: pathophysiology and therapeutic implications [^113imuvg]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex regulatory system involved in the control of blood pressure and physiology of the cardio-renal system. The classical RAS, main effector of the system, is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II (Ang II). Hypoperfusion, sympathetic activation, or hypoxic metabolism trigger the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which cleaves angiotensinogen (produced by the liver) into angiotensin I (Ang I). ACE, primarily found in the membrane-bound endothelium of the pulmonary and renal capillary beds, converts Ang I into Ang II. Specific effects of Ang II are mediated by the activation of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT 1), widely distributed in the liver, adrenals, brain, lung, kidney, heart, and vasculature, which results to vasoconstriction, pro-inflammatory effects, fibrosis, vasopressin, and aldosterone release.

In critically ill patients, especially those with vasodilatory shock, the classical RAS may be pathophysiologically affected. Activation of the RAS is observed and characterized by increased levels of renin and Ang I, along with impaired Ang II signaling, resulting in an elevated circulating Ang I / Ang II ratio, which has been linked to mortality. Additionally, disturbances in Ang II signaling can occur at the tissue level, such as a reduction in AT 1 expression in blood vessels and kidneys in sepsis models.

While there is growing evidence of classical RAS alterations in critically ill patients, recent research has also highlighted disturbances in the counterbalancing axis of the classical RAS: the alternative RAS. The main functions observed so far in the alternative RAS are its ability to degrade Ang II via the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The classical RAS can also be modulated through the action of peptidases, such as dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3), which can degrade peptides from both the classical and alternative RAS.

Here, we provide an overview of the physiology and alterations of the alternative RAS and DPP3 in critically ill patients and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting this system.

### The increase in renin during renin inhibition: does it result in harmful effects by the (pro) renin receptor? [^11236vuw]. Hypertension Research (2010). Low credibility.

Renin inhibitors, similar to all renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, increase the plasma concentration of renin because they attenuate the negative feedback effect of angiotensin (Ang) II on renin release. The increase in renin has been suggested to be higher than that during other types of RAS blockade. This could potentially limit the effectiveness of renin inhibition, either because Ang II generation might occur again ('Ang II escape'), possibly even at the levels above baseline, as has been described before for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or because high levels of renin will stimulate the recently discovered (pro)renin receptor, and thus induce effects in an Ang-independent manner. This review shows first that the cause(s) of the renin increase during treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren is the consequence of a combination of factors, including an assay artifact, allowing the detection of prorenin as renin, and a change in renin half-life. When correcting for these phenomena the increase is unlikely to be as excessive as originally thought. The review then critically describes the consequence(s) of such a increase, concluding (i) that an Ang II escape is highly unlikely, given the [aliskiren]/[renin] stoichiometry, and (ii) that renin and prorenin downregulate their receptor (similar to many agonists). On the basis of the latter, one could even speculate that this will be more substantial when the renin and prorenin levels are higher. Thus, from this point of view the larger increase in renin during renin inhibition will cause a stronger reduction in (pro)renin receptor expression, and a greater suppression of (pro)renin receptor-mediated effects than other renin-Ang blockers.

### Calcium oscillations within juxtaglomerular cell clusters control renin release [^115oPguU]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Juxtaglomerular cells are sensors that control blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. They are arranged as clusters at the tip of each afferent arteriole. In response to decreased blood pressure or extracellular fluid volume, juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin, initiating an enzymatic cascade that culminates in the production of Ang II (angiotensin II), a potent vasoconstrictor that restores blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. In turn, Ang II exerts negative feedback on renin release commensurate with increased intracellular Ca 2+, preventing excessive circulating renin and hypertension. However, within their native structural organization, the intricacies of intracellular Ca 2+ signaling dynamics and their sources remain uncharacterized.

Methods

We generated mice expressing the juxtaglomerular cell-specific genetically encoded Ca 2+ indicator (GCaMP6f) to investigate Ca 2+ dynamics within juxtaglomerular cell clusters ex vivo and in vivo. For ex vivo Ca 2+ imaging, acutely prepared kidney slices were perfused continuously with a buffer containing variable Ca 2+ and Ang II concentrations ± Ca 2+ channel inhibitors. For in vivo Ca 2+ image capture, native mouse kidneys were imaged in situ using multiphoton microscopy with and without Ang II and Ang II type-1 receptor blocker losartan administration. ELISA measurements determined acute renin secretion ex vivo and in vivo.

Results

Ex vivo Ca 2+ imaging revealed that juxtaglomerular cell clusters exhibit robust and coordinated intracellular oscillatory signals with cell-cell propagation following Ang II stimulation. Ang II dose dependently induced stereotypical burst patterns characterized by consecutive Ca 2+ spikes, which inversely correlated with renin secretion. Pharmacological channel inhibition identified key sources of these oscillations: endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ storage and release, extracellular Ca 2+ uptake via store-operated ORAI (Ca 2+ -selective plasma membrane channels involved in store-operated Ca 2+ entry), Ca 2+ channels, and intercellular communication through gap junctions. Blocking ORAI channels and gap junctions reduced Ang II inhibitory effect on renin secretion. In vivo Ca 2+ imaging demonstrated robust intracellular and intercellular Ca 2+ oscillations within juxtaglomerular cell clusters under physiological conditions, exhibiting spike patterns consistent with those measured in ex vivo preparations. Ang II administration enhanced the Ca 2+ oscillatory signals and suppressed acute renin secretion, whereas losartan produced inverse effects in vivo.

Conclusions

Ang II elicits coordinated intracellular and intercellular Ca 2+ oscillations within juxtaglomerular cell clusters, ex vivo and in vivo. The effect is driven by endoplasmic reticulum-derived Ca 2+ release, ORAI channels, and gap junctions, leading to suppressed renin secretion.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112qVv5U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — justification and implementation of renin-guided titration: The guideline explains that "because the pathophysiology of PA in most individuals manifests with suppressed renin, a rise in renin with MRA therapy serves as a biomarker indicating a restoration of physiology", and therefore "we suggest focusing on dose intensification of MRA therapy to raise renin, particularly in individuals whose BP is not controlled". It further notes that "once BP is controlled, non-MRA medications can be lowered or removed, when possible, thus allowing further increases of MRA dosing and attempts to raise renin", that "interpretation of renin levels may be hampered" by other drugs affecting renin, and that "rather than targeting a specific renin threshold, we suggest that the observation that renin has increased from its pretreatment baseline should provide reassurance of treatment efficacy". As external context, it cites that "a recent large international consensus group endorsed targeting a rise in renin… to a level higher than 1.0 ng/mL/h (plasma renin activity [PRA]) or 10 mIU/L (direct renin concentration [DRC])".

### Evidence for a role of an intracardiac renin-angiotensin system in normal and failing hearts [^112i2vGz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although substantial evidence of a cardiac RAS has been obtained in the past decade, a number of important questions remain unanswered. These include identification and localization of the cell types responsible for production of the system's components as well as the regulation of synthesis, storage, and secretion pathways for each component. Future studies, which will utilize tools of molecular biology that have become recently available (for example, transgenic animal models), renin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, and bradykinin antagonists, will help to elucidate specific roles of the cardiac RAS in normal and failing hearts.

### Renin-angiotensin system… [^113VtJfj]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The renin–angiotensin system, or renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance. When renal blood flow is reduced, juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys convert the precursor prorenin into renin and secrete it directly into the circulation. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of angiotensinogen, released by the liver, to angiotensin I, which has no biological function on its own. Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to the active angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly those of the lungs. Angiotensin II has a short life of about 1 to 2 minutes. Then, it is rapidly degraded into angiotensin III by angiotensinases which are present in red blood cells and vascular beds in many tissues.

Activation The system can be activated when there is a loss of blood volume or a drop in blood pressure. This loss of pressure is interpreted by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus. It can also be activated by a decrease in the filtrate sodium chloride concentration or a decreased filtrate flow rate that will stimulate the macula densa to signal the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin.

1. If the perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney's macula densa decreases, then the juxtaglomerular cells release the enzyme renin.
2. Renin cleaves a decapeptide from angiotensinogen, a globular protein. The decapeptide is known as angiotensin I.
3.

Angiotensin I is then converted to an octapeptide, angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is thought to be found mainly in endothelial cells of the capillaries throughout the body, within the lungs and the epithelial cells of the kidneys. One study in 1992 found ACE in all blood vessel endothelial cells.
4. Angiotensin II is the major bioactive product of the renin–angiotensin system, binding to receptors on intraglomerular mesangial cells, causing these cells to contract along with the blood vessels surrounding them; and to receptors on the zona glomerulosa cells, causing the release of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Angiotensin II acts as an endocrine, autocrine/paracrine, and intracrine hormone.
- Throughout the body, angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor of arterioles.
- In the kidneys, angiotensin II constricts glomerular arterioles, having a greater effect on efferent arterioles than afferent.

As with most other capillary beds in the body, the constriction of afferent arterioles increases the arteriolar resistance, raising systemic arterial blood pressure and decreasing the blood flow.
- Angiotensin II decreases medullary blood flow through the vasa recta. This decreases the washout of NaCl and urea in the kidney medullary space. Thus, higher concentrations of NaCl and urea in the medulla facilitate increased absorption of tubular fluid. Furthermore, increased reabsorption of fluid into the medulla will increase passive reabsorption of sodium along the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle.
- Angiotensin II stimulates Na^+^/H^+^ exchangers located on the apical membranes of cells in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in addition to Na^+^ channels in the collecting ducts. This will ultimately lead to increased sodium reabsorption.

### Macula densa sensing and signaling mechanisms of renin release [^1175hmYf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Macula densa cells in the distal nephron, according to the classic paradigm, are salt sensors that generate paracrine chemical signals in the juxtaglomerular apparatus to control vital kidney functions, including renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and renin release. Renin is the rate-limiting step in the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, a key modulator of body fluid homeostasis. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding macula densa sensing and suggest these cells, in addition to salt, also sense various chemical and metabolic signals in the tubular environment that directly trigger renin release.

### Control of renin synthesis and secretion [^117VLxHf]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The aspartyl protease renin is the rate limiting activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Renin is synthesized as an enzymatically inactive proenzyme which is constitutively secreted from several tissues. Only renin-expressing cells in the kidney are capable of generating active renin from prorenin, which is stored in prominent vesicles and which is released into the circulation upon demand. The acute release of renin is controlled by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and by calcium signaling pathways, which in turn are activated by a number of systemic and local factors. Longer lasting challenges of renin secretion lead to changes in the number of renin-producing cells, which occur by a metaplastic transformation of renin cell precursors such as preglomerular vascular smooth muscle or extraglomerular mesangial cells. This review aims to briefly address the state of knowledge of these various aspects of renin synthesis and secretion and attempts to relate them to the in vivo situation, in particular in men.

### Renin inhibition: what are the therapeutic opportunities? [^1134WDAS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has become a crucial element in cardiovascular and renal medicine. This review evaluates the potential of renin inhibition as an adjunct to therapies that depend on renin system interruption.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in hypertension: is there evidence for benefit independent of blood pressure reduction? [^112i21Ha]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (HTN). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are first line anti-HTN drug classes that are potent, effective and largely safe. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have shown similar blood pressure (BP) reduction but more side effects. The efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs (for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal protection) has been promoted to extend beyond what could be explained by BP reduction alone. In the current review, we will briefly discuss the (1) pathophysiology of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system, (2) clinical evidence for ACEIs, ARBs and DRIs in HTN, (3) comparison of ACEIs vs. ARBs and combination therapy, (4) role of RAAS inhibitors in specific patient populations, (5) safety profile of RAAS inhibitors, and (6) guideline recommendations and future perspectives. Closer scrutiny of outcome data shows little, if any, evidence that the efficacy of RAAS blockers in HTN extends beyond BP reduction.

### Mechanisms of disease: local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems and the pathogenesis and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^111d7uX3]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Accumulating evidence has made it clear that not only does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) exist in the circulation where it is driven by renal renin, but it is also active in many tissues-and likely within cells as well. These systems might not be completely independent of each other, but rather interact. These local RAASs affect tissue and cellular angiotensin II concentrations and appear to be associated with clinically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic actions in the cardiovascular system and elsewhere. Evidence in support of this possibility is reviewed here. In addition, direct (pro)renin action after binding to its specific receptor, the existence of renin transcripts, which apparently encode an intracellular renin, the discovery of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme homologue (ACE2), which leads to enhanced generation of angiotensin-(1–7) and the newly appreciated role of angiotensin-receptor dimerization in the regulation of angiotensin activity, all point to the conclusion that the RAASs are complexly regulated, multifunctional systems with important roles both within and outside the cardiovascular system.

### Why the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in critically ill patients can no longer be ignored [^112LiTXj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There are profound and clinically relevant disturbances of the RAAS in critically ill patients, detected by the presence of hyperreninemia. Depending on the time of renin measurement and the population, this hormone may be associated with the development of AKI or an increased mortality or both. In addition, the vasodilatory biotype of high-renin shock may, in the future, be further defined by the mechanisms responsible for hyperreninemia. Irrespective of the mechanisms, however, personalized treatment of critically ill patients who have high renin-levels with AT-II might improve outcome. The importance and complexity of the RASS in critical illness can no longer be ignored.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the kidney: effects on kidney disease [^116n2psf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates renal vasomotor activity, maintains optimal salt and water homeostasis, and controls tissue growth in the kidney. However, pathologic consequences can result from overactivity of this cascade, involving it in the pathophysiology of kidney disease. An activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system promotes both systemic and glomerular capillary hypertension, which can induce hemodynamic injury to the vascular endothelium and glomerulus. In addition, direct profibrotic and proinflammatory actions of angiotensin II and aldosterone may also promote kidney damage. The majority of the untoward effects associated with angiotensin II appear to be mediated through its binding to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Aldosterone can also induce renal injury by binding to its receptor in the kidney. An understanding of this system is important to appreciate that inhibitors of this cascade can reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease in proteinuric disease states. Pharmacologic agents that can interfere with this cascade include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists. This paper will provide an overview of the renin-angiotensin system, review its role in kidney disease, examine the renal effects of inhibition of this cascade in experimental animal models, and review clinical studies utilizing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies.

### On the origin of urinary renin: a translational approach [^116Wz672]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary angiotensinogen excretion parallels albumin excretion, which is not the case for renin, while renin's precursor, prorenin, is undetectable in urine. We hypothesized that renin and prorenin, given their smaller size, are filtered through the glomerulus in larger amounts than albumin and angiotensinogen, and that differences in excretion rate are because of a difference in reabsorption in the proximal tubule. To address this, we determined the glomerular sieving coefficient of renin and prorenin and measured urinary renin/prorenin 1) after inducing prorenin in Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats and 2) in patients with Dent disease or Lowe syndrome, disorders characterized by defective proximal tubular reabsorption. Glomerular sieving coefficients followed molecular size (renin > prorenin > albumin). The induction of prorenin in rats resulted in a > 300-fold increase in plasma prorenin and doubling of blood pressure but did not lead to the appearance of prorenin in urine. It did cause parallel rises in urinary renin and albumin, which losartan but not hydralazine prevented. Defective proximal tubular reabsorption increased urinary renin and albumin 20- to 40-fold, and allowed prorenin detection in urine, at ≈50% of its levels in plasma. Taken together, these data indicate that circulating renin and prorenin are filtered into urine in larger amounts than albumin. All 3 proteins are subsequently reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. For prorenin, such reabsorption is ≈100%. Minimal variation in tubular reabsorption (in the order of a few %) is sufficient to explain why urinary renin and albumin excretion do not correlate. Urinary renin does not reflect prorenin that is converted to renin in tubular fluid.

### Kidney… [^113gWsKd]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

In humans, the kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped blood-filtering organs that are a multilobar, multipapillary form of mammalian kidneys, usually without signs of external lobulation. They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about 12 centimetres in length. They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. The word "renal" is an adjective meaning "relating to the kidneys", and its roots are French or late Latin. Whereas according to some opinions, "renal" should be replaced with "kidney" in scientific writings such as "kidney artery", other experts have advocated preserving the use of "renal" as appropriate including in "renal artery".

Structure In humans, the kidneys are located high in the abdominal cavity, one on each side of the spine, and lie in a retroperitoneal position at a slightly oblique angle. The asymmetry within the abdominal cavity, caused by the position of the liver, typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and smaller than the left, and being placed slightly more to the middle than the left kidney. The left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level T12 to L3, and the right is slightly lower. The right kidney sits just below the diaphragm and posterior to the liver. The left kidney sits below the diaphragm and posterior to the spleen. On top of each kidney is an adrenal gland. The upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th and 12th ribs. Each kidney, with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers of fat: the perirenal fat present between renal fascia and renal capsule and pararenal fat superior to the renal fascia.

The human kidney is a bean-shaped structure with a convex and a concave border. A recessed area on the concave border is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat. The anterior surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior surface is the transversalis fascia. The superior pole of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver. For the left kidney, it is next to the spleen. Both, therefore, move down upon inhalation. A Danish study measured the median renal length to be 11. 2 cm on the left side and
10. 9 cm on the right side in adults. Median renal volumes were 146 cm^3^ on the left and 134 cm^3^ on the right.

Gross anatomy The functional substance, or parenchyma, of the human kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns. The tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces empty into major calyces, and major calyces empty into the renal pelvis. This becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes surround these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the renal sinus. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.

### What is brain nitric oxide synthase doing in the kidney? [^111kE9bZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Brain, or type I, nitric oxide synthase is expressed strongly in the macula densa of the kidney. Functional studies show that it blunts the tubuloglomerular feedback response that causes vasoconstriction of the renal afferent arteriole in response to sodium chloride reabsorption at this site, and regulates renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Studies published this year have made great progress in defining the mechanism of action of type I nitric oxide synthase on tubuloglomerular feedback. Macula densa-derived nitric oxide can act via both the autocrine and probably the paracrine routes. Nitric oxide bioactivity in the juxtaglomerular apparatus is strongly curtailed by oxidative stress in hypertensive models. The signalling pathways within macula densa cells have been examined in detail. Nitric oxide synthase type I in the macula densa probably adapts renal hemodynamics and possibly renin secretion to changes in blood pressure and salt intake.

### Approach to the patient: reninoma [^115ZgswT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A reninoma is a functional tumor of afferent arteriolar juxtaglomerular cells that secretes the enzyme renin, leading to hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Reninoma is a potentially curable cause of pathological secondary hyperaldosteronism that results in often severe hypertension and hypokalemia. The lack of suppression of plasma renin contrasts sharply with the much more common primary aldosteronism, but diagnosis is often prompted by screening for that condition. The major differential diagnosis of reninoma is renovascular hypertension. Fewer than 200 cases of reninoma have been described. Reninomas have been reported across a broad demographic but have a 2:1 predilection for women, often of childbearing age. Aldosterone receptor blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers offer effective medical management but are contraindicated in pregnancy, so surgical curative resection is ideal. The current optimal imaging and biochemical workup of reninoma and management approach (ideally, tumor excision with subtotal renal resection) are described.

### The tissue renin-angiotensin systems in cardiovascular disease [^116M2BRS]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system, in its classic definition, is known as an endocrine system that exerts its actions through the effector peptide, angiotensin II, in various organs to act as a vasoconstrictor and a regulator of salt and volume homeostasis. The availability of more sensitive methods to study the biochemistry and pharmacology as well as the molecular biology of the RAS has expanded our knowledge of the system and provided new perspectives of autocrine and paracrine functions of the RAS in cardiovascular regulation. One of the more exciting of these recently described actions is the possible involvement of the RAS in the adaptive processes related to cardiovascular hypertrophy and angiogenesis.

It adds that "the costs of measuring renin… may be a limiting factor for some clinicians", that "no research evidence was identified for acceptability by the health care workers or feasibility", yet "measurement of renin to guide medical therapy is likely feasible at most centers that routinely treat individuals with PA". It also specifies, "no studies were found that assessed the cost-effectiveness of targeting renin in PA-directed medical therapy".

### Genetic manipulation of the renin-angiotensin system: targeted expression of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney [^112aTZjp]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system is a classic endocrine system that also exists within individual tissues. All components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are expressed in the kidney suggesting the potential for local production and action of angiotensin II. Although the importance of the kidney in hypertension is unequivocal, our understanding of the functional significance of intrarenal production of angiotensin II remains incomplete. Using genetic manipulation of the mouse genome we generated a novel transgenic model expressing human angiotensinogen specifically in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney. Herein I describe the generation and physiologic characterization of this model, and discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the genetics of human hypertension. The experimental results presented support the hypothesis that a tissue-specific RAS cascade exists in the kidney of this transgenic model, and that this system may play an important role in blood pressure (BP) and renal homeostasis in this model.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its therapeutic targets [^111Wsui5]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway that have led to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system. Moreover, dual inhibitors which block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or targeting upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.

In summary, we thank Bellomo and colleagues for their informative analysis of how hormone levels along the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system may help identify which patients benefit from angiotensin II infusion. We challenge future randomized trials in critical care to innovate robust approaches to generating the evidence-based estimates of treatment effect for individual patients that clinicians and patients need to make informed, personalized treatment decisions.

### (pro) renin receptors: are they biologically relevant? [^116dbdRk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recent introduction of a renin inhibitor, aliskiren, into the clinical arena has revived interest in renin and its precursor prorenin. In addition, a renin-binding and prorenin-binding receptor has been found, which not only activates prorenin but also induces angiotensin-independent signaling. This review addresses the question of whether this receptor has any biological relevance.

Recent Findings

Prorenin is the preferred agonist of the (pro)renin receptor. When bound to the receptor, prorenin undergoes a conformational change allowing it to display full enzymatic activity. Receptor activation by renin/prorenin triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway, and human (pro)renin receptor transgenic rats develop glomerulosclerosis and hypertension in the absence of changes in renin or angiotensin. Aliskiren prevents angiotensin I generation by receptor-bound prorenin but does not block signaling. Conflicting results have been obtained with the putative (pro)renin receptor antagonist 'handle region peptide', suggesting that its efficacy depends on experimental conditions.

Summary

Although it is tempting to speculate that the (pro)renin receptor is the missing link providing a role for prorenin in tissue angiotensin generation, the discrepant results with handle region peptide and the lack of clinical studies with (pro)renin receptor blockers do not yet firmly support such a role.

### Renin… [^116xfD6c]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Renin, also known as an angiotensinogenase, is an aspartic protease protein and enzyme secreted by the kidneys that participates in the body's renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system — also known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis — that increases the volume of extracellular fluid and causes arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it increases the body's mean arterial blood pressure. Renin is not commonly referred to as a hormone, although it has a receptor, the renin receptor, also known as the renin receptor and prorenin receptor, as well as enzymatic activity with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Biochemistry and physiology Structure The primary structure of renin precursor consists of 406 amino acids with a pre- and a pro-segment carrying 20 and 46 amino acids, respectively. Mature renin contains 340 amino acids and has a mass of 37 kDa.

Secretion The enzyme renin is secreted by pericytes in the vicinity of the afferent arterioles and similar microvessels of the kidney from specialized cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus — the juxtaglomerular cells, in response to three stimuli:

1. A decrease in arterial blood pressure as detected by baroreceptors. This is the most direct causal link between blood pressure and renin secretion.
2. A decrease in sodium load delivered to the distal tubule. This load is measured by the macula densa of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.
3. Sympathetic nervous system activity, which also controls blood pressure, acting through the β~1~ adrenergic receptors. Human renin is secreted by at least two cellular pathways: a constitutive pathway for the secretion of the precursor prorenin and a regulated pathway for the secretion of mature renin.

Renin–angiotensin system The renin enzyme circulates in the bloodstream and hydrolyzes angiotensinogen secreted from the liver into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved in the lungs by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme into angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the smooth muscle and, therefore, raises the resistance posed by these arteries to the heart, and so for the same cardiac output, the blood pressure will rise. Angiotensin II also acts on the adrenal glands and releases aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells in the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of sodium, exchanging with potassium to maintain electrochemical neutrality, and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure.

The RAS also acts on the CNS to increase water intake by stimulating thirst, as well as conserving blood volume, by reducing urinary loss through the secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland. The normal concentration of renin in adult human plasma is 1. 98–24. 6 ng/L in the upright position. Function Renin activates the renin–angiotensin system by using its endopeptidase activity to cleave the peptide bonds between leucine and valine residues in angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to yield angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin–converting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. Angiotensin II then constricts blood vessels, increases the secretion of ADH and aldosterone, and stimulates the hypothalamus to activate the thirst reflex, each leading to an increase in blood pressure.

### Novel RAAS agonists and antagonists: clinical applications and controversies [^116tXmK1]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury and repair responses. The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by ∼20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This Review summarizes the present and future pharmacological manipulation of this important system.

### Conventional vasopressor and vasopressor-sparing strategies to counteract the blood pressure-lowering effect of small interfering RNA targeting angiotensinogen [^112Mhx9R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

This leaves the question why fludrocortisone upregulated plasma angiotensinogen concentrations in siRNA‐administered rats. Its lack of effect on the plasma angiotensinogen concentration in mice deficient for liver angiotensinogen despite the upregulation of eWAT angiotensinogen synthesis strongly argues against release from extrahepatic (adipose tissue) sites, and suggests a hepatic source. However, Agt mRNA abundance increased only marginally (although significantly) in the liver. A further possibility is that the massive reduction in renin after fludrocortisone (potentially related to its mineralocorticoid receptor‐stimulatory effect) allowed a significant reduction in angiotensinogen metabolism. Such renin suppression after fludrocortisone has been described before in both ratsand humans. Particularly at low angiotensinogen levels (when angiotensinogen is no longer in the Michaelis‐Menten constant range), rises in renin are capable of decreasing angiotensinogen even further, and the opposite may occur when renin disappears, particularly if hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis modestly increases.

### Human kidney organoids produce functional renin [^116Thqa8]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Renin production by the kidney is of vital importance for salt, volume, and blood pressure homeostasis. The lack of human models hampers investigation into the regulation of renin and its relevance for kidney physiology. To develop such a model, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids to study the role of renin and the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney. Extensive characterization of the kidney organoids revealed kidney-specific cell populations consisting of podocytes, proximal and distal tubular cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells. We examined the presence of various components of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin II receptors, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin-converting enzymes 1 and 2. We identified by single-cell sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays that cyclic AMP stimulation induces a subset of pericytes to increase the synthesis and secretion of enzymatically active renin. Renin production by the organoids was responsive to regulation by parathyroid hormone. Subcutaneously implanted kidney organoids in immunodeficient IL2Ry - /-Rag2 -/- mice were successfully vascularized, maintained tubular and glomerular structures, and retained capacity to produce renin two months after implantation. Thus, our results demonstrate that kidney organoids express renin and provide insights into the endocrine potential of human kidney organoids, which is important for regenerative medicine in the context of the endocrine system.

### The collecting duct is the major source of prorenin in diabetes [^114JKfMd]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

In addition to the juxtaglomerular apparatus, renin is also synthesized in renal tubular epithelium, including the collecting duct (CD). Angiotensin (Ang) II differentially regulates the synthesis of juxtaglomerular (inhibition) and CD (stimulation) renin. Because diabetes mellitus, a disease with high intrarenal renin-Ang system and Ang II activity, is characterized by high prorenin levels, we hypothesized that the CD is the major source of prorenin in diabetes. Renin granular content was visualized using in vivo multiphoton microscopy of the kidney in diabetic Munich-Wistar rats. Diabetes caused a 3.5-fold increase in CD renin, in contrast to less pronounced juxtaglomerular changes. Ang II type 1 receptor blockade with Olmesartan reduced CD renin to control levels but significantly increased juxtaglomerular renin. Using a fluorogenic renin assay, the prorenin component of CD renin content was measured by assessing the difference in enzymatic activity of medullary homogenates before and after trypsin activation of prorenin. Trypsinization caused no change in control renin activity but a 5-fold increase in diabetes. Studies on a CD cell line (M1) showed a 22-fold increase in renin activity after trypsinization and a further 35-fold increase with Ang II treatment. Therefore, prorenin significantly contributes to baseline CD renin. Diabetes, possibly via Ang II, greatly stimulates CD prorenin and causes hyperplasia of renin-producing connecting segments. These novel findings suggest that, in a rat model of diabetes, prorenin content and release from the CD may be more important than the juxtaglomerular apparatus in contrast to the existing paradigm.

### Renin is essential for angiotensin II formation in the brain [^1135Annz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The existence of a local brain renin–angiotensin system is a disputed topic because renin–angiotensin system peptides are often undetectable or present at low levels in brain tissue. Angiotensinogen is abundantly secreted by brain astrocytes, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) is produced by cells of the choroid plexus, endothelium, and some astrocytes. Renin is poorly expressed in the brain, and most of the protein product is projected to remain intracellularly, since an alternative promoter that causes a partial loss of renin's signal peptide drives most of brain renin transcription, rendering an interaction with secreted angiotensinogen in the brain parenchyma unlikely. Recently, we have generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing the rat angiotensinogen gene specifically in brain astrocytes. Transgenic mice presented detectable levels of angiotensin II in the brain contrary to wild‐type littermates. Because the pathway of angiotensin II formation in the brain remains a controversial topic, we employed this model to investigate if angiotensin II is locally produced in angiotensinogen transgenic mouse brains (deletion of endogenous angiotensinogen) and if the production of it relies on renin (deletion of renin).

### The biology of the (pro) renin receptor [^115AXw9C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) binds renin and prorenin, its proenzyme inactive form. Receptor-bound prorenin becomes enzymatically active and binding then activates the MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38 pathways, leading to upregulation of profibrotic and cyclooxygenase-2 genes independent of angiotensin II generation. These characteristics explain the interest in the potential role of PRR in organ damage in diseases associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), in particular hypertension and diabetes. Although identification of PRR has improved our understanding of the physiology of the tissue RAS, its role in pathology is far from clear. Transgenic animals overexpressing PRR ubiquitously or selectively in smooth-muscle cells develop high BP or glomerulosclerosis, and increased expression of PRR is reported in models of hypertension or kidney damage. However, definitive proof is still lacking for a role for PRR in disease, or by showing improvement of disease by tissue-specific ablation of PRR or by administration of a specific PRR antagonist. Furthermore, the early embryonic lethality seen in PRR-null mice suggests PRR has additional essential cellular functions we do not understand.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and progression of renal disease [^112JrWAY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the most powerful maneuvers to slow progression of renal disease. Angiotensin II (AngII) has emerged in the past decade as a multifunctional cytokine that exhibits many nonhemodynamic properties, such as acting as a growth factor and profibrogenic cytokine, and even having proinflammatory properties. Many of these deleterious functions are mediated by other factors, such as TGF-beta and chemoattractants that are induced in the kidney by AngII. Moreover, understanding of the RAAS has become much more complex in recent years with the identification of novel peptides (e.g. AngIV) that could bind to specific receptors, elucidating deleterious effects, and non-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-mediated generation of AngII. The ability of renal cells to produce AngII in a concentration that is much higher than what is found in the systemic circulation and the observation that aldosterone may be engaged directly in profibrogenic processes independent of hypertension have added to the complexity of the RAAS. Even renin has now been identified to have a "life on its own" and mediates profibrotic effects via binding to specific receptors. Finally, drugs that are used to block the RAAS, such as ACE inhibitors or certain AngII type 1 receptor antagonists, may have properties on cells independent of AngII (ACE inhibitor-mediated outside-inside signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma stimulatory effects of certain sartanes). Although blockade of the RAAS with ACE inhibitors, AngII type 1 receptor antagonists, or the combination of both should be part of every strategy to slow progression of renal disease, a better understanding of the novel aspects of the RAAS should contribute to the development of innovative strategies not only to completely halt progression but also to induce regression of human renal disease.

### Receptor-mediated actions of renin and prorenin [^115cmLCm]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Renin can induce renal disease by generating angiotensin II and, thereby, increasing fibrosis. Huang et al describe a new mechanism of action whereby the renin-angiotensin system can also exert this effect. Direct activation of the renin/prorenin receptor in mesangial cells induced synthesis of TGF-beta and profibrotic proteins. Hence, like other proteases such as thrombin, renin and prorenin are capable of receptor-mediated cellular signaling.

### Key developments in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition [^116mxr4v]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was initially thought to be fairly simple. However, this idea has been challenged following the development of RAAS blockers, including renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, type 1 angiotensin II (AT(1))-receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Consequently, new RAAS components and pathways that might contribute to the effectiveness of these drugs and/or their adverse effects have been identified. For example, an increase in renin levels during RAAS blockade might result in harmful effects via stimulation of the prorenin receptor (PRR), and prorenin-the inactive precursor of renin-might gain enzymatic activity on PRR binding. The increase in angiotensin II levels that occurs during AT(1)-receptor blockade might result in beneficial effects via stimulation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors. Moreover, angiotensin 1–7 levels increase during ACE inhibition and AT(1)-receptor blockade, resulting in Mas receptor activation and the induction of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, including stimulation of tissue repair by stem cells. Finally, a role of angiotensin II in sodium and potassium handling in the distal nephron has been identified. This finding is likely to have important implications for understanding the effects of RAAS inhibition on whole body sodium and potassium balance.

### Commentary for "human kidney pericytes produce renin" [^111BmrGF]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Renin-secreting cells of the kidney display several particularities, including their intrarenal localization in the fetal and in the adult kidney, their ultrastructure, and the mode by which they secrete renin into circulation to trigger the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The cell type from which renin cells differentiate has long been subject to speculation. The paper by Stefanska et al. now strongly suggests that renin cells are or derive from pericytes.

### Renin cells, from vascular development to blood pressure sensing [^112UVd9A]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

During embryonic and neonatal life, renin cells contribute to the assembly and branching of the intrarenal arterial tree. During kidney arteriolar development renin cells are widely distributed throughout the renal vasculature. As the arterioles mature, renin cells differentiate into smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and mesangial cells. In adult life, renin cells are confined to the tips of the renal arterioles, thus their name juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cells are sensors that release renin to control blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. Three major mechanisms control renin release: (1) β-adrenergic stimulation, (2) macula densa signaling, and (3) the renin baroreceptor, whereby a decrease in arterial pressure leads to increased renin release whereas an increase in pressure results in decrease renin release. Cells from the renin lineage exhibit plasticity in response to hypotension or hypovolemia, whereas relentless, chronic stimulation induces concentric arterial and arteriolar hypertrophy, leading to focal renal ischemia. The renin cell baroreceptor is a nuclear mechanotransducer within the renin cell that transmits external forces to the chromatin to regulate Ren1 gene expression. In addition to mechanotransduction, the pressure sensor of the renin cell may enlist additional molecules and structures including soluble signals and membrane proteins such as gap junctions and ion channels. How these various components integrate their actions to deliver the exact amounts of renin to meet the organism needs is unknown. This review describes the nature and origins of renin cells, their role in kidney vascular development and arteriolar diseases, and the current understanding of the blood pressure sensing mechanism.

### Newly recognized components of the renin-angiotensin system: potential roles in cardiovascular and renal regulation [^112N7Tn2]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a coordinated hormonal cascade in the control of cardiovascular, renal, and adrenal function that governs body fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as arterial pressure. The classical RAS consists of a circulating endocrine system in which the principal effector hormone is angiotensin (ANG) II. ANG is produced by the action of renin on angiotensinogen to form ANG I and its subsequent conversion to the biologically active octapeptide by ANG-converting enzyme. ANG II actions are mediated via the ANG type 1 receptor. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the components and actions of the RAS, including local tissue RASs, a renin receptor, ANG-converting enzyme-2, ANG (1–7), the function of the ANG type 2 receptor, and ANG receptor heterodimerization. The role of the RAS in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function is reviewed and discussed in light of these newly recognized components.

### Renin is essential for angiotensin II formation in the brain [^1176FnNb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the brain, mRNA levels of renin and ACE were not altered upon angiotensinogen transgene expression (Figure [D] and [D.3]). Brain renin concentration was not altered in the investigated lines (Figure [D.2]). Plasma renin concentration (Figure [E.3]) and renal renin expression (Figure [F]) were increased in angiotensinogen transgenic/angiotensinogen knockout mice, reflecting the lack of circulating angiotensinogen (Figure [E.1]) and angiotensin II. Importantly, the renal renin amplification exponential phase detected by reverse transcription quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction happened ≈10 C t after renal renin. Finally, neither brain nor plasma ACE were altered (Figure [D.4] and [E.2]).

Our experiments, using mice with brain‐specific rat angiotensinogen overexpression, indicate that the formation of angiotensin peptides in the brain from overexpressed rat angiotensinogen depends on renin. Although locally synthesized renin in defined brain areas cannot be excluded as the source of central renin, it most likely stems from the kidney. However, this was not addressed in the current study. Finally, brain angiotensin generation by renin relying on endogenous mouse angiotensinogen could not be demonstrated, in full agreement with previous studies.

### Role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in vascular remodeling and inflammation: a clinical review [^117AKyn7]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The concept of hypertension as primarily a consequence of altered hemodynamics has changed. Many factors are now implicated in the development of hypertensive vascular disease, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to be one of the most significant. Angiotensin II, the principal effector peptide of the RAAS, has far-reaching effects on vascular structure, growth and fibrosis, and is a key regulator of vascular remodeling and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species and a network of signaling pathways mediate angiotensin II and cellular mechanisms that promote remodeling and inflammation. The involvement of aldosterone in vessel-wall and myocardial remodeling has also come under intensive research scrutiny. Treatments that block the pathologic effects of the RAAS at several points have been shown to limit target-organ damage in hypertension and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that participate in the early development of hypertensive vascular disease may lead to more targeted treatment and improved outcomes.

### Adult renal mesenchymal stem cell-like cells contribute to juxtaglomerular cell recruitment [^114Z66U1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates BP and salt-volume homeostasis. Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells synthesize and release renin, which is the first and rate-limiting step in the RAAS. Intense pathologic stresses cause a dramatic increase in the number of renin-producing cells in the kidney, termed JG cell recruitment, but how this occurs is not fully understood. Here, we isolated renal CD44(+) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells and found that they differentiated into JG-like renin-expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. Sodium depletion and captopril led to activation and differentiation of these cells into renin-expressing cells in the adult kidney. In summary, CD44(+) MSC-like cells exist in the adult kidney and can differentiate into JG-like renin-producing cells under conditions that promote JG cell recruitment.

### Renin lineage cells repopulate the glomerular mesangium after injury [^116qFKYC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mesangial cell injury has a major role in many CKDs. Because renin-positive precursor cells give rise to mesangial cells during nephrogenesis, this study tested the hypothesis that the same phenomenon contributes to glomerular regeneration after murine experimental mesangial injury. Mesangiolysis was induced by administration of an anti-mesangial cell serum in combination with LPS. In enhanced green fluorescent protein-reporter mice with constitutively labeled renin lineage cells, the size of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive area in the glomerular tufts increased after mesangial injury. Furthermore, we generated a novel Tet-on inducible triple-transgenic LacZ reporter line that allowed selective labeling of renin cells along renal afferent arterioles of adult mice. Although no intraglomerular LacZ expression was detected in healthy mice, about two-thirds of the glomerular tufts became LacZ positive during the regenerative phase after severe mesangial injury. Intraglomerular renin descendant LacZ-expressing cells colocalized with mesangial cell markers α8-integrin and PDGF receptor-β but not with endothelial, podocyte, or parietal epithelial cell markers. In contrast with LacZ-positive cells in the afferent arterioles, LacZ-positive cells in the glomerular tuft did not express renin. These data demonstrate that extraglomerular renin lineage cells represent a major source of repopulating cells for reconstitution of the intraglomerular mesangium after injury.

### Stronger association of intact angiotensinogen with mortality than lactate or renin in critical illness: post-hoc analysis from the VICTAS trial [^116FFFHo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock remain global healthcare problems associated with high mortality rates despite best therapy efforts. Circulating biomarkers may identify those patients at risk for poor outcomes, however, current biomarkers, most prominently lactate, are non-specific and have an inconsistent impact on prognosis and/or disease management. Activation of the renin-angiotensin- system (RAS) is an early event in sepsis patients and elevated levels of circulating renin are more predictive of worse outcomes than lactate. The precursor protein Angiotensinogen is another key component of the circulating RAS; it is the only known substrate for renin and the ultimate source of the vasopressor Angiotensin II (Ang II). We postulate that lower Angiotensinogen concentrations may reflect a dysfunctional RAS characterized by high renin concentrations but attenuated Ang II generation, which is disproportionate to the high renin response and may compromise adequate support of blood pressure and tissue perfusion in septic patients. The current study compared the association between serum Angiotensinogen with mortality to that of lactate and renin in the VICTAS cohort of sepsis patients at baseline (day 0) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier curve analyses. Serum concentration of Angiotensinogen was more strongly associated with 30-day mortality than either the serum concentrations of renin or lactate in sepsis patients. Moreover, the clinical assessment of Angiotensinogen may have distinct advantages over the typical measures of renin. The assessment of intact Angiotensinogen may potentially facilitate more precise therapeutic approaches (including exogenous angiotensin II) to restore a dysfunctional RAS and improve patient outcomes. Additional prospective validation studies are clearly required for this biomarker in the future.

### Lineage-tracing methods and the kidney [^111NtDse]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

A growing body of work has documented epithelial hierarchies in acute kidney disease and chronic kidney fibrosis models using lineage analysis. The approach demonstrated that bone marrow cells do not meaningfully contribute to the epithelium after acute injury, for example, although low levels of cell fusion can be detected. We have used fate mapping to establish that the cells responsible for repair of damaged nephron epithelial originate from within the tubule and not from any extratubular compartment. In kidney fibrosis, our fate-mapping approach showed that interstitial myofibroblasts did not originate from epithelial cells through epithelial to mesenchymal transition, but rather they originate from endogenous kidney pericytes and interstitial fibroblasts. These results have been substantiated using separate genetic fate-mapping approaches by other groups.

Lineage tracing has also provided insight concerning the identification and plasticity of erythropoietin-producing cells in kidney interstitium and the origins of renal vasculature. Gomez used a renin-Cre line to show that renin-expressing cells give rise to multiple lineages during development, and those cells retain the capacity to synthesize renin during stress. More recently, Asada et al. provided lineage-tracing evidence that erythropoietin-producing cells originate from the neural crest, and upon injury differentiate into myofibroblasts while they lose the capacity for erythropoietin production. Notably, erythropoietin production could be rescued by the administration of dexamethasone or neuroprotective agents, suggesting a novel strategy to treat the anemia of chronic kidney disease. With sparse genetic recombination, visualization of cellular substructures is made possible. We recently showed that tertiary podocyte foot processes can be easily detected by light microscopy using such a strategy.

### Newly developed renin and prorenin assays and the clinical evaluation of renin inhibitors [^113FiJ18]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The last decade has seen the introduction of renin inhibitors and new plasma renin and prorenin assays, which has led to a better understanding of the tissue renin-angiotensin system.

Aim Of The Study

To clarify the consequences of these developments for the methodology and interpretation of measurements of renin and prorenin.

Methods

The principles and application of the newly developed immunosorbent assays (ISAs) are surveyed and the results are compared with those of enzyme-kinetic assays (EKAs).

Results and Conclusions

Angiotensin (Ang) II in cardiac, renal and adrenal tissue is known to originate mainly from locally produced Ang I. Experimental evidence and theoretical considerations show that a simple relation between Ang II receptor occupancy, in tissue micromilieu, and the circulating levels of Ang II or renin may not exist. This supports the clinicians' view that the plasma level of renin tells more about the mechanisms regulating its release into the circulation than about the Ang II-dependency of hypertension. ISAs are a welcome addition to clinical studies of renin inhibitors. By comparing the results of ISAs with those of EKAs, the inhibitor-bound forms of renin and prorenin can be distinguished from the unbound forms. ISAs also provide important information on the molecular basis of prorenin activation. We propose a single kinetic model to incorporate the conformational changes of prorenin induced by cryo-activation and acid-activation, and by binding to renin inhibitors. It explains why renin ISAs can overestimate the rise of renin in response to these drugs, and shows how to deal with this artefact.

### The importance of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system [^112Tki3v]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Evidence suggests that virtually every organ system in the human body possesses a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS). These local systems seem to be independently regulated and compartmentalized from the plasma circulation, perhaps with the exception of the vascular endothelial system, which is responsible for maintaining physiological plasma levels of RAS components. Among these local RASs, the kidney RAS — the focus of this Review — seems to be of critical importance for the regulation of blood pressure and salt balance. Indeed, overactivation of the intrarenal RAS in certain disease states constitutes a pathogenic mechanism that leads to tissue injury, proliferation, fibrosis and ultimately, end-organ damage. Intrarenal levels of angiotensin peptides are considerably higher than those in plasma or any other organ tissue. Moreover, the kidney has a unique capacity to degrade angiotensin peptides, perhaps to maintain its intrinsic homeostasis. Interestingly, each local RAS has a distinct enzymatic profile resulting in different patterns of angiotensin fragment generation in different tissues. A better understanding of the autocrine and paracrine mechanisms involved in the renal RAS and other local RASs might direct future organ-specific therapy.

### Localisation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in breast [^115G3o2x]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Together with previous data on the distribution of mRNA, which in normal tissue was detected mostly in fibroblasts and myoepithelium, the data suggest that (pro)renin, is formed in the fibroblasts (and myoepithelium) and is transported from the connective tissue site of synthesis, perhaps to myoepithelium (although the myoepithelium is also a source), and possibly even to the epithelium, though this is has only been faintly visible in some of the abnormal samples (Figure 4C). In cancer, although, (pro)renin mRNA and protein are both found in fibroblasts. This suggests that the intimate association between fibroblasts, myoepithelium and epithelium are essential for any such transfer to occur. Together with the progressive loss overall of both (pro)renin mRNA and protein, such physical disruption suggests that the system for local Ang II generation is greatly impaired in cancer.

The localisation of ACE is especially important to the concept of a local RAS supplying purely local requirements for Ang II. The immunohistochemical results presented here shows that ACE is largely distributed in the epithelial cells in human benign and malignant breast tissues (Figure 6A, C, E and F). This distribution matches that of the AT1 receptor, but is different from that of (pro)renin. It suggests that Ang II in breast tissue is not necessarily derived from the circulation and may originate from a local source. Most importantly, it suggests that Ang II is produced directly in the epithelium, the site at which it acts. Clearly it may be formed from Ang I provided by renin activity in the myoepithelium. This reveals a tightly organised RAS that is geared to the production of hormone in the breast duct epithelium alone.

It is the apparently close coupling of (pro)renin and ACE expression with the epithelial site of Ang II action that is so compelling about the data presented here. As Ang II has numerous functions in epithelial and other tissues, including the regulation of mitosis and tissue differentiation, the observation that (pro)renin transcription apparently fails in invasive carcinoma, crucially suggests that here Ang II is not available to maintain these functions. This has profound implications for our understanding of cancer. We conclude that the local tRAS may be important for the regulation of epithelial function in the breast. Such regulation is lost as the renin producing fibroblasts and myoepithelium are physically separated from the bulk of the proliferating cells. The characteristic invasiveness of malignant cells may reflect this loss of RAS control.

### Localisation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in breast [^116XD2RE]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II has mitogenic and angiogenic effects and its receptors are widespread, particularly in epithelial tissue. Tissue renin angiotensin systems (tRASs) may be a local source of angiotensin II that has specific paracrine functions. To investigate the presence of a tRAS in normal human breast and tumours. Immunocytochemistry, and quantitative RT–PCR was used to establish: (i) the presence and localisation of RAS components, (ii) the possibility of their involvement in cancer. (1) mRNA coding for angiotensinogen, prorenin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and both AT1 and AT2 receptors was demonstrated in normal and diseased breast tissues. (2) (pro)renin was identified in epithelial cells in both normal and diseased tissue, but in invasive carcinoma, its distribution was mostly confined to fibroblasts or could not be detected at all. (3) Angiotensin converting enzyme was shown in epithelial cells in both normal and malignant tissue. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a tRAS is present in the breast, and is disrupted in invasive cancer.

### Urinary renin in patients and mice with diabetic kidney disease [^114HYnxn]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), plasma renin activity is usually decreased, but there is limited information on urinary renin and its origin. Urinary renin was evaluated in samples from patients with longstanding type I diabetes mellitus and mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. Renin-reporter mouse model (Ren1d-Cre; mT/mG) was made diabetic with streptozotocin to examine whether the distribution of cells of the renin lineage was altered in a chronic diabetic environment. Active renin was increased in urine samples from patients with DKD (n = 36), compared with those without DKD (n = 38; 3.2 versus 1.3 pg/mg creatinine; P < 0.001). In mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, urine renin was also increased compared with nondiabetic controls. By immunohistochemistry, in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, juxtaglomerular apparatus and proximal tubular renin staining were reduced, whereas collecting tubule staining, by contrast, was increased. To examine the role of filtration and tubular reabsorption on urinary renin, mice were either infused with either mouse or human recombinant renin and lysine (a blocker of proximal tubular protein reabsorption). Infusion of either form of renin together with lysine markedly increased urinary renin such that it was no longer different between nondiabetic and diabetic mice. Megalin mRNA was reduced in the kidney cortex of streptozotocin-treated mice (0.70 ± 0.09 versus 1.01 ± 0.04 in controls, P = 0.01) consistent with impaired tubular reabsorption. In Ren1d-Cre; mT/mG with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, the distribution of renin lineage cells within the kidney was similar to nondiabetic renin-reporter mice. No evidence for migration of cells of renin linage to the collecting duct in diabetic mice could be found. Renin mRNA in microdissected collecting ducts from streptozotocin-treated mice, moreover, was not significantly different than in controls, whereas in kidney cortex, largely reflecting juxtaglomerular apparatus renin, it was significantly reduced. In conclusion, in urine from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and DKD and from mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, renin is elevated. This cannot be attributed to production from cells of the renin lineage migrating to the collecting duct in a chronic hyperglycemic environment. Rather, the elevated levels of urinary renin found in DKD are best attributed to altered glomerular filteration and impaired proximal tubular reabsorption.

### Hypertension: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations [^112hxfKj]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), that is, renin inhibitors, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, are a cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension. How exactly they exert their effect, in particular in patients with low circulating RAAS activity, also taking into consideration the so-called Ang II/aldosterone escape that often occurs after initial blockade, is still incompletely understood. Multiple studies have tried to find parameters that predict the response to RAAS blockade, allowing a personalized treatment approach. Consequently, the question should now be answered on what basis (eg, sex, ethnicity, age, salt intake, baseline renin, ACE or aldosterone, and genetic variance) a RAAS blocker can be chosen to treat an individual patient. Are all blockers equal? Does optimal blockade imply maximum RAAS blockade, for example, by combining ≥ 2 RAAS blockers or by simply increasing the dose of 1 blocker? Exciting recent investigations reveal a range of unanticipated extrarenal effects of aldosterone, as well as a detailed insight in the genetic causes of primary aldosteronism, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have now become an important treatment option for resistant hypertension. Finally, apart from the deleterious ACE-Ang II-Ang II type 1 receptor arm, animal studies support the existence of protective aminopeptidase A-Ang III-Ang II type 2 receptor and ACE2-Ang-(1 to 7)-Mas receptor arms, paving the way for multiple new treatment options. This review provides an update about all these aspects, critically discussing the many controversies and allowing the reader to obtain a full understanding of what we currently know about RAAS alterations in hypertension.

### Renin cells, the kidney, and hypertension [^1142VMKp]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Renin cells are essential for survival perfected throughout evolution to ensure normal development and defend the organism against a variety of homeostatic threats. During embryonic and early postnatal life, they are progenitors that participate in the morphogenesis of the renal arterial tree. In adult life, they are capable of regenerating injured glomeruli, control blood pressure, fluid-electrolyte balance, tissue perfusion, and in turn, the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cells. Throughout life, renin cell descendants retain the plasticity or memory to regain the renin phenotype when homeostasis is threatened. To perform all of these functions and maintain well-being, renin cells must regulate their identity and fate. Here, we review the major mechanisms that control the differentiation and fate of renin cells, the chromatin events that control the memory of the renin phenotype, and the major pathways that determine their plasticity. We also examine how chronic stimulation of renin cells alters their fate leading to the development of a severe and concentric hypertrophy of the intrarenal arteries and arterioles. Lastly, we provide examples of additional changes in renin cell fate that contribute to equally severe kidney disorders.

### Keratinocyte-specific angiotensin II receptor-associated protein deficiency exacerbates angiotensin II-dependent hypertension via activation of the skin renin-angiotensin system [^115Cytjf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

All RAS components necessary for Ang II synthesis, including angiotensinogen, renin, and ACE, are expressed in the skin. Indeed, a previous in vitro study indicated that keratinocytes have the ability to produce Ang II. Furthermore, the presence of AT1R in the epidermis and dermal vascular endothelial cells suggests that the skin serves as both a source and a target of Ang II. Thus, the skin might form the basis of local RAS activity independently of circulating RAS, similar to other tissues such as the brain, adipose tissue, and kidneys –. However, liver-derived angiotensinogen, the major source of circulating angiotensinogen, has been reported to strongly affect local angiotensinogen levels. In the current study, keratinocyte-specific ATRAP deficiency caused Ang II-induced angiotensinogen excess specifically in the skin, which was consistently observed at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting Ang II-induced skin tissue RAS activation in KO mice. This is further supported by the fact that, although similar liver Agt mRNA expression and plasma Ang II levels were observed for both genotypes, Ang II levels in the skin were significantly increased in Ang II-infused KO mice. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting analysis using epidermis samples suggested that keratinocytes are the main site of skin angiotensinogen excess in Ang II-infused KO mice. Furthermore, Ang II-induced angiotensinogen excess in skin lacking ATRAP was restored by additional keratinocyte-specific AT1R deficiency, suggesting that whole skin angiotensinogen excess in Ang II-infused KO mice was mainly mediated by the Ang II-AT1R axis in keratinocytes. These results support the concept of skin tissue RAS, which might involve a positive feedback loop for local RAS in the skin through the Ang II-AT1R axis. This is also suggested by previous studies demonstrating positive feedback between Ang II stimulation and local angiotensinogen production, especially in the kidneys –. The current study also revealed that KO mice exhibited enhanced Ang II-induced hypertension and skin vasoconstriction along with skin-specific angiotensinogen excess, all of which were abolished in DKO mice. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that keratinocyte-specific ATRAP deficiency accelerates Ang II-induced angiotensinogen production in the skin through activating the Ang II-AT1R axis in keratinocytes. This may contribute to increased Ang II levels in the skin, resulting in exacerbated Ang II-induced hypertension through enhanced skin vasoconstriction (Fig. 6).

### Definitive evidence for the identification and function of renin-expressing cholinergic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus [^116fCZiQ]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The importance of the brain renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular function is well accepted. However, not knowing the precise source of renin in the brain has been a limitation toward a complete understanding of how the brain renin-angiotensin system operates.

Methods

Highly sensitive in situ hybridization techniques and conditional knockout mice were used to address the location and function of renin in the brainstem.

Results

We identified novel renin-expressing cholinergic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (NuAm), a major vagal cardioinhibitory center in the brainstem. The expression of renin-angiotensin system genes was relatively abundant in the NuAm, implying that angiotensin II might mediate an important regulatory role in this nucleus and other regions with neural connectivity to the NuAm. Then, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking the classical renin isoform (Ren-a ChAT-KO), specifically in cholinergic neurons. Ablation of Ren-a in cholinergic neurons abrogated renin expression in the NuAm. Moreover, studies using radiotelemetry, heart rate variability analyses, and pharmacological approaches revealed that the parasympathetic nervous system is depressed in Ren-a ChAT-KO males while augmented in the Ren-a ChAT-KO females. Subsequently, transcriptomic approaches were used to infer putative genes and signaling pathways regulated by renin within the NuAm.

Conclusions

This study revealed that renin in cholinergic neurons plays a fundamental role in preserving autonomic balance and cardiovascular homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner. These findings define the NuAm as an endogenous, local source of renin with biological function and serve as conclusive evidence for the presence and functionality of the brain renin-angiotensin system.

### Renin: friend or foe? [^115Ehyge]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Renin maintains blood pressure through vasoconstriction when there is inadequate salt to maintain volume. In populations where blood pressure is more often high than low, and vascular death more common than haemorrhage or dehydration, therapeutic reductions in renin secretion or response are valuable. Whether long-term benefits are due entirely to blood pressure reduction remains unproved. The pathway can be blocked at its rate-limiting step (beta blockade or direct renin inhibition), the synthesis of the active product, angiotensin II, or at the receptor for angiotensin. Because renin and sodium are the two main factors in blood pressure control, and renin levels vary inversely with sodium load, blood pressure control requires a combination of natriuresis and blocking the consequential increase in renin activity. Being a large and stable molecule, renin is among the easiest and cheapest of hormone measurements. Understanding the simple biochemistry and physiology of renin permits optimal use of the drugs acting to raise or suppress this hormone.

### Nephron… [^115gDmts]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The nephron is the minute or microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney. It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule. The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and a cup-shaped structure called Bowman's capsule. The renal tubule extends from the capsule. The interior of Bowman's capsule, called Bowman's space, collects the filtrate from the filtering capillaries of the glomerular tuft, which also contains mesangial cells supporting these capillaries. These components function as the filtration unit and make up the renal corpuscle. The filtering structure has three layers composed of endothelial cells, a basement membrane, and podocyte foot processes. Normally the only components of the blood that are not filtered into Bowman's capsule are blood proteins, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.

Over 150 liters of fluid enter the glomeruli of an adult every day: 99% of the water in that filtrate is reabsorbed. Reabsorption occurs in the renal tubules and is either passive, due to diffusion, or active, due to pumping against a concentration gradient. Renal corpuscle The renal corpuscle is the site of the filtration of blood plasma. The renal corpuscle consists of the glomerulus, and the glomerular capsule or Bowman's capsule. The renal corpuscle has two poles: a vascular pole and a tubular pole. The arterioles from the renal circulation enter and leave the glomerulus at the vascular pole. The glomerular filtrate leaves the Bowman's capsule at the renal tubule at the urinary pole. Renal tubule The renal tubule is a continuous and long pipe-like structure containing the tubular fluid filtered through the glomerulus. The filtrate passing through the renal tubule ultimately ends at the collecting duct system. The components of the renal tubule are:
3.

Distal convoluted tubule: lies in the cortex
4. Collecting tubule The epithelial cells that form these nephron segments can be distinguished by the shapes of their actin cytoskeleton visualized by confocal microscopy of fluorescent phalloidin. Blood from the efferent arteriole, containing everything that was not filtered out in the glomerulus, moves into the peritubular capillaries, tiny blood vessels that surround the loop of Henle and the proximal and distal tubules, where the tubular fluid flows. Substances then reabsorb from the latter back to the blood stream. The peritubular capillaries then recombine to form an efferent venule, which combines with efferent venules from other nephrons into the renal vein, and rejoins the main bloodstream. Juxtamedullary nephrons start low in the cortex near the medulla and have a long loop of Henle which penetrates deeply into the renal medulla: only they have their loop of Henle surrounded by the vasa recta.

These long loops of Henle and their associated vasa recta create a hyperosmolar gradient that allows for the generation of concentrated urine. Also the hairpin bend penetrates up to the inner zone of medulla. Juxtamedullary nephrons are found only in birds and mammals, and have a specific location: medullary refers to the renal medulla, while juxta refers to the relative position of the renal corpuscle of this nephron
- near the medulla, but still in the cortex. In other words, a juxtamedullary nephron is a nephron whose renal corpuscle is near the medulla, and whose proximal convoluted tubule and its associated loop of Henle occur deeper in the medulla than the other type of nephron, the cortical nephron. The juxtamedullary nephrons comprise only about 15% of the nephrons in the human kidney. However, it is this type of nephron which is most often depicted in illustrations of nephrons.

### Kidney renin-angiotensin system: lost in a RAS cascade [^113YTLfh]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Renin was discovered more than a century ago. Since then, the functions of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney have been the focus of intensive research revealing its importance in regulation of renal physiology and in the pathogenesis of heart, vascular, and kidney diseases. Inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system components are now foundational therapies for a range of kidney and cardiovascular diseases from hypertension to heart failure to diabetic nephropathy. Despite years of voluminous research, emerging studies continue to reveal new complexities of the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system within the kidney and identification of nonclassical components of the system like the prorenin receptor (PRR) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), with powerful renal effects that ultimately impact the broader cardiovascular system. With the emergence of a range of novel therapies for cardiovascular and kidney diseases, the importance of a detailed understanding of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney will allow for the development of informed complementary approaches for combinations of treatments that will optimally promote health and longevity over the century ahead.

### Human kidney pericytes produce renin [^116vg3r8]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

A canonical feature of cultured pericytes from multiple tissue origins is tri-lineage mesodermal differentiation ability. We also observed this for the first time in renal pericytes, which implies that the kidney can also be a source of MSCs. It is tempting to suggest that renin secretion ability represents another facet of the broad developmental potential of ubiquitous pericytes. In this respect, it will be important to assess renin secretion by pericytes isolated from tissues that do not contain a RAS. Conversely, the potential to express renin may be specific to pericytes from the kidney and other organs hosting a RAS. Little is known regarding tissue-related restrictions in the regenerative and/or regulatory potential of pericytes. Importantly, the developmental origin of pericytes is varied; most are derived from mesoderm, but those in the cephalic region stem from the neural crest, which could indicate as yet undiscovered significant functional differences. Localized pericyte surface markers have been also described, which might indicate different tissue-specific functions. So far, the best-documented example of an anatomic restriction is the cardiac pericyte. Cardiac pericytes, unlike those from other tissues, cannot differentiate into skeletal muscle, but can, to some extent, give rise to cardiomyocytes. Overall, our results support the concept that pericytes serve as a reservoir of tissue-specific progenitors.

The present study is the first to describe the isolation and characterization of human renal pericytes. We demonstrate that isolated kidney pericytes, like those from other organs, have MSC properties in vitro. Kidney-derived pericytes also exhibit distinctive renin expression and secretion. However, nonrenal pericytes can also be induced to produce renin, which supports the unifying concept of the existence of perivascular tissue RASs. This novel hypothesis opens the field for further research into the physiological and pathophysiological regulation of renin-inducible pericytes and their potential therapeutic role.

### Renin and renin blockade have no role in complement activity [^1156ZBhN]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Renin, an aspartate protease, regulates the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving its only known substrate angiotensinogen to angiotensin. Recent studies have suggested that renin may also cleave complement component C3 to activate complement or contribute to its dysregulation. Typically, C3 is cleaved by C3 convertase, a serine protease that uses the hydroxyl group of a serine residue as a nucleophile. Here, we provide seven lines of evidence to show that renin does not cleave C3. First, there is no association between renin plasma levels and C3 levels in patients with C3 Glomerulopathies (C3G) and atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), implying that serum C3 consumption is not increased in the presence of high renin. Second, in vitro tests of C3 conversion to C3b do not detect differences when sera from patients with high renin levels are compared to sera from patients with normal/low renin levels. Third, aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, does not block abnormal complement activity introduced by nephritic factors in the fluid phase. Fourth, aliskiren does not block dysregulated complement activity on cell surfaces. Fifth, recombinant renin from different sources does not cleave C3 even after 24 hours of incubation at 37 °C. Sixth, direct spiking of recombinant renin into sera samples of patients with C3G and aHUS does not enhance complement activity in either the fluid phase or on cell surfaces. And seventh, molecular modeling and docking place C3 in the active site of renin in a position that is not consistent with a productive ground state complex for catalytic hydrolysis. Thus, our study does not support a role for renin in the activation of complement.

### Human kidney pericytes produce renin [^112AMGi8]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Studying JG cells, which natively produce renin, remains a difficult task for several reasons: (i) there is no JG specific marker except for renin; (ii) they are rare (0.01%–0.001% of the total kidney cell mass); and (iii) renin production is switched off after 48 to 72 hours in culture. In vitro studies support the mesenchymal origin of renin-producing cells. 3T3 pre-adipocytesand murine MSCs differentiate into renin-producing αSMA + cellswhen treated with cAMP inducers (forskolin and IBMX). CD44 + MSC-like cells respond to dietary sodium depletion and captopril administration by activation and differentiation into renin-producing cells; however, only a small percentage of recruited renin lineage cells coexpress CD44.

The so-called extra-renal tissue RAS has been described in multiple organs, including the adrenal glands, heart, brain, vascular wall, reproductive tract, skin, digestive organs, sensory organs, and lymphatic tissue. Our findings suggest a role of pericytes in promoting extra-renal RAS. Tissue RASs display differences compared with the circulating RAS in terms of functions and regulation. Most of tissue renin is released under an inactive form; however, it is believed that small amounts of angiotensin II can be generated in an autocrine fashion within tissues. All key components of the RAS are expressed in the human placenta. Immunohistochemical staining showed renin distribution in the placental vasculature and syncytiotrophoblast. However, most (92%–96%) of released renin is inactive. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the highest levels of renin and/or prorenin are detected during the first trimester and reduce to low levels at term. High levels of renin, prorenin receptor, and the AT1 receptor in early gestation have been correlated with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which suggests a role for RAS in placental angiogenesis and trophoblast proliferation and invasion.

### Approach to the patient: reninoma [^111QgZiw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Considerations Regarding Pregnancy

Pregnancy is an obligatory physiologic state of hyperaldosteronism. This appears to stem from many levels throughout the RAAS, partly independent of renin and salt intake.

A local placental RAAS is formed separately from maternal circulation from 6 weeks' gestation and is most active in early pregnancy. A key product of the RAAS, angiotensin II, acts as an important growth factor, promoting invasion of trophoblast cells, cell proliferation, and migration and angiogenesis. Angiotensin II is also an important trophic factor for vascular smooth muscle, the adrenal cortex, and cardiac myositis.

Hepatic production of angiotensinogen is increased throughout pregnancy by the liver in parallel with estrogen. The ovarian follicle secretes prorenin at ovulation and levels rise in pregnancy, peaking at 8 to 12 weeks' gestation to 10-fold nonpregnancy levels.

By contrast, renin rises later in pregnancy, from about 20 weeks' gestation. Placental production of relaxin and estrogen-mediated activation of the angiotensin type 2 receptor causes vasodilatation and increased cardiovascular capacitance, in turn activating baroreceptors via hypotension. Baroreceptors, catecholamines, and reduced renal perfusion stimulate cleavage of prorenin to renin and release from the JG cell.

### Short-lived active prorenin: precursor of so-called native prorenin [^1138xhPB]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The enzymatic activity of the aspartic protease, renin, is critical for its function in blood pressure regulation and sodium homeostasis. Incubation of so-called native prorenin at low pH leads to its activation. After binding to transition-state mimicking renin inhibitors at neutral pH, prorenin attains the active conformation, as indicated by immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies specific for epitopes of the prosegment or the renin body. A comparison of immunosorbent assay with enzyme-kinetic assay revealed the intermediary steps of prorenin auto-activation/inactivation. The kinetically identified intermediary steps of activation/inactivation correspond with the published crystal structures of free renin, free prorenin, and renin in complex with inhibitors. Both renin and activated prorenin exist in 2 forms, α and β. The α form is active, and the α/β quantity ratio is 2.5. The kidney produces renin and prorenin, while the ovarium, placenta, and eye produce inactive prorenin. The production of renin by these organs has never been demonstrated. We propose that the so-called native prorenin in extracellular fluid, including the circulation, is derived, at least partly, from short-lived active prorenin. Its potential paracrine function is discussed.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112SdU3E]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — evidence scope and key findings informing Recommendation 7: The panel prioritized outcomes including BP control, antihypertensive burden, systolic BP, and cardiovascular events, noting that "our systematic review (53) identified 11 studies that evaluated the impact of increasing renin with aldosterone-directed medical therapy", and observational data reporting that "a rise in renin to a level higher than 1.0 ng/mL/h was associated with lower risk for MACEs when compared with persistently suppressed renin". Overall, the guideline concludes that "in balance, targeting a rise in renin may be associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, and atrial fibrillation, but the pooled analysis did not demonstrate statistically significant reduction in the risk for MACEs".

### Structure and functions of angiotensinogen [^114q1vv3]. Hypertension Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is pivotal to the regulation of blood pressure and homeostasis of water and sodium through actions of angiotensin II (AngII). Recently many other bioactive angiotensin peptides have been identified (Figure 1). The RAS is now recognized as a major regulator for a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological functions. Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the only precursor of all angiotensin peptides. Human AGT has 485 amino acids, including a 33 amino-acid signal peptide. The 10 N-terminal amino acids are cleaved by renin to provide angiotensin I (AngI), which is the source for an array of active angiotensin peptides (Figure 1). The removal of AngI leaves a protein termed des(AngI)AGT. Despite des(AngI)AGT being 98% of the parent protein, its biological properties and fate are largely unknown. Indeed, even fundamental questions such as the relative concentrations of intact AGT vs. des(AngI)AGT in plasma and tissues have not been determined.

There is increasing acknowledgment that AGT is more than a mere passive substrate for the RAS. Recent studies have provided insights into new roles of AGT in both angiotensin peptide-dependent and -independent manners. We have discussed many biological properties of AGT in a recent review article. The present review will primarily focus on structural analysis and in vivo manipulations of AGT.

### Direct renin inhibition and the kidney [^11633MEf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Direct renin inhibition is a new means for blocking the renin-angiotensin system at the rate-limiting step of the cascade of events triggered by renin release — the interaction of renin with its physiological substrate angiotensinogen. The remarkable success of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in the management of cardiovascular and renal disease has led to great interest in the potential of direct renin inhibitors. This Review focuses on the evidence that suggests that direct renin inhibitors might block the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney more completely than either angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The therapeutic implications of this evidence are also reviewed, as well as the possible mechanistic routes by which direct renin inhibition might exert its influence on the kidney.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: current understanding and future direction [^115Ewkok]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is common and affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to management of these people is not unclear. This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectrums of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. It is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system

Physiology of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system

The pharmacological RAAS inhibition reduces BP and represents a key part of current approaches to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction. The classical simplified RAAS image has recently turned to a complex network (Figure 1). The cascade starts with the renal release of the renin, which cleaves the liver-produced angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I). Renin may also bind to its (pro)renin receptor (P)RR, that enhances its cleavage activity and activates its inactive precursor, prorenin. However, binding to (P)RR elicits angiotensin-independent effects, such as activation of promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF), protein-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and eventually mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) resulting in enhanced proteosynthesis, proliferation, and decreased apoptosis. –

### Angiotensin (1–12) in humans with normal blood pressure and primary hypertension [^114QhNbG]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The importance of canonical versus noncanonical mechanisms for the generation of angiotensins remains a major challenge that, in part, is heavily swayed by the relative efficacy of therapies designed to inhibit renin, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), or the Ang II (Angiotensin II) receptor. Ang (1–12) (angiotensin [1–12]) is an Ang II forming substrate serving as a source for Ang II-mediated tissue actions. This study identifies for the first time the presence of Ang (1–12) in the blood of 52 normal (22 women) and 19 (13 women) patients with hypertension not receiving antihypertensive medication at the time of the study. Normal subjects of comparable ages and body habitus had similar circulating plasma Ang (1–12) concentrations (women: 2.02 ± 0.62 [SD] ng/mL; men 2.05 ± 0.55 [SD] ng/mL, P > 0.05). The higher values of plasma Ang (1–12) concentrations in hypertensive men (2.51 ± 0.49 ng/mL, n = 6) and women (2.33 ± 0.63 [SD] ng/mL, n = 13) were statistically significant (P < 0.02) and correlated with elevated plasma renin activity, systolic and pulse pressure, and plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone BNP). The increased plasma Ang (1–12) in patients with hypertension was not mirrored by similar changes in plasma angiotensinogen and Ang II concentrations. The first identification of an age-independent presence of Ang (1–12) in the blood of normotensive subjects and patients with hypertension, irrespective of sex, implicates this non-renin dependent substrate as a source for Ang II production in the blood and its potential contribution to the hypertensive process.

### Aliskiren [^113psLTV]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non-ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g. ACE or non-ACE pathways, is not known.

All agents that inhibit the RAAS, including renin inhibitors, suppress the negative feedback loop, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma renin concentration. When this rise occurs during treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, the result is increased levels of PRA. During treatment with aliskiren, however, the effect of increased renin levels is blocked so that PRA, Ang I and Ang II are all reduced, whether aliskiren is used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, PRA was decreased in a range of 50% to 80%. This reduction in PRA was not dose-related and did not correlate with blood pressure reductions. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known.

### An update of the role of renin angiotensin in cardiovascular homeostasis [^116ZZHd6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is thought to be the body's main vasoconstrictor system, with physiological effects mediated via the interaction of angiotensin II with angiotensin I receptors (the "classic" RAS model). However, since the discovery of the heptapeptide angiotensin 1–7 and the development of the concept of the "alternate" RAS system, with its ability to reduce arterial blood pressure, our understanding of this physiologic system has changed dramatically. In this review, we focus on the newly discovered functions of the RAS, particularly the potential clinical significance of these developments, especially in the realm of new pharmacologic interventions for treating cardiovascular disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), ES 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that in hypertensive patients with CKD, renin decreases proportionately to nephron loss, except in cases of renal ischemia from renal artery stenosis where renin will be elevated. Recognize that aldosterone can also be elevated in CKD, leading to overall increases in false-positive testing.

Dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone-system (RAAS) in sepsis is a complex and early phenomenon with a likely significant contribution to organ failure and patient outcomes. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and intricacies of the RAAS in septic shock has led to the use of exogenous angiotensin II as a new therapeutic agent. In this review, we report a multinational and multi-disciplinary expert panel discussion on the role and implications of RAAS modulation in sepsis and the use of exogenous angiotensin II. The panel proposed guidance regarding patient selection and treatment options with exogenous angiotensin II which should trigger further research.

### Obesity and hypertension: Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2023 [^1137ZVQY]. Obesity Pillars (2023). High credibility.

Increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) — adipose contributions to hypertension: Angiotensinogen is mainly produced by the liver, with variably increased angiotensinogen production by large adipose tissue deposits as well as smaller deposits such as visceral and perivascular adipose tissue, and angiotensinogen levels are increased with obesity. Angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I by renin and then to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme; angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor that increases vascular peripheral resistance and increases blood pressure and also stimulates aldosterone release that promotes sodium and water reabsorption by the kidneys; aldosterone can also be produced by adipocytes in patients with obesity. The increase in vascular vasoconstriction, coupled with increased water reabsorption increases blood pressure.

### Why the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in critically ill patients can no longer be ignored [^115vqjNy]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

High renin-levels portend a worse outcome and outperform lactate as prognostic indicator of survival. Thus, the notion of a high-renin biotype is becoming increasingly supported by evidence and, given the availability of AT-II, is now clinically relevant. An important additional consideration is the etiology of such elevated renin state. The renin-levels seen in shocked patients exceed levels seen in renin-secreting tumors, which suggests a broad RAAS response. Moreover, since these elevated renin-levels are seen in both severe AKI and ESRD, it is likely that the kidney is not the sole source of renin as this hormone can be secreted from various non-renal sources. This raises the question as to whether patients with high-renin shock have hyperreninemia because of decreased AT-II production or because of decreased ATR1 responsiveness or both or even because of other mechanism. This question cannot yet be answered. However, we know that, in patients with vasodilatory shock, secondary hyperreninemia renin is decreased when AT-II is administered. Additionally, experimental models of sepsis suggest that decreased AT1R-responsiveness may also be important and contribute to kidney injury. Clearly, renewed interest in the RAAS during critical illness demands more sophisticated analyses of all aspects of this system not only at baseline but also over time and in response to interventions.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: a potential source of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for sarcoidosis [^111Qtk5v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The discovery of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dates back to 1898, when studies by Tigerstedt and Bergman reported the pressor effect of renal extracts, which they named renin on the basis of its source. The RAAS consists of three molecules: renin, angiotensin, and the hormone aldosterone, produced by the adrenal cortex. Renin is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is relatively inactive and is converted into the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). A recent study documented the role of the RAAS in sarcoidosis pathogenesis, specifically that hyperactive macrophage activity within granulomas is the source of increased ACE activity. Additionally, in another elegant study using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) Nakamizo and colleagues showed that only macrophages positive for TREM2 (triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells 2) expressing ACE were increased in cutaneous sarcoidosis granulomas.

Sarcoidosis is a multiorgan granulomatous lung disease that primarily affects the lungs. It occurs in individuals of all ages, sexes, and ethnic backgrounds and is characterized by the accumulation of large numbers of activated CD4 + T cells and noncaseating granulomas. Although the cause of sarcoidosis is largely undefined, multiple studies have reported prior exposure to environmental factors, including bacterial or fungal pathogens. In this issue of the Journal, Crouser and colleagues (pp.) report the role of the RAAS in promoting the accumulation of cellular aggregates derived from sarcoidosis peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after in vitro stimulation by tuberculin protein extract purified protein derivatives (PPD)–coated beads. The addition of inhibitors of the RAAS pathway, receptors, or downstream components prevents the accumulation of aggregates and lowers granuloma area fraction and inflammatory cytokines in the cellular supernatant (Figure 1). This investigation thus provides alternative therapeutic targets to treat patients with sarcoidosis and potentially other immune-mediated lung disorders.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: fundamental aspects and clinical implications in renal and cardiovascular disorders [^115MKJst]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) exerts a principal influence in maintaining vascular tone, optimal salt and water homeostasis, and forward cardiac output in human beings. Overactivity of the RAAS can lead to pathologic consequences in states of diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. In addition to fluid and hemodynamic effects, the RAAS may have a critical role in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the progression of atherosclerosis, the dysregulation of endothelial function, and the inhibition of the fibrinolytic system. Accumulated basic and clinical evidence supports the use of inhibitors of the RAAS, including aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, in treating hypertension, improving diabetic nephropathy, preventing or ameliorating congestive heart failure, and optimizing the prognosis after myocardial infarction.

### Diagnosis and management of primary aldosteronism [^113H2d9h]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying primary aldosteronism within the hypertensive population is an important clinical challenge, as most patients with a unilateral source of excess aldosterone secretion are amenable to surgical cure. At least 20% of patients with primary aldosteronism have normal serum potassium levels. Therefore, screening tests should not be based on recognition of hypokalemia alone. Rather, the diagnosis should depend on identifying renin suppression and measuring the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity. The diagnosis may be confirmed by performing an aldosterone suppression test after oral salt loading. Once primary aldosteronism has been established, it is necessary to exclude glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism and then proceed to localization studies. Detecting a unilateral source of aldosterone, usually due to an adenoma (Conn syndrome), is achieved by postural hormonal testing and confirmed by selective venous sampling (SVS) with measurement of aldosterone concentrations (expressed as the aldosterone/cortisol ratio) in each adrenal vein. SVS is enjoying a revival in many institutions as it is more sensitive and specific than either cross-sectional imaging or scintigraphy and has the potential to influence significantly both the diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Patients with unilateral disease are ideally treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients in whom localization is not achieved usually have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and are treated medically.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for the treatment of low-renin hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132ujvr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mmHg. It affects an estimated 1.28 billion adults worldwide and is a major cause of premature death. Adequate control of this modifiable risk factor is key to reducing cardiovascular disease; a 5 mmHg reduction in SBP is associated with a 10% reduction in major cardiovascular events. However, four out of five hypertensive people do not meet blood pressure (BP) targets and it is estimated that two-thirds of patients will require more than one drug to achieve BP control.

One possible reason for this is that the current one-size-fits-all sequential approach to pharmacotherapy fails to address the underlying pathophysiology of hypertension for the individual. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a key regulator of BP. Low dietary salt and blood volume stimulate the release of renin, which leads to a cascade of downstream effects including water and salt reabsorption and increased vascular tone mediated by angiotensin II, aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation. However, when the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is dysregulated, such as in the case of primary aldosteronism (PA), there is a loss of the negative feedback mechanism, leading to inappropriate MR activation promoting excess sodium and water reabsorption, hypertension and end-organ damage. PA is diagnosed by the presence of low renin and an inappropriately normal or elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, resulting in an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). PA has clear targeted treatment options including medical therapy with MR antagonist (MRA) or adrenalectomy in the case of an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Importantly, adrenalectomy to remove the source of excess aldosterone, and MR blockade are effective in reducing BP and the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with PA. With easier access to renin and aldosterone measurement and advocacy for expanded screening for PA, clinicians are faced with the dilemma of how to manage patients who have low renin but do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PA. This condition, known as low-renin hypertension (LRH), is present in as many as 30% of hypertensive individuals. It is hypothesised that the low renin in the context of hypertension reflects excess MR activation and/or salt reabsorption due to abnormalities in renal sodium handling in the distal nephrons of the kidneys. Current clinical practice guidelines do not provide clear recommendations for the initial choice of monotherapy for people with LRH. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of participants with resistant hypertension on three antihypertensives, a lower baseline renin was associated with a greater BP-lowering response with MRA add-on therapy compared to a beta-blocker and an alpha-blocker. This raises the question of whether early targeted MRA treatment in patients with LRH would be beneficial and possibly avoid the need for multiple anti-hypertensives. The findings of individual studies have been conflicting and hence we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to combine existing data on the efficacy and tolerability of MRA in LRH.

### Human kidney pericytes produce renin [^112W8SvU]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Pericytes, perivascular cells embedded in the microvascular wall, are crucial for vascular homeostasis. These cells also play diverse roles in tissue development and regeneration as multi-lineage progenitors, immunomodulatory cells and as sources of trophic factors. Here, we establish that pericytes are renin producing cells in the human kidney. Renin was localized by immunohistochemistry in CD146 and NG2 expressing pericytes, surrounding juxtaglomerular and afferent arterioles. Similar to pericytes from other organs, CD146 + CD34 – CD45 – CD56 – renal fetal pericytes, sorted by flow cytometry, exhibited tri-lineage mesodermal differentiation potential in vitro. Additionally, renin expression was triggered in cultured kidney pericytes by cyclic AMP as confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy, and secretion of enzymatically functional renin, capable of generating angiotensin I. Pericytes derived from second trimester human placenta also expressed renin in an inducible fashion although the renin activity was much lower than in renal pericytes. Thus, our results confirm and extend the recently discovered developmental plasticity of microvascular pericytes, and may open new perspectives to the therapeutic regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.

### Human kidney pericytes produce renin [^115RRzDx]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the versatile nature of renin-expressing cells is related to their perivascular identity. Therefore, we investigated the developmental affiliation between pericytes and renin-expressing and/or -producing cells in the human kidney. For the first time, human kidney pericytes were typified, purified, cultured, and functionally characterized as MSCs. Principally, we showed that fetal renal pericytes natively express renin with functional enzyme activity.

### Revisiting the relationship between (pro) renin receptor and the intrarenal RAS: focus on the soluble receptor [^116X4Qqv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The (pro)renin receptor (PRR), also termed as ATPase H+ transporting accessory protein 2 (ATP6AP2), was originally cloned as a specific receptor for prorenin and renin [together called (pro)renin]. Given the wide tissue distribution of PRR, PRR was further postulated to act as a regulator of tissue renin. However, assigning a physiological role of PRR within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been challenging largely due to its pleotropic functions in regulation of embryogenesis, autophagy, and H+ transport. The current review will summarize recent advances in understanding the roles of sPPR within the intrarenal RAS as well as those outside this local system.

Recent Findings

Site-1 protease (S1P) is a predominant source of sPPR at least in the kidney. So far most of the known physiological functions of PRR including renal handling of electrolytes and fluid and blood pressure are mediated by sPRR. In particular, sPRR serves as a positive regulator of collecting duct renin to activate the intrarenal RAS during water deprivation or angiotensin-II (AngII) infusion. However, PRR/sPRR can act in renin-independent manner under other circumstances.

Summary

S1P-derived sPRR has emerged as a key regulator of kidney function and blood pressure and its relationship with the intrarenal RAS depends on the physiological context.

### Physiological relevance of renin / prorenin binding and uptake [^117Ghka4]. Hypertension Research (2005). Low credibility.

There is compelling physiological evidence of binding and uptake of renin and prorenin in tissues. A number of molecules with the ability to bind renin and prorenin have been identified and have been characterized to varying degrees. It remains unclear, however, just how many renin/prorenin binding proteins and receptors exist and what their physiological functions may be. The possible functions of renin/prorenin binding and uptake are manifold, and include clearance of renin and prorenin from the circulation, local generation of angiotensins, activation of prorenin on the cell surface, trafficking of prorenin between cellular and extracellular compartments as part of a complex processing machinery, and signal transduction both via direct receptor mediated signaling, and via modulation of O-linkage of N-acetyl-glucosamine to cellular proteins. Some of these functions may involve single renin/prorenin binding sites or receptors, while others may require multiple binding sites and receptors. This review describes the physiological studies that have provided evidence of renin/prorenin uptake from the circulation, summarizes our knowledge of renin/prorenin binding proteins and receptors, and postulates new roles for renin/prorenin binding and uptake in tissues.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate (aliskiren) [^112W2k3o]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non-ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g. ACE or non-ACE pathways, is not known.

All agents that inhibit the RAAS, including renin inhibitors, suppress the negative feedback loop, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma renin concentration. When this rise occurs during treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, the result is increased levels of PRA. During treatment with aliskiren, however, the effect of increased renin levels is blocked so that PRA, Ang I and Ang II are all reduced, whether aliskiren is used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, PRA was decreased in a range of 50% to 80%. This reduction in PRA was not dose- related and did not correlate with blood pressure reductions. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Aliskiren is poorly absorbed (bioavailability about 2.5%) with an approximate accumulation half-life of 24 hours. Steady state blood levels are reached in about 7 to 8 days.

Absorption and Distribution

Following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of aliskiren are reached within 1 to 3 hours. When taken with a high-fat meal, mean AUC and Cmaxof aliskiren are decreased by 71% and 85% respectively. In the clinical trials of aliskiren, it was administered without requiring a fixed relation of administration to meals.

### Role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in chronic kidney disease [^113q9E2K]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The existence of local or tissue-based renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (RAAS) is well documented and has been implicated as a key player in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal diseases. The kidney contains all elements of the RAAS, and intrarenal formation of angiotensin II not only controls glomerular hemodynamics and tubule sodium transport, but also activates a number of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the intrarenal RAAS is activated early in diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers decrease the rate of decline in kidney function in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy, many patients still progress to end-stage renal disease or die from cardiovascular events. There is still a clear need for additional strategies to block the RAAS more effectively to reduce progression of CKD. The focus of this paper is to review the importance of the intrarenal RAAS in CKD and recent findings in renin-angiotensin biology pertinent to the kidney. We also discuss additional strategies to inhibit the RAAS more effectively and the potential impact of direct renin inhibition on the prevention and management of CKD.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Yahfk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Renin as a biomarker during primary aldosteronism–specific medical therapy: Although aldosterone-directed medical therapy has been beneficial in PA, the optimal dosing and surveillance remain uncertain, and whether renin should guide treatment has been considered by prior studies and consensus groups. Because PA is characterized and diagnosed by aldosterone overproduction despite suppression of renin and angiotensin II, a rise in renin induced by aldosterone-directed medical therapy should reflect reversal of PA pathophysiology that may portend improved clinical outcomes.

### The renin phenotype: roles and regulation in the kidney [^115wcEBh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Renin cells are fundamental for the control of blood pressure, fluid electrolyte homeostasis and kidney development. This review discusses recent discoveries regarding the mechanisms that control the identity and fate of renin cells and their role in the maintenance of kidney architecture and function.

Recent Findings

It is now established that cyclic AMP is a crucial factor for the regulation of the renin phenotype. Furthermore, additional factors such as microRNAs and gap junctions have recently emerged as key regulators for the maintenance and proper functioning of renin cells.

Summary

Experiments described in this review will hopefully raise new questions regarding the mechanisms that control the identity, plasticity and function of renin cells.

### Short-lived active prorenin: precursor of so-called native prorenin [^111js4mR]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The enzymatic activity of the aspartic protease, renin, is key to the functioning of the renin-angiotensin system. Consensus says that inactive prorenin is the precursor of renin and that in vivo activation of prorenin depends on cleavage of the prosegment from the renin body. Gastric aspartic proteases like pepsinogen are activated at low pH. The early phase of activation is reversible and is followed by proteolytic auto-activation. Prorenin is also activated by acid, but here activation is rapidly reversed at pH 7 and 37 °C. Unlike pepsin, renin is active at neutral pH, and the same is true for acid-activated prorenin.

The kidney produces renin and prorenin. Other organs, like the ovary, uterus, and eye, produce prorenin, but there is no evidence of prorenin-to-renin conversion in these organs. Low-molecular weight transition-state-mimicking renin inhibitors interact with native prorenin at neutral pH, thereby inducing the unfolding of the prosegment and a change of the renin moiety into a conformation identical or very similar to native renin. The x-ray crystal structures of free renin, free prorenin, and renin in complex with inhibitors are now available. The pathway of reversible prorenin auto-activation/inactivation is still not fully understood. A better understanding of this process may help to design experiments addressing the question of how prorenin could participate in the functioning of the so-called tissue renin-angiotensin system.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115ieX9V]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — renin-guided titration during PA-specific medical therapy: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy whose hypertension is not controlled and renin is suppressed, we suggest increasing PA-specific medical therapy to raise renin. This applies to individuals with PA receiving aldosterone-directed medical therapy whose blood pressure (BP) remains high, and the panel does not specify a renin level to target but rather advises titration of aldosterone-directed medical therapy to a rise in renin from pretreatment baseline; uncertainty remains as to whether titrating aldosterone-directed medical therapy to raise renin when BP is controlled is efficacious.

### The tissue renin-angiotensin system and intracellular signalling [^11481V8f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The renin-angiotensin system is not what it was, or for that matter not necessarily where we thought it should be. For example, there is a novel angiotensin I-metabolizing enzyme that generates angiotensin 1–7 rather than angiotensin II. Moreover, we are slowly realizing the importance of local rather than circulating angiotensin II.

Recent Findings

Rather than concentrating on the systemic renin-angiotensin system, recent work has concentrated on elucidating the consequences of increasing angiotensin II production within specific organs, such as the heart and vasculature, as well as in the pancreas and in adipose tissue. Inhibition of angiotensin II production either using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers not only reverses remodelling but also increases tissue insulin sensitivity. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system clinically delays the onset of type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. Moreover, at least one other angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue (ACE2) plays a significant role in the regulation of heart and kidney function, and as it generates angiotensin 1–7 from angiotensin I, it is proposed to counteract the detrimental effects associated with the activation of the classic renin-angiotensin system.

Summary

There is a need to re-evaluate the role(s) played by the molecular components of the "extended" local renin-angiotensin system and their role in vascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

### Influence of sodium intake and change in sodium intake on plasma-renin in man [^114XiSR4]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias across studies: To investigate possible heterogeneity due to methodological diversity, subgroup analyses was performed for groups with contrasting assessments of overall-bias appearing from the risk of bias analysis. The stratification by BP may prevent some heterogeneity and meta-regression analyses of potential effect modifiers may reveal other sources of heterogeneity.

Additional analyses: To investigate the potential effect of the method of sodium administration we stratified the studies into a group, which ingested sodium by diet alone and into a group, which was treated with salt tablets or placebo tablets.

2.3 Role of the funding source

There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

### Renin, angiotensin II, and the journey to evidence-based individual treatment effects [^112W7PkT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Designing randomized trials to assess for heterogeneity of treatment effect by biologic measures of the proposed mechanistic pathway is one important step toward evidence-based individual treatment effects, but it is not the only step. Bellomo and colleagues apply a traditional "one-variable-at-a-time" approach to evaluating for heterogeneity of treatment effect. A complete understanding of how individual patients will respond to treatment, however, may require simultaneous consideration of the interaction among multiple related variables (e.g. intravascular volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, tissue oxygen saturation, and exogenous catecholamine receipt). For example, euvolemic patients with "inappropriately" high renin levels might benefit from angiotensin II infusion, whereas hypovolemic patients with "appropriately" high renin levels might be harmed by angiotensin II infusion. The number of potential effect modifiers and their theoretical combinations may outpace traditional methods for analyzing randomized trials.

Building the tools clinicians need to make evidence-based treatment decisions for individual patients will require investment on multiple fronts. In the long term, we believe randomized trials in critical care should:
1 Be large enough to estimate, with adequate statistical power, treatment effects for individuals or small groups of patients, rather than average treatment effects.
2 Enroll broad and representative enough patient populations to estimate treatment effects for the full range of individuals who might be exposed to an intervention in practice. Specifically, trials should only exclude patients for whom an incontrovertible pathophysiologic rationale suggests they will not respond to the treatment (e.g. absence of the molecular target). This approach allows a comprehensive understanding of which patients do and do not benefit from a treatment and avoids inappropriately depriving patients of a treatment from which they would have benefited in cases in which the treatment's mechanism is multimodal or incompletely understood.
3 Extract data automatically from the electronic health record to generate large volumes of granular data on physiology and response to treatment and develop innovative, inexpensive approaches to targeted assessment of mechanistic biomarkers.
4 Address in design, analysis, and dissemination the complex patterns of covariates and interactions that determine the effects of treatment on outcomes for individual patients. Analysis of randomized trials using advanced approaches to regression analysis or machine learning may inform both mechanistic understanding and treatment decisions. Computerized clinician decision-support tools may help translate increasingly sophisticated estimates of individual treatment effect into clinical care.

### Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is involved in the control of renin gene expression [^11565dKT]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Based on the presence of a functional retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor transcription factor binding sequence (hormone-responsive element) in the renin gene enhancer and on the fact that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) bind to DNA as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors, we speculated that PPARs are involved in the regulation of renin gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used the human renin-producing cell line CaLu-6. Endogenous or pharmacological PPARgamma agonists (unsaturated fatty acids and thiazolidinediones, respectively) stimulated renin gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that PPARgamma targets a palindromic repeat with a 3-bp spacer (Pal3) in the proximal human renin promoter. Thus, renin is the first gene described with a functional Pal3 sequence. PPARgamma agonists also stimulated renin gene expression in cultured native juxtaglomerular cells, which are the main source of renin in vivo. In summary, PPARgamma was identified as a novel intracellular mediator involved in the upregulation of renin transcription.

### Primary aldosteronism: molecular medicine meets public health [^113ztf5Q]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Defining primary aldosteronism

PA is the most common cause of endocrine arterial hypertension and is characterized by the autonomous production of aldosterone from one or both adrenal glands. The autonomy of this disorder contrasts with normal physiological processes, and with secondary aldosteronism, in which aldosterone secretion is regulated largely by angiotensin II (ANGII). As the production of ANGII is dependent on the secretion of the enzyme renin, the practical definition of PA refers to the ratio of aldosterone and renin measured in blood. Like many other medical conditions defined by a threshold value within a quantitative continuum, the application of this definition is straightforward only for the minority of patients who reside near the extreme end of the continuum. When the continuum is a ratio, in this case the ARR, in which the culprit hormone (aldosterone) is the arithmetically distributed numerator, and the denominator a log-normally distributed sodium sensor (renin), the problems of diagnosis are multiplied: almost any measurable value of aldosterone in the presence of an undetectable plasma renin creates an ARR that is apparently diagnostic of PA. In practice, however, ARR frequently fails as a standalone measure of PA, and the autonomy of aldosterone secretion needs to be confirmed by showing that aldosterone is not suppressed (below another threshold value) by administration of salt or captopril.

### (pro) renin receptor: a treatment target for diabetic retinopathy? [^1152KMbM]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Many lines of evidence implicate the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. A recent multicenter trial showed that angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade (ARB) reduced the incidence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetic patients and improved the regression of retinal disease in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the failure of ARB to prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy indicates a role for mechanisms additional to angiotensin II in its pathogenesis. In this issue of Diabetes, Satofuka et al. provide evidence that prorenin and the (pro)renin receptor, acting in part through mechanisms unrelated to angiotensin II, may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. This evidence holds promise for new therapies for diabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes.

Prorenin is a high–molecular weight biosynthetic precursor of renin. It has a low intrinsic activity of < 2% of the activity of renin because it has an amino-terminal 43–amino acid prosegment that masks the active site, thereby preventing access by the renin substrate — angiotensinogen. Renal juxtaglomerular cells are the only known site of renin production, whereas the kidney and a number of extrarenal tissues including adrenal, ovary, testis, placenta, and retina produce prorenin. Plasma prorenin concentrations are ∼10- to 20-fold higher than those of renin. Prorenin concentrations in plasma and vitreous fluid are increased in diabetic subjects, and plasma prorenin is a powerful marker for both prevalent and incident microvascular complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.

### Measuring and targeting aldosterone and renin in atherosclerosis-a review of clinical data [^114tizEt]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the development and progression of atherosclerosis has increased substantially over the past decades. A significant role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in this process has gained appreciation in recent years. Preclinical and clinical studies have associated components of the RAAS with various cardiovascular disease conditions. Classically known for its contribution to hypertension, dysregulation of the system is now also believed to promote vascular inflammation, fibrosis, remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction, all intimately related to atherosclerosis. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, as seen with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, supports the concept that RAAS is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the pathophysiology remain to be completely understood. Evidence points toward additional benefit from therapeutic approaches aiming at more complete inhibition of the system and the possible utility of renin or aldosterone in the prediction of cardiovascular outcome. This review will summarize the current knowledge from clinical studies regarding the presumptive role of renin and aldosterone in the prediction and management of patients with atherosclerosis. For this purpose, a literature search was performed, focusing on available clinical data regarding renin or aldosterone and cardiovascular outcome.

### Renin and prorenin as biomarkers in hypertension [^113N1Cxq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the evidence that plasma renin and/or prorenin level may be used to guide therapy in hypertension and as an independent risk factor for future cardiovascular events.

Recent Findings

A large number of retrospective analyses of patient populations in clinical trials, in whom 'baseline' renin measurements were available, supports that high renin, but not high prorenin levels, are indicative of future cardiovascular disease and death, particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction and/or hypertension. The relationship is not affected by the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. High renin levels also tend to support the use of RAS inhibitors as first-choice antihypertensive agents. However, the added value of a renin measurement on top of traditional risk factors is modest, and the pressure response to RAS blockade, even in high-renin patients, varies widely.

Summary

Measuring 'baseline' renin as a marker of future cardiovascular events or to determine the choice of drug is of limited value in an individual patient.

### Renin-angiotensin system revisited [^114N7e25]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

New components and functions of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are still being unravelled. The classical RAS as it looked in the middle 1970s consisted of circulating renin, acting on angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I, which in turn was converted into angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II, still considered the main effector of RAS was believed to act only as a circulating hormone via angiotensin receptors, AT1 and AT2. Since then, an expanded view of RAS has gradually emerged. Local tissue RAS systems have been identified in most organs. Recently, evidence for an intracellular RAS has been reported. The new expanded view of RAS therefore covers both endocrine, paracrine and intracrine functions. Other peptides of RAS have been shown to have biological actions; angiotensin 2–8 heptapeptide (Ang III) has actions similar to those of Ang II. Further, the angiotensin 3–8 hexapeptide (Ang IV) exerts its actions via insulin-regulated amino peptidase receptors. Finally, angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7) acts via mas receptors. The discovery of another ACE2 was an important complement to this picture. The recent discovery of renin receptors has made our view of RAS unexpectedly complex and multilayered. The importance of RAS in cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated by the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers. Great expectations are now generated by the introduction of renin inhibitors. Indeed, RAS regulates much more and diverse physiological functions than previously believed.
