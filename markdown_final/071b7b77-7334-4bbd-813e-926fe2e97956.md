## Question

Types of endoleaks

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the types of endoleaks after EVAR — their classification, mechanisms, risks, and management principles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standardized classification and definitions. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and hemodynamics that drive risk. Next, I will review incidence and natural history by type. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and thresholds for intervention. Finally, I will synthesize management algorithms and highlight special scenarios and controversies, ensuring each claim is supported by guidelines or high-quality data.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework so I don't drift from consensus: endoleaks are categorized into five types (I–V) by anatomic source and mechanism, with type I reflecting attachment-site failure, type II reflecting branch-vessel backflow, type III reflecting device-component failure, type IV reflecting fabric porosity, and type V reflecting endotension without a visible leak, and this schema is consistently endorsed by ACC/AHA and EACTS/STS guidelines and reflected in contemporary interventional standards, so I should anchor to those sources to avoid ambiguity [^11713mDm] [^113Dm2Yi] [^111j2E9C] [^1129Tzd2].

> Wait, let me verify the subclassifications so I don't misstate them: type I is subdivided into Ia (proximal), Ib (distal), and Ic (iliac occluder in aorto-uni-iliac repairs), type II into IIa (single branch) and IIb (multiple branches), and type III into IIIa (modular disconnection) and IIIb (fabric tear), which aligns with CIRSE and SVS guidance and is the nomenclature used in modern series and device safety communications [^111vDpmV] [^114R4Mgx] [^111DgWzZ].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology and hemodynamic significance because management hinges on risk: type I and III are high-pressure, high-flow failures that transmit systemic pressure into the sac and are unequivocally associated with rupture risk, whereas type II is low-flow collateral backfill that may be benign but can occasionally cause sac expansion, and type IV is typically transient porosity in older devices; type V reflects pressurization without a visible leak, often from occult microleak or pressure transmission through thrombus, so I need to keep these distinctions front-of-mind when deciding urgency [^112yG9e6] [^116wM4nu] [^113tyamW].

> Hold on, I should verify incidence and natural history so I don't overgeneralize: type II is the most common, seen in roughly 10–30% early after EVAR, with about half resolving spontaneously by 6 months and a minority persisting; type I occurs in up to about 10% and may increase over time, especially with hostile necks; type III is uncommon overall but more frequent with early-generation devices; type IV is rare with modern grafts; type V is uncommon and often represents occult pathology, so I need to ensure surveillance plans account for late emergence and device-era effects [^111PYPxF] [^111vDpmV] [^1129q2ke] [^116wM4nu] [^113tyamW].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy and detection performance so I don't miss subtle leaks: contrast-enhanced CT angiography with delayed imaging remains the pragmatic gold standard for detection and classification, duplex ultrasound is highly specific for type I/III but less sensitive for type II, MRI can improve detection of subtle type II or occult leaks, and dynamic or dual-energy CTA may better characterize flow direction and small leaks; I should double-check that these modality strengths match guideline and imaging literature before recommending a surveillance mix [^116eooVk] [^1172aNmG] [^114yE6Sp] [^113tyamW].

> Let me think about surveillance cadence and thresholds, and I should confirm them against multiple guidelines: lifelong imaging follow-up is required after EVAR, with early postoperative CT or duplex at about 1 month, then 6 and 12 months, and annually thereafter if stable; new endoleaks should prompt reassessment for type I or III, and sac growth exceeding about 5–10 mm over 12 months is a common trigger to consider intervention for type II, while type I/III mandate treatment when identified, so I need to ensure my plan aligns with SVS, ACC/AHA, and EACTS/STS recommendations [^114GnTPt] [^113Uaz3P] [^11713mDm] [^112HeBGN].

> I should confirm management principles by type so I don't over-treat low-risk lesions: type I and III endoleaks are treatment failures and should be corrected urgently, typically with endovascular extension, relining, or EndoAnchors, reserving open conversion for failure or uncorrectable anatomy; type II endoleaks are observed unless associated with significant sac expansion or persistence beyond roughly 6–12 months, with embolization (often translumbar) favored when intervention is indicated; type IV is observed given self-limited behavior with modern devices; type V warrants exclusion of occult leaks and consideration of relining or conversion if expansion persists, and I should double-check that these align with SVS, ESVS, and CIRSE guidance [^116Ktkry] [^113xHVqx] [^111rgwSt] [^1137jfzb] [^113tyamW].

> But wait, what if a type II endoleak is refractory to embolization — could I be missing an occult type I or III; I should verify that risk: failed or repeated attempts to treat a presumed type II endoleak, especially with rapid sac growth, should raise suspicion for delayed or occult type I/III, and series suggest a meaningful fraction of such patients harbor previously undetected high-risk endoleaks, so escalation imaging with catheter angiography or advanced CT/MR is prudent before repeated embolization [^111KJhkM] [^113tt65X].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't overlook device-specific failure modes: chimney or parallel grafts can create gutter-related type Ia leaks that may require tailored endovascular strategies, and certain platforms have higher propensities for type III failures over time, so surveillance should be device-aware and include plain radiographs to assess component separation when suspicion is high, which is reinforced by device-focused analyses and interventional reviews [^112gicAV] [^1143QYui] [^111DgWzZ].

> I should double-check that my synthesis preserves the key clinical takeaways: endoleaks are classified into five types by mechanism, type I/III are high-risk and mandate repair, type II is common and usually observed unless the sac enlarges, type IV is rare and benign with modern grafts, and type V is a diagnosis of exclusion that still warrants action if expansion persists; lifelong surveillance is non-negotiable, and management should be individualized within a multidisciplinary framework to balance rupture risk against intervention morbidity [^11713mDm] [^112HeBGN] [^111JvXUJ].

Endoleaks are classified into **five types** based on their pathophysiology and management implications [^11713mDm]:

- **Type I**: Attachment site leaks (Ia proximal, Ib distal, Ic iliac occluder) — high rupture risk; treat immediately [^111j2E9C] [^111vDpmV].
- **Type II**: Branch vessel backflow (IIa single, IIb multiple) — most common; observe unless sac expands > 5–10 mm/year or persists > 6–12 months [^111JvXUJ] [^115sd2bh].
- **Type III**: Graft defect (IIIa component separation, IIIb fabric tear) — high rupture risk; urgent repair required [^111rgwSt] [^1129Tzd2].
- **Type IV**: Fabric porosity — rare, self-limited, no treatment [^116wM4nu].
- **Type V**: Endotension (sac expansion without visible leak) — consider intervention if sac grows > 10 mm/year or remains unexplained [^112HeBGN] [^111j2E9C].

Type I and III are **high risk and require prompt treatment**; Type II is managed selectively based on sac behavior; Type IV is observed; Type V warrants further imaging and intervention if expansion persists [^1138WLdE] [^111JvXUJ].

### CIRSE standards of practice on management of endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair [^116DjYAM]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoleaks represent the most common complication after EVAR. Some types are associated with ongoing risk of aneurysm rupture and necessitate long-term surveillance and secondary interventions.

Purpose

This document, as with all CIRSE Standards of Practice documents, will recommend a reasonable approach to best practices of managing endoleaks. This will include imaging diagnosis, surveillance, indications for intervention, endovascular treatments and their outcomes. Our purpose is to provide recommendations based on up-to-date evidence, updating the guidelines previously published on this topic in 2013.

Methods

The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in endoleak management. The writing group reviewed the existing literature performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed to select publications in English and relating to human subjects up to 2023. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

Results

Endoleaks may compromise durability of the aortic repair, and long-term imaging surveillance is necessary for early detection and correct classification to guide potential re-intervention. The majority of endoleaks that require treatment can be managed using endovascular techniques. This Standards of Practice document provides up-to-date recommendations for the safe management of endoleaks.

### The significance and management of different types of endoleaks [^114Jo62H]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Development of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been accompanied by previously unencountered complications. The most challenging but least understood of these complications is the incomplete seal of the endovascular graft (endoleak), a phenomenon that has a variety of causes. An important consequence of endoleakage may be persistent pressurization of the aneurysm sac, which may ultimately lead to post-EVAR rupture. Data of 110 European centers were recorded in a central database (EUROSTAR). Patient, anatomic characteristics, and operative and device details were correlated with the occurrence of different types of endoleaks. Outcome events during follow-up, particularly expansion of the aneurysm, incidence of conversion to open repair, and post-EVAR rupture were assessed in the different categories of endoleaks and in a group of patients without any endoleak. Type I and III endoleak were associated with an increased frequency of open conversions or risk of rupture of the aneurysm. Device-related endoleaks also correlated with an increased need for secondary interventions. These types of endoleaks need to be treated without delay, and when no other possibilities are present, an open conversion to avert the risk of rupture should be considered. Type II endoleaks do not pose an indication for urgent treatment. However, they may not be harmless, because there was a frequent association with enlargement of aneurysm and reinterventions. Our findings suggest that more frequent surveillance examinations are indicated than in patients without collateral endoleak. The indication for intervention is primarily dictated by documented expansion of the aneurysm.

### What is the significance of endoleaks and endotension [^116FLML5]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Endovascular repair has been used over a decade as a treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and has become a widely accepted treatment method with a low rate of perioperative complications. Endoleak, perigraft blood flow outside endograft but within aneurysmsac, has been intensively studied during the last 10 years of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVR). The natural history of aneurysms with endoleak and the true clinical significance of various types of endoleaks remains unclear. Type I/III endoleak has been found to be associated with aneurysm rupture, while the risk of rupture of aneurysms with type II endoleak and endotension appears very small. In endotension, the aneurysm sac remains pressurized, even if there is no evidence of an endoleak. Currently, it is accepted that type I/III endoleaks should be corrected, preferably by endovascular means, due to the risk of rupture. If endovascular repair is not possible, then open conversion should be considered. The risk of conversion should be weighed against the risk of aneurysm rupture. Treatment of type II endoleaks and endotension is more controversial. In those with aneurysm enlargement, secondary interventions are often performed.

### Type II endoleaks: when is intervention indicated and what is the index of suspicion for types I or III? [^112Spsnn]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

One of the principal reasons for failure of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the occurrence of endoleaks, which regardless of size or type can transmit systemic pressure to the aneurysm sac. There is little debate that type I endoleaks (poor proximal or distal sealing) are associated with continued risk of aneurysm rupture and require treatment. Similarly, with type III endoleak, there is agreement that the defect in the device needs to be addressed; however, what to do with type II endoleaks and their effect on long-term outcome are not so clear. Aneurysm sac change is a primary parameter for determining the presence of an endoleak and assessing its impact. While diameter measurement has been the most commonly used method for determining sac changes, volume measurement has now been proven superior for monitoring structural changes in the 3-dimensional sac. Determining the source of an endoleak and the direction of flow are necessary for proper classification; however, while computed tomographic angiography has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting endoleaks, it is limited in its ability to show the direction of flow. Contrast-enhanced duplex ultrasound, on the other hand, is better able to quantify flow and characterize endoleaks. Flow is evidence of pressure, and increasing intrasac pressure increases wall tension, thus inducing progressive aneurysm expansion until rupture. Hence, determining intrasac pressure is becoming a vital component of endoleak assessment. All endoleaks can create systemic pressure inside the aneurysm sac, and there are a variety of intrasac pressure transducers being evaluated to assess this effect. A clinical pathway for patients with suspected type II endoleaks is based on a combination of imaging and pressure measurements. Imaging alone requires at least two interval examinations to determine the trend, while pressure measurements give immediate reassurance or an indication to intervene. Although still under development, pressure measurement is destined for general use and will provide a scientific basis for the management of type II endoleaks.

Symptoms and management

Understanding the aforementioned different pathophysiology mechanisms that lead to the various types of endoleaks permits to distinguish the high- and low-flow nature, which impacts on the requirement or not of repeated intervention and correction. In particular, high-flow endoleaks could lead to the rupture of the aneurysmal sac and may be associated with symptoms like lumbar pain, or even hypotension and tachycardia due to hypovolemic shock. On the other hand, type II endoleaks due to their pathophysiology mechanism of onset are classified as low flow. This is because the sac reperfusion occurs via collateral circulation arising with inverted flow from the periphery towards the aneurysm sac. In these cases, the sac is exposed to a low-pressure flow that may lead to sac enlargement over time. The evolution can be slow and the endoleak can either be managed conservatively or lead to sac expansion over 5 mm in a year in which case treatment will be deemed necessary. According to the type of endoleak, different approaches may be followed.

Type 2 endoleaks (EL2) are the most commonly encountered endoleaks following EVAR. Despite two decades of experience, there remains considerable variation in the management of EL2 with controversies ranging from if to treat, when to treat and how to treat. Here, we summarise the available evidence, describe the treatment techniques available and offer guidelines for management.

### Endoleaks after endovascular aortic stent-grafting: impact, diagnosis, and management [^116PBkWa]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Endoleaks and endotension remain the primary limitation of endovascular aortic repair with stent-grafts. Consequently, all endovascular surgeons performing thoracic or abdominal endovascular aortic repairs require a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of how to survey and manage endoleaks. The derivation of the current endoleak classification scheme, the clinical impact of endoleaks, the diagnostic tools relevant to endoleak detection, an endoleak surveillance protocol, and the strategies in use for their management are outlined in this review.

### Secondary Endoleak Management Following TEVAR and EVAR [^1131Gfwh]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair and are widely used to treat increasingly complex aneurysms. Secondary endoleaks, defined as those detected more than 30 days after the procedure and after previous negative imaging, remain a challenge for aortic specialists, conferring a need for long-term surveillance and reintervention. Endoleaks are classified on the basis of their anatomic site and aetiology. Type 1 and type 2 endoleaks (EL1 and EL2) are the most common endoleaks necessitating intervention. The management of these requires an understanding of their mechanics, and the risk of sac enlargement and rupture due to increased sac pressure. Endovascular techniques are the main treatment approach to manage secondary endoleaks. However, surgery should be considered where endovascular treatments fail to arrest aneurysm growth. This chapter reviews the aetiology, significance, management strategy and techniques for different endoleak types.

### Type II endoleaks [^1163QA9s]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair are the most common type of endoleak and generate the majority of secondary interventions. Their natural history is mostly benign, but they can occasionally lead to sac expansion and eventual rupture. Three-phase computed tomography angiography is the "gold standard" for diagnosis, but duplex ultrasound with or without contrast enhancement and magnetic resonance angiography offer an alternative for endoleak detection or surveillance. Whereas there are concerns as to whether sac expansion can be a dependable marker for risk of rupture, it is currently the best surrogate available and guides the indication for intervention. Obliteration of type II endoleaks can be challenging, and a variety of techniques, endovascular, open, and laparoscopic, have been proposed. The most common approaches are transarterial and translumbar embolization, and they are usually successful, provided the operator is experienced and persistent, targeting both the branches and the nidus of the endoleak. Recurrences and subsequent reinterventions should be anticipated, and on continuing sac expansion, repeated endovascular or open surgical and laparoscopic alternatives may be required.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112pXuPj]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) — Endoleak is defined as persistent blood flow in the aneurysm sac after EVAR; endoleaks at the time of repair may be present in up to 25%. Although some resolve without intervention, some require immediate or delayed treatment to prevent aneurysm rupture, and some develop months or years after EVAR; thus, lifelong surveillance after EVAR is required. An endoleak may be identified by CT imaging or duplex ultrasound. There are four main types of endoleak, and management depends on endoleak type and the associated risk of sac rupture.

### Endotension: what do we know and not know about this enigmatic complication of endovascular aneurysm repair [^117KBokp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

As the use of endovascular approaches to treat aneurysm repair continues to increase, more and more patients have been identified with endoleaks. Five types of endoleaks have been defined. Endotension, or type V endoleak, remains controversial owing to its variable definition across studies and the range of proposed treatments. Thus, we performed a review of the reported studies to summarize the diagnosis and treatment of this rare complication after endovascular aneurysm repair to determine what we do and do not know about this rare form of endoleak. The presence of an endoleak places patients at an increased risk of aneurysm sac enlargement and potential rupture. Although additional research is essential and yet difficult to perform, we sought to provide a guide for the management of this perplexing endoleak known as endotension.

### Nature and significance of endoleaks and endotension: summary of opinions expressed at an international conference [^112QGFwQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Endoleaks and endotension are critically important complications of some endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs (EVARs). For the resolution of controversial issues and the determination of areas of uncertainty relating to these complications, a conference of 27 interested leaders was held on November 20, 2000.

Methods

These 27 participants (21 vascular surgeons, five interventional radiologists, one cardiologist) had previously answered 40 key questions on endoleaks and endotension. At the conference, these 40 questions and participant answers were discussed and in some cases modified to determine points of agreement (consensus), near consensus (prevailing opinion), or disagreement.

Results

Conference discussion added two modified questions for a total of 42 key questions for the participants. Interestingly, consensus was reached on the answers to 24 of 42 or 57% of the questions, and near consensus was reached on 14 of 42 or 33% of the questions. Only with the answers to four of 42 or 10% of the questions was there persistent controversy or disagreement.

Conclusion

The current endoleak classification system with some important modifications is adequate. Types I and II endoleak occur after 0 to 10% and 10% to 25% of EVARs, respectively. Many (30% to 100%) type II endoleaks will seal and have no detrimental effect, which never or rarely occurs with type I endoleaks. Not all endoleaks can be visualized with any technique, and increased pressure (endotension) can be transmitted through clot. Aneurysm pulsatility after EVAR correlates poorly with endoleaks and endotension. An enlarging aneurysm after EVAR mandates surgical or interventional treatment. These and other conclusions will help to resolve controversy and aid in the management of these vexing complications and should also point the way to future research in this field.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^111j2E9C]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Endoleaks — definitions and management notes describe that the traditional endoleak classification distinguishes 5 types, and type I endoleaks have a high risk of rupture and should be treated at the time of diagnosis. The sole existence of type II endoleaks does not imply the need for reintervention, and endovascular re-interventions may be weighed if sustained substantial aortic growth occurs during the follow-up (> 10 mm); current data do not support the elective open conversion approach for type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Type IIIa endoleaks affecting aortic endografts have a sizeable complication rate and should therefore be repaired promptly, the same recommendation applies to the secondary BSG-related endoleaks, whereas an early type IIIc endoleak may be observed. A type IV endoleak is associated with the porosity of the device material and practically does not occur in the new generations of endografts. A type V endoleak or endotension describes a substantial aneurysm sac expansion (> 10 mm) without the presence of the contrast agent in the aneurysm sac.

We suggest no treatment of type IV endoleaks. Level of recommendation 2 (Weak); Quality of evidence C (Low). We recommend open repair if endovascular intervention fails to treat a type I or type III endoleak with ongoing aneurysm enlargement. Level of recommendation 1 (Strong); Quality of evidence B (Moderate). We suggest open repair if endovascular intervention fails to treat a type II endoleak with ongoing aneurysm enlargement. Level of recommendation 2 (Weak); Quality of evidence C (Low). We suggest treatment for ongoing aneurysm expansion, even in the absence of a visible endoleak. Level of recommendation 2 (Weak); Quality of evidence C (Low).

### Postoperative management: type I and III endoleaks [^117M7KUh]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to help the reader understand the importance of imaging findings and treatment strategies for type I and III endoleaks. Although the appearance of these leaks on computed tomography can be somewhat unremarkable and similar in appearance to type II endoleaks, it is critically important for the treating physician to make the correct diagnosis, as these endoleak types signify an incompletely treated aneurysm. Once the diagnosis of a type I or III endoleak is made, the next step in treatment is to identify the cause of the endoleak. Incomplete initial graft expansion, further arterial dilation, endograft migration, component separation, and tears within the graft fabric are all possible causes of type I and III endoleaks. A combination of computed tomography, plain film radiography, and diagnostic angiography may be necessary to make the diagnosis and identify the underlying cause of the complication. Once all of these factors have been determined, a decision has to be made of whether the endoleak can be treated through additional endovascular means or if endovascular therapy has failed for the patient, making open surgical revision necessary to treat the aneurysm. Illustrative cases of all endoleak types and their treatments are the focus of this article.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcome of different treatments for type 1a endoleak after EVAR [^111Acjun]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Insufficient evidence is available to recommend a particular strategy for the treatment of type 1a endoleaks (T1aELs) after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR). The aim of this study was to report outcomes of the different treatment modalities proposed for persistent and late-occurring T1aEL after EVAR.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature (database searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library) was undertaken until August 2018. Studies about treatment of T1aEL after EVAR (excluding intraoperative treatments during the first EVAR) presenting a series of 5 or more patients with extractable outcome data (at least intraoperative and/or early results) were included. Meta-analyses of proportions were performed using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 39 nonrandomized studies were included (714 patients; 88.1% males, 95% confidence interval [CI] 84.5–91.7; weighted mean age 75.76 years, 95% CI 74.11–77.4). Overall estimated technical success (TS) and clinical success (CS) rates were 93.2% (95% CI 90.5–95.8) and 88.2% (95% CI 84.5–91.9), respectively. Two hundred eighteen patients underwent proximal extension (98.1% TS, 95% CI 96.3–99.8), 131 chimney EVAR (93.9% TS, 95% CI 89.9–97.9), 97 fenestrated EVAR (86.2% TS, 95% CI 77.3–95.1), 90 open conversion (96.5% TS, 95% CI 93–100), 71 embolization (95.2% TS, 95% CI 90.4–100), 35 endostapling (57.2% TS, 95% CI 14.1–100), and 72 conservative treatment (75.4% CS, 95% CI 56.4–94.5). Estimated overall 30-day mortality was 3.2% (95% CI 1.7–4.7), and it was higher for patients undergoing open surgery (6.6%, 95% CI 1.7–11.5). Overall, endoleak resolution during the mean follow-up of 19.4 months (95% CI 15.45–23.36) was maintained in 91% of the patients (95% CI 87.7–94.3).

Conclusions

T1aEL repair appeared generally feasible, with good early to midterm outcomes. Different treatments are available, and the choice should be based on endoleak characteristics, aortic anatomy, and the patient's surgical risk. Conservative treatment and endoleak embolization should be considered only in selected cases, such as low-flow endoleaks and unfit patients.

Endoleak classification and surveillance — Endoleaks are classified by 5 types: Type Ia (proximal attachment site endoleak), Type Ib (distal attachment site endoleak), Type II (backfilling of the aneurysm sac through branch vessels of the aorta), Type III (graft defect or component misalignment), Type IV (leakage through the graft wall attributable to endograft porosity), and Type V (caused by "endotension", possibly resulting from aortic pressure transmitted through the graft/thrombus to the aneurysm sac). An endoleak results in the persistence of blood flow outside the graft and within the aneurysm sac, preventing its complete thrombosis, and patients with endografts require lifelong surveillance imaging to monitor for the appearance of endoleaks.

Endoleaks after endovascular stent-grafting — endografting is widely used for aortic aneurysm repair but one limitation is the occurrence of endoleaks, which may occur early or late; there are 5 types of endoleaks, an endoleak results in persistence of blood flow outside the graft and within the aneurysm sac preventing complete thrombosis, and patients with endografts require lifelong surveillance imaging to monitor for the appearance of endoleaks.

### Endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: management strategies according to CT findings [^115Ea399]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

With increasing use of endovascular techniques for repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, the prevalence of leakage into excluded aneurysm sacs (endoleaks) as a complication has risen. We will describe and illustrate the imaging findings for endoleaks involving abdominal aortic aneurysms. We will also discuss which types of endoleaks require urgent catheter-based evaluation.

Conclusion

Radiologists should be familiar with the classification scheme for endoleaks and understand which types of endoleaks require urgent catheter-based evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of type 2 endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair [^1176SKSG]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Endovascular repair is a major treatment advance in patients with large infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. Since the FDA approved two commercial devices 2.5 years ago, over 40,000 patients have undergone this procedure in the United States. Although we have learned a great deal, more than a few mysteries relating to the long-term performance of these devices remain. This results in never-ending surveillance protocols searching for graft failure and aneurysm expansion. One of the especially contentious issues is the management of type 2 endoleaks. Unlike other endoleaks that are related to problems with the graft and/or fixation, this type of leak occurs in patients with properly functioning devices. This is why so much controversy exists about whether or not these patients must be treated. Some advocate "watchful-waiting" intervention only when there is aneurysm expansion. Others routinely treat patients with type 2 endoleaks in an attempt to prevent expansion. As with most controversial topics, if you look carefully, there is more agreement than disagreement between the two groups. In this review, we will first describe the methods used for endoleak diagnosis and treatment. We will then review our current endoleak treatment algorithm and explain its rationale for use.

### The impact of completion and follow-up endoleaks on survival, reintervention, and rupture [^1155AeWU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Endoleaks may be seen at case completion of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), and the presence of an endoleak may impact outcomes. However, the clinical implications of various endoleaks seen during follow-up is not well-described. Therefore, we studied the impact of endoleaks at completion and at follow-up on mid-term outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed patients who underwent EVAR from 2003 to 2016 within the Vascular Quality Initiative-Medicare database and identified patients with endoleak at procedure completion and during follow-up, excluding those presenting with rupture. We stratified cohorts by presence of completion and follow-up endoleak subtypes. The primary outcome was 5-year survival, and secondary outcomes included 5-year freedom from reintervention and freedom from rupture. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests to analyze differences in time-to-event endpoints.

Results

Of 21,745 patients with completion endoleak data, 5085 (23%) had an endoleak. Compared with those without endoleak, those with type I endoleaks had lower 5-year survival (69% vs 75%; P < .001), type II endoleaks had higher survival (79%; P < .001), and types III, IV, and indeterminate were not statistically different (73%, 73%, and 75%, respectively). Freedom from reintervention for types I and III endoleaks were significantly lower than no endoleak cohort (I: 76%; P < .001; III: 72%; P < .001 vs 83%), but freedom from rupture was higher for those with type II and III endoleak (95% and 97% vs 94%; P < .001). Of 14,479 patients with detailed follow-up endoleak data, 2290 (16%) had an endoleak. Compared with those without endoleak, types I and III had significantly lower 5-year survival (I: 80%; p = 0.002; III: 66%; P < .001 vs 84%), but there were no differences for types II (82%) and indeterminate (77%). Those with any type of follow-up endoleak had lower 5-year freedom from reintervention (I: 70%; P < .001; II: 76%; p = 0.006; III: 36%; P < .001; indeterminate: 60%; p = 0.007 vs 84%), and lower freedom from rupture (I: 92%; P < .001; II: 91%; p = 0.16; III: 88%; p = 0.01; indeterminate: 90%; p = 0.11 vs 94%).

Conclusions

Compared with patients with no endoleak, those with type I completion endoleaks have lower 5-year survival and freedom from reintervention. Patients with types I and III follow-up endoleaks also have lower survival, and any endoleak at follow-up is associated with lower freedom from reintervention and freedom from rupture. These data highlight the importance of careful patient selection and close postoperative follow-up after EVAR, as the presence of endoleaks, specifically type I and III, over time portends worse outcomes.

Type III and type IV endoleaks — definitions and initial management are described as follows: A type III endoleak occurs when there is incomplete seal between components or component separation and less frequently is due to fabric erosion, and all type III endoleaks should be treated; when present at the contralateral gate or between an iliac limb and an iliac extension, treatment entails bridging the gap with an appropriately sized limb. A type IV endoleak is due to fabric porosity and all type IV endoleaks seal spontaneously and do not require treatment.

### Surveillance for endoleaks: how to detect all of them [^114tRLMz]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Endovascular aneurysm repair has proven to be a valuable alternative to open repair in selected patients. This less invasive procedure, however, requires long-term surveillance for its own set of potential complications, including perigraft leakage, or endoleak. This article focuses on the detection of these leaks, first defining and classifying endoleaks and then describing various means of detecting them, including computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, color-flow duplex ultrasonography, and conventional angiography.

Classification of endoleaks

Endoleaks are classified into five types (I–V). Type I occurs due to incomplete proximal (Ia) or distal (Ib) seal. This could be due to either inappropriate device selection, incorrect graft deployment, or disease progression. Type Ia may also appear when chimneys are used and are known as "gutter endoleaks". Type II occurs due to sac centripetal reperfusion via side branches (lumbar arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, accessory renal arteries) with inverted flow. Type III is a result of dislodgement of the various graft components. Type IV occurs due to increased porosity of the graft material. Type V (also known as "endotension") is the type of endoleak that cannot be classified in any of the other categories.

### CIRSE standards of practice on management of endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair [^1129Tzd2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An endoleak (EL) is defined as persistent blood flow in the aneurysm sac outside the stent graft after aortic endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). They represent the most common complication after EVAR with an incidence of 10–50%. Some types are associated with ongoing risk of aneurysm rupture, necessitating long-term surveillance and secondary interventions.

ELs may be classified into primary (present at the time of repair or within 30 days of EVAR) or secondary (occurring after previous negative imaging or beyond 30 days). There are five types of EL based on their anatomical site and aetiology (Table 1). Management depends on EL type and the associated risk of sac rupture.

Table 1
Summary of endoleak type and reported incidence

The EUROSTAR registry demonstrated that type I and III ELs increase the risk of aneurysm rupture (Table 2) and subsequent studies have identified type I and III ELs to most commonly associated with late rupture, responsible for over 60% of sac ruptures (Table 3). Furthermore, a review of EVAR 1 and 2 trial data showed type II EL with sac expansion to be a risk factor for late aneurysm rupture.

Therefore, early detection and correct classification of ELs is vital to plan optimal management. Once detected, ELs that require treatment are managed predominantly with endovascular techniques.

### Are type II endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair endograft dependent? [^113XKi1z]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most clinical end points after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are endograft-specific, but type II endoleaks have been assumed to be an unavoidable consequence of the repair method and independent of the type of endograft used. Some recent data have suggested that the rate of type II endoleaks may also be graft-dependent. We reviewed a large clinical experience with six endografts to determine the behavior of type II endoleaks and whether they are graft-specific.

Methods

All elective EVAR cases from five university institutions from 1996 to 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. Endografts used in < 50 patients were excluded. Endoleaks were diagnosed and classified from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans by the treating surgeons. Results of angiography and interventions for endoleaks were tracked. The rate of type II endoleaks was compared among endografts at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

Results

During the study period, 1909 patients underwent elective EVAR and had an adequate imaging follow-up at one of the specified time points. At 1 month, the overall rate of type II endoleak was 14.0% (range, 9.8% to 25.2%.) The Excluder had a significantly higher incidence of type II endoleaks at 1 month but was similar to most other grafts during longer follow-up. At 6 months, the overall rate of type II endoleak was 16.3% (range, 8.3% to 16.8%). The Talent and Lifepath had an apparent lower initial rate of type II leaks, but this was only significant for the Talent at 6 months compared with Excluder, Zenith, and Ancure, and at 1 year compared with Excluder and Zenith. No graft had a long-term statistically significant difference in the rate of type II endoleak formation. Intervention rates varied by institution and graft type but in general were quite low. Of 25 successful interventions (Ancure, 12; AneuRx, 8; Excluder, 2; Lifepath, 2; Zenith, 1; Talent, 0), 21 were performed during the first year. Interim spontaneous resolution, defined as a negative CT scan after a CT positive for endoleak, was high, especially in the first year. Resolution of type II endoleaks occurred in 54 (33%) of 164 between 1 and 6 months, in 37 (33%) of 112 between 6 and 12 months, in 20 (35%) of 57 from 12 to 24 months, and in 5 (20%) of 25 between 24 and 36 months. The various grafts had a nearly identical pattern, but the rates were highest for the Talent. Late appearing endoleaks, defined as a positive CT after a negative CT, were frequent. At 6 months, 44 (30%) of 147 type II endoleaks were newly diagnosed. The rates were 37 (35%) of 107 at 12 months, 15 (27%) of 56 at 2 years and 5 (25%) of 20 at 3 years. No conversions to open repair for type II endoleaks were noted in the first 4 years. The thrombus burden could not be determined in this analysis.

Conclusions

Type II endoleaks occur in nearly 15% of patients treated by EVAR. The early incidence varies only slightly with graft type. The long-term prevalence and clinical significance are masked by different treatment patterns, spontaneous resolution, newly evident endoleaks, and aneurysm size at initial treatment.

Importance

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the dominant treatment strategy for abdominal aortic aneurysms, encompassing 80% of all repairs in the United States. Endoleaks are ubiquitous and affect 30% of patients treated by EVAR, potentially leading to sac enlargement and increased risk of rupture. The care of EVAR patients requires long-term surveillance by a multidisciplinary team. Accordingly, physicians should be familiar with the fundamentals of endoleak management to achieve optimal outcomes, including timely referral for remediation or providing counseling and reassurance when needed.

Observations

PubMed and the Cochrane database were searched for articles published between January 2002 and December 2022 in English, addressing epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of endoleaks after EVAR. Endoleaks can be detected intraoperatively or years later, making lifelong surveillance mandatory. Type I and III have the highest risk of rupture (7.5% at 2 years and 8.9% at 1 year, respectively) and should be treated when identified. Intervention should be considered for other types of endoleak when associated with aneurysm sac growth larger than 5 mm based on current guidelines. Type II endoleaks are the most common, accounting for 50% of all endoleaks. Up to 90% of type II endoleaks resolve spontaneously or are not associated with sac enlargement, requiring only observation. Although the risk of rupture is less than 1%, cases that require reintervention are challenging. Recurrence is common despite endovascular treatment, and rupture can occur without evidence of sac growth. Type IV endoleaks and endotension are uncommon, are typically benign, and primarily should be observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Endoleak management depends on the type and presence of sac expansion. Type I and III endoleaks require intervention. Type II endoleaks should be observed and treated selectively in patients with significant sac expansion. Since endoleaks can appear any time after EVAR, at least 1 contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiogram or duplex ultrasound by an experienced laboratory is recommended every 5 years.

Endoleak after EVAR — type-specific frequency and management: Type IA endoleak is noted in 6% of procedures at implantation; initial management is angioplasty with a compliant balloon followed by extension cuff placement, and conversion to open repair is not recommended unless rupture or significant, uncorrectable device maldeployment is noted. Type IB endoleak is treated initially by repeated balloon angioplasty and, as needed, by graft extension. A type II endoleak is not treated at the time of implantation and is observed in 10% to 20% of patients at 1-month follow-up on CT imaging. A type III endoleak is treated by angioplasty of component overlap sites or by placement of an additional conduit. A type IV endoleak is self-limited, and treatment is not required.

### Aneurysm morphology as a predictor of endoleak following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair: do smaller aneurysm have better outcomes? [^112j5ctE]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Since the Food and Drug Administrations' approval of endovascular devices for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, clinicians have been relaxing the strict inclusion criteria present during the clinical trials. Although the long-term natural history of endoleaks remains unclear, attachment site leaks (type I) are believed to represent an ongoing risk for future rupture. We reviewed our experience with endovascular AAA repair to elucidate factors that predispose toward the development of endoleaks and found that larger AAAs are significantly more likely to have a short proximal neck and severe proximal angulation. These factors likely contribute to the significantly increased rate of type I endoleaks that occurred after endovascular repair of large AAAs. Small AAAs (< 5) had the lowest rate of endoleaks overall (8.3%) and of type I endoleaks in particular (0%). We conclude that AAA size and morphology can be used to predict which aneurysms will experience attachment site endoleaks in their course; AAAs from 4.5 to 5 cm in diameter may be particularly well suited for endovascular repair in this regard.

### Endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1154Ci16]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms shows promising initial results. Endoleaks represent one of the unique causes of endovascular repair failure not seen with traditional abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Endoleaks occur when there is blood flow outside the stent-graft lumen but within the aneurysm sac. They can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and their management is a source of continued controversy. This review further defines endoleaks and the clinical challenges that they create. Current methods for endoleak detection, classification, and management are reviewed.

INTRODUCTION

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a well-established method for thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and currently, 28%–79% of all aneurysms worldwide are repaired with an endovascular approach, with the United States having the highest application of endovascular technology. Despite the rapid advances in endovascular therapy and numerous benefits, this approach is not without complications. The complication of endoleaks, defined as persistent flow into the aneurysm sac, remains of concern at the time of initial repair and beyond.

Endoleaks were first categorized in 1997 by White et al into four major categories, with a fifth type defined roughly a decade later. Type 3 endoleaks (T3EL) were defined as persistent flow into the aneurysm sac through graft components and were then subcategorized in 1998 as either modular disconnections (3a) or graft fabric disruptions (3b). T3ELs have historically been difficult to study, and although their presence and resulting complications can be devastating, the breadth of their clinical impact is yet unknown.

Of the endoleak categories, T3ELs are the least frequent and consequently the least well understood. This is especially true given that their rate of occurrence, implications and morphology are very device specific. Due to their relative rarity, initial knowledge of T3EL was derived from case reports. In the early 2000s, as endovascular aortic therapy burgeoned, large-scale studies such as Endovascular vs Open Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (EVAR1) and EUROpean collaborators on Stent-graft Techniques for Abdominal aortic aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) began to reliably report T3EL incidence rates between 3.0% and 4.5%. Since then, the landscape of endovascular aortic repair has changed dramatically, but there have been few new large-scale trials describing current rates of T3EL or attempting to catalogue their resulting complications.

Just as the treatment strategy underlying EVAR is entirely different from that of open AAA repair, the modes of failure also are entirely different. Because the AAA is left intact after EVAR, the patient remains at risk of AAA rupture should flow to the aortic aneurysm sac persist. This phenomenon of persistent flow into an aortic aneurysm sac, despite stent graft placement, is called an endoleak. Endoleaks have been categorized into 4 subgroups on the basis of the location of their inflow into the aortic aneurysm sac (Figure 2). A type I endoleak is caused by persistent flow into the aneurysm sac through either the proximal or the distal endograft attachment site as a result of failure to achieve a complete seal between the endograft and the aortic or iliac artery wall. A type II endoleak is caused by retrograde flow into the aneurysm sac, usually from either a lumbar artery or the inferior mesenteric artery. A type III endoleak is caused by flow into the aneurysm sac that is due to an inadequate overlap at a junction of modular graft components or to a defect in the graft fabric. A type IV endoleak is caused by blood flow through the pores in the fabric of the stent graft into the aneurysm sac.

Three large, prospective, randomized controlled trials have compared outcomes after elective open AAA repair to those after EVAR (Table 1). – In general, the findings across all 3 studies have been concordant.

### Late-onset type II endoleaks and the incidence of secondary intervention [^112XojcJ]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Type II endoleaks are a recognized complication of endoluminal treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. In order to better understand the natural history of type II endoleaks and their influence on secondary procedures, we examined our experience with patients who developed isolated type II endoleaks 6 months or more after their original procedure. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent endoluminal repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms with bifurcated endoluminal devices at a single institution from June 1996 to June 2000. Endoleak surveillance was performed on all patients by using a defined CT angiogram protocol. Patients with definitive and isolated type II endoleaks on CT angiogram were identified. Patients with indeterminate endoleaks or a combination of different types of endoleaks were excluded. Data were analyzed on the basis of early (< 6 months) or late occurrence of isolated type II endoleak. Fifty patients were identified with isolated type II endoleaks. Of these patients, 20 (40%) had endoleaks discovered before the 6-month follow-up interval whereas the majority (60%) had new type II leaks discovered at least 6 months after their initial procedure. The timing of endoleak occurrence did not significantly influence the rate of spontaneous endoleak resolution between the early- (< 6 months) and late-onset (> 6 months) groups, which was nearly identical (40% vs. 43%). Ten patients in the early group and seven of the late-onset group required secondary intervention for treatment of type II endoleak (50% vs. 23%; NS). Three patients in the early group underwent surgical conversion (vs. 0 patients in the late-onset group). The mortality rate was not significantly different between groups (15% vs. 7%). Most isolated type II endoleaks in this patient population occurred 6 months or more after initial endoluminal repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Timing of type II endoleak occurrence did not significantly affect the rates of spontaneous resolution or mortality. Although differences were observed in the number of patients receiving secondary interventions, these findings did not reach statistical difference. All patients who required surgical conversion had early type II endoleaks. There were no observed ruptures in patients with increased aneurysm size treated with secondary intervention or those with stable aneurysm volumes who were followed without intervention. The continued development of type II endoleaks beyond the perioperative period supports the need for continued endoleak surveillance.

Incidence

It is not easy to define the precise incidence of endoleaks from the existing data in the literature. The evidence-based practice centre of the Mayo Clinic has published in 2017 a systematic review and meta-regression analysis evaluating surveillance outcomes after EVAR for AAA including 6 meta-analyses and 52 observational studies. The authors confirmed that an endoleak incidence rate is subject to the type of imaging modality used for their detection and reported that a combined approach of DUS, non-contrast-enhanced CT, and MRI offered the highest endoleak detection rate at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months of 35%, 46%, 51%, and 92%, respectively. At 60 months, the highest detection rate (91%) was observed using a combined approach of DUS, CTA, and MRI. However, most of the centres adopt the use of CTA with delayed images as the "gold standard" as it is the most cost-effective single modality for endoleak detection.

Operator experience and appropriate sizing decreased the incidence of type I (both a and b) endoleaks with the use of conventional devices over the years. However, the incidence of type Ia is still high when chimneys are used, reaching sometimes even 30%. Type II endoleaks remain stable over the years in terms of incidence and have been reported around 10% for emergency EVARs and around 20% after elective repairs. Types III–V endoleaks have been reported with lower incidence, in the region of 1–3%.

### Secondary Endoleak Management Following TEVAR and EVAR [^115ZmqSp]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of Secondary Endoleaks — TEVAR

Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) affect 10.4 in 100,000 people per year, with an estimated incidence of rupture and dissection at 3.5 per 100,000 per year, with a high (90%) mortality rate in cases of acute rupture The aim of TEVAR is to reduce these risks and many studies have confirmed favourable long-term outcomes after endovascular repair. Overall, all types of endoleaks after TEVAR range occur in 9.5 to 15.8% of procedures, and there are limited data regarding the incidence of secondary vs primary endoleaks. Below we provide an overview of the management of endoleaks following TEVAR for aneurysms and do not address those performed for aortic dissections.
- Type 1a Endoleaks

Type 1 endoleak occurs in 3 to 16% of cases. The treatment options are mostly endovascular with a low rate to open conversion of 3.6%. Secondary proximal type 1 endoleaks are due to an ongoing poor seal at the proximal attachment site, dilatation of the proximal attachment site or distal endograft migration. Management of secondary EL1a is primarily by extension proximally of endograft coverage by additional endografts to achieve a seal. There are a few reports of the use of EndoAnchors to treat proximal type 1 endoleaks. However, in general, proximal endograft coverage is the optimal treatment method. If the proximal landing zone is close to or involves the aortic arch arteries, efforts should be made to preserve flow into these arteries by surgical debranching, fenestrations, branches or chimneys. A comprehensive discussion of these advanced techniques is provided in the article entitled "Various endoluminal approaches available for treating pathologies of the aortic arch".

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1152zxNN]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Type I endoleak management after EVAR — A type I endoleak occurs when there is an incomplete seal at the proximal aortic attachment site or at the distal iliac attachment site; a type IA endoleak most often occurs in the presence of a short or severely angulated neck or a reverse tapered neck or when the attachment site contains considerable thrombus or calcification, and a type I endoleak is associated with elevated sac pressure and an ongoing risk of rupture. Whereas a small endoleak may seal and can be observed, it is preferable that when a type I endoleak is identified at the time of repair, every attempt should be made to treat it before the conclusion of the procedure; options include balloon molding of the proximal seal zone, placement of a proximal cuff, and endostaples, which have been used with varying degrees of success, and endostaples may reduce the risk of endograft migration and a type IA endoleak, but long-term data are limited. Other options for type IA endoleak treatment include embolization with coils or glue, proximal extension with a chimney approach, and conversion to a fenestrated endograft. A type IB endoleak is treated with distal extension of the iliac limb if repeated angioplasty fails to eliminate the endoleak; it may be necessary to extend the endograft to the external iliac artery with coil occlusion of the HA, and conversion to open repair should be considered in the presence of a persistent type IA endoleak.

### Outcomes of endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms: a nationwide survey in Japan [^115zAayF]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Our data also support the immediate treatment of type 1 and 3 endoleaks, as these were strongly associated with overall survival. In addition, all persistent endoleaks were risk factors for adverse events, sac dilatation, and reintervention. A previous report revealed that any type of endoleak (types were not divided) was associated with sac enlargement. Type 2 endoleaks are believed to be a sign of initial success, reflecting intraoperative aneurysm exclusion and sac pressure decompression, and reintervention for type 2 endoleaks remains controversial. However, the present results might indicate the importance of observing all types of persistent endoleaks closely.

Each surgeon determined the timing of reintervention and the causes for reintervention were not evaluated, as the reintervention details were described in a free-comment item. Although we cannot provide data regarding when to intervene, a sac dilatation ≥ 5 mm is a strong indicator for intervention. As endoleaks, especially type 2, have been reported to cause sac dilataion, we are interested in the relationship between type 2 endoleaks and the sac dilatation rate. Thus, we performed an exploratory analysis, comparing patients who were positive for type 2 endoleak with those who were negative; the Kaplan–Meier curves of the "sac dilatation ratio" are shown in Fig. 2. Given the observed group differences, surgeons should recognize the potential risk of a type 2 endoleak at discharge, and inform the patients of the possibility of an increased dilatation rate. However, other endoleak types must be analyzed in more detail in future studies to exclude confounding biases.

### The incidence and fate of endoleaks vary between ruptured and elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair [^112FdgB2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The number of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (r-AAA) patients who are treated by endovascular means is increasing as ruptured endovascular aneurysm repair (r-EVAR) enters the mainstream. However, even today, data on the incidence and behavior of endoleaks after r-EVAR are scarce. This study analyzed whether endoleaks behave differently after EVAR for rupture vs elective AAA repair.

Methods

From 2002 to 2013, there were 2052 patients who underwent EVAR for treatment of rupture (n = 166 [8.1%]) and elective repair (n = 1886 [91.9%]) of infrarenal AAA. Follow-up included computed tomography angiography at 1 month, at 6 months, and yearly thereafter. All type I and type III endoleaks were treated at the time of or shortly after the diagnosis. Persistent type II endoleaks at > 6 months after EVAR without a decrease in AAA sac underwent translumbar or transfemoral embolization procedures. Data were prospectively collected in a vascular database.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 30 months, patients had a significantly lower incidence of type II endoleaks after r-EVAR compared with elective endovascular aneurysm repair (e-EVAR; n = 15 [9.0%] vs n = 380 [20.2%]; P < .01). Although the incidence of type I endoleaks is similar after r-EVAR (n = 9 [5.4%] and e-EVAR (n = 83 [4.4%]; p = 0.68), the r-EVAR patients required stent graft explantation more frequently (n = 9 [5.4%] vs n = 20 [1.1%]; P < .01). Whereas the need for secondary intervention was comparable in both r-EVAR (n = 33 [19.9%]) and e-EVAR (n = 439 [23.3%]; p = 0.37) groups, patients undergoing percutaneous embolization procedures trended toward significance between the two groups (n = 11 [6.6%] vs n = 216 [11.5%]; p = 0.06) with endoleaks.

Conclusions

Compared with e-EVAR, patients who undergo r-EVAR experience a similar incidence of type I endoleaks and a significantly lower incidence of type II endoleaks. The endoleaks in both e-EVAR and r-EVAR patients can frequently be managed by endovascular means. However, r-EVAR patients with type I and type II endoleaks are at a significantly higher risk for stent graft explantation.

Type V endoleaks

Type V endoleaks are a result of "endotension". With this term is defined the aneurysm sac growth without any detectable endoleak and is a result of increased pressure within the aneurysm sac (Fig. 6). This may be due to such slow blood flow that it is below the sensitivity limits for detection on current imaging methods. This kind of endoleak seems to be more common with expanded poly-tetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) fabric grafts rather than polyester covered ones. New-generation ePTFE grafts include a second layer of low permeability ePTFE to decrease this risk. No studies have shown an increased risk of aneurysm rupture among patients with endotension. However, the current view regarding type V management is that when sac growth of more than > 8 mm occurs, then some form of re-intervention is required. Nevertheless, further studies are required to demystify this phenomenon and condition and delineate the appropriate management.

Types III, IV, and V endoleaks

Type III

Chaikof et al. classified first type III endoleaks in 2002 in "Reporting standards for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair". They may occur either due to disconnection of components of the modular endograft system (IIIa) or a defect in the stent-covering graft fabric (IIIb). Type III b endoleaks are further stratified with respect to the extent of fabric disruption as major (> 2 mm) or minor (< 2 mm). Incidence of type III endoleaks has been reported from 1 to 11%. Also based on the complexity of the anatomy, type IIIa endoleak could be classified as simple and complex. Improper seal, inadequate overlap of modular components, and distal component migration are considered as simple type III endoleaks, whereas major component dislocation including total mal-alignment results in complex type IIIa endoleaks. With the advent of more complex fenestrated EVAR and TEVAR procedures, the total number of junctions in endografts has increased with the possibility of a corresponding increase in the incidence of type III endoleaks. Type III endoleaks arising from side branches are a special concern after fenestrated endografting, with reported rates of 0 to 6.8%.

Treatment consists in either realigning the dislodged stent graft parts or advancing another covered stent in the dislodged branches/ fenestrations in the b-EVAR/ f-EVAR case.

Type IV

In patients who underwent EVAR repair, type IV endoleaks are very rare. Espinosa et al. reported a prevalence of this type of endoleak as 0.3%. Forbes et al. reported the conservative treatment as sufficient, in the case of type IV endoleak. Furthermore, in longer follow-up observation, a type IV endoleak was not the cause of the aneurysm re-supply in open surgery and some clinicians think that type IV endoleaks should be classified as a type V endoleak.

Type IV endoleaks are even more rare with the new-generation stent grafts. In such cases, usually, the best management is surgical conversion with graft explantation.

### Serious failure modes after EVAR are device specific [^1143QYui]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Type I and III endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can lead to catastrophic events that require major re-interventions. We reviewed our experience with aortic endograft re-interventions for type I and III endoleaks and other serious failures among different devices.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients with a prior EVAR who underwent open conversion (OC) or major endovascular intervention (MEI) (re-lining, cuff/limb extension, parallel graft) for type I/III endoleaks at our institution from 2002 to 2019. Baseline characteristics, procedural details, re-interventions, and outcomes were collected.

Results

A total of 229 patients (194 men) underwent re-interventions for type I and III endoleaks after EVAR (90 OC, 139 MEI) for devices implanted between 1997 and 2019. Average age at re-intervention was 78 ± 8.5 years. A total of 135 (59%) were implanted at our institution, whereas 93 (41%) were referred. Median time to re-intervention was 4 years with 25% to 75% interquartile range (IQR) of 2.2–6.6 years. There was no significant difference in baseline demographics or type of re-interventions (OC/MEI) between device types. 42/229 (18%) presented with ruptured aneurysms, 20/229 (9%) were symptomatic, whereas the rest presented with asymptomatic radiographic findings. Type 1A endoleak was present in 146/229 (63.8%-72 with proximal migration), type IB in 46/229 (20.1%), type IIIA in 37/229 (16.6%), type IIIB in 15/229 (6.5%), and persistent aneurysm sac growth with no radiographic evidence of an endoleak in 6/229 (2.6%). Devices included most commercial products: AFX, Excluder, AneuRx, Ancure, Endurant, and Zenith. A smaller number of investigational devices accounted for the rest. Type 1A endoleak was the most common indication for re-intervention among all devices except for AFX and ancure devices, proximal migration was a frequent presentation with AneuRx. AFX devices more frequently presented with a type III and ancure devices more frequently presented with a type IB endoleak.

Conclusions

Serious failure modes after EVAR differ between endografts and occur throughout the follow-up period. This is important to guide targeted interrogation of surveillance studies and follow-up schedules, even for discontinued devices, as well as comparisons between various series and estimation of EVAR failure rates.

Clinical Impact

Surveillance after EVAR is critical for long term success of the repair, understanding of the differential modes of failure of every graft available is important in the longitudinal evaluation of these endografts. Equally important is the understanding of the modes of failure of legacy endografts that are no longer on the market but still being followed, in order to be able to tailor a surveillance regiemn and the evntual repair if needed.

### Secondary Endoleak Management Following TEVAR and EVAR [^114R4Mgx]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and (TEVAR) have become the mainstay of therapy of many pathologies of the abdominal and thoracic aorta. Moreover, the development of complex endograft technologies such as fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR), branched EVAR (BEVAR) and parallel grafts enables increasingly challenging anatomy to be treated. However, despite the increased number of procedures and diversity of techniques, the management of endoleaks remains a challenge for aortic specialists. Endoleaks (EL) may compromise long-term endograft viability and some are associated with an increased risk of rupture, thereby necessitating long-term surveillance and secondary interventions. Thus, early detection and classification of endoleaks is crucial for optimal management planning. Endoleaks may be classified as primary or secondary endoleaks. Primary endoleaks appear within 30 days post-procedure and secondary (or late) endoleaks are detected more than 30 days after the procedure and after previous negative imaging. Endoleaks are also classified on the basis of their anatomic site and aetiology and are subdivided into five types (Table 1). Type 1 endoleak (EL1) is caused by inadequate apposition of the endograft to the vessel wall (attachment site) and is subclassified as EL 1a for proximal endoleak, EL 1b for distal attachment site endoleak and EL Ic for lack of seal by an iliac occlude plug in aorto-uni-iliac repair with a crossover graft; type 2 endoleak (EL2) involves perfusion of the aneurysm sac from collateral vessels; type 3 endoleak (EL3) describes stent graft component separation or endoleak due to a fabric tear; type 4 endoleak (EL4) represents an endoleak due to porosity of the graft; and type 5 endoleak (EL5), also known as endotension, is present when there is expansion of the sac without an apparent endoleak on imaging. With developments in endograft fabric technology, type 4 endoleaks are of historical value and will not be further described. A wide range of treatment options exist including transarterial embolisation, percutaneous direct sac puncture embolisation, transcaval embolisation, surgical and conservative management. The criteria for best management should be tailored to each individual patient after careful planning and multidisciplinary team discussion.

### Classification of gutter type in parallel stenting during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair [^112gicAV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Gutters can be described as the loss of continuous apposition between the main body of the endograft, the chimney stent graft, and the aortic wall. Gutters have been associated with increased risk of type IA endoleaks and are considered to be the Achilles' heel of chimney endovascular aneurysm repair (ch-EVAR). However, there is no classification yet to classify and quantify gutter types after ch-EVAR.

Methods

Different gutter types can be distinguished by their morphologic appearance in two- and three-dimensional views and reconstructed slices perpendicular to the center lumen line.

Results

Three main categories are defined by (1) the most proximal beginning of the gutter, (2) the length of gutter alongside the endograft, and (3) its distal end. Type A gutters originate at the proximal fabric of an endograft, type B gutters originate as loss of apposition of the chimney stent graft in the branch vessel, and type C gutters start below the fabric of the endograft. To determine eventual changes of gutter size during follow-up computed tomography angiograms (CTAs), measurements may be performed with dedicated software on the follow-up CTA scan to assess the extent of gutters over the aortic circumference, ranging from 0° to 360° of freedom, together with the maximum gap between the endograft material and the aortic wall as it appears on reconstructed axial CTA scan slices.

Conclusions

The proposed gutter classification enables a uniform nomenclature in the current ch-EVAR literature and a more accurate risk assessment of gutter-associated endoleaks. Moreover, it allows monitoring of eventual progression of gutter size during follow-up.

### Complicated embolisation of late endoleak via direct sac puncture: not all endoleaks are a type II endoleak [^112eG2Gb]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endoleaks after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) occur frequently with type 2 being the most common (Mustafa et al.). The majority are detected during routine follow-up with either computed tomography angiography (CTA), Duplex or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). The typical distribution of contrast on CTA is usually enough to diagnose what type of endoleak is present. The majority of endoleaks detected are type 2 and these only require an intervention if there is aneurysmal sac expansion. Embolisation can be performed via trans-arterial approach or direct aneurysmal puncture, either transcaval or percutaneous. Trans-arterial approach has reported failure rates as high as 80% and transcaval failure rates vary from 30 to 50%, though this is a relatively new technique with limited publications available (Salvatore et al.). Type 3 endoleak has an estimated incidence of 0.9–3% (Chaikof et al.). It can be further subdivided into type 3a, where there is a modular disruption of the stent graft or component disconnection, or type 3b which is a fabric tear or disintegration of the stent graft (Chang et al.). Type 3 endoleaks, along with type 1 endoleaks, have shown to be the most common cause of rupture and late conversion to open repair post EVAR (Harris et al.). Treatment of type 3 endoleaks differs from type 2 and either involves relining of the stent graft or conversion to open repair. We present a patient who underwent an embolisation via percutaneous direct aneurysmal sac puncture of what was initially thought to be a type II endoleak. During the procedure it however became apparent that it actually was a type 3b endoleak and non-target embolisation occurred.

Type I Endoleak

Definition

Type I EL is defined as a leak at the attachment site of a stent graft, and a manifestation of sealing failure. Type I ELs are further classified into type IA, IB, and IC depending on the occurrence at the proximal or distal ends of the endograft, or iliac occluder, respectively. Type I EL has been reported to occur in as many as 10% of EVAR cases and appear to increase with time from less than 5% incidence on surveillance imaging at 30 days to 6.8% incidence at 12 months.

Type IA EL is associated with adverse proximal neck anatomy pre-EVAR, including short (> 15 mm), angulated (> 60°), large diameter (> 32 mm), conical or tapered necks or those with calcification or thrombus. Patients with hostile neck anatomy often require adjunctive procedures to achieve an adequate proximal seal and are associated with a four-fold increased risk of developing type IA EL. The use of EVAR in challenging necks outside the device instructions for use (IFU) is associated with a higher incidence of type IA EL, which may contribute to delayed rupture and poor outcomes. In view of this, such practice is discouraged.

Type IB EL is associated with large diameter common iliac arteries > 14 mm, short iliac sealing zones and iliac artery tortuosity. Around 50% occur within 6 months after EVAR and iliac artery expansion at the landing zones in the early postoperative months may result in a loss of seal.

Indication for Treatment

Type I EL is associated with elevated sac pressure and an ongoing risk of aneurysm expansion and rupture. It is the leading cause of late aneurysm rupture in up to 52% of cases and should be treated promptly upon detection.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111PYPxF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Type II endoleak management after EVAR — Persistent filling of the aneurysm sac from patent lumbar arteries or the IMA constitutes a type II endoleak, which is the most common endoleak and may be present at the time of repair in up to one-fourth of patients. When a type II endoleak is identified at the time of the procedure, treatment is not indicated as at least 50% will spontaneously resolve, and the incidence of type II endoleak at 6 months is 10% to 15%. For persistent type II endoleaks, aneurysm sac size may decrease in up to 25%, remain stable in 50% to 70%, or increase in up to 25% of patients; delayed onset may occur 6 months or later after EVAR, and expansion in sac diameter > 10 mm is uncommon. Factors that increase the risk of a persistent type II endoleak include a patent IMA, number and diameter of patent lumbar arteries (especially L3 and L4 lumbar arteries), and ongoing anticoagulation. Treatment options include embolization of the IMA or lumbar arteries with coils or glue, direct translumbar injection of the aneurysm sac, and laparoscopic ligation of the IMA and lumbar arteries, all with variable success rates. Up to 60% of treated aneurysms continue to expand, requiring multiple procedures and sometimes explantation with conversion to open repair; rupture from a type II endoleak is rare and more often related to an unrecognized type I endoleak, and selective intervention appears both safe and cost-effective.

Type II Endoleak

Definition

Type II ELs are caused by retrograde blood flow into the aneurysm sac from aortic or iliac branch arteries, such as lumbar, inferior mesenteric (IMA), accessory renal, median sacral and internal iliac arteries. They are further classified into type IIA EL when only one branch is involved, and type IIB EL when there are two or more branches, usually with a dominant inflow artery and one or more outflow arteries. Type II ELs are the most common EL following EVAR and a major cause for re-intervention. They occur in up to 20–30% of cases. Approximately 50% resolve spontaneously in the first 6 months, 5–10% persist beyond 6 months and new type II ELs develop in 5–10% of patients. Factors that increase the risk of developing type II EL include a patent IMA > 3 mm in diameter, a lumbar artery > 2 mm, an aorto-iliac aneurysm and/or a significant mural thrombus burden.

Indication for Treatment

There is debate regarding the clinical significance of type II EL and the threshold for intervention. Some authors suggest a more conservative approach as the ELs are inherently low-flow and often transient. The risk of aneurysm rupture in the presence of an isolated type II EL has been shown to be less than 1% and type II EL has not been associated with reduced patient survival. Similarly, several studies have found no differences in aneurysm-related mortality or sac expansion between patients who were treated conservatively for type II EL and those who underwent re-intervention.

However, other authors have presented contradictory findings and have demonstrated that some type II ELs may not be benign and are associated with adverse outcomes. For example, type II EL has been shown to be an independent risk factor for sac expansion and persistent type II EL to be associated with a higher incidence of re-intervention, rupture and conversion to open surgery.

The current consensus is to consider intervention in persistent type II ELs when they are associated with significant sac expansion. This is commonly considered to be > 5–10 mm over 12 months. Type II EL with stable sac size should be managed conservatively with regular imaging follow-up as proposed in Fig. 1.

### Risk factors and consequences of persistent type II endoleaks [^111wMTot]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Type II endoleaks are common after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but their clinical significance remains undefined and their management controversial. We determined risk factors for type II endoleaks and associations with adverse outcomes.

Methods

We identified all EVAR patients in the Vascular Study Group of New England abdominal aortic aneurysm database. Patients were subdivided into two groups: (1) those with no endoleak or transient type II endoleak and (2) persistent type II endoleak or new type II endoleak (no endoleak at completion of case). Patients with other endoleak types and follow-up shorter than 6 months were excluded. Multivariable analysis was used to evaluate predictors of persistent or new type II endoleaks. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate predictors of reintervention and survival.

Results

Two thousand three hundred sixty-seven EVAR patients had information on endoleaks: 1977 (84%) were in group 1, of which 79% had no endoleaks at all, and 21% had transient endoleaks that resolved at follow-up. The other 390 (16%) were in group 2, of which 31% had a persistent leak, and 69% had a new leak at follow-up that was not seen at the time of surgery. Group 2 was older (mean age, 75 vs 73 years; P < .001) and less likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 24% vs 34%; P < .001) or elevated creatinine levels (2.6% vs 5.3%; p = 0.027). Coil embolization of one or both hypogastric arteries was associated with a higher rate of persistent type II endoleaks (12 vs 8%; p = 0.024), as was distal graft extension (12% vs 8%; p = 0.008). In multivariable analysis, COPD (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–0.9; p = 0.017) was protective against persistent type II endoleak, while hypogastric artery coil embolization (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0–2.2; p = 0.044), distal graft extension (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3; p = 0.025), and age ≥ 80 (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–5.3; p = 0.004) were predictive. Graft type was also associated with endoleak development. Persistent type II endoleaks were predictive of postdischarge reintervention (OR, 15.3; 95% CI, 9.7–24.3; P < .001); however, they were not predictive of long-term survival (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9–1.6; p = 0.477).

Conclusions

Persistent type II endoleak is associated with hypogastric artery coil embolization, distal graft extension, older age, the absence of COPD, and graft type, but not with aneurysm size. Persistent type II endoleaks are associated with an increased risk of reinterventions, but not rupture or survival. This reinforces the need for continued surveillance of patients with persistent type II endoleaks and the importance of follow-up to detect new type II endoleaks over time.

### An international, multicenter retrospective observational study to assess technical success and clinical outcomes of patients treated with an endovascular aneurysm sealing device for type III endoleak [^116Qtswn]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has surpassed open surgical repair for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), related to its lower morbidity and an early survival benefit. However, effective solutions must be found for late complications after EVAR. Endograft designs have evolvedbut complications continue to occur and warrant long-term follow-up and effective treatment.

Type III endoleak is defined as leakage between different parts of an endograft. This can be either due to modular disconnection (type IIIa) or due to endograft fabric disruption (type IIIb). Once detected, these endoleaks warrant treatment because they lead to increased pressure within the aneurysm sac, which in turn leads to an increased risk of rupture. Maleux et alreported an incidence of type III endoleak of 2.1% within 4 years after EVAR, of which 56% were type IIIa and 44% type IIIb. Endovascular treatment of type IIIa endoleak is generally performed by means of endograft relining, reconnecting the divided components of the endograft. The treatment of type IIIb endoleak is often less straightforward because the graft defect is regularly located in the area of the flow divider. As a consequence, the use of a cuff extension may not seal the tear. Relining with a bifurcated EVAR device is also often not possible because as distance from the renal artery to the flow-splitter of the original graft is often too short to host the length of a new device and its contralateral limb. A custom-made device with an inverted limb is a valid alternative, but not always available and costly. An aorto-uni-iliac device is therefore often used but requires an extra-anatomical femoro-femoral bypass, with its own morbidity. A recurrence of type III endoleak has been reported in up to 25% of patients after relining. Alternatively, open surgical conversion remains an option.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that the most likely mechanisms of persistent intra-sac high pressure are two: the endoleak occur but it is not identified (probably a type I or low-flow type II) or pressure is transmitted through thrombus in the case of short and wide occluded channels between the arterial lumen and the excluded aneurysm sac (at the attachment sites of the endograft or through side branches orifices).

On the other hand, type IV endoleak related to fabric porosity would be unlikely with current devices. In the event of this issue, detection by means of the available imaging methods would be unlikely as well.

In our opinion, the used terminology is rather confusing. Given the evidence of existing studies, it would need to be updated. Any of the cited mechanisms in the preceding paragraph may be the origin of a SEWEL (Sac Expansion Without Evident Leak). A detailed analysis of each individual case will allow guidance of the investigation towards any of them.

### Clinical significance of type II endoleak after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1176ZLDr]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Type II endoleaks after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) are a result of retrograde flow from arterial branches (e.g., lumbar and inferior mesenteric) refilling the aneurysm sac, which has been excluded by the stent graft. Controversy continues with regard to the clinical significance and treatment of type II endoleaks. To develop recommendations for management, we analyzed outcome data from 10 EVAR trials completed over the last 5 years involving a total of 2,617 cases. The incidence of type II endoleak at discharge or 30 days was 6–17%, at 6 months 4.5–8%, and at 1 year 1–5%. Successful resolution of endoleak following secondary interventions was observed in 11–100% of cases. There were 10 conversions to open repair and no ruptures related to type II endoleak. In patients observed for 12 months with computed tomography and/or ultrasound, approximately one-half of type II endoleaks disappeared spontaneously. In the absence of a type I endoleak, our analysis of the current literature suggests that intervention for type II endoleak should be undertaken for abdominal aortic aneurysm sac enlargement occurring after 6 months, persistence for > 12 months without abdominal aortic aneurysm sac enlargement, or an aneurysm sac pressure > 20% of systolic blood pressure; translumbar aneurysm sac thrombosis and intra-arterial feeding vessel occlusion appear to be prudent management options.

### Detection of endoleaks following thoracic and abdominal aortic endovascular aortic repair-: a comparison of standard and dynamic 4D-computed tomography angiography [^114yE6Sp]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Endoleaks are a common complication after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). The detection and correct classification of endoleaks is essential for the further treatment of affected patients. However, standard computed tomography angiography (CTA) provides no hemodynamic information on endoleaks, which can result in misclassification in complex cases. The aim of this study was to compare standard CTA (sCTA) with dynamic, dual-energy CTA (dCTA) for detection and classification of endoleaks following EVAR or TEVAR.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective evaluation compared 69 sCTA diagnostic examinations performed on 50 different patients with 89 dCTA diagnostic examinations performed on 69 different patients.

Results

In total, 15.9% of sCTA examinations and 49.4% of dCTA examinations led to the detection of endoleaks. With sCTA, 20.0% of patients were diagnosed with endoleaks, while with dCTA, 37.7% of patients were diagnosed with endoleaks. With sCTA, mainly Type 1 endoleaks were detected, whereas, with dCTA, the types of detected endoleaks were more evenly distributed. In comparison with the literature, the frequencies of endoleak types detected with dCTA better reflect the natural distribution than the frequencies detected with standard CTA.

Conclusion

Based on the retrospective comparative evaluation, dCTA could pose a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool resulting in a more accurate and realistic detection and classification of suspected endoleaks.

### Type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair [^1137jfzb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim was to assess the risk of rupture, and determine the benefits of intervention for the treatment of type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).

Methods

This systematic review was done according to PRISMA guidelines. Outcome data included incidence, spontaneous resolution, sac expansion, interventions, clinical success, and complications including conversion to open repair, and rupture.

Results

Thirty-two non-randomized retrospective studies were included, totalling 21 744 patients who underwent EVAR. There were 1515 type II endoleaks and 393 interventions. Type II endoleak was seen in 10.2 per cent of patients after EVAR; 35.4 per cent resolved spontaneously. Fourteen patients (0.9 per cent) with isolated type II endoleak had ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm; six of these did not have known aneurysm sac expansion. Of 393 interventions for type II endoleak, 28.5 per cent were unsuccessful. Translumbar embolization had a higher clinical success rate than transarterial embolization (81 versus 62.5 per cent respectively; P = 0.024) and fewer recurrent endoleaks were reported (19 versus 35.8 per cent; P = 0.036). Transarterial embolization also had a higher rate of complications (9.2 per cent versus none; P = 0.043).

Conclusion

Aortic aneurysm rupture after EVAR secondary to an isolated type II endoleak is rare (less than 1 per cent), but over a third occur in the absence of sac expansion. Translumbar embolization had a higher success rate with a lower risk of complications.

### Proximal migration and endoleak: impact of endograft design and deployment techniques [^114DFLgF]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms by endovascular means is the preferred method in most patients. Despite its popularity, questions remain about the long-term efficacy and durability. Proximal migration and endoleak are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and are two of the most important factors in achieving a successful outcome. The technology associated with endovascular grafts continues to evolve rapidly, as does our understanding of ideal deployment techniques. Both can impact the incidence of proximal migration as well as endoleak and must be optimized to achieve ideal clinical outcomes.

### Enlarging aneurysm sac post EVAR-type V or occult type II endoleak? [^116Nxaee]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type V endoleaks (T5ELs) describe aneurysm sac expansion after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) without a demonstrable type I-IV endoleak (Chaikof et al; Gilling-Smith et al; White and May). Originally T5ELs occurred with early iterations of the Gore Excluder aortic grafts (Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) proposedly from porosity of the graft fabric, leading to its modification in the early noughties.

However, persistence of T5ELs with newer generation endografts has led to several hypotheses including intermittent or low-flow endoleaks not visualised on imaging (Sambeek et al; Torres-Blanco and Miralles-Hernández; Parsa et al.). Other authors postulate hyperfibrinolysis and local coagulation activation as the mechanism of a clear gelatinous material accumulating within the aneurysm sac, known as sac hygroma (Risberg et al.). Torikai et al. propose proliferation of vasa vasorum in the aortic wall causes occult type II endoleaks (T2EL) suggested by patchy heterogenous enhancement of sac thrombus on delayed-phase CT (Torikai et al.). These cases of apparent endotension pose a challenge as continued sac expansion warrants active intervention (Risberg et al; Deery et al.).

We present two cases of patients with enlarging aneurysm sacs but no definable endoleak on imaging, which we propose are type II endoleaks secondary to reversal of flow in the vasa vasora.

Type IV Endoleak

Type IV EL represents leakage of blood through the stent graft due to fabric porosity in the early postoperative period. They were described mainly in first-generation stent grafts at the time of completion angiography when patients are fully anticoagulated. They are rare in newer generation devices, are self-limiting and do not require re-intervention.

### Occult type I or III endoleaks are a common cause of failure of type II endoleak treatment after endovascular aortic repair [^111KJhkM]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Most type II endoleaks have a benign natural history, but 6% to 8% are associated with sac enlargement and respond poorly to treatment. Our aim was to evaluate whether these enlargements are associated with delayed or occult type I and III endoleaks.

Methods

Patients with interventions for endoleak after endovascular aortic repair from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient demographics, comorbidities, endoleak type, secondary procedures, aortic sac growth (≥ 5 mm), and mortality were collected. Successful treatment was defined as endoleak resolution with no further aortic sac growth. Secondary procedures, ruptures, endograft explant, and death were captured.

Results

There were 130 patients diagnosed with a primary type II endoleak after endovascular aortic repair at a median of 1.3 months (interquartile range, 1.0–13.3 months). One hundred eighteen had their initial treatment for a primary type II. Twelve of the 130 were initially stable and observed, but were treated for a delayed type I or III endoleak. The 130 patients underwent 279 procedures for endoleaks (mean of 2.2 ± 1.3) over 6.9 ± 3.8 years of follow-up. Of the 118 patients treated for primary type II endoleaks, 26 (22.0%) later required interventions for delayed type I and III endoleaks. The mean time to intervention for a delayed type I or III endoleak was 5.4 ± 2.8 years. Overall, there were 16 type IA, 11 type IB, 2 type III, 7 combined type IA/IB, and 2 type IA/III delayed endoleaks. The odds of harboring a delayed type I or III endoleak was 22.0% before the first attempt at type II endoleak treatment, 35.1% before the second, 44.8% before the third, and 66.6% before the fourth attempts. Rapid aortic sac growth of ≥ 5 mm/y before initial endoleak treatment was associated with increased risk for delayed type I or III endoleak (47.8 vs 14.1%; p = 0.003). Patients with delayed type I or III endoleaks had a lower successful treatment rate (8.3% vs 52.3%; p = 0.001) than those with only type II endoleaks. Late rupture was increased with delayed type I or III endoleak (P = 0.002), whereas mortality (P = 0.96) and aortic-related mortality (P = 0.46) were similar. Graft explant (P = 0.06) trended toward an increase with a delayed type I or III endoleak, but was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Failed attempts treating type II endoleaks and/or a rapid aortic sac growth of 5 mm/y or greater should raise the suspicion of a delayed or occult type I or III endoleak. Occult endoleaks are associated with decreased chance of endoleak resolution.

### Incidence, etiology, and management of type III endoleak after endovascular aortic repair [^1129q2ke]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to retrospectively assess the incidence, etiology, and management of type III endoleaks in a large cohort of patients treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in two European university centers.

Methods

From 1995 until 2014, 965 EVAR procedures were performed with use of first- and second-generation (n = 79) or third-generation (n = 886) endografts. Radiologic follow-up was performed with computed tomography and abdominal plain film examinations in accordance with the European Collaborators on Stent/graft Techniques for aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) scheme. The potential relationship between the type of endograft and the incidence of type III endoleak and the time interval between initial EVAR and diagnosis of type III endoleak were calculated.

Results

Twenty patients (2.1%) were identified with 25 type III endoleaks (n = 10/79 [12.7%] for first- and second-generation endografts and n = 10/886 [1.2%] for third-generation endografts; P < .001). Disconnection was found in 14 of 25 endoleaks (56%) and a fabric defect in 11 of 25 (44%) endoleaks, both without any difference between first- and second- vs third-generation endografts (P = 0.216). The time interval between initial EVAR and type III endoleak was 3.87 and 5.92 years, respectively, for first- or second-generation and third-generation endografts (P = 0.148). Twenty-five type III endoleaks were treated using endovascular techniques (n = 22 [88%]) or by open surgical conversion (n = 3 [12%]).

Conclusions

Type III endoleak rarely (2.1%) occurs after EVAR, with a higher incidence in first- and second-generation endografts. In the majority of cases, the underlying mechanism is disconnection of the stent graft components. Type III endoleaks may occur early or late after initial EVAR and can, in most cases, be managed endovascularly, although type III endoleak may recur.

### Type II endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair: natural history and treatment outcomes [^1126netc]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural history of type II endoleaks and linkage to aneurysm rupture is unclear. Likewise, treatment recommendations are controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the incidence, factors associated with type II endoleaks, and outcomes in an Australia cohort of patients who have undergone endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

Methods

Data from 693 patients who underwent EVAR between 2009 and 2013 at multiple institutions across Australia were studied. Patients who developed (1) type II endoleak and (2) type II endoleak with sac expansion were compared for preoperative demographics, mortality, sac expansion, aneurysm rupture, and intervention rates.

Results

A total of 225 patients developed type II endoleak over a mean follow-up of 1.9 years (± 1.0 years), out of which 133 spontaneously resolved, 37 were untreated unresolved, and 16 underwent intervention. Type I and III endoleaks occurred in 50 and 19 patients, respectively. Smoking (P = 0.002) and warfarin (P = 0.044) were protective factors for development of type II endoleak, whereas age (P = 0.034), right iliac artery tortuosity (P = 0.031), and right (P = 0.008) and left external iliac diameters (P = 0.028) were risk factors for endoleak. Three patients suffered aneurysm ruptures in the entire cohort. All ruptures occurred in type II endoleak patients, of which two occurred after reintervention and in the absence of sac expansion (> 5 mm). Late type II endoleak occurred in 117 patients, out of which 26 had sac expansion. Of those without late type II endoleak, 25 have sac expansion. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between those with and without type II endoleak. Age (P < 0.0001) and smoking (P = 0.001) were significant independent predictive factors for survival in this patient sample. Treatment outcomes were encouraging with most cases involving endoleak resolution (15 of 16 patients) and no sac expansion after intervention (0 of 8 patients with complete follow-up info on sac size).

Conclusions

Aneurysm rupture in patients with type II endoleak is uncommon in our series. Type II endoleak with sac expansion does not appear to be associated with aneurysm rupture. In this series, most aneurysm ruptures occurred in the absence of documented sac expansion and after reintervention.

Type II EL is the most common type of endoleak with a reported prevalence between 8 and 44%. In type II EL, the persistent perfusion of the aneurysm sac is caused by retrograde blood flow via collateral vessels (most commonly the inferior mesenteric artery and lumbar arteries). Based on the number of patent branches involved, type II EL (Fig. 4) can be classified into type IIa (only one collateral artery, Fig. 5) and type IIb (two or more arteries). Up to 40% of type II EL spontaneously resolve with collateral thrombosis. Therefore, the "wait and see" approach is accepted for stable aneurysms at follow-up. Type II EL treatment is advisable for cases persistent over 6 months and with more than 5 mm of sac expansion compared to preprocedural CT measurements. CT scan shows the presence of contrast agent in the peripheral part of the aneurysm sac, close to the origin of the involved vessels (anterior wall of the sac for inferior mesenteric artery, posterior wall of the sac for lumbar arteries). Minimally invasive treatment includes embolization through transarterial, transcaval, translumbar and transabdominal approaches. The translumbar embolization is a safe and effective treatment for type II EL, with low complication and reintervention rate.

Endoleak

Most studies who reported endoleak, were only reported on overall endoleak and did not stratify into endoleak types. The 3 EVAS and 2 EVAR studies were included in the forest plot (Figure 2B). There was considerable overall heterogeneity present (p = 0.00 with I² = 85%). Inter-group heterogeneity was not observed (p = 0.137).

For EVAS, the total endoleak rate was 10% (95% CI: 4%–19%). Harrison et aldid not report on all types of endoleak, but noted that of the 8 aneurysm ruptures after EVAS, 7 were secondary to a type Ia endoleak and the other rupture was associated with a type Ib endoleak. In addition, of the 5 device failures which occurred in the first year after EVAS, 3 were caused by type Ia endoleak and 2 by type Ib endoleak.

The total endoleak rate for EVAR was 17% (95% CI: 13%–23%). Howard et alonly provided 30 day follow-up endoleak rates, totaling to 25 cases with endoleak (0.01%). Throughout long-term follow-up, the freedom from type Ia endoleak was reported in 99% and 97% at 1 and 5 years follow-up, respectively. Massière et alreported on long-term prevalence of type I endoleak and noted 2 cases (1%) of type Ia endoleak and 5 cases (2%) of type Ib endoleak. Sirignano et alreported 6 cases of type Ia endoleak (2%), 3 type Ib endoleak (1%), 7 type II endoleak (2%), and 1 type III endoleak (0.3%). Torsello et alreported the prevalence of endoleak as cumulative numbers and could therefore not be included in the forest plot since patients were probably counted double. They noted 2 type Ia and 2 type Ib endoleaks (3.3%), 31 total cases of endoleak type II (53%) at 1 month follow-up and 10 cases (26%) at 5 years follow-up.

Type 3 endoleak rates and reinterventions at follow-up

The overall rate of any endoleak at follow-up was 16%. Endoleak rates overall and by endoleak type for standard EVAR at follow-up are presented in table 2. The rate of incident T3EL in standard EVAR at follow-up was 0.7% (n = 205), which accounts for 4.7% of all the endoleaks seen at follow-up. Type 2 endoleaks were the most common endoleak, comprising 58% (n = 196) of all endoleaks in standard EVAR. The rate of indeterminate endoleaks within standard EVAR at follow-up was 2% (n = 509), which accounts for roughly 11.7% of all the endoleaks.

The overall follow-up reintervention rate for standard EVAR for any indication was 3.4% (n = 899). The overall rates of reintervention for endoleaks at follow-up in standard EVAR are presented in table 3. The overall rate of reintervention for any endoleak was 1.3% (n = 335), which accounts for 37% of all reinterventions. Of the 205 incident T3EL discovered at long-term follow-up, only 30 (15%) were recorded as treated with reintervention. Reintervention for T3EL occurred in 0.1% of the population, accounting for 8.9% (n = 30/335) of the endoleak reinterventions and 3.3% of all reinterventions (table 4).

EVAR outcomes and duplex ultrasound performance — supportive data: The incidence of late aortic rupture after EVAR is > 5% through 8 years of follow-up, and endoleaks may be present for 10% to 17% of EVAR at 30 days postoperatively; in patients without early (30-day) endoleak, the incidence of new endoleak at 6 and 12 months postoperatively is similar, and earlier detection at 6 vs. 12 months is not associated with improved long-term outcomes. Stent graft fracture and migration is a long-term complication after EVAR that occurs in 3% to 4% of patients by 4 years postoperatively. Duplex ultrasound is 95% accurate for measuring aortic aneurysm sac diameter and 100% specific for the detection of type I and type III endoleaks after EVAR, but it is insufficient for detecting type II endoleaks or for characterizing anatomy related to stent graft migration or failure.

D: Two Messages About Endoleak Management Following TEVAR and EVAR

1. The primary therapy for type 1, 2 and 3 endoleaks after EVAR and TEVAR involves endovascular methods in the majority of cases. Many of the therapeutic options require the insertion of additional endografts in conjunction with additional endovascular methods, e.g. EndoAnchors, chimneys, etc.
2. Embolisation plays a key role in the treatment of type 2 endoleaks and EVAR and TEVAR. Embolisation plays a small, but significant role in the management of challenging type 1 endoleaks after EVAR and TEVAR if no other endovascular solution is feasible.

E: Prediction for the Next Five Years

The therapeutic algorithm for all endoleaks will continue as described in this manuscript. It would be surprising to see any significant therapeutic advances or change in the approach to the management of any of the endoleak types. However, with increasing recognition that treating patients with hostile proximal necks by standard EVAR, and with the potential ramifications of planned UK NICE EVAR guidelines, we may see a significant reduction in the frequency of type 1a endoleaks after EVAR.

Type V Endoleak

Definition

Type V EL is also known as endotension and represents aneurysm sac expansion in the absence of an identifiable EL. This may be due to such slow blood flow that it is below the sensitivity limits for detection on current imaging methods. For example, several authors have suggested that the vasa vasorum of the aneurysmal aortic wall may be a source of occult type II EL. Other alternative hypotheses include hyperfibrinolysis and local coagulation activation leading to sac hygromas, ultrafiltration across the fabric of the endograft, and pressure transmission through thrombus or the stent graft. It is an uncommon phenomenon reported in 2–3% of EVARs and as the underlying mechanism remains contentious, each case is treated on an individual basis. Observation may be appropriate in some cases but the criteria for conservative management are unclear.

Indication for Treatment

Type V EL is a diagnosis of exclusion when all other causes of sac expansion have excluded. Potential cases require additional imaging to exclude an occult EL. MRI has been shown to be more sensitive than CTA for the detection of type II EL and some authors recommend its use in patients with a suspected type V EL. Catheter angiography with cone-beam CT has also been suggested as a useful imaging adjunct.

Management

Treatment of type V EL is not yet defined and remains a challenge. Reported interventions include percutaneous sac aspiration, open surgical exploration and sac plication/resection, which have been unsuccessful in preventing sac enlargement. Relining of the entire stent graft has also been described. If device relining fails, then open surgical conversion may be the only viable option.

### Type IIIb endoleak is an important cause of failure following endovascular aneurysm repair [^111gGtiu]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present confirmed cases of type IIIb endoleak in second and third-generation stent-grafts used for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).

Case Reports

Four patients developed type IIIb endoleak caused by fabric tears between 4 and 13 years following their initial EVAR. Three patients presented with rupture and one with aneurysm expansion of unknown cause. In each case, the type IIIb endoleak was confirmed at open surgery after imaging proved non-diagnostic. Only one patient survived. Had the cause for the expansion or ruptures been found prior to open reintervention, relining of the stent-graft may have been possible.

Conclusion

Type IIIb endoleak remains difficult to diagnose. Avoidance of the high mortality associated with open secondary intervention requires a high degree of suspicion and it should be considered in any post-EVAR aneurysm expansion without an obvious cause.

Complications and reinterventions

Complications (apart from endoleaks after EVAR) and reinterventions were reported heterogeneously across the four trials. The overall rates of reintervention reported were higher in the EVAR group than in the open repair group for all trials (Table 1). The risk of reintervention by time period following aneurysm repair is shown in Fig. S4 (supporting information); there was substantial heterogeneity between trials for reinterventions recorded between 31 days and 3 years.

There was no indication that complications following EVAR decreased with the year in which the trial commenced: these rates, together with types and numbers of complications, are reported in Table S5 (supporting information). The commonest reported complication after EVAR was type II endoleak, which overall was reported 435 times in 325 of 2783 patients (11.7 per cent). Corrective reintervention was performed in 99 of 435 detected type II endoleaks (22.8 per cent). There was no evidence that a detected type II endoleak (either treated or untreated) was associated with worse overall survival (Table S6, supporting information). The second most common type of complication was type I endoleak, for which 79 of 120 (65.8 per cent) received an early reintervention. Similarly, early correction of other serious EVAR‐related complications was attempted in less than two‐thirds of patients. Secondary sac rupture was reported in 37 patients: 33 in the EVAR randomized groups (2.4 per cent of patients) and four in the open groups (0.3 per cent), although all four of the latter patients were treated with EVAR. For those with secondary rupture following treatment with EVAR, the median time to rupture was 3.5 years (Fig. S5, supporting information). Of these patients, 11 had a type I endoleak, of which seven were treated, seven had a type II endoleak, of which three were treated, two had a type III endoleak, of which one was treated, and nine had known graft migration. Nineteen patients had no endoleaks detected before secondary sac rupture and one further patient had a thoracic endograft for proximal aortic dissection 3 days earlier. The mean time between detection of the first endoleak and rupture was 1.8 years. The 30‐day mortality rate following rupture was 62 per cent (23 of 37).

More recent studies found a sensivity between 69% (Ashoke et al.) and 86% (Manning et al.). In the setting of an endoleak identified on the previously cited imaging methods, angiography is an essential modality for further diagnostic characterization and treatment.

Interestingly, and regarding the limitations of angiography, Blackwood et al. created an in vitro model in an experimental study. Measurements of pressure and angiography images were recorded in three scenarios: no endoleak, type I endoleak with inflow and sac outflow and a type I endoleak with inflow but no sac outflow. In the second scenario, aneurysm sac pressure was lower than the systemic and the endoleak was visible at 30 s. In the last scenario sac pressure was higher than the systemic so that net flow was zero and visibility of an endoleak was confirmed after 9 min. Consequently, they concluded that the endoleak could only be visualized with markedly delayed imaging and not with standard angiography like that used in clinical practice (Blackwood et al.). Therefore, endotension may represent an undiagnosed endoleak, particularly type I.

Fabric porosity

The possible influence of fabric porosity in the pressure transmission to the aneurysm sac is another controversial point. Initially it was proposed as one of the possible causes of endotension although afterwards it was considered as type IV endoleak.

Available endografts are made of different materials and each one has its corresponding porosity grade. Initially, some clinical data suggested that PTFE stent-grafts could not prevent the sac enlargement despite of the aneurysm exclusion in the absence of endoleak. Moreover, some studies observed a lower incidence in the regression of the aneurysm sac in patients that underwent treatment with the original Excluder stent-graft in comparison with other devices (Cho et al; Bertges et al; Rhee et al; Trocciola et al.). Because of the publication of these findings, the Excluder endograft was modified in 2004, incorporating an additional low-permeability layer to reduce porosity.

### Type II endoleak is an enigmatic and unpredictable marker of worse outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair [^116be3cT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This study analyzed predictors and the long-term consequence of type II endoleak in a large series of elective endovascular abdominal aneurysm repairs (EVARs).

Methods

Baseline characteristics and operative and follow-up data of consecutive patients undergoing EVAR were prospectively collected. Patients who developed type II endoleak according to computed tomography angiography and those without type II endoleak were compared for baseline characteristics, mortality, reintervention, conversion, and aneurysm growth after repair.

Results

In 1997–2011, 1412 consecutive patients (91.4% males; mean age, 72.9 years) underwent elective EVAR and were subsequently followed up for a median of 45 months (interquartile range, 21–79 months). Type II endoleak developed in 218. Adjusted analysis failed to identify significant independent predictors for type II endoleak with the exception of age (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.05; p = 0.003) and intraluminal thrombus (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.92; p = 0.010). Type II endoleak rates were comparable regardless of the device model. Late aneurysm-related survival was comparable (98.4% vs 99.5% at 60 months; p = 0.73) in patients with and without type II endoleak. However, at 60 months after EVAR, rates of aneurysm sac growth > 5 mm (35.3% vs 3.3%; P < .0001) were higher in patients with type II endoleak. Cox regression identified type II endoleak as an independent predictor of aneurysm growth along with age and cardiac disease. The presence of type II endoleak led to reinterventions in 40% of patients and conversion to open surgery in 8%. However, assessment of these patients after reintervention showed similar 60-month freedom rates of persisting type II endoleak (present in more than two after computed tomography angiography scan studies) among those with and without reinterventions (49.8% vs 45.6%; p = 0.639). Aneurysm growth > 5 mm persisted with comparable rates in type II endoleak patients after reintervention and in those who remained untreated (42.9% vs 57.4% at 60 months; p = 0.117).

Conclusions

Reintervention for type II endoleak was common in our practice, yet such intervention did not reliably prevent the continued expansion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our data indicate type II endoleak appears to be a marker of EVAR failure that is difficult to predict and treat effectively.

### Rupture signs on computed tomography, treatment, and outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^114GnTPt]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Outcome

A ruptured AAA often leads to disastrous consequences, with an up to 90% mortality rate. Over half of the patients do not reach the hospital alive. Even for those who are able to undergo open surgical repair, the mortality rate remains higher than 40%.

The arrival of EVAR for ruptured AAA has been associated with lower mortality and morbidity, reduction in blood loss, transfusion requirements, and hospital stay. Short-term mortality rates vary from 11 to 45% in the literature, with most studies reporting a perioperative mortality rate around 20%. Even in patients with haemodynamic instability, the mortality rate with EVAR has been seen to be as low as 18%. A study led by Bosch et al. found a reduction in the 6-month mortality rate of EVAR over open surgery by 26.5%.

Such lower mortality and morbidity may be due to the use of local, as opposed to general, anaesthesia, the lower amount of blood loss, the minimally invasive nature of EVAR, and fewer extra-aortic injuries associated with open surgery.

Despite improvements in perioperative mortality rates, no studies have shown a long-term reduction in survival rates with EVAR over open surgery. Also, an irrefutable reduction in mortality rates has not been confirmed in randomised control studies.

Finally, EVAR is associated with endoleaks, which are the most frequent long-term complications and may end up causing aneurysm rupture. CT imaging at 1 and 12 months after the initial intervention, followed by annual controls, is therefore recommended for early detection and prevention of complications, such as endoleaks. If an endoleak is observed on follow-up imaging, it needs to be carefully analysed to determine its origin. Types I (sealing zone endoleak) and III (graft failure endoleak) need to be immediately addressed as they should be considered the equivalent of an untreated AAA. Type II endoleaks (retrograde flow from a covered aortic branch) are the most commonly encountered endoleaks. If a type II endoleak is detected, a 6-month follow-up CT is recommended, and re-intervention should be considered if there is progression of the aneurysm diameter. Finally, if a type V endoleak is suspected (endotension; progression of the AAA diameter with no detectable endoleak on a dual-phase CT), it should be closely followed with imaging and possibly referred for surgical conversion.

### Nationwide analysis of persistent type II endoleak and late outcomes of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in Japan: a propensity-matched analysis [^1167DjxV]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The current endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) technology appears well established, with lower operative mortality and morbidity rates than open repair. However, these advantages have not been sustained beyond 2 years; reintervention has been required for endoleak, so-called endoflow, which has not been reported after open repair. – Perigraft flow after EVAR is defined as endoleak: type I from attachment sites, type II from collateral branches to the aneurysm, and type III occurring from stent graft defects or junction sites. – Endoleaks of type Ia at proximal and Ib at distal landing zones of the stent graft are comparable to EVAR failure, with an incidence of 5% to 30%, and relate strongly to aneurysm sac growth and rupture. Type IIIa at the junction of stent grafts and IIIb endoleaks with graft disruption, both attributable to device failure, should be treated because direct endoleaks are associated with a risk of aneurysm sac rupture, into the original aneurysmal wall covering the stent graft and perigraft cavity.

Unlike the ominous nature of type I and type III endoleaks, the clinical importance of type II endoleak remains unknown, although persistent type II endoleak (p-T2EL) is the most common complication of EVAR, with a widespread overall incidence (3.8%–45%), and relates to sac growth. Most type II endoleaks are believed to be benign, and rupture has infrequently arisen from type II endoleaks.

Some facilities are aggressively performing embolization, considering the reported cases of newly developed type I endoleak attributable to sac enlargement caused by type II endoleak. However, to compensate for the insufficient evidence and to reveal the significance of p-T2ELs to the risk of late adverse events, larger population studies to clarify the effects of p-T2ELs and aneurysm sac enlargement after EVAR are warranted.

The Japanese Committee for Stentgraft Management(JACSM) registry was established to prevent the inappropriate use of the commercial stent graft in 2006, and all EVAR procedures in Japan have been registered with the committee. The aim of this study was to review the results of EVAR in > 17 000 patients from the JACSM registry and to determine the significance of p-T2ELs to the risk of late adverse events. In addition, the risk factors of aneurysm sac enlargement after EVAR were investigated as a marker of clinical failure and indication for reintervention.

### Prevention of type II endoleaks during endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm: endovascular treatment versus combination with coil embolisation of the aneurysmal sac (SCOPE1) [^112w1TB4]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

The term endoleak is specific to EVAR, and describes the primary means by which endografts fail. Type I endoleaks occur because of inadequate graft seal proximally or distally, resulting in perigraft flow and aneurysm sac pressurization. Type II endoleaks occur when branch arteries arising from the aneurysmal aorta back-bleed into the aneurysm sac due to collateral flow. Type III endoleaks occur when flow persists between segments of a modular graft. Type IV endoleaks occur when flow persists through endograft material. Type V endoleaks have also been called "endotension", and occur when pressurization of the sac occurs in the absence of any demonstrable endoleak. Type I and Type III endoleaks are most concerning for rupture, although persistent Type II endoleaks can also lead to aneurysm rupture and premature death. The most common method of EVAR follow-up is computed tomographic angiography.

These studies allow accurate measurement of aneurysm sac diameters and volumes. They also are highly sensitive and specific for endoleaks. Type II endoleaks are treated if they remain persistent and are present in the setting of aneurysm sac enlargement. Type I and III endoleaks are immediately treated when identified. Type IV endoleaks are rarely seen with current endograft technology. Study Objectives: The purpose of the current study is to compare the level of endoleaks between group 1 and 2 at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Study Design Prospective interventional study, multicenter, open, randomized trial comparing the type II endoleak level in patients who benefited the endovascular AAA repair versus combination with coil embolization of the aneurysmal sac.

### Inflammation, endoleaks, and aortic remodeling… [^115KnrWU]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Shalaby and colleagues1 have taken a fresh look at inflammation and aortic aneurysms by examining the continued remodeling of the residual aneurysmal sac after endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic aneurysms. Two long-term pitfalls for EVAR are endoleaks and continued expansion of the residual sac. The rate of type II endoleaks may be as low as 15%2 or as high as 27%. 3 Type II endoleaks usually involve continued flow within the aneurysm sac. Approximately 60% resolve within 6 months, but persistence of a type II endoleak after the first 6 months is associated with higher rates of aneurysm sac enlargement. 2 The search for risk factors for type II endoleaks and sac expansion have primarily focused on anatomical factors: the number of patent lumbars, the size of the inferior mesenteric artery, the burden of laminated thrombus in the aneurysm, or the technical complexities of the endovascular procedure.

possible to anticipate the development of Type IIIa endoleaks when progressive device migration or separation is noted on radiographic imaging, Type IIIb endoleaks from fabric perforation cannot be anticipated and may occur at any time. Thus, it is particularly challenging to prospectively predict this device failure mode.
