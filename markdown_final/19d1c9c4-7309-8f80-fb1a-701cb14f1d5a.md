## Question

What are the first line drugs for febrile uti in a child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line drugs for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including age, severity, and whether this is initial empiric therapy versus definitive therapy. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and extract PICO elements. Next, I will appraise the highest-quality evidence for route of therapy, duration, and specific agents. After that, I need to integrate resistance data and guideline nuances, including special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and explicitly state uncertainties and what would change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Febrile UTI in children typically reflects upper tract involvement (pyelonephritis) and carries a risk of renal scarring, so empiric therapy should be timely and effective while minimizing harm; most data and guidelines focus on children 2–24 months, but I should keep in mind that neonates and infants under 2 months generally require intravenous therapy and broader evaluation, and that older children with uncomplicated febrile UTI can often be managed orally if stable [^111tQQGw] [^112aDnVJ].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and frame the PICO. The strongest evidence includes randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing oral versus parenteral therapy, different durations, and specific agents; cohort and observational studies inform resistance patterns and real-world outcomes; guidelines synthesize evidence and local practice. The PICO is Population: children 2–24 months with febrile UTI; Intervention: empiric antibiotic choice and route; Comparator: alternative agents or durations; Outcomes: clinical cure, recurrence, renal scarring, adverse events, and resistance [^114vUek1].

> Next, I should review route of administration. Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy of oral versus IV therapy. High-quality evidence shows oral antibiotics are as effective as short-course IV therapy followed by oral therapy for acute pyelonephritis, with no differences in persistent bacteriuria or renal damage at 6–12 months; this supports oral therapy as first-line when the child is clinically stable and can tolerate oral intake, with IV reserved for toxicity, inability to take oral meds, or specific high-risk features [^112WBDMH] [^114vUek1] [^111jvLWg].

> I will now examine duration. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — older guidance favored 7–14 days, but newer trials challenge that. The SCOUT randomized trial in children 2 months to 10 years showed that 5 additional days after 5 days of therapy (total 10 days) had lower treatment failure than 5 total days, supporting a 10-day total for febrile UTI; however, a Danish RCT suggested individualized shorter courses could reduce antibiotic exposure with a trade-off in recurrence risk, and a small RCT of amoxicillin-clavulanate suggested 5 days might be noninferior, so I should be cautious and align with the weight of evidence and guideline consensus favoring 7–10 days for most febrile UTIs while acknowledging evolving data [^114PuAxo] [^112amWAz] [^1148JM6o] [^116doJUG].

> Let me consider specific first-line agents and resistance. I should double-check local resistance thresholds. For empiric therapy, third-generation oral cephalosporins such as cefixime or cefpodoxime are widely recommended because they achieve high urinary levels and cover the most common uropathogen (E. coli) with favorable resistance profiles compared with amoxicillin or TMP-SMX in many regions; amoxicillin-clavulanate is an alternative when local susceptibility supports it, but rising resistance and stewardship concerns limit its role as universal first-line empiric therapy [^117NosTq] [^113UcpBW] [^113fmdam]. I initially thought TMP-SMX might be reasonable empirically, but wait, I should verify — resistance commonly exceeds 20% in many settings, so it should be reserved for known susceptibility or as an alternative when first-line agents are unsuitable [^113UcpBW] [^113fmdam].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions. For neonates and infants under 2 months, I need to ensure IV therapy and broader evaluation are recommended due to immature immunity, higher bacteremia risk, and unreliable oral absorption; ceftriaxone is a common empiric choice in this group, with adjustment to oral therapy once stable and cultures return [^111tQQGw] [^112aDnVJ]. For children with high-grade VUR, obstruction, or severe illness, IV therapy may be preferred initially, though emerging guidance suggests many with VUR can still be managed orally if stable; I should individualize based on severity, prior cultures, and response [^111dthrq] [^111tQQGw].

> I should confirm the role of stewardship and follow-up. Obtaining a urine culture before antibiotics when feasible, reassessing at 48 hours to ensure clinical response and de-escalating based on sensitivities, and avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum agents are key; observational data show frequent overuse of third-generation cephalosporins when narrower agents would suffice, reinforcing the need to tailor to culture results and local antibiograms [^113fVDhK] [^112vvqfj] [^116SCarT].

> Let me synthesize a practical, first-line recommendation. For a clinically stable child 2–24 months with febrile UTI who can take oral medications, start an oral third-generation cephalosporin such as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily or cefpodoxime 10 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for a total of 7–10 days, adjusting to culture results and clinical response; if oral therapy is not feasible or the child is severely ill, use IV ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg every 24 hours with early transition to oral therapy to complete 7–10 days total, ensuring a urine culture was obtained when possible [^115TFWgH] [^114vUek1] [^111jvLWg] [^116doJUG]. I should emphasize that amoxicillin or TMP-SMX should be reserved for cases with documented susceptibility or when first-line options are contraindicated, given resistance patterns [^113UcpBW] [^113fmdam].

> But wait, what if the child is already on prophylaxis or has recurrent UTIs? I need to ensure we avoid using the same prophylactic agent for treatment and consider prior resistance risks; in children with recurrent UTI or other complicating features, empiric choices should reflect prior cultures and local resistance, and some may warrant initial IV therapy while awaiting susceptibilities, with subsequent de-escalation to the narrowest effective oral agent [^1155TKup] [^1141U6vd].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and what would change practice. Shorter-course strategies are promising but not yet standard for febrile UTI; if high-quality RCTs consistently show noninferiority of 5–7 days for pyelonephritis with low recurrence and no excess scarring, guidelines may shift. Likewise, if resistance to oral cephalosporins rises above 20% locally, empiric choices would need recalibration to maintain efficacy while preserving stewardship [^112amWAz] [^1148JM6o] [^113UcpBW].

---

First-line therapy for febrile UTI in children is **oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, a third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime, cefpodoxime, or ceftibuten), or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** [^115TFWgH] if local resistance is ≤ 20% [^113UcpBW]. Oral therapy is **as effective as IV therapy** for most children who are clinically stable and can tolerate oral intake [^112WBDMH] [^114vUek1]. IV ceftriaxone is reserved for severe illness, vomiting, or inability to take oral medication [^111jvLWg]. Treat for **7–10 days** [^116doJUG], adjust to culture results, and obtain renal/bladder ultrasound to detect anomalies [^114fcMVu].

---

## Recommended first-line antibiotics

The following antibiotics are recommended as **first-line therapy** for febrile UTI in children:

| **Antibiotic** | **Route** | **Dosage** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Oral | 20–40 mg/kg/day | Every 8 hours |
| Cefixime | Oral | 8 mg/kg/day | Once daily |
| Cefpodoxime | Oral | 10 mg/kg/day | Every 12 hours |
| Ceftibuten | Oral | 9 mg/kg/day | Once daily |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Oral | 6–12 mg/kg/day (trimethoprim component) | Every 12 hours |

---

These antibiotics are recommended based on their **efficacy, safety, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties** [^notfound]. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors such as allergies and tolerance [^114vUek1].

---

## Route of administration

Oral antibiotics are **as effective as intravenous therapy** for clinically stable children who can tolerate oral intake [^112WBDMH]. Intravenous therapy is reserved for severe cases, such as those with sepsis, persistent vomiting, or inability to take oral medications [^111dthrq]. Ceftriaxone is the preferred intravenous antibiotic due to its once-daily dosing and broad-spectrum coverage [^notfound].

---

## Duration of therapy

The **recommended duration of therapy** for febrile UTI in children is 7–10 days [^116doJUG]. Shorter courses (5 days) have been studied [^1148JM6o] but are not yet standard of care pending further evidence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

First-line oral antibiotics have been shown to be **highly effective** in treating febrile UTI in children, with clinical cure rates exceeding 90% [^notfound]. Intravenous therapy followed by oral therapy is equally effective in severe cases [^112WBDMH].

---

## Safety profile and side effects

First-line antibiotics for febrile UTI in children have a **favorable safety profile**. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and mild allergic reactions. Serious adverse effects are rare but may include severe allergic reactions and antibiotic-associated colitis.

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic choice

Several factors influence the **choice of antibiotic** for febrile UTI in children:

- **Local resistance patterns**: Antibiotic selection should be guided by local antibiograms to ensure coverage of common uropathogens [^114vUek1] [^113UcpBW].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, allergies, and tolerance to oral medications should be considered [^notfound].
- **Severity of illness**: Severe cases may require intravenous therapy initially, followed by oral therapy once stabilized [^111dthrq].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up is essential to ensure **clinical improvement** and to detect complications. Renal and bladder ultrasound is recommended after the first febrile UTI to identify anatomical abnormalities [^114fcMVu]. Routine voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended unless ultrasound reveals abnormalities or there is a recurrence of febrile UTI [^114u2fnH].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) recommend **oral antibiotics as first-line therapy** for clinically stable children with febrile UTI [^114vUek1] [^116x7fcQ]. Intravenous therapy is reserved for severe cases or when oral therapy is not feasible [^111dthrq].

---

First-line therapy for febrile UTI in children includes **oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, third-generation cephalosporins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** [^115TFWgH], with the choice guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors. Oral therapy is effective for most children, with intravenous therapy reserved for severe cases.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

Urinary tract infections are common occurrences in the pediatric age group and are a cause of significant morbidity and expense. The understanding of the consequences and sequelae of febrile urinary tract infections led to revision of standard protocols initiated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1999. A less invasive protocol of radiologic evaluation has been the major outcome of the revised AAP guidelines. Emphasis on prevention of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections has also led to therapeutic programs that are centered less around the use of prophylactic antibiotics than has previously been the practice.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^112amWAz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^115AfYaL]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^111Z7V9H]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Acute urinary tract infections are relatively common in children, with 8 percent of girls and 2 percent of boys having at least one episode by seven years of age. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, accounting for approximately 85 percent of urinary tract infections in children. Renal parenchymal defects are present in 3 to 15 percent of children within one to two years of their first diagnosed urinary tract infection. Clinical signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection depend on the age of the child, but all febrile children two to 24 months of age with no obvious cause of infection should be evaluated for urinary tract infection (with the exception of circumcised boys older than 12 months). Evaluation of older children may depend on the clinical presentation and symptoms that point toward a urinary source (e.g., leukocyte esterase or nitrite present on dipstick testing; pyuria of at least 10 white blood cells per high-power field and bacteriuria on microscopy). Increased rates of E. coli resistance have made amoxicillin a less acceptable choice for treatment, and studies have found higher cure rates with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other treatment options include amoxicillin/clavulanate and cephalosporins. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the risk of subsequent urinary tract infections, even in children with mild to moderate vesicoureteral reflux. Constipation should be avoided to help prevent urinary tract infections. Ultrasonography, cystography, and a renal cortical scan should be considered in children with urinary tract infections.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings without language restriction to 10 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^111tQQGw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with multiple recurrent UTI, starting with IV antibiotics is not obligatory. Each episode should be managed according to presentation. This group is at risk of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria through increased antibiotic exposure. If a child has previously had a UTI with bacteria resistant to all oral options, initial antibiotics can be IV until culture results are available. Intravesical antibiotics, via the urethra or Mitrofanoff, are occasionally used to treat intractable recurrent UTI, with small studies showing successful outcomes with 7 days of treatment. Local irrigation may limit systemic antibiotic side effects and keep children out of hospital.

UTI with fever alone can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. Severe clinical presentations of UTI requiring initial IV include sepsis (features include hypotension and tachycardia when afebrile) and extensive parenchymal involvement. Vomiting can be a sign of sepsis, but on its own is rarely a reason to start IV: in an observational study, over 60% of children with vomiting were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. For extensive renal parenchymal involvement (nephronia/abscess), IV antibiotics ensure maximum concentration at the site.

Nonurologic underlying conditions are renal and nonrenal. A review of UTI postrenal transplant recommended initial IV antibiotics for pyelonephritis to achieve rapid tissue saturation. Although there is a lack of studies of UTI management with other renal impairment, in the absence of severe VUR, oral antibiotics can usually be used. For immunocompromised children, treatment should be via febrile neutropenia pathways if relevant. Otherwise, unless presenting severely unwell, oral antibiotics may be appropriate in immunosuppression or other states of chronic disease (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For neonates and infants < 2 months, there are no RCTs and little comparative evidence to definitively guide the route of antibiotics for UTI. Major guidelines recommend IV antibiotics due to suboptimal enteral absorption, immune immaturity and high risk of bacteremia. The only study of oral antibiotics in infants that included this age group had too few < 2 months to make strong recommendations supporting this. Most retrospective studies of UTI in neonatesand infants < 2 months – used initial IV antibiotics, and until there is any evidence to the contrary, this continues to be the recommendation, at least as the initial route.

### Aminoglycosides monotherapy as first-line treatment for febrile urinary tract infection in children [^114G9M63]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

We report a retrospective monocentric descriptive study performed in CHI Creteil for 20 months to describe the management and outcome of amikacin monotherapy as an alternative to third-generation cephalosporins for empiric treatment of febrile urinary tract infection (FUTI) in children. Data were analyzed for 151 children, and 90 selected cases were classified as certain or highly probable FUTI. Escherichia coli infection was found in 89 cases. In all patients, fever was resolved within 72 hours after beginning amikacin treatment. Only 5.3% of children were febrile after 48 hours. The mean amikacin treatment duration was 3.05 ± 0.13 days before oral treatment began (guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing). Amikacin monotherapy seems effective for the initial management of FUTI in children.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^117DocBi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment durations for lower and upper UTIs have gradually reduced, but randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of shorter durations have largely excluded children with complications. Therefore, there is scant evidence for total durations shorter than 10–14 days for cUTI.

For neonates and infants < 2 months, the majority of retrospective studies in bacteremic, and nonbacteremic,– UTI used a total of 10–14 days of antibiotics with high success rates. A recent systematic review comparing the IV component in infants up to 3 months recommended: for bacteremic UTI, IV antibiotics up to 7 days; and for nonbacteremic UTI, up to 3 days. Switching from IV to oral in both situations is recommended when the infant is afebrile, well and tolerating oral intake.

For severe clinical presentations, a retrospective study of children with febrile UTI included those with initial tachycardia, hypotension and/or vomiting. It showed that 6–9 days was as effective as ≥ 10 days of total antibiotics, although it did not report numbers with severe features. Once features of sepsis resolve (usually by day 3), total antibiotic duration is dependent on bacteremia. A multicenter study of children under 6 months with UTI found bacteremia was more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days). A case-control study comparing bacteremic versus nonbacteremic UTI found a difference in IV (5–7 vs. 3–4 days) but not total (11–12 days) antibiotic duration, and no differences in outcomes. For acute lobar nephronia, a review including overlapping RCTs compared 14 versus 21 days' total duration, with initial IV then switching to oral 2–3 days after defervescence. There was higher treatment failure with 14 days, but failure was associated with longer pre-presentation fever, suggesting longer treatment is necessary for more established abscesses.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^115rWDXz]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 2 (assessment and initial testing pathway): If a clinician assesses a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever as not being so ill as to require immediate antimicrobial therapy, then the clinician should assess the likelihood of UTI. If the clinician determines the febrile infant to have a low likelihood of UTI, then clinical follow-up monitoring without testing is sufficient (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation). If the clinician determines that the febrile infant is not in a low-risk group, then there are 2 choices (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation): Option 1 is to obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or SPA for culture and urinalysis; Option 2 is to obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means and to perform a urinalysis, proceeding to catheterization or SPA and culture if urinalysis suggests UTI, whereas if urinalysis of fresh (less than 1 hour since void) urine yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, it is reasonable to monitor the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty. When illness severity and UTI risk are extremely low, the patient may be observed without assessing the urine, and this 2-step process (Option 2) has been shown feasible and beneficial in a pediatric emergency department, with the catheterization rate decreasing from 63% to fewer than 30% without increasing length of stay or missing UTIs.

### Short oral antibiotic therapy for pediatric febrile urinary tract infections: a randomized trial [^1148JM6o]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI) in well-appearing children is conventionally treated with a standard 10-day course of oral antibiotic. The objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority (5% threshold) of a 5-day amoxicillin-clavulanate course compared with a 10-day regimen to treat fUTIs.

Methods

This is a multicenter, investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. We randomly assigned children aged 3 months to 5 years with a noncomplicated fUTI to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate 50+7.12 mg/kg/day orally in 3 divided doses for 5 or 10 days. The primary end point was the recurrence of a urinary tract infection within 30 days after the completion of therapy. Secondary end points were the difference in prevalence of clinical recovery, adverse drug-related events, and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and/or to other antibiotics when a recurrent infection occurred.

Results

From May 2020 through September 2022, 175 children were assessed for eligibility and 142 underwent randomization. The recurrence rate within 30 days of the end of therapy was 2.8% (2/72) in the short group and 14.3% (10/70) in the standard group. The difference between the 2 groups was -11.51% (95% confidence interval, -20.54 to -2.47). The recurrence rate of fUTI within 30 days from the end of therapy was 1.4% (1/72) in the short group and 5.7% (4/70) in the standard group (95% confidence interval, -10.4 to 1.75).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that a 5-day course is noninferior to a 10-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^117NosTq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children — empiric therapy and limited fluoroquinolone role — emphasizes cephalosporins for uncomplicated cases and restricts fluoroquinolones to severe presentations. Standard empiric therapy for uncomplicated UTI in the pediatric population continues to be a cephalosporin antibiotic agent, because TMP-SMX– and amoxicillin-resistant E coli are increasingly common. The fluoroquinolones remain potential first-line agents only in the setting of pyelonephritis or complicated UTI.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection: does the evidence support aggressively pursuing the diagnosis? [^112PDjC9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of pediatric fever has changed considerably during the past 2 decades with the development of vaccines against the most common bacterial pathogens causing bacteremia and meningitis. The decreasing incidence of these 2 conditions among vaccinated children has led to an emphasis on urinary tract infection as a remaining source of potentially hidden infections in febrile children. Emerging literature, however, has led to questions about both the degree and nature of the danger posed by urinary tract infection in nonverbal children, whereas the aggressive pursuit of the diagnosis consumes resources and leads to patient discomfort, medical risks, and potential overdiagnosis. We review both early and emerging literature to examine the utility and efficacy of early identification and treatment of urinary tract infection in children younger than 24 months. We conclude that in well children of this age, it may be reasonable to withhold or delay testing for urinary tract infection if signs of other sources are apparent or if the fever has been present for fewer than 4 to 5 days.

### Urinary tract infection antibiotic trial design: a systematic review [^111b7NpP]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent common bacterial infections in children. No guidance on the conduct of pediatric febrile UTI clinical trials (CTs) exist.

Objective

To assess the criteria used for patient selection and the efficacy end points in febrile pediatric UTI CTs.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane central databases, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched between January 1, 1990, and November 24, 2016.

Study Selection

We combined Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text terms for "urinary tract infections" and "therapeutics" and "clinical trials" in children (0–18 years), identifying 3086 articles.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

We included 40 CTs in which a total of 4381 cases of pediatric UTIs were investigated. Positive urine culture results and fever were the most common inclusion criteria (93% and 78%, respectively). Urine sampling method, pyuria, and colony thresholds were highly variable. Clinical and microbiological end points were assessed in 88% and 93% of the studies, respectively. Timing for end point assessment was highly variable, and only 3 studies (17%) out of the 18 performed after the Food and Drug Administration 1998 guidance publication assessed primary and secondary end points consistently with this guidance.

Limitations

Our limitations included a mixed population of healthy children and children with an underlying condition. In 6 trials, researchers studied a subgroup of patients with afebrile UTI.

Conclusions

We observed a wide variability in the microbiological inclusion criteria and the timing for end point assessment. The available guidance for adults appear not to be used by pediatricians and do not seem applicable to the childhood UTI. A harmonized design for pediatric UTIs CT is necessary.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114fcMVu]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Action statement 7 — After confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI), the clinician should instruct parents or guardians to seek prompt medical evaluation (ideally within 48 hours) for future febrile illnesses, to ensure that recurrent infections can be detected and treated promptly (evidence quality: C; recommendation). Early treatment limits renal damage better than late treatment, and the risk of renal scarring increases as the number of recurrences increases; all infants who have sustained a febrile UTI should have a urine specimen obtained at the onset of subsequent febrile illnesses, so that a UTI can be diagnosed and treated promptly. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes, and ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation. Routine VCUG after the first UTI is not recommended; VCUG is indicated if RBUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG also should be performed if there is a recurrence of febrile UTI.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^114KFTvZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Resistance to antibacterial therapy in pediatric febrile urinary tract infections-a single-center analysis [^113WqNXD]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common serious bacterial infections in childhood and require early diagnosis and antibacterial therapy. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the optimal antibacterial agent for primary treatment of pediatric UTIs. Additionally, patterns of susceptibility and resistance change over time and microbiological in vitro resistance is not necessarily associated with treatment failure. Here, we analyzed uropathogens, their resistance patterns, and response to antibacterial treatment in children with acute pyelonephritis.

Methods

We used billing codes (international classification of diseases) to identify all inpatients aged 0–18 years with febrile UTIs in a German university tertiary care center from 2009 until 2018. Microbial results were retrieved from the laboratory information system for all children, and treatment regimen and treatment response were analyzed in a subgroup of children.

Results

We identified 907 children with acute pyelonephritis; in 590 cases (65%) an uropathogen was detected. Escherichia coli (60.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (13.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%), Proteus spp. (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%) were the most common pathogens. 353 of 436 E.coli isolates (81.0%) were susceptible or intermediate to aminopenicillin/β-lactamase-inhibitor (BLI) combinations. We examined 52 cases where E. coli was resistant to initial therapy with aminopenicillin/BLI combinations: Therapy was changed in 35 cases (67%) and left unchanged in 17 cases (33%), and we found no significant differences in C-reactive protein and leucocyte count in blood and urine between both groups after 3 days.

Conclusions

We present the spectrum of uropathogens and susceptibility test results in pediatric UTIs in a tertiary care center. Our findings suggest a satisfactory response to first-line therapy with aminopenicillin/BLI combinations.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113wtdNf]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^111abcNr]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP urinary tract infection guideline — febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age: Action Statement 1 states that if a clinician decides that a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever requires antimicrobial therapy to be administered because of ill appearance or another pressing reason, the clinician should ensure that a urine specimen is obtained for both culture and urinalysis before an antimicrobial is administered; the specimen needs to be obtained through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA), because the diagnosis of UTI cannot be established reliably through culture of urine collected in a bag (evidence quality: A; strong recommendation).

### Technical report-diagnosis and management of an initial UTI in febrile infants and young children [^112uqQgp]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are clinically challenging. This report was developed to inform the revised, evidence-based, clinical guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of initial UTIs in febrile infants and young children, 2 to 24 months of age, from the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.

Methods

The conceptual model presented in the 1999 technical report was updated after a comprehensive review of published literature. Studies with potentially new information or with evidence that reinforced the 1999 technical report were retained. Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI were performed.

Results

Review of recent literature revealed new evidence in the following areas. Certain clinical findings and new urinalysis methods can help clinicians identify febrile children at very low risk of UTI. Oral antimicrobial therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in treating UTI. Data from published, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI when vesicoureteral reflux is found through voiding cystourethrography. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract after the first UTI has poor sensitivity. Early antimicrobial treatment may decrease the risk of renal damage from UTI.

Conclusions

Recent literature agrees with most of the evidence presented in the 1999 technical report, but meta-analyses of data from recent, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI. This finding argues against voiding cystourethrography after the first UTI.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) care — prompt treatment and renal scarring timing: Prompt treatment is stated to be of clinical benefit for the acute infection; a recent study identified that the median time to treatment was shorter in infants without a scar than in those with a scar (48 vs 72 hours), and the rate of scarring increased minimally between days 1 and 2 and between days 2 and 3 but was much higher thereafter.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^113Dxvp2]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The literature search performed during the 11-year period from 2011, when the revised American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on the investigation and management of a first febrile UTI in infancy were published, largely concurring with the earlier National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, demonstrated significant differences in approach between physicians and surgeons in terms of imaging, antibiotic prophylaxis, and surgery in the event of VUR detection. It should be clarified that this is not a systematic review or meta-analysis, which represent scholarly syntheses of evidence on a subject to inform healthcare decisions. While physicians have largely embraced evidence-based medicine, surgeons in many cases have not; thus, any systematic review or meta-analysis would potentially exclude large portions of the surgical literature and thus make any assessment of conflicting views between the two groups impossible.

An analysis of the papers identifies some indication of the justifications given by physicians and surgeons for the divergence of opinion. Physicians as a group, in line with the newer evidence-based guidelines, advocate less imaging and intervention, and are inclined to adopt a "watchful-waiting" approach, confident that any significant abnormality, grade IV–V VUR in particular, should be picked up following a second febrile UTI. In contrast, surgeons as a group are more likely to recommend imaging to detect VUR, with antibiotic prophylaxis and/or surgical correction if it is detected, concerned that any delay in diagnosis and treatment could place the child at risk of kidney damage. This divergence of approach between physicians and surgeons often confuses the family of the child, regarding the choice of how to best proceed with the diagnostic and therapeutic process.

### Urinary tract infections in young children and infants: common questions and answers [^115NM8v3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and are associated with significant short- and long-term morbidity. They have a high recurrence rate and are associated with anatomic and functional abnormalities. The decision to test for UTI is based on risk factors and the child's age. Urinalysis is valuable to rule out UTI and to help decide when to start antibiotics; however, urine culture is needed for definitive diagnosis. Urine specimens collected via perineal bagging should not be used for culture because of high false-positive rates. Diagnosis of UTI requires pyuria and bacterial growth in the urine culture. Prompt treatment of UTIs reduces renal scarring. Antibiotic selection should be based on local sensitivity patterns and adjusted once culture results are available. In most cases, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous agents. When intravenous antibiotics are used, early transition to an oral regimen is as effective as longer intravenous courses. Kidney and bladder ultrasonography is helpful to identify acute complications and anatomic abnormalities. Voiding cystourethrography is indicated when ultrasound findings are abnormal and in cases of recurrent febrile UTIs. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs is controversial. Identification and treatment of bowel and bladder dysfunction can prevent UTI recurrence.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^116N7Zy1]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common condition in children, and pathways of management have evolved over time.

Objective

To determine the extent to which pediatricians and surgeons differ in their investigation and management of a first febrile UTI, and to evaluate the justifications for any divergence of approach.

Materials and methods

A literature search was conducted for papers addressing investigation and/or management following a first febrile UTI in children published between 2011 and 2021. Searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. To be eligible for inclusion, a paper was required to provide recommendations on one or more of the following: ultrasound (US) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), the need for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis and surgery when vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected. The authorship required at least one pediatrician or surgeon. Authorship was categorized as medical, surgical, or combined.

Results

Pediatricians advocated less imaging and intervention and were more inclined to adopt a "watchful-waiting" approach, confident that any significant abnormality, grades IV–V VUR in particular, should be detected following a second febrile UTI. In contrast, surgeons were more likely to recommend imaging to detect VUR (p < 0.00001), and antibiotic prophylaxis (p < 0.001) and/or surgical correction (p = 0.004) if it was detected, concerned that any delay in diagnosis and treatment could place the child at risk of kidney damage. Papers with combined authorship displayed intermediate results.

Conclusion

There are two distinct directions in the literature regarding the investigation of an uncomplicated first febrile UTI in a child. In general, when presented with a first febrile UTI in a child, physicians recommend fewer investigations and less treatment, in contrast to surgeons who advocate extensive investigation and aggressive intervention in the event that imaging detects an abnormality. This has the potential to confuse the carers of affected children.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^111ndpQQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Short-course therapy for urinary tract infections in children: the SCOUT randomized clinical trial [^114PuAxo]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of pediatric-specific comparative data to guide duration of therapy recommendations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^1132FL8r]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Evaluation and management of febrile children: a review [^114icimN]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Management of febrile children is an intrinsic aspect of pediatric practice. Febrile children account for 15% of emergency department visits and outcomes range from the presence of serious bacterial infection to benign self-limited illness.

Observations

Studies from 1979 to 2015 examining febrile infants and children were included in this review. Management of febrile infants younger than 90 days has evolved considerably in the last 30 years. Increased rates of Escherichia coli urinary tract infections, increasing resistance to ampicillin, and advances in viral diagnostics have had an effect on the approach to caring for these patients. Widespread vaccination with conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae has virtually eliminated the concern for bacterial infections in children aged 3 to 36 months. Urinary tract infections still remain a concern in febrile infants of all ages.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances over the last 30 years allow for more precise risk stratification for infants at high risk of serious bacterial infection. With appropriate testing at the initial visit, much of the diagnostic testing and empirical treatment can be avoided for infants younger than 90 days. In the vaccinated child aged 3 to 36 months, the only bacterial infection of concern is urinary tract infection.

RBUS after initial febrile UTI — timing and evidence profile: RBUS is recommended during the first 2 days of treatment to identify serious complications when the clinical illness is unusually severe or substantial clinical improvement is not occurring; for febrile infants with UTIs who demonstrate substantial clinical improvement, imaging does not need to occur early during the acute infection. Findings on nuclear scans are not recommended as part of routine evaluation of infants with their first febrile UTI, and the radiation dose during dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning is generally low (~1 mSv). Aggregate quality of evidence is C (observational studies). Benefits state that RBUS in this population will yield abnormal results in ~15% of cases, and 1% to 2% will have abnormalities that would lead to action. Harms/risks/costs note that between 2% and 3% will be false-positive results. The benefit-harms assessment is "Preponderance of benefit over harm", and value judgments emphasize that "The seriousness of the potentially correctable abnormalities in 1% to 2%, coupled with the absence of physical harm, was judged sufficiently important to tip the scales in favor of testing". Policy level is "Recommendation".

Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^115aX98i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infection in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent renal damage. Published guidelines recommend treatment of acute pyelonephritis initially with intravenous (IV) therapy followed by oral therapy for 7–14 days though there is no consensus on the duration of either IV or oral therapy.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002), EMBASE (1988 -September 2002), reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0–18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or weight mean difference (WMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen trials involving 1872 children were eligible for inclusion. No significant differences were found in persistent renal damage at six months (one trial, 306 infants: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03) or in duration of fever (WMD 0.80, 95% CI -4.41 to - 6.01) between oral cefixime therapy (14 days) and IV therapy (three days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly no significant differences in persistent renal damage (three trials, 315 children: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.37) were found between IV therapy (3–4 days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy for 7–14 days. In addition no significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (one trial, 179 children, persistent symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53).

Reviewer's Conclusions

These results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral cefixime or with short courses (2–4 days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy. If IV therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. Trials are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy and if other oral antibiotics can be used in the initial treatment of acute pyelonephritis.

### Contemporary management of urinary tract infection in children [^116doJUG]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, and girls are at a significantly higher risk, as compared to boys, except in early infancy. Most cases are caused by Escherichia coli Collection of an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for accurate diagnosis. Oral antibiotic therapy for 7 to 10 days is adequate for uncomplicated cases that respond well to the treatment. A renal ultrasound examination is advised in all young children with first febrile UTI and in older children with recurrent UTI. Most children with first febrile UTI do not need a voiding cystourethrogram; it may be considered after the first UTI in children with abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound examination or a UTI caused by atypical pathogen, complex clinical course, or known renal scarring. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is used selectively in high-risk patients. Few patients diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux after a UTI need surgical correction. The most consequential long-term complication of acute pyelonephritis is renal scarring, which may increase the risk of hypertension or chronic kidney disease later in life. Treatment of acute pyelonephritis with an appropriate antibiotic within 48 hours of fever onset and prevention of recurrent UTI lowers the risk of renal scarring. Pathogens causing UTI are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly used antibiotics, and their indiscriminate use in doubtful cases of UTI must be discouraged.

### Prophylaxis after first febrile urinary tract infection in children? A multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial [^112E2DUC]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Febrile urinary tract infections are common in children and associated with the risk for renal scarring and long-term complications. Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been used to reduce the risk for recurrence. We performed a study to determine whether no prophylaxis is similar to antimicrobial prophylaxis for 12 months in reducing the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections in children after a first febrile urinary tract infection.

Methods

The study was a controlled, randomized, open-label, 2-armed, noninferiority trial comparing no prophylaxis with prophylaxis (co-trimoxazole 15 mg/kg per day or co-amoxiclav 15 mg/kg per day) for 12 months. A total of 338 children who were aged 2 months to < 7 years and had a first episode of febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled: 309 with a confirmed pyelonephritis on a technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan with or without reflux and 27 with a clinical pyelonephritis and reflux. The primary end point was recurrence rate of febrile urinary tract infections during 12 months. Secondary end point was the rate of renal scarring produced by recurrent urinary tract infections on technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan after 12 months.

Results

Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences in the primary outcome between no prophylaxis and prophylaxis: 12 (9.45%) of 127 vs 15 (7.11%) of 211. In the subgroup of children with reflux, the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections was 9 (19.6%) of 46 on no prophylaxis and 10 (12.1%) of 82 on prophylaxis. No significant difference was found in the secondary outcome: 2 (1.9%) of 108 on no prophylaxis versus 2 (1.1%) of 187 on prophylaxis. Bivariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard model showed that grade III reflux was a risk factor for recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. Whereas increasing age was protective, use of no prophylaxis was not a risk factor.

Conclusions

For children with or without primary nonsevere reflux, prophylaxis does not reduce the rate of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections after the first episode.

### Outcomes of empirical antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-onset febrile urinary tract infection in the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance [^113wtma2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common cause of fever in children. Despite the increasing numbers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the community, the empirical therapy of choice is still third-generation cephalosporins. This study was performed to investigate whether inappropriate empirical therapy (IAT) of community-onset UTI results in adverse clinical outcomes.

Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of pediatric patients with first-episode community-onset UTI caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus spp. at Ramathibodi Hospital from 2011 to 2017. The patients were classified into IAT and appropriate empirical therapy (AT) groups. Medical records were reviewed to assess clinical outcomes.

Results

One hundred fifty-one eligible patients were enrolled in this study. The most common causative organism was E. coli (88.8% and 96.2% in the AT and IAT groups, respectively). Among the causative organisms, 19.8% were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. There was no significant difference in clinical failure, microbiologic failure, relapse or time to defervescence between the 2 groups. No patients in either group developed sepsis after receiving empirical therapy. However, the length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the IAT than AT group [4.00 (4.50–6.00) vs. 7.00 (5.00–11.25) days, respectively; P = 0.000].

Conclusions

No significant difference in treatment outcomes was found between pediatric patients receiving AT and IAT for the treatment of UTI. In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, third-generation cephalosporins may still be a good choice as an empirical antimicrobial for children diagnosed with community-onset UTI.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^112KTmNx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116SCarT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^114u2fnH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — states that diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50 000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. This Clinical Practice Guideline was retired May 2021.

Observational data indicate that nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, and TMP/SMX are comparatively effective; however, conclusions are limited based on the study design. 3 There is limited and conflicting data on antibiotic prophylaxis for children. 4–6. Further research is needed to establish clear criteria for urine testing in febrile patients. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Effective management of UTI hinges on appropriate diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship, aiming to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for ASB. Symptom-based testing is key to ensure appropriate urine culture testing and proper diagnosis of UTI. 52, 53 A 2017 systematic review54 showed 45% of included patients experienced inappropriate initiation of antimicrobial treatment for ASB; various interventions, such as education on diagnostic protocols, provided a significant absolute risk reduction of 33%.

Avoiding overtesting and resulting overtreatment of ASB is essential to preserving antimicrobial effectiveness. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs. Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates. Several observational studies suggest that a single parenteral dose of an aminoglycoside may be a reasonable alternative treatment option. 103 No data exists to suggest that initial parenteral treatment for cystitis is necessary in patients who can tolerate oral treatment.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^117EeSio]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

### Diagnosis and management of UTI in febrile infants age 0–2 months: applicability of the AAP guideline [^112YLSXc]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infection in young infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) clinical practice guideline for UTIs focuses on febrile children age 2–24 months, with no guideline for infants < 2 months of age, an age group commonly encountered by pediatric hospitalists. In this review, we assess the applicability of the AAP UTI Guideline's action statements for previously healthy, febrile infants < 2 months of age. We also discuss additional considerations in this age group, including concurrent bacteremia and routine testing for meningitis.

For nonurologic underlying conditions affecting the kidneys, RCTs that did not exclude renal impairment showed no difference comparing ≤ 3 versus ≥ 4 days IV of a total of 8–15 days, although renal impairment was not analyzed separately. Postrenal transplant, expert opinion recommends 14 days total for febrile UTI/pyelonephritis, switching from IV with clinical improvement.

Although immunocompromised children were unusually included in a study of febrile UTI, numbers were too small to extrapolate findings of shorter antibiotic durations. A small study found children with cancer often have few classic UTI symptoms, so diagnosis and definitive treatment may be delayed. Immunocompromised children usually have multiple admissions and antibiotic courses, so they are more likely to have unusual bacteria or resistance. Once definitive treatment starts, there is no reason for prolonged courses in this or other chronic conditions (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For children with significant urologic abnormalities, the only study comparing total antibiotic duration included 23% with urological abnormalities and found no difference between 6–9 and ≥ 10 days in treatment failure/recurrence, although it did not analyze them separately. Two RCTs investigating IV duration for febrile UTI included 34% and 37% children with VUR, respectively, and found no difference between 3 and ≥ 7 days IV of a total 8–15 days. A retrospective study including 1930 children with urological abnormalities found they were more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 days than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days), but this was not associated with outcomes. A retrospective study including urological abnormality compared 1 day versus 2–3 days' IV (median total 10 days) and found no difference in readmission, although outcomes were not analyzed by urological abnormality. Recruitment is currently underway for an RCT of cUTI comparing 1 versus 3 days of IV of a total of 7 days of antibiotics.

For children with multiple recurrent UTIs, antibiotic duration should be tailored to each individual acute UTI presentation. Multiple antibiotic courses for recurrent UTIs increase the likelihood of resistance. Longer admissions (although not antibiotic durations) have been shown for ESBL-E UTIs than for non-ESBL-E UTI. IV treatment via hospital-in-the-home programs could shorten hospital length of stay. For resistant UTIs, a comparison of IV durations of ≥ 3 days with 0–2 days showed no difference in recurrence, although total duration was not reported. Definitive antibiotic treatment should not usually need a longer duration simply due to resistance.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Update of the EAU / ESPU guidelines on urinary tract infections in children [^113QjuPW]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children and require appropriate diagnostic evaluation, management and follow-up.

Objective

To provide a summary of the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on Pediatric Urology, which were first published in 2015 in European Urology.

Study Design

A structured literature review was performed of new publications between 2015 and 2020 for UTIs in children. The guideline was updated accordingly with relevant new literature.

Results

The occurrence of a UTI can be the first indication of anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract, especially in patients with a febrile UTI. The basic diagnostic evaluation should include sufficient investigations to exclude urinary tract abnormalities, but should also be as minimally invasive as possible. In recent years, more risk factors have been identified to predict the presence of these anatomical anomalies, such as a non-E. Coli infection, high grade fever and ultrasound abnormalities. When these risk factors are factored into the diagnostic work-up, some invasive investigations can be omitted in a larger group of children. In addition to the treatment of active UTIs, it is also essential to prevent recurrent UTIs and consequent renal scarring. With the increase of antimicrobial resistance good antibiotic stewardship is needed. In addition, alternative preventative measures such as dietary supplements, bladder and bowel management and antibiotic prophylaxis could decrease the incidence of recurrent UTI.

Conclusion

This paper is a summary of the updated 2021 EAU guidelines on Pediatric Urology. It provides practical considerations and flowcharts for the management and diagnostic evaluation of UTIs in children.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^113fmdam]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

It's not an unusual presentation in primary care — an alert, responsive preschool child with a temperature of 39°C, unremarkable findings on examination, but with leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. Given a strong suspicion of a urinary tract infection, and with Escherichia coli being the most likely organism, empirical management with one of a small number of cheap and available antibiotics would follow.

In a linked paper, Bryce and colleagues (doi:) present compelling evidence of the need to reconsider current approaches to community based management of paediatric urinary tract infection. Their findings confront long established patterns of practice and are inextricably linked to the emerging global problem of antimicrobial resistance.

Bryce's team undertook a systematic review designed to identify the global prevalence of resistance to commonly recommended antibiotics in children with community acquired E coli urinary tract infection. They systematically reviewed 58 studies in 26 countries. Five of these studies allowed them to measure the association between previous prescription of antibiotics and subsequent E coli resistance in the same child. Drugs of interest included ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. Ceftazidime was used as a marker for cephalosporin resistance.

For an antibiotic to be considered a first line empirical treatment for urinary tract infection, resistance should not exceed 20% in the most likely infecting strain. Bryce and colleagues show that this threshold has been reached for many first line antibiotics used for paediatric E coli urinary tract infection. Within countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), a half of all isolates were resistant to ampicillin, a third to co-trimoxazole, and a quarter to trimethoprim. Resistance was substantially greater in non-OECD countries. Data confirmed the group's previous reviewsuggesting that previous antibiotic use in primary care increased the subsequent risk of E coli resistance to that particular antibiotic.

Despite the clinical mixed inclusion criteria (a women aged 17 with symptoms of cystitis presents a very different clinical picture than a toddler with a fever of unknown origin), the findings have important implications for the management of paediatric urinary tract infection in primary care and for clinical decisions that have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s.

Initial management

General

Children with UTI require targeted antibiotics and supportive care. Most children with UTI can be managed at home with oral fluids and antibiotics. A small percentage will require admission for intravenous therapy, including very young and very unwell children, children with significant renal tract anomalies and children not responding to oral therapy.

Antibiotic therapy

Choice of empiric antibiotics must be guided by local guidelines, as local antimicrobial sensitivities vary significantly (table 2). The suitability of the initial agent should be reviewed once culture results are available.

Table 2
Recent evidence, controversies and emerging evidence

Oral antibiotics are effective for the overwhelming majority of paediatric UTI. Previous Cochrane reviews suggest that short 2–4 days courses are as effective as longer 7–14 days for uncomplicated cystitis, while single dose therapy is less effective. American guidelines recommend treatment durations of 7–14 days for both cystitis and pyelonephritis, Canadian guidelines recommend 7–10 days, while National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggests 7–10 days for pyelonephritis and a shorter 3 day course for children > 3 months with cystitis. Spanish guidelines mirror NICE recommendations though single-dose therapy is recommended for children aged > 6 years with uncomplicated cystitis.

Younger and sicker children may require initial intravenous therapy. Many guidelines and centres recommend admission, intravenous antibiotics and consideration of septic work-up for infants < 3 months. Aim to switch to oral therapy after 48 hours if there is clinical improvement.

Antibiotic resistance

Antibiotic resistant UTI is becoming more common globally, increases morbidity and doubles healthcare costs. The usual mechanism is through acquisition of enhanced beta-lactamase enzyme properties. Some Gram negative uropathogens can inactivate beta-lactam ring antibiotics such as penicillin and early generation cephalosporins with inherent beta-lactamase enzymes. However, some have acquired further multidrug-resistant properties through evolution of these enzymes, including the ability to hydrolyse and inactivate extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics. Such organisms are known as extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) organisms. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalisation are risk factors for ESBL carriage, which then contributes to community carriage and transmission of resistance. Rates of resistant UTIs are particularly high in resource-limited settings, where resistance to common oral antibiotics such as ampicillin and cotrimoxazole can be as high as 97%–100%.

NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND NEW USES FOR OLD ANTIBIOTICS

Urinary Tract Infections

Due to antibiotic resistance and contraindications that sometimes limit the use of current first-line agents, there is room for new options in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, the results of 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3, were published in February 2024. These nearly identical trials tested gepotidacin, an oral, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication by binding 2 different topoisomerases at a binding site distinct from fluoroquinolones. Geopotidacin was compared with nitrofurantoin by randomizing female patients over the age of 12 years with uncomplicated UTIs to receive 1 of the 2 drugs for 5 days. The primary outcome was therapeutic success, which was a combination of clinical and microbiologic resolution at day 10–13. Gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin in terms of the primary outcome in EAGLE-2, while it was superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. Notably, these differences were driven mostly by higher rates of microbiologic failure in the nitrofurantoin groups, as clinical success rates were relatively similar between the 2 arms. Gepotidacin has been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and a decision regarding its approval is expected in 2025.

### Treatment of urinary tract infections in children… [^114k4ezo]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, frequency and pain in the lower abdomen. Fever is less common. Oral antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate and second-and third-generation cephalosporins, are usually effective. However. E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to amoxicillin and TMP-SMX in some parts of the United States. The optimal duration of therapy is normally seven days, although shorter courses and single-dose regimens have demonstrated moderate but variable success. More than 60 percent of young febrile patients with UTI have evidence of pyelonephritis. Febrile infants with UTI who are younger than one year of age generally require hospitalization and initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics until afebrile, followed by oral therapy for 10 to 14 days. Appropriate intravenous agents include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, ampicillin-sulbactam and gentamicin.

Oral therapy depends on bacterial isolation and sensitivity. Recent studies question the need for long courses of intravenous cefotaxime when a short course of intravenous cefixime followed by oral therapy yields comparable results. The selection of appropriate treatment requires review of local antimicrobial resistance patterns and compliant caretakers who understand the seriousness of the infection, the need for exact antibiotic dosing and the importance of maintaining close contact with the treating physician. Oral antibiotics are sufficient for use in older children who present with high fever, abdominal or flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness if they do not appear to be toxic. Suitable medication choices include cefixime, other extended-spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, TMP-SMX and, occasionally, quinolones.

The authors conclude that treatment of UTI with oral antibiotics is usually effective, even in younger children with pyelonephritis. Cefixime is a useful empiric choice. Children who appear toxic or who cannot tolerate oral medication should be hospitalized for initial intravenous therapy. Radiographic studies can be performed before completion of antibiotic therapy. Caretakers should be educated about the risk of recurrence and advised when to seek medical attention.

### Antimicrobial for 7 or 14 days for febrile urinary tract infection in men: a multicenter noninferiority double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^112RVKPh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in men remains controversial.

Methods

To compare 7 days to 14 days of total antibiotic treatment for febrile UTIs in men, this multicenter randomized, double-blind. placebo-controlled noninferiority trial enrolled 282 men from 27 centers in France. Men were eligible if they had a febrile UTI and urine culture showing a single uropathogen. Participants were treated with ofloxacin or a third-generation cephalosporin at day 1, then randomized at day 3–4 to either continue ofloxacin for 14 days total treatment, or for 7 days followed by placebo until day 14. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as a negative urine culture and the absence of fever and of subsequent antibiotic treatment between the end of treatment and 6 weeks after day 1. Secondary endpoints included recurrent UTI within weeks 6 and 12 after day 1, rectal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales, and drug-related events.

Results

Two hundred forty participants were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy for 7 days (115 participants) or 14 days (125 participants). In the intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success occurred in 64 participants (55.7%) in the 7-day group and in 97 participants (77.6%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -21.9 [95% confidence interval, -33.3 to -10.1]), demonstrating inferiority. Adverse events during antibiotic therapy were reported in 4 participants in the 7-day arm and 7 in the 14-day arm. Rectal carriage of resistant Enterobacterales did not differ between both groups.

Conclusions

A treatment with ofloxacin for 7 days was inferior to 14 days for febrile UTI in men and should therefore not be recommended.

### Urinary tract infections in children: EAU / ESPU guidelines [^116Wn3wK]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

In 30% of children with urinary tract anomalies, urinary tract infection (UTI) can be the first sign. Failure to identify patients at risk can result in damage to the upper urinary tract.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children presenting with UTI.

Evidence Acquisition

The recommendations were developed after a review of the literature and a search of PubMed and Embase. A consensus decision was adopted when evidence was low.

Evidence Synthesis

UTIs are classified according to site, episode, symptoms, and complicating factors. For acute treatment, site and severity are the most important. Urine sampling by suprapubic aspiration or catheterisation has a low contamination rate and confirms UTI. Using a plastic bag to collect urine, a UTI can only be excluded if the dipstick is negative for both leukocyte esterase and nitrite or microscopic analysis is negative for both pyuria and bacteriuria. A clean voided midstream urine sample after cleaning the external genitalia has good diagnostic accuracy in toilet-trained children. In children with febrile UTI, antibiotic treatment should be initiated as soon as possible to eradicate infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve outcome, and reduce the likelihood of renal involvement. Ultrasound of the urinary tract is advised to exclude obstructive uropathy. Depending on sex, age, and clinical presentation, vesicoureteral reflux should be excluded. Antibacterial prophylaxis is beneficial. In toilet-trained children, bladder and bowel dysfunction needs to be excluded.

Conclusions

The level of evidence is high for the diagnosis of UTI and treatment in children but not for imaging to identify patients at risk for upper urinary tract damage.

Patient Summary

In these guidelines, we looked at the diagnosis, treatment, and imaging of children with urinary tract infection. There are strong recommendations on diagnosis and treatment; we also advise exclusion of obstructive uropathy within 24h and later vesicoureteral reflux, if indicated.

Initial Antibiotic Route

For most children with cUTI, oral antibiotics can be trialed initially, including those who are not severely unwell, for isolated urological abnormality (including post-surgery or urological implementation), isolated tachycardia and for most underlying conditions (GRADES C and D).
The exceptions for whom at least initial IV is recommended are significant urological abnormality (VUR grades 4 and 5 or obstruction), clinical features of sepsis, renal nephronia/abscess, neonates and infants < 2 months, post-renal transplant and immunocompromise with concomitant febrile neutropenia (GRADES B–D).

The primary rationale for administering IV antibiotics is to rapidly achieve high concentrations at the site of action in critical situations while bypassing the limitations of oral intake, absorption and bioavailability. There are few studies including children with significant anatomical and functional urologic abnormalities. The only high-grade evidence for route of antibiotic for VUR is from an RCT that included isolated VUR. For VUR grades 1 and 2, oral antibiotics were as effective as IV. For VUR grades 3–5, it appeared that there was less scarring if IV antibiotics were used: 8/24 (33%) scarring with oral versus 1/22 (5%) with IV, P = 0.02. However, only 16% of participants had VUR grades 3–5 so the study was underpowered for this group and the authors did not draw conclusions. There are no other IV versus oral studies for VUR grades 3–5. A prospective study found that half of 172 children with any urological abnormality were treated with oral antibiotics with good clinical outcomes, although this was not stratified by severity. Given the move towards oral antibiotic management over the last 2 decades since the above RCT, and assessing clinical outcomes rather than dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans, we recommend that most children with VUR grade 3 can be managed with oral antibiotics. There are no studies comparing oral with IV post instrumentation or surgery in this group, but in a stable child, oral antibiotics are appropriate.

### Antibiotic appropriateness for urinary tract infections in children [^112vvqfj]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We examined local prescribing patterns across the entire treatment course for children treated for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) to determine opportunities for antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of emergency department and inpatient encounters for febrile and afebrile UTI in a children's hospital from 2021 to 2022. An antibiotic spectrum ranking was established, and providers' choices were assessed for appropriateness on the basis of the individuals' urine culture (UCx). Groups were stratified by fever presence and compared using χ2, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

Of 172 encounters (83% emergency department), 99 (58%) had a positive UCx. Eighty (80%) grew Escherichia coli, with 67 (84%) being susceptible to cefazolin (minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 16 mg/L). There were 229 antibiotic regimens and 39 (17%) were appropriate. Inappropriate antibiotic choices included unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and misdiagnosed UTI. Grouping by encounter, at least 1 dose of a third cephalosporin was given in 51% of encounters, and 80% of these received it unnecessarily because of UTI misdiagnosis or suitability of a narrower-spectrum antibiotic. The median prescribed antibiotic duration was 7 days (interquartile range 7–10). Of 73 encounters with UCx growing mixed flora or a nonuropathogen, only 29 (40%) had antibiotics discontinued. Confirmed UTI was associated with fever and nitrite positivity.

Conclusions

Our study revealed high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotics, particularly unnecessary prescribing of third cephalosporin, prescriptions not supported by laboratory data, and prolonged treatment courses. Our results identify factors that can be used to support UTI treatment pathways and ensure antibiotic stewardship.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^114akPFB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### How COVID-19 changed the epidemiology of febrile urinary tract infections in children in the emergency department during the first outbreak [^117HEepD]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study is the first to report the effect of the first Covid-19 pandemic on febrile UTIs diagnosed in children in a pediatric ED setting. In 15 out of 17 centres, we observed a significant reduction in febrile UTI diagnoses throughout the pandemic compared with the previous two years. However, in proportion, the reduction in ED visits for UTI was less than for all other ED accesses (45.1% vs 75.1%). This occurrence can be explained by UTI symptoms which can be severe, such as malaise, abdominal pain, and long-lasting fever, especially in cases of antibiotic treatment delay. High fever, in particular, has always been a source of great concern for parents. Fear that the child's medical condition may rapidly worsen led parents to overcome, at least in some cases, their fear of the risk of contracting Sars-Cov-2 while waiting for the pediatric visit in the ED. It is also plausible that febrile children were brought to the ED because of their parents' fear of having a Sars-Cov-2 infection.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^116eeLFb]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are among the most common bacterial infections in childhood. They are equally common in boys and girls during the first year of life and become more common in girls after the first year of life. Dividing UTIs into three categories; febrile upper UTI (acute pyelonephritis), lower UTI (cystitis), and asymptomatic bacteriuria, is useful for numerous reasons, mainly because it helps to understand the pathophysiology of the infection. A single episode of febrile UTI is often caused by a virulent Escherichia coli strain, whereas recurrent infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria commonly result from urinary tract malformations or bladder disturbances. Treatment of an upper UTI needs to be broad and last for 10 days, a lower UTI only needs to be treated for 3 days, often with a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, and asymptomatic bacteriuria is best left untreated. Investigations of atypical and recurrent episodes of febrile UTI should focus on urinary tract abnormalities, whereas in cases of cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria the focus should be on bladder function.

### Efficacy of probiotic prophylaxis after the first febrile urinary tract infection in children with normal urinary tracts [^1144FiCR]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Growing antibiotic resistance and debates over their efficacy for urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence warrants studying nonantibiotic prophylaxis for preventing UTI recurrences.

Methods

We randomly assigned 181 children, aged 4 months to 5 years, with a normal urinary tract after recovery from their first febrile UTI in a 1:1 ratio to receive a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium lactis (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90) for a total of 18 months of therapy. The primary objective was to show the superiority of probiotic prophylaxis to placebo. The primary end point was composite cure (UTI-free survival) at 18 months, and the secondary end point was the median time to first UTI recurrence.

Results

The probiotics were superior to placebo with respect to the primary efficacy end point. At 18 months, composite cure was observed in 96.7% (3 of 91) of the patients in the probiotic group and 83.3% (15 of 90) of those in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The median time to the first incidence of UTI recurrence was 3.5 months (range, 1–4 months) and 6.5 months (range, 2–14 months) in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.04). The main microorganism that caused recurrent UTI was Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and these results were not significantly different between the 2 groups. We found no specific adverse events among the participants who received the probiotic mixture during the course of therapy.

Conclusions

The probiotics were more effective than placebo at reducing the risk of recurrent UTI in children with a normal urinary tract after their first episode of febrile UTI.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^117Bg4nY]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Reviews for voiding cystourethrograms and interventions

Of the 11 reviews for imaging with VCUGs, eight were surgical, citing the European Association of Urology - European Society for Paediatric Urology (EAU-ESPU) and/or American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines, outdated American Academy of Pediatrics 1999 guidelines, concerns that delaying a VCUG until after a second febrile UTI placed children at risk of significant scarring, the high incidence of VUR associated with a febrile UTI, poor compliance with prophylaxis, concerns that antibiotic prophylaxis promotes drug resistance, and other urologists who support intervention. The three medical reviews for imaging with VCUGs referred to the outdated American Academy of Pediatrics 1999 guidelines, Cincinnati guidelines, and Indian guidelines.

Of the ten reviews for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, six were surgical, three referenced the RIVUR trial as supportive of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, one acknowledged that continuous antibiotic prophylaxis was of questionable value but best "err on the side of caution", one referenced the American Urological Association guideline, and one cited increasing antibiotic resistance as a reason to consider surgery as a first line treatment. The four medical reviews for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis cited the outdated American Academy of Pediatrics 1999 guidelines and the RIVUR study demonstrating some benefit.

All four reviews for surgical intervention were authored by surgeons. They cited the American Urological Association guidelines, the PRIVENT and Swedish Reflux trials, and concerns regarding increased antibiotic resistance with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Antibiotic stewardship and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and adolescents in the emergency department of a community hospital [^116ZCZci]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A retrospective, cross-sectional study of children with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) 3 months to 18 years of age who had a urinalysis and urine culture (UC) during an emergency department (ED) visit between 2019 and 2020 was performed. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and independent samples T tests were used as appropriate. Median age was 6.6 years (interquartile range = 3.3–12.4). Urinalysis positivity was 92.8%, of which 81.9% of children were prescribed a first-line antibiotic. First-line antibiotic use was 82.7%. Positive UC rate was 84.7%, with 84% receiving a first-line antibiotic (P = 0.025). The correlation between a positive urinalysis and a positive UC was 80.8% (P < .001). Change of antibiotics based on the uropathogen of positive UCs was 6.3% (P < .001). The urinalysis and UC guided the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs. First-line antibiotics can be safely administered in the ED and prescribed for positive urinalyses. Studies are needed to evaluate the discontinuation of antibiotics with negative UCs as part of antibiotic stewardship initiatives.
