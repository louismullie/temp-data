## Question

What is the interpretation of CSF with low protein and low glucose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with both low protein and low glucose, including the differential diagnosis and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute or chronic. Then, I should verify the CSF parameters against age-specific reference ranges and confirm the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology of low glucose and low protein together. After that, I should build a prioritized differential diagnosis, including infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, and metabolic causes. Finally, I will outline immediate actions, including confirmatory testing, empiric management, and follow-up strategies, while double-checking for pitfalls like preanalytical delays and traumatic taps [^111A28h7] [^11342pRF].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because interpretation hinges on whether this is an acute presentation suggesting meningitis or encephalitis versus a chronic or subacute process such as leptomeningeal metastasis or GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, and I need to check for immunocompromise, recent neurosurgery, or HIV risk that shift the pretest probabilities toward fungal or healthcare-associated infections [^1119wX33] [^113nM5hy] [^115vfGMe].

> Wait, let me verify the CSF parameters against age-specific norms before drawing conclusions, since neonates and young infants have higher protein and lower glucose ranges than older children and adults, and I should confirm the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio using a serum glucose drawn within about 12 hours to avoid misclassification of hypoglycorrhachia [^117WGfQm] [^116uTh3g] [^1175HULb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about low glucose alone implying bacterial meningitis; I need to check the pathophysiology. Low CSF glucose (hypoglycorrhachia) generally reflects impaired transport across an inflamed blood–brain barrier plus increased consumption by pathogens and inflammatory cells, whereas low protein suggests reduced intrathecal synthesis and relatively preserved barrier integrity, so the combination of low glucose with low protein is mechanistically discordant and should prompt me to reconsider the diagnosis or the sample integrity [^1168oJqi] [^111thoJd] [^115s1sDy].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, starting with infectious etiologies, but wait, I should verify whether this pattern fits known entities. Classic bacterial meningitis typically shows high protein with low glucose, not low protein, so low protein plus low glucose is atypical for pyogenic meningitis; however, early or partially treated bacterial meningitis can blunt protein elevation, and healthcare-associated ventriculitis or shunt infections may have atypical chemistries, so I should not exclude infection solely on protein level [^1119wX33] [^112jjCLs] [^112EY6Z4]. Fungal meningitis, especially cryptococcus, often shows high protein and low glucose, but in immunocompromised hosts the protein may be less marked and glucose can be depressed with variable pleocytosis, so I should double-check cryptococcal antigen and consider Histoplasma or Coccidioides depending on exposure risk [^115vfGMe] [^116iTcpZ] [^112hgTWF]. Tuberculous meningitis classically has high protein and low glucose with lymphocytic pleocytosis, so low protein would argue against TBM unless very early or atypical, and I should confirm with targeted mycobacterial testing if suspected [^111f3wnb] [^112MNWJS].

> But wait, what if the low glucose is driven by a noninfectious process; I need to ensure I consider neoplastic and inflammatory causes. Leptomeningeal metastasis can present with low glucose and variable protein, and although protein is often elevated, early or low-burden disease may show modest protein changes, so I should send large-volume CSF for cytology and consider flow cytometry if hematologic malignancy is suspected, recognizing that imaging can be falsely negative and repeated sampling improves yield [^112g4Ci6] [^113UYXp7] [^113U6TnF]. Autoimmune or granulomatous meningitides such as neurosarcoidosis can rarely produce low glucose with moderate protein elevation, so if the protein is unexpectedly low I should reconsider the diagnosis or the timing of sampling, and I may need to repeat LP or pursue tissue diagnosis if suspicion remains high [^114PjwvC] [^116Ngdnv].

> Let me consider metabolic etiologies now, because low glucose with low protein could reflect impaired CNS glucose transport rather than consumption or barrier leak. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome causes persistently low CSF glucose and low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio with low-normal CSF lactate, and although protein is not characteristically low, it is often normal or only mildly reduced, so in a child with developmental delay, epilepsy, or paroxysmal movement disorders this pattern should trigger SLC2A1 genetic testing and consideration of a ketogenic diet as disease-modifying therapy [^117GF2Fw] [^113W8TFu] [^115uUbou].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check for preanalytical and technical issues that can artifactually lower glucose or protein and create misleading patterns. Delayed CSF processing can cause glucose to fall by roughly 3–5 mg/dL per hour, and traumatic taps can dilute protein and cells, so I need to confirm processing time, compare sequential tubes for RBC clearing, and, if needed, repeat the LP with simultaneous serum glucose to recalculate the ratio accurately [^11342pRF] [^1175HULb].

> Next, I should review immediate confirmatory steps to resolve ambiguity. I need to ensure serum glucose was obtained within 12 hours to compute the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, because a ratio less than about 0.4 supports hypoglycorrhachia and strengthens the significance of a low absolute CSF glucose; I should also add CSF lactate, which has excellent discrimination for bacterial meningitis and can help adjudicate equivocal cases, while sending bacterial and fungal cultures, cryptococcal antigen, and targeted PCR panels based on risk and seasonality [^1175HULb] [^113swvgh] [^1118L1Dv] [^111Ytib1]. If malignancy is on the table, I should request large-volume cytology and consider flow cytometry; if GLUT1 deficiency is suspected, I should arrange SLC2A1 sequencing and discuss ketogenic therapy without delay [^113UYXp7] [^117GF2Fw].

> I should confirm empiric management implications while awaiting results. In an acutely ill patient with low CSF glucose, even if protein is not high, I should not withhold empiric antimicrobials for bacterial and fungal meningitis when clinical suspicion is moderate to high, especially in immunocompromised hosts or those with risk factors, and I should tailor therapy as cultures and antigen results return; conversely, if GLUT1 deficiency is strongly suspected, I should pivot to metabolic management rather than antimicrobials to avoid overtreatment [^1119wX33] [^116DoYRE] [^117GF2Fw].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances if this case involves an infant, because normal protein and glucose values differ substantially in neonates and young infants, and relying on adult cutoffs can mislead interpretation; in this scenario, I need to apply age-specific reference intervals and maintain a low threshold to repeat LP if the clinical course evolves or initial studies are confounded by a traumatic tap or delayed processing [^117WGfQm] [^116uTh3g] [^111A28h7].

> In summary, I need to ensure that the combination of low CSF protein with low glucose is not overinterpreted as classic bacterial meningitis, which typically shows high protein; instead, I should prioritize fungal or atypical infections, early or partially treated bacterial meningitis, leptomeningeal metastasis, neurosarcoidosis or other granulomatous processes, and GLUT1 deficiency, while systematically excluding preanalytical errors and confirming the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio before anchoring on a final diagnosis [^1119wX33] [^1168oJqi] [^112g4Ci6] [^117GF2Fw].

---

Low CSF protein with low glucose is an **atypical pattern** that most often reflects **technical error** (delayed analysis, traumatic tap, or incorrect sampling) or **non-infectious causes** such as GLUT1 deficiency syndrome [^117GF2Fw], leptomeningeal metastases [^112g4Ci6], or chronic inflammatory meningitides (e.g. neurosarcoidosis) [^114PjwvC]. Infectious etiologies are uncommon with this pattern; if present, they are usually atypical or partially treated. Immediate **repeat LP** with simultaneous serum glucose, strict processing, and age-specific reference ranges [^117WGfQm] is essential to confirm the pattern and guide further workup, including metabolic testing, cytology, and targeted infectious studies [^1119wX33].

## Normal CSF protein and glucose ranges

Normal CSF protein and glucose ranges vary by age; **neonates have higher protein and lower glucose** than older infants and children [^116uTh3g]:

| **Parameter** | **Neonates (0–28 days)** | **Infants (29–60 days)** | **Older infants and children (> 2 months)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Protein (mg/dL) | 15–127 | 10–99 | 15–45 |
| Glucose (mg/dL) | 25–80 | 27–80 | 40–80 |

---

Simultaneous serum glucose should be measured to calculate the **CSF/serum glucose ratio**, normally ≥ 0.6 in adults and older children; neonates may have slightly lower ratios [^1118sW6L].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Low CSF protein with low glucose is **atypical** and suggests **non-infectious or technical causes**:

- **GLUT1 deficiency syndrome**: Impaired glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier causes low CSF glucose with normal or mildly reduced protein [^117GF2Fw].
- **Leptomeningeal metastases**: Malignant cells consume glucose, causing low CSF glucose; protein may be normal or mildly elevated but can occasionally be low [^112g4Ci6].
- **Chronic inflammatory meningitides**: Neurosarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases can cause low glucose with variable protein levels [^114PjwvC].
- **Technical errors**: Delayed analysis, traumatic taps, or incorrect sampling can artifactually lower glucose and protein [^111A28h7].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for low CSF protein and low glucose includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Partially treated bacterial meningitis <br/> - Fungal meningitis (e.g. Cryptococcus) [^notfound] <br/> - Tuberculous meningitis (early or atypical) [^notfound] |
| Non-infectious | - GLUT1 deficiency syndrome [^notfound] <br/> - Leptomeningeal metastases [^notfound] <br/> - Neurosarcoidosis [^notfound] <br/> - Chronic inflammatory meningitides |
| Technical errors | - Delayed analysis [^111A28h7] <br/> - Traumatic tap [^notfound] <br/> - Incorrect sampling |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Low CSF protein with low glucose is **clinically significant** and warrants:

- **Immediate repeat LP**: Confirm results with simultaneous serum glucose and strict processing [^116DoYRE].
- **Age-specific interpretation**: Use age-adjusted reference ranges to avoid misinterpretation [^117WGfQm].
- **Targeted testing**: Consider GLUT1 deficiency testing, cytology, and infectious studies based on clinical context [^117GF2Fw] [^112g4Ci6].
- **Empiric management**: If infection is suspected, initiate empiric therapy while awaiting confirmatory results [^115rktuN].

---

## Prognostic significance

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**. GLUT1 deficiency has a **favorable prognosis** with early ketogenic diet therapy [^113W8TFu], whereas leptomeningeal metastases and chronic inflammatory meningitides carry **variable prognoses** based on disease extent and treatment response [^113U6TnF].

---

Low CSF protein with low glucose is an **atypical pattern** that most often reflects **technical error** or **non-infectious causes** such as GLUT1 deficiency, leptomeningeal metastases, or chronic inflammatory meningitides. Infectious etiologies are uncommon; if present, they are usually atypical or partially treated. Immediate **repeat LP** with simultaneous serum glucose, strict processing, and age-specific reference ranges is essential to confirm the pattern and guide further workup, including metabolic testing, cytology, and targeted infectious studies.

### Guidelines on routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis. report from an EFNS task force [^115s1sDy]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

A great variety of neurological diseases require investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to prove the diagnosis or to rule out relevant differential diagnoses. The objectives were to evaluate the theoretical background and provide guidelines for clinical use in routine CSF analysis including total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, glucose, lactate, cell count, cytological staining, and investigation of infectious CSF. The methods included a Systematic Medline search for the above-mentioned variables and review of appropriate publications by one or more of the task force members. Grading of evidence and recommendations was based on consensus by all task force members. It is recommended that CSF should be analysed immediately after collection. If storage is needed 12 mL of CSF should be partitioned into three to four sterile tubes. Albumin CSF/serum ratio (Qalb) should be preferred to total protein measurement and normal upper limits should be related to patients' age. Elevated Qalb is a non-specific finding but occurs mainly in bacterial, cryptococcal, and tuberculous meningitis, leptomingeal metastases as well as acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies. Pathological decrease of the CSF/serum glucose ratio or increased lactate concentration indicates bacterial or fungal meningitis or leptomeningeal metastases. Intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis is best demonstrated by isoelectric focusing followed by specific staining. Cellular morphology (cytological staining) should be evaluated whenever pleocytosis is found or leptomeningeal metastases or pathological bleeding is suspected. Computed tomography-negative intrathecal bleeding should be investigated by bilirubin detection.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^1119wX33]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a diagnostic tool for many conditions affecting the central nervous system. Urgent indications for lumbar puncture include suspected central nervous system infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. CSF analysis is not necessarily diagnostic but can be useful in the evaluation of other neurologic conditions, such as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and malignancy. Bacterial meningitis has a high mortality rate and characteristic effects on CSF white blood cell counts, CSF protein levels, and the CSF:serum glucose ratio. CSF culture can identify causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivities. Viral meningitis can present similarly to bacterial meningitis but usually has a low mortality rate. Adjunctive tests such as CSF lactate measurement, latex agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction testing can help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes of meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may have meningitis caused by tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, or fungal or parasitic infections. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high mortality rate, and rapid diagnosis is key to improve outcomes. Computed tomography of the head is nearly 100% sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first six hours after symptom onset, but CSF analysis may be required if there is a delay in presentation or if imaging findings are equivocal. Xanthochromia and an elevated red blood cell count are characteristic CSF findings in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can mimic central nervous system infection. It has a poor prognosis, and large-volume CSF cytology is diagnostic.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1118L1Dv]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Longitudinal analysis of CSF glucose.

Calculating changes in glucose and proteins in repeated CSF samples compared with the corresponding initial CSF sample in microbial meningitis revealed that a linear relationship was conserved over time between these 2 markers with absolute CSF glucose (n = 83 samples in 52 patients, β = −35.1, R² = 46%, p < 0.001, figure 2) or the glucose ratio (n = 52 samples in 47 patients, β = −0.3, R² = 49%, p < 0.001).

Figure 2
Longitudinal relationship between CSF glucose and protein changes

Delta glucose and changes in proteins represent the difference between a repeat CSF sample and the corresponding initial CSF sample. Note the strong linear relationship (p = 10⁻¹²) and the fact that most data points fall either in the upper left quadrant (improvement) or in the lower right quadrant (worsening), indicating an inverse correlation between CSF glucose and protein levels.

Receiver operating characteristics.

As shown in figure 3, thresholds that are typically used clinically (CSF glucose < 40 mg/dL or glucose ratio < 0.4) yielded sensitivities around 53% and 55% and specificities around 89% and 82%, respectively. The specificity for microbial meningitis was increased to more than 90% at the expense of poorer sensitivity by decreasing the threshold to CSF glucose < 30 mg/dL or glucose ratio < 0.3, reflecting the very low CSF glucose levels seen more frequently in microbial meningitis cases (table 1).

Figure 3
Receiver operating characteristics for CSF glucose (n = 225) and serum/CSF glucose ratio (n = 156) as predictors for microbial meningitis

The sensitivity and specificity of different clinically meaningful threshold levels are shown in the inset table and at corresponding dots on the curves (low, middle, and high thresholds). Note that when a low threshold is chosen, the raw glucose and glucose ratio perform similarly with high specificity for microbial cases but very low sensitivity. On the other hand, when a high threshold is chosen, the glucose ratio performs approximately 10% better than raw glucose in terms of sensitivity for equivalent specificity. Thresholds typically used in clinical practice are in the middle range. CSFg = CSF glucose; Gr = Glucose ratio.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^113EdUS6]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Because the model included a significant interaction term between CSF protein and diagnostic category, we followed up with a stratified analysis to achieve a better understanding of the effects of each variable separately (figure 1). First, CSF protein significantly predicted CSF glucose only in the microbial category (β = −21.7, R² = 0.18, p < 0.001, figure 1B), meaning that CSF glucose inversely varied with the degree of inflammation only in the presence of a pathogen. Second, binning CSF protein levels and comparing diagnostic categories showed that CSF glucose and glucose ratios were significantly decreased in the microbial compared with the aseptic group (p ≤ 0.01 for all except p = 0.07 for absolute glucose with mild CSF protein, t test).

Figure 1
Linear relationship between CSF inflammation and glucose in meningitis; analysis stratified by diagnostic category (aseptic, n = 115 and microbial, n = 110) and levels of CSF protein

(A) Trend showing lower CSF glucose level with the higher CSF leukocyte count in the microbial category (β = −9.1, R² = 13%, p < 0.001, black line) but not in the aseptic category (yellow line, p = 0.23). (B) The CSF glucose level is significantly lowered with the elevated CSF protein level in the microbial category (β = −20.2, R² = 17%, p < 0.001, black line) but not in the aseptic category (yellow line, p = 0.28). (C–E) Stratified analysis of the effect of the diagnostic category on CSF glucose within similar degrees of inflammation as assessed by the protein levels, low (p = 0.07), intermediate (p = 0.01), and high (p < 0.01). Note that the glucose level is significantly decreased only in microbial meningitis at intermediate and high levels of CSF protein. ✱ p ≤ 0.01.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1175HULb]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

In the second part of this study, longitudinal analysis with repeated CSF sampling in a subset of patients with microbial meningitis revealed an inverse correlation between CSF protein and glucose concentration. This was interpreted as a marker of the response to treatment or the lack thereof. When microorganisms are effectively killed, inflammation decreases and glucose catabolism decreases as well. The strong linear relationship found here suggests that CSF glucose and CSF protein are valuable biomarkers to track the clinical progression of microbial meningitis.

Third, ROC analysis showed that both CSF raw glucose and the CSF-to-serum glucose ratio were specific but not sensitive tests to detect microbial meningitis at thresholds used in clinical practice. In our study, there was a mild benefit of using the glucose ratio (with serum levels obtained within 12 hours) instead of raw glucose to achieve higher sensitivity (approximately 10% increase), and it therefore probably reflects a more accurate estimation of glucose repartition in the 2 compartments. For these reasons, it should be preferred over absolute CSF glucose when making clinical predictions; however, our data illustrate that it is not a widespread practice. We did not have enough time points to investigate whether the glucose ratio obtained within shorter time frames (e.g. ± 2 hours) would yield better ROC.

The limitations of the study include its use of single-center retrospectively collected laboratory measures without the ability to further explore pathologic mechanisms or control for uniform collection of variables. In a prospective study asking the same questions, a number of additional control variables could be collected. The blood-brain barrier integrity could be assessed by parallel measurement of albumin in the plasma and CSF. Lactate quantification could clarify a potential role for anaerobic metabolism. Proteins could be further separated into those of microbial origin and immunoglobulins. Microbial load could be quantified using PCR, and a tight CSF-to-serum glucose ratio could be assessed systematically. Although promising, newer biomarkers such as serum or CSF procalcitoninand serum C-reactive proteinhave not yet replaced CSF glucose in the evaluation of meningitis and were not systematically available in our data set. We did not include carcinomatous meningitis in our analysis, but doing this could provide yet another interesting angle, as cancerous cells are known to be highly catabolic. Overall, the aim of our analyses was to describe the relationship between CSF variables, as opposed to building a predictive score for the diagnosis of microbial meningitis that should be the focus of a larger prospective study. The percentage of diagnoses should be considered as information on the data used here and not as a cross-sectional study on meningitis differential diagnosis.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^116e5Six]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Samples.

We included 225 inflammatory CSF (pleocytosis ≥ 6 × 10⁶ cell/L) obtained by lumbar puncture at the time of clinical presentation into the main analysis and 83 additional repeat samples belonging to the same patients (cutoff: 7 days to 1 month) into the longitudinal analyses (supplemental information and figure e-1). The University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol and granted a waiver of informed consent for retrospective chart review with no patient contact.

Variables.

Absolute CSF glucose (mg/dL, n = 225) and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios (abbreviated glucose ratio, with a cutoff for serum glucose within 12 hours of CSF, n = 156, 69.0% and 67.0% of the microbial and aseptic cases, respectively) were tabulated alongside CSF protein, CSF cell count and differential (missing for 13), and serum leukocyte count (obtained within 24 hours of CSF sampling), age at presentation, sex, HIV and diabetes status, and whether the meningitis was immediately (postoperative) or remotely (shunt infections) associated with neurosurgery. In the case of CSF samples with a high number of red blood cells, we reviewed the chart to check whether the lumbar puncture was traumatic and accordingly selected data coming from the last tube collected (aseptic, n = 9 and microbial, n = 8). We dichotomized the diagnoses into 2 groups: microbial and aseptic meningitis (supplemental information for details). All statistical analyses were performed on the entire database on absolute CSF glucose and repeated for the subset of patients on the glucose ratio to ensure congruent results.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^11342pRF]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Lumbar puncture is frequently performed in primary care. Properly interpreted tests can make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a key tool in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases. Proper evaluation of CSF depends on knowing which tests to order, normal ranges for the patient's age, and the test's limitations. Protein level, opening pressure, and CSF-to-serum glucose ratio vary with age. Xanthochromia is most often caused by the presence of blood, but several other conditions should be considered. The presence of blood can be a reliable predictor of subarachnoid hemorrhage but takes several hours to develop. The three-tube method, commonly used to rule out a central nervous system hemorrhage after a "traumatic tap", is not completely reliable. Red blood cells in CSF caused by a traumatic tap or a subarachnoid hemorrhage artificially increase the white blood cell count and protein level, thereby confounding the diagnosis. Diagnostic uncertainty can be decreased by using accepted corrective formulas. White blood cell differential may be misleading early in the course of meningitis, because more than 10 percent of cases with bacterial infection will have an initial lymphocytic predominance and viral meningitis may initially be dominated by neutrophils. Culture is the gold standard for determining the causative organism in meningitis. However, polymerase chain reaction is much faster and more sensitive in some circumstances. Latex agglutination, with high sensitivity but low specificity, may have a role in managing partially treated meningitis. To prove herpetic, cryptococcal, or tubercular infection, special staining techniques or collection methods may be required.

### Pragmatic and evidence-based approach to paediatric cerebrospinal fluid reference limits for white cell count and concentrations of total protein and glucose [^116uTh3g]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

It is often impractical for each laboratory to establish its own paediatric reference intervals. This is particularly true for specimen types collected using invasive procedures, for example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Methods

Published CSF reference intervals for white cell count, and concentrations of total protein and glucose were reviewed by stakeholders in a paediatric hospital. Consensus reference intervals for the three CSF parameters were then subjected to verification using guidelines from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and residual CSF specimens.

Results

Consensus paediatric reference intervals adapted from published studies with minor modifications were locally verified as follows. White cell count (×10⁶ cells/L): 0–20 (< 1month); 0–10 (1–2 months); 0–5 (> 2 months). Total protein (g/L): 0.3–1.2 (< 1month); 0.2–0.6 (1–3 months); 0.1–0.4 (> 3 months). Glucose (mmol/L): 2.0–5.6 (< 6 months); 2.4–4.3 (6 months or older).

Cryptococcosis — diagnosis in people with HIV — is usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis and most commonly presents as subacute meningoencephalitis, and initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis generally shows mildly elevated protein levels, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and a variable pleocytosis mostly of lymphocytes. Some people with advanced HIV may have very few CSF inflammatory cells, and a Gram stain or an India ink preparation, if available, may reveal numerous yeast forms.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^113UYXp7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases — patient evaluation and CSF diagnosis: Patients present with signs and symptoms ranging from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion of the brain or spinal cord, alteration of the local blood supply, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways leading to increased intracranial pressure, or interference with normal brain function. Patients should have a physical examination with a careful neurologic evaluation, and MRI of the brain and spine should also be performed for accurate staging, particularly if the patient is a candidate for active treatment. A definitive diagnosis is most commonly made by CSF analysis via lumbar puncture if it is safe for the patient, and CSF protein is typically increased with possible pleocytosis or decreased glucose levels and ultimately positive CSF cytology for tumor cells. Assessment of circulating tumor cells increases the sensitivity of tumor cell detection in CSF, is now CLIA-approved in some states, and should be done when it is available. CSF cytology testing has approximately 50% sensitivity with the first lumbar puncture, and up to 90% sensitivity after repeated CSF analyses in affected patients, and clinicians should be aware that lumbar punctures may be contraindicated in patients with anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or bulky intracranial disease.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^111thoJd]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective:

The mechanism of hypoglycorrhachia — low CSF glucose — in meningitis remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in lowering CSF glucose levels.

Methods:

We retrospectively categorized CSF profiles into microbial and aseptic meningitis and analyzed CSF leukocyte count, glucose, and protein concentrations. We assessed the relationship between these markers using multivariate and stratified linear regression analysis for initial and repeated CSF sampling. We also calculated the receiver operating characteristics of CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios to presumptively diagnose microbial meningitis.

Results:

We found that increasing levels of CSF inflammation were associated with decreased CSF glucose levels in the microbial but not aseptic category. Moreover, elevated CSF protein levels correlated more strongly than the leukocyte count with low CSF glucose levels on initial (R² = 36%, p < 0.001) and repeated CSF sampling (R² = 46%, p < 0.001). Hypoglycorrhachia (< 40 mg/dL) was observed in 50.1% of microbial cases, but only 9.6% of aseptic cases, most of which were neurosarcoidosis. Absolute CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios had similar low sensitivity and moderate-to-high specificity in diagnosing microbial meningitis at thresholds commonly used.

Conclusions:

The main driver of hypoglycorrhachia appears to be a combination of microbial meningitis with moderate to high degrees of CSF inflammation and proteins, suggesting that the presence of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose is a determinant of hypoglycorrhachia in meningitis. A major notable exception is neurosarcoidosis. Low CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios are useful markers for the diagnosis of microbial meningitis.

RESULTS

Patients and CSF samples.

We included 115 aseptic and 110 microbial meningitis cases with similar demographics (tables 1 and 2). Both included a minority of pediatric cases (10.4% vs 10.9%), with ages ranging from 2 to 88 and 5–90 years, respectively. Microbial cases were more likely to be men, to have a history of neurosurgery and to be HIV infected. As expected in the microbial category, the white blood cell count was slightly increased, average absolute CSF glucose and glucose ratios were decreased, and, conversely, CSF inflammatory markers were increased. These variables were tested as potential confounders in the model below.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1168oJqi]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypoglycorrhachia — low CSF glucose — has been recognized since the 1930s, as a critical clinical laboratory finding with the potential to influence treatment of meningitis and is therefore reported within 1 hour by most laboratories. Marked hypoglycorrhachia has traditionally been viewed as a predictor of microbial meningitis (caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites, but not viruses) in both adults and childrenand heralds poor outcomes including death. The differential diagnosis for hypoglycorrhachia includes not only microbial but also neoplastic causes as well as select primary inflammatory meningitides such as neurosarcoidosis. While neoplastic meningitis can usually be suspected when it presents in the context of a known malignancy, microbial and aseptic etiologies (viral, chemical, and autoimmune) can be difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds alone. To date, and more than a hundred years after the first observations, hypoglycorrhachia remains an important CSF marker for etiologic diagnosis, as serology, microbiology, and cytology have low sensitivity and can take days until results are available. Finding the etiology is key, as immediate initiation of the correct targeted treatment against specific pathogens improves prognosis.

Despite intense experimental meningitis research in the 1960s, the pathophysiology underlying CSF glucose depletion remains controversial. Because hypoglycorrhachia is associated with higher degrees of CSF inflammation, it has long been debated whether inflammation or microbial load is most responsible for depleting CSF glucose. Commonly cited mechanisms include increased glucose catabolism by leukocytes, microorganisms, or the brain parenchyma, as well as altered glucose transport across inflamed meninges. The introduction of bacteria in cisternal CSF decreased glucose within a few hours, arguing in favor of direct microbial catabolism, but the effect was not confirmed in leukopenic dogs, suggesting that the host inflammatory response is also necessary to cause hypoglycorrhachia. Induction of chemical meningitis did not alter CSF glucose, showing that inflammation alone may not be sufficient and suggesting the presence of a synergy with microbial metabolism. Finally, the uptake of radiolabeled glucose was increased in neutrophils derived from purulent CSF, showing that they contribute to glucose depletion. To our knowledge, these experimental results have never been correlated with large human clinical data sets, despite recent advances in the understanding of immune mechanisms at play in meningitis.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^1128Gooq]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The mechanism of hypoglycorrhachia-low CSF glucose-in meningitis remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in lowering CSF glucose levels.

Methods

We retrospectively categorized CSF profiles into microbial and aseptic meningitis and analyzed CSF leukocyte count, glucose, and protein concentrations. We assessed the relationship between these markers using multivariate and stratified linear regression analysis for initial and repeated CSF sampling. We also calculated the receiver operating characteristics of CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios to presumptively diagnose microbial meningitis.

Results

We found that increasing levels of CSF inflammation were associated with decreased CSF glucose levels in the microbial but not aseptic category. Moreover, elevated CSF protein levels correlated more strongly than the leukocyte count with low CSF glucose levels on initial (R² = 36%, p < 0.001) and repeated CSF sampling (R² = 46%, p < 0.001). Hypoglycorrhachia (< 40 mg/dL) was observed in 50.1% of microbial cases, but only 9.6% of aseptic cases, most of which were neurosarcoidosis. Absolute CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios had similar low sensitivity and moderate-to-high specificity in diagnosing microbial meningitis at thresholds commonly used.

Conclusions

The main driver of hypoglycorrhachia appears to be a combination of microbial meningitis with moderate to high degrees of CSF inflammation and proteins, suggesting that the presence of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose is a determinant of hypoglycorrhachia in meningitis. A major notable exception is neurosarcoidosis. Low CSF glucose and CSF-to-serum glucose ratios are useful markers for the diagnosis of microbial meningitis.

Statistical analysis.

First, we obtained univariate linear regressions of CSF inflammation markers onto CSF glucose. The distribution of CSF glucose and glucose ratios was tested for normality. The CSF leukocyte count and protein were log transformed before further analysis, as their distribution was inversely exponential. To test for independence of these predictors, we used a stepwise multivariate linear regression approach seeking global optimization of the corrected R². For fitting, we used a bisquare method to increase robustness to outliers. We initialized the model including all predictors significant at the univariate level and included all interaction terms between hypothesized predictors (diagnostic category and CSF leukocyte count) and effect modifiers (CSF protein) but left out interactions with potential confounders. In a stepwise approach, we then discarded variables that were not independent, starting with potential confounders. The final fit yielded the following model: where G is the dependent variable CSF glucose, and the explanatory variables are DM for diabetes mellitus (categorical, 1 for present), Dx for diagnostic category (categorical, 1 for microbial), and P for CSF protein (continuous). All other terms were not independent predictors, including the leukocyte count. Given the significant interaction term between 2 predictors (diagnostic category and CSF protein), a stratified post hoc t test (Bonferroni corrected, p < 0.017) was conducted using a 3-level variable for protein concentration: low (50–100 mg/dL), medium (101–180 mg/dL), and high (181–500 mg/dL). Note that the neutrophil count was not an independent predictor in the multivariate model, but because it can often distinguish between microbial and aseptic meningitis, we also repeated the stratified analysis with the absolute CSF neutrophil count categorized as low (> 20 × 10⁶/L) and high (> 50 × 10⁶/L). Sensitivity analyses of the multivariate model included exclusion of neurosurgical cases, analyzing only surgical cases, exclusion of culture-negative cases, analyzing inflammatory and infectious aseptic meningitis cases separately, and stratifying by neutrophil count.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114gx3vm]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we showed that, contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of glucophagic microorganisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, fungus, or parasite) is the predominant determinant of hypoglycorrhachia and that depletion of CSF glucose is more pronounced in the setting of more severe infections with higher pleocytosis and proteins. In the absence of such a pathogen, a similar degree of CSF inflammation is per se, not sufficient to significantly decrease CSF glucose on average, with a few notable exceptions including cases of biopsy-confirmed neurosarcoidosis. Furthermore, the degree of pleocytosis was not an independent predictor of hypoglycorrhachia when CSF protein was taken into account, and the type of pleocytosis did not play a crucial role.

From these data, we understand that either (1) the presence of both glucophagic microorganisms and a significant degree of inflammation synergistically induce hypoglycorrhachia; or (2) CSF protein is a marker for another variable we could not measure, such as microbial load and/or function of the blood-brain barrier. Of note, CSF protein in meningitis can be of microbial (e.g. bacterial wall) or endogenous origin (e.g. immunoglobulins), which may explain its predictive strength in our model as it combines 2 variables into 1 metric. Unfortunately, microbial load is not routinely measured in CSF, so we could not test this hypothesis. Taking into account early work on animal experimental meningitis, it is conceivable that a synergy between CSF inflammatory mechanisms and the presence of glucophagic microorganisms stimulates leukocytic glucose catabolism. Alternatively, glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier might be reduced as proposed in cases of tuberculous meningitisand experimental meningitis.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114pm8ah]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relative contribution of CSF inflammation vs microbial infection in driving hypoglycorrhachia in the clinical context of microbial and aseptic meningitis. We made the hypothesis that because all leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes) have the capability of catabolizing glucose, they could be a major determinant of hypoglycorrhachia, including in aseptic meningitis. We retrospectively collected meningitis CSF profiles — defined as the presence of pleocytosis — with confirmed microbial and aseptic etiologies. This dichotomization offered a natural experiment to compare CSF glucose levels along a continuum of varying degrees of CNS inflammation in the presence (microbial) or the absence (aseptic) of microorganisms capable of catabolizing glucose across a broad range of meningitis etiologies.

### Reassessing the value of CSF protein and glucose measurement in pediatric infectious meningitis [^111LB91C]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Infectious meningitis (IM) in US children is increasingly rare and new rapid multiplex PCR-based testing is increasingly available. We evaluated the added value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and glucose tests to predict IM when compared with information provided by CSF white blood cell count (WBC) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed CSF results from October 2015 to August 2017 in patients 0 to 18 years at a US children's hospital. Noninfectious evaluations were excluded. Test characteristics were calculated for CSF WBC, protein, and glucose in isolation and in parallel for prediction of microbiologically confirmed IM. Chart review was performed to identify consideration of protein and glucose in medical decision-making (MDM).

Results

We identified 735 patients including 446 < 2 months; 45 (6.1%) had microbiologically-confirmed IM, including 23 (5.2%) age < 2 months. Multiplex PCR and/or CSF WBC identified all IM patients. When added to CSF WBC, measurement of glucose made no contribution to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) or negative predictive value (NPV), and protein had no impact on sensitivity and decreased the specificity, PPV, and NPV compared with CSF WBC alone. Abnormal protein was documented in MDM in 6 (0.8%) patients, all of whom had elevated WBC counts also cited. Glucose was not mentioned in MDM.

Conclusions

Multiplex PCR testing and WBC may be sufficient to predict meningitis in children in low incidence settings. Protein and glucose did not contribute significant additional information. More intentional use of protein and glucose testing in patients with suspected IM may achieve higher value care.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^111h83sQ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include a relatively large sample size as compared to previously published data that encompassed a wide variety of confirmed etiologies including more recently recognized entities in the aseptic category, such as meningitides related to immunologic disturbances. The baseline characteristics were fairly balanced aside from an overrepresentation of men in the microbial category that we could not explain, as there are no reports suggesting a sex difference in this disease. As planned, the microbial category encompassed cases with a history of neurosurgery that may have had an impact on the blood-brain barrier permeability and thus bias glucose measurements. However, we feel that this is part of the variability of the clinical setting and serves to increase the generalizability of our findings. Indeed, repeating the analysis excluding cases with a history of neurosurgery yielded the same results (supplemental data).

In conclusion, the data presented here shed light on meningitis pathophysiology by suggesting that the presence of a pathogen and the induced changes in CSF milieu, rather than inflammation alone, underlie hypoglycorrhachia. The practical correlate is that aseptic meningitis, even with a high level of leukocytes, should remain a diagnosis of exclusion if low — especially very low (< 30 mg/dL) — CSF glucose is present. Our data also support trending CSF glucose as a marker of treatment response and suggest that CSF glucose alone is a relatively specific marker of microbial meningitis, although the CSF-to-serum ratio may be better in borderline cases. The early assessment of CSF glucose remains a vital component of the workup when a patient presents with signs of meningitis, as it can help distinguish between microbial meningitis requiring antimicrobial therapy and aseptic cases requiring very different treatment.

### Cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentration to distinguish bacterial from aseptic meningitis: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^112tZAsW]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present meta-analysis revealed that the AUC of CSF lactate concentration was 0.9840 (Figure 4), indicating an excellent level of overall accuracy. The overall performance was highest for the CSF lactate concentration compared to the performances of the four conventional markers (CSF glucose, CSF/plasma glucose quotient, CSF protein, and CSF total number of leukocytes) based on head-to-head meta-analytic SROC curves and their AUC (Figure 5), which was in good agreement with previous literature. CSF lactate is less useful if it has a low concentration, but the assay is supportive if it is positive, especially if the diagnosis was otherwise not conclusive. In such cases, increased CSF lactate should be considered a sign of BM. Because of the lactate assay, several BM patients with elevated CSF lactate and minimal CSF abnormalities have been treated with antibiotics prior to culture test results. Moreover, an increased CSF lactate level has been also proposed as a good indicator of CSF infection in intra-ventricular hemorrhagic patients with an external ventricular drain. However, clinicians should be aware that CSF lactate is also increased in several central nervous system diseases such stroke (2 to 8 mmol/l), convulsion (2 to 4 mmol/l), cerebral trauma (2 to 9 mmol/l), hypoglycemic coma (2 to 6 mmol/l).

The measurement of CSF lactate concentration is a simple, rapid, inexpensive assay, takes just 15 minutes, and can be performed at the bedside. In addition, the CSF lactate concentration is useful during the course of treatment, because a rapid CSF lactate decrease is indicative of good prognosis. Since the CSF lactate concentration is not specific for BM, the results of this assay should be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings and the results of conventional assays including CSF concentrations of protein, cells, glucose, and a microbiological examination of CSF. The cut-off value for CSF lactate concentration ranges from 2.1 to 4.44 mmol/L, suggesting a variance between instrument, hospital labs, and the method. Therefore, every center should set its own cut-off value for CSF lactate concentration. Another disadvantage of CSF lactate is that it is not useful in the choice of antibiotic selection, which must be based on the results of microscopic examination of a smear or culture for bacteria, as well as the other clinical data.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, glucose, and protein — Abnormalities of CSF cell count, glucose, and/or protein may not be reliable indicators for the presence of infection in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis (weak, moderate), and normal CSF cell count, glucose, and protein may not reliably exclude infection (weak, moderate); a negative CSF Gram stain does not exclude the presence of infection, especially in patients who have received previous antimicrobial therapy (strong, moderate). Supporting data note that CSF white blood cell counts and lactate concentrations were normal in approximately 20% of episodes in adults with shunt-associated infection, CSF eosinophilia (> 8% of the differential count) has been associated with an indolent infection, and using a looser definition (ie, > 1% of the differential count) eosinophilia correlated with CSF infection but also with subcutaneous CSF extravasation, blood in the CSF, younger age at shunt insertion, and intraventricular hemorrhage as a cause of the hydrocephalus. The CSF white blood cell count tends to be lower in samples obtained by shunt aspiration or from ventricular fluid than when obtained after lumbar puncture. In a cohort of patients with external CSF drains, lumbar catheters were placed in 125 patients (54.3%), ventricular catheters in 97 (42.2%), and more than 1 type in 8 (3.5%), with external drainage–related bacterial meningitis developing in 22 patients (9.6%); analyses of 1516 CSF samples showed no significant differences during the first 3 days of infection or during the 3 days preceding infection in leukocyte count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, or CSF-to-blood glucose ratio.

### Diagnostic yield of cerebrospinal fluid analysis in status epilepticus: an 8-year cohort study [^117Esqbt]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The underuse of CSF analyses may also be explained by the fact that during the study period no institutional guidelines regarding the performance of lumbar punctures were in place and that the guidelines of the Neurocritical Care Society only provide vague recommendations that lumbar puncture should be considered in specific cases, and most other SE guidelines do not even mention the lumbar puncture and CSF analyses as an important diagnostic step. Our finding that infectious pathogens were identified in every fifth patient in whom CSF was analyzed indicates that in SE patients without known etiology, infections of the CNS are frequent and may be underestimated due to the underuse of CSF analyses. This comes along with a high probability of underdiagnosed autoimmune diseases as screening for autoimmune diseases was not performed systematically in our patients with persistent unknown etiology of SE. Although it is unclear why current guidelines "toned down" or neglected the importance of CSF analyses, our results suggest that CSF analyses should be performed more frequently, since many patients have a persistent undetermined etiology of SE and lumbar puncture is safe if neuroimaging reveals no signs of increased intracranial pressure.

The fact that lumbar puncture was less frequently performed, especially in patients with convulsive SE, may be explained by the fact that during convulsions invasive diagnostic procedures put the patients at additional risks of injury in conjunction with unpredictable motor activity of the patient. However, as most patients were in refractory SE for more than 24 h and treated with the induction of deep coma, this assumption may only be a partial explanation.

Another important finding is the large proportion of abnormal chemical and/or cellular CSF components in patients in whom microbiologic workup did not detect infectious pathogens. To what degree these CSF findings were explained by the inflammation as a result of an excessive intracerebral increase of neurotransmitters to neurotoxic concentrations due to SE per se or by undetected or unsuspected autoimmune CNS disease remains unclear, as screening for autoantibodies was left to the discretion of the clinician and was not performed systematically. Although glucose CSF/serum ratios and lactate concentrations were mostly unremarkable, CSF protein levels and leukocyte counts were frequently and noticeably increased even without detectable infectious pathogens. In this context, it is important to mention that according to a recent systematic review there is concordance in the available literature to recommend increasing CSF total protein upper reference limits and to consider implementing age-adjusted values above 600 mg/L starting at age 50. However, when talking this into account, only 6 patients with a protein level above 500 mg/L without proof of infectious or autoimmune encephalitis were then still considered within the normal range.

Diagnosis

Figure 4 outlines a plan for approaching patients with suspected CM, encompassing clinical features, differential diagnosis and basic investigations. Box 1 presents practical diagnostic tips, and figure 5 shows images of important diagnostic tests. CM diagnostics have been transformed in recent years, but it is still useful to know the characteristic findings of CSF analysis. These include elevated opening pressure in the left lateral position (sitting lumbar puncture (LP) pressures are unreliable), lymphocytic pleocytosis, high CSF protein and low CSF glucose. In HIV-CM, the CSF white cell count may be lower than expected, or even normal, so it is important to perform specialised tests as outlined in table 1. The recommendations made in table 1 are adapted from the British Society for Medical Mycology 2015 best practice guidelines.

Box 1
Diagnostic tips

Think about cryptococcal meningitis (CM) if your patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows abnormal white cell count (especially lymphocytosis), glucose or protein concentrations.
In a UK setting, for the correct CSF tests to be performed, it is important to specify that a patient is immunocompromised on the test request, or notify the laboratory.
India ink microscopy is no longer recommended unless cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) lateral flow assays are unavailable.
Serum and CSF CrAg are qualitative lateral flow tests with high sensitivity and specificity — in symptomatic patients, negative CSF CrAg effectively rules out CM.
Once positive, CrAg remains so for many months — it cannot be used to monitor treatment response or to diagnose early CM relapse.
Fungal culture can be helpful for diagnosis, but treatment is not usually contingent on antifungal sensitivities; it is, therefore, most useful in CM recurrence and relapse.
Where possible, a contrast-enhanced MRI brain should be performed within 48 hours in immunocompromised patients with suspected or proven meningitis and/or new neurological features such as seizures, persistent headache and altered mental state.

### Effect of delay in analysis on neonatal cerebrospinal fluid parameters [^111A28h7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The effect of delayed analysis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count and glucose has never been studied in neonates.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Level III newborn unit.

Patients

Neonates undergoing lumbar puncture were enrolled after consent. CSF was analysed at baseline (30 minutes) for protein, WBC and glucose; and from the same sample for WBC and glucose after a lag of 2 h and 4 h after lumbar puncture. Those with traumatic/inadequate CSF were excluded. Subjects were classified in three groups (n = 20 each) based on baseline WBC count: no WBC, 1–30 WBC and > 30 WBC/microl. Analysis was by repeated-measures ANOVA.

Results

There was a significant decline in mean (SD) CSF glucose from baseline to 2 h and 4 h (41.0 (19) to 38.3 (19) and 36.2 (20) mg/dl, respectively) and WBC count (36 (45) to 28.6 (38) and 23.8 (34) cells/microl, respectively; both p < 0.001). CSF glucose and WBC declined in all three groups (p < 0.001). High baseline CSF WBC (p < 0.001) and protein (p < 0.001) was associated with a more rapid decline in the levels of CSF WBC, but not glucose. True CSF parameters could be predicted from 4-h parameters: "baseline glucose 5.4 + 0.98 (4-h glucose)" (adjusted R² 97.2%, p < 0.001) and "baseline WBC 1.3 (4-h WBC) +0.05 (protein)" (adjusted R² 98.8%, p < 0.001). In group 3, a diagnosis of meningitis (based on pleocytosis) would be missed in 52.6% and 78.9% subjects at 2 h and 4 h, respectively.

Conclusions

CSF WBC count and glucose decrease significantly with time. Reliance on WBC counts of delayed samples can result in underdiagnosis.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^114PjwvC]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Low glucose in aseptic meningitis.

Among aseptic meningitis cases (n = 115), only 11 cases (9.6%) had CSF glucose lower than 40 mg/dL (median 33, range 16–37 mg/dL). Eight cases were neurosarcoidosis (half confirmed by brain and the other half by lung biopsy), a diagnosis that has been associated with hypoglycorrhachia in the literature. The remaining cases were 2 neuromyelitis optica with positive aquaporin-4 serum antibodies (one with mild hypoglycemia of 64 mg/dL and the other with correction of the hypoglycorrhachia on the next day) and 1 brain biopsy–confirmed small vessel CNS vasculitis with associated leptomeningitis. The median age was 43 years (range 28–64 years), and 9 were women. CSF inflammatory markers were moderately elevated including proteins (median 125, range 65–300 mg/dL) and leukocytes (median 58, range 9–685 × 10⁶ cells/L) with a lymphocytic predominance (78.4% ± 27.7% lymphocytes and 3.3% ± 4.5% neutrophils).

### Neonatal meningitis: what is the correlation among cerebrospinal fluid cultures, blood cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid parameters? [^114knvkY]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Meningitis is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Clinicians frequently use the presence of positive blood cultures to determine whether neonates should undergo lumbar puncture. Abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters are often used to predict neonatal meningitis and determine length and type of antibiotic therapy in neonates with a positive blood culture and negative CSF culture.

Methods

We evaluated the first lumbar puncture of 9111 neonates at ≥ 34 weeks' estimated gestational age from 150 NICUs, managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. CSF culture results were compared with results of blood cultures and CSF parameters (white blood cells [WBCs], glucose, and protein) to establish the concordance of these values in culture-proven meningitis. CSF cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci and other probable contaminants, as well as fungal and viral pathogens, were excluded from analyses.

Results

Meningitis was confirmed by culture in 95 (1.0%) neonates. Of the 95 patients with meningitis, 92 had a documented blood culture. Only 57 (62%) of 92 patients had a concomitant-positive blood culture; 35 (38%) of 92 had a negative blood culture. In neonates with both positive blood and CSF cultures, the organisms isolated were discordant in 2 (3.5%) of 57 cases. In each case, the CSF pathogen required different antimicrobial therapy than the blood pathogen. For culture-proven meningitis, CSF WBC counts of > 0 cells per mm³ had sensitivity at 97% and specificity at 11%. CSF WBC counts of > 21 cells per mm³ had sensitivity at 79% and specificity at 81%. Culture-proven meningitis was not diagnosed accurately by CSF glucose or by protein.

Conclusions

Neonatal meningitis frequently occurs in the absence of bacteremia and in the presence of normal CSF parameters. No single CSF value can reliably exclude the presence of meningitis in neonates. The CSF culture is critical to establishing the diagnosis of neonatal meningitis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcosis in HIV — diagnosis and screening: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generally demonstrates mildly elevated levels of serum protein, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and pleocytosis consisting mostly of lymphocytes, and the opening pressure in the CSF may be elevated, with pressures ≥ 25 cm H₂O occurring in 60% to 80% of patients. Cryptococcal disease can be diagnosed through culture, CSF microscopy, or by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection; in patients with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis, 55% of blood cultures and 95% of CSF cultures are positive and visible colonies can be detected within 7 days. India ink staining of CSF demonstrates encapsulated yeast in 60% to 80% of cases. CSF CrAg is usually positive in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, serum CrAg is usually positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset, and a positive serum CrAg should prompt a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal disease. Three methods exist for antigen detection — latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassays, and lateral flow assay — and testing for the antigen in the serum is a useful initial screening tool in diagnosing cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients and may be particularly useful when a lumbar puncture is delayed or refused.

### Meningitis in adult patients with a negative direct cerebrospinal fluid examination: value of cytochemical markers for differential diagnosis [^112EY6Z4]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Low CSF glucose levels (2 to 2.5 mmol/L) and a low CSF/serum glucose ratio (on the order of 0.30 to 0.40) have been classically described as a feature of BM. Spanos reported a median CSF glucose level of 3.4 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.45) in patients with BM and a negative direct examination of the CSF, compared with 1.7 mmol/L (CSF/serum glucose ratio, 0.23) in 134 patients with BM and a positive direct CSF examination. Similar values were seen in the patients included in our study, although CSF glucose levels were more markedly reduced.

Elevated CSF protein levels are also seen in patients with BM, mean values ranging from 1 to 2.5 g/L. With regard to the differential diagnosis of BM, the reported sensitivity of this parameter ranged from 63% to 86% with a specificity of 94% to 98%. Normal CSF protein values were found in 10% of patients with BM and a negative direct CSF examination. In our study, a CSF protein level of 1.88 g/L gave a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of BM. Normal levels of protein in the CSF were seen in 5% of the patients with BM in our study.

### Meta-analysis of cerebrospinal fluid cell count and biochemistry to diagnose meningitis in infants aged [^114Nz4ut]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count, protein, and glucose (cytochemistry) are performed to aid in the diagnosis of meningitis in young infants. However, studies have reported varying diagnostic accuracies. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CSF cytochemistry in infants below 90 days and determined the certainty of evidence.

Study Design

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus databases in August 2021. We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CSF cytochemistry compared with CSF culture, Gram stain, or polymerase chain reaction in neonates and young infants < 90 days with suspected meningitis. We pooled data using the hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) model.

Results

Of the 10,720 unique records, 16 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, with a cumulative sample size of 31,695 (15 studies) for WBC, 12,936 (11 studies) for protein, and 1,120 (4 studies) for glucose. The median (Q 1, Q 3) specificities of WBC, protein, and glucose were 87 (82, 91), 89 (81, 94), and 91% (76, 99), respectively. The pooled sensitivities (95% confidence interval [CI]) at median specificity of WBC count, protein, and glucose were 90 (88, 92), 92 (89, 94), and 71% (54, 85), respectively. The area (95% CI) under ROC curves were 0.89 (0.87, 0.90), 0.87 (0.85, 0.88), and 0.81 (0.74, 0.88) for WBC, protein, and glucose, respectively. There was an unclear/high risk of bias and applicability concern in most studies. Overall certainty of the evidence was moderate. A bivariate model-based analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy at specific thresholds could not be conducted due to a paucity of data.

Conclusion

CSF WBC and protein have good diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of meningitis in infants below 90 days of age. CSF glucose has good specificity but poor sensitivity. However, we could not identify enough studies to define an optimal threshold for the positivity of these tests.

Key Points

· Median specificity of CSF leucocyte count, protein and glucose are similar in young infants. · At median specificity, CSF leukocyte count and protein are more sensitive than glucose. · Owing to inadequate data, bivariate modelling to suggest optimal diagnostic thresholds is not possible.

### Accuracy and test characteristics of ancillary tests of cerebrospinal fluid for predicting acute bacterial meningitis in children with low white blood cell counts in cerebrospinal fluid [^113qAUFg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether ancillary tests of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), specifically, the total protein concentration, glucose concentration, and percent neutrophils, provide information for diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis among children with low white blood cell (WBC) count in CSF.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed CSF from children aged 1 month to 18 years undergoing lumbar puncture at Children's Hospital in Boston from 1993 to 1999. Data were supplemented with CSF test results obtained from children with 0–30 WBCs/mm(3) in CSF diagnosed with acute bacterial meningitis at the same institution from 1984 to 1992. For each test, the incremental value of ancillary tests was estimated by calculating indices of performance such as the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) and interval likelihood ratios that are relatively insensitive to disease prevalence.

Results

Among children with 0–30 WBCs/mm(3) in CSF who met study criteria, acute bacterial meningitis was identified in ten of 7,701 (0.1%) for the period from 1993 to 1999 and supplemented with 11 additional cases for the period from 1984 to 1992. AUC values for ancillary tests were 0.61 for total protein concentration, 0.69 for glucose concentration, and 0.90 for percent neutrophils. Interval likelihood ratios were unremarkable for mildly abnormal test results. In contrast, interval likelihood ratios for markedly abnormal test results were higher: 22 for total protein concentration > 120 mg/dL, 57 for neutrophils > 75%, 15 for glucose concentration < 20 mg/dL, and 20 for glucose concentration > 120 mg/dL.

Conclusions

When markedly abnormal, results of CSF total protein concentration, glucose concentration, and percent neutrophils have value for diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis, even among children with a low WBC count in CSF.

### C. neoformans meningitis without pleocytosis, hyperproteinorrachia, and hypoglycorrhachia on cerebrospinal fluid studies [^115rktuN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis is typically aided through CSF analysis obtained via lumbar puncture (LP), revealing elevated WBCs, increased protein, decreased glucose, and increased opening pressure. While CSF culture confirms the diagnosis, it takes days, prompting reliance on these adjuncts. AIDS from Human Immunodeficiency Virus is less commonly diagnosed in the emergency setting due to advances in testing and treatment. This case highlights fungal meningitis in an undiagnosed AIDS patient, where positive CSF cryptococcal antigen enabled timely diagnosis despite normal CSF findings, emphasizing the importance of rapid diagnostic tests in high-risk patients even when CSF results appear normal. A 30-year-old male with no prior medical history presented with 3.5 weeks of nausea, vomiting, headache, and back pain. He showed signs of cachexia, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Initial CSF analyses were within normal limits for glucose, WBC, and protein, but cryptococcal antigen was positive. He was treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine. CSF cultures confirmed C. neoformans, and serial LPs monitored elevated opening pressures, requiring a VP shunt. The patient was diagnosed with AIDS (CD4 6 cells/mm³). This case underscores that C. neoformans can present with normal CSF studies, delaying diagnosis and treatment, highlighted by the fact that this patient went undiagnosed in the preceding 3.5 weeks. CSF cryptococcal antigen and opening pressure are critical diagnostic tools, enabling timely antifungal therapy. Given the high mortality rate, early empirical treatment is essential, especially in high-risk patients, even when CSF findings seem normal.

### Analysis of the risk of shunt failure or infection related to cerebrospinal fluid cell count, protein level, and glucose levels in low-birth-weight premature infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus [^111X1EBM]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Premature, low-birth-weight infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus have a high risk of shunt obstruction and infection. Established risk factors for shunt failure include grade of the hemorrhage and age at shunt insertion. There is anecdotal evidence that the amount of red blood cells or protein levels in the CSF may affect shunt performance. However, this has not been analyzed specifically for this cohort of high-risk patients. Therefore, the authors performed this study to examine whether any statistical relationship exists between the CSF constituents and the rate of shunt malfunction or infection in this population.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed on premature infants born at Riley Hospital for Children from 2000 to 2009. Inclusion criteria were a CSF sample analyzed within 2 weeks prior to shunt insertion, low birth weight (< 1500 grams), prematurity (birth prior to 37 weeks estimated gestational age), and shunt insertion for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Data points included the gestational age at birth and shunt insertion, weight at birth and shunt insertion, history of CNS infection prior to shunt insertion, shunt failure, shunt infection, and the levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, protein, and glucose in the CSF. Statistical analysis was performed to determine any association between shunt outcome and the CSF parameters.

Results

Fifty-eight patients met the study entry criteria. Ten patients (17.2%) had primary shunt failure within 3 months of insertion. Nine patients (15.5%) had shunt infection within 3 months. A previous CNS infection prior to shunt insertion was a statistical risk factor for shunt failure (p = 0.0290) but not for shunt infection. There was no statistical relationship between shunt malfunction or infection and the CSF levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, protein, or glucose before shunt insertion.

Conclusions

Low-birth-weight premature infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus have a high rate of shunt failure and infection. The authors did not find any association of shunt failure or infection with CSF cell count, protein level, or glucose level. Therefore, it may not be useful to base the timing of shunt insertion on CSF parameters.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome: a systematic review [^117GF2Fw]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a treatable neurometabolic disorder, characterized by a low concentration of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a decreased CSF to blood glucose ratio. Reports of patients with apparently normal CSF glucose levels, however, have raised the question whether CSF analysis is a reliable screening tool for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Objective

To determine the value of CSF analysis in the workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Evidence Review

PubMed was searched until July 2012 by using the terms glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency syndrome, glucose transporter defect, and SLC2A1-gene. Relevant references mentioned in the articles were also included. The CSF results of all patients with genetically proven GLUT1 deficiency syndrome described in literature were reevaluated.

Findings

The levels of glucose in CSF, the CSF to blood glucose ratios, and the levels of lactate in CSF were reported for 147 (94%), 152 (97%), and 73 (46%) of 157 patients, respectively. The CSF glucose levels ranged from 16.2 to 50.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for all 147 patients. The CSF to blood glucose ratios ranged from 0.19 to 0.59 and were at or below the 10th percentile for 139 of 152 patients (91%), but they could be within the normal range as well. The CSF lactate levels ranged from 5.4 to 13.5 mg/dL and were at or below the 10th percentile for 59 of 73 patients (81%). A typical CSF profile for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, which is defined as a CSF glucose level at or below the 10th percentile, a CSF to blood glucose ratio at or below the 25th percentile, and a CSF lactate level at or below the 10th percentile, was found in only 35 of 4099 CSF samples (0.9%) present in our CSF database of patients who received a diagnosis other than GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

Conclusions and Relevance

We conclude that if age-specific reference values are applied, CSF glucose and lactate levels are adequate biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Future availability of whole-exome sequencing in clinical practice will make the existence of a reliable biomarker for GLUT1 deficiency syndrome even more important, in order to interpret genetic results and, even more importantly, not to miss SLC2A1-negative patients with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^112hgTWF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidal meningitis — cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging findings — Coccidioidal diagnosis requires laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); abnormal CSF is the hallmark of all meningitis, the opening pressure should always be measured if technically feasible, and the CSF should be submitted for differential analysis of the cells, glucose, protein, fungal culture, coccidioidal antibodies by immunodiffusion and/or complement fixation, and coccidioidal antigen. Typical CSF patterns include pleocytosis in the range of double digits to hundreds, but occasionally thousands, lymphocytic predominance with possible early neutrophilic predominance, eosinophils as an important clue, protein commonly > 150 mg/dL, and glucose commonly depressed to less than one-half to two-thirds of the fasting blood sugar value (nondiabetic). A positive CSF culture is a low frequency event, but when the clinical presentation is unexplained hydrocephalus, initial ventricular cultures are commonly positive; the presence of immunodiffusion or CF IgG antibody is nearly as specific but lacks sensitivity, with only 30%–60% positive initially, and diagnosis is most commonly made by clinical and CSF parameters plus IgG antibody in the serum. Neuroimaging may further support diagnosis, preferably by gadolinium-enhanced MRI; at initial diagnosis, approximately 50% of patients have a discernible abnormality, and a negative CT or MRI result does not exclude CM.

### Cerebrospinal fluid reference values for young infants undergoing lumbar puncture [^117WGfQm]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine age-specific reference values and quantify age-related changes for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) counts and protein and glucose concentrations in infants ≤ 60 days of age.

Methods

This multicenter, cross-sectional study included infants ≤ 60 days old with CSF cultures and complete CSF profiles obtained within 24 hours of presentation. Those with conditions suspected or known to cause abnormal CSF parameters (eg, meningitis) and those with a hospital length of stay of > 72 hours were excluded. Reference standards were determined for infants ≤ 28 days of age and 29 to 60 days of age by using the third quartile +1.5 interquartile range for WBC and protein and the first quartile -1.5 interquartile range for glucose. CSF parameter centile curves based on age were calculated by using the LMST method.

Results

A total of 7766 patients were included. CSF WBC counts were higher in infants ≤ 28 days of age (upper bound: 15 cells/mm³) than in infants 29 to 60 days of age (upper bound: 9 cells/mm³; P < .001). CSF protein concentrations were higher in infants ≤ 28 days of age (upper bound: 127 mg/dL) than in infants 29 to 60 days of age (upper bound: 99 mg/dL; P < .001). CSF glucose concentrations were lower in infants ≤ 28 days of age (lower bound: 25 mg/dL) than in infants 29 to 60 days of age (lower bound: 27 mg/dL; P < .001).

Conclusions

The age-specific CSF WBC count, protein concentration, and glucose concentration reference values identified in this large, multicenter cohort of infants can be used to interpret the results of lumbar puncture in infants ≤ 60 days of age.

### Assessment of diagnostic yield of nonculture infection testing on cerebrospinal fluid in immune-competent children [^115oZucH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections, such as meningitis and encephalitis, require prompt recognition of treatable etiologies (eg, bacterial pathogens, herpes simplex virus [HSV]) to reduce potentially significant morbidity and mortality. Infections of the CNS are typically identified with lumbar puncture and evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts, protein, glucose, Gram stain, bacterial culture, and nonculture infection tests. A CSF white blood cell (WBC) count lower than 5 cells/μL in immune-competent children older than 2 months is considered normal, whereas a count of 5 cells/μL or higher suggests infection and/or inflammation(to convert to ×10⁹ per liter, multiply by 0.001). The presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in CSF samples represents either intrathecal blood (eg, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage) or introduction of peripheral blood into CSF during the performance of the lumbar puncture. Introduction of peripheral blood into otherwise sterile CSF may result in the potential contamination of a bloodstream pathogen, and it also makes the CSF WBC difficult to clinically interpret because an elevated count may reflect a true pleocytosis and/or peripheral blood WBCs.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF and antigen or antibody assays are used to identify specific pathogens in suspected CNS infection; however, their overall diagnostic yield is variable. Nonculture CSF infection test sensitivity and specificity are high for some organisms (eg, HSV PCR, enterovirus PCR) but are low for others (eg, Borrelia burgdorferi PCR and antibody assays). The positive and negative predictive values, as well as the clinical advantages of these tests in populations with a low pretest probability for CNS infection (such as immune-competent children with normal CSF cell counts), are unknown.

Laboratory testing with little clinical advantage but a disproportionately high cost is one example of low-value care. When a lumbar puncture is performed, frontline clinicians often order nonculture CSF infection tests concurrently with CSF cell counts, protein level, glucose level, and Gram stain to optimize administrative workflow and minimize the potential need later to collect more CSF. Even though lumbar puncture has a low complication rate, it often requires sedation for children, making a repeated procedure undesirable. To determine if ordering practices and laboratory workflow for nonculture CSF infection tests may be a target to reduce low-value care in pediatrics, we sought to identify the frequency of positive nonculture CSF infection tests and their association with the clinical care of immune-competent children with normal CSF cell counts.

### Pleocytosis is not fully responsible for low CSF glucose in meningitis [^116Ngdnv]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Microbial and aseptic meningitis differ in their immune inflammatory responses, as illustrated by the presence of neutrophilic vs lymphocytic pleocytosis. For this reason, we also evaluated the effect of the absolute neutrophil count alone and found no difference in the interpretation of results with the caveat that relatively few samples contributed to this analysis. We also observed that all eleven outlying cases of aseptic meningitis with low CSF glucose had a lymphocytic pleocytosis, supporting the idea that hypoglycorrhachia is independent of the leukocyte type. These cases were for the most part (8/11) biopsy-proven neurosarcoidosis, confirming previous reports. As exemplified by the typical granulomatous inflammation found on pathology, neurosarcoidosis resembles inflammatory responses to microbial meningitis. Little is known about the exact molecular pathways of neuroinflammation in neurosarcoidosis, but whole blood transcriptome analyses of patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis resemble that of inflammatory responses to active mycobacterial infection. If involvement of similar inflammatory responses in the brain was confirmed, this may provide a clue for why CSF glucose can be low in neurosarcoidosis but not in other archetypical CNS inflammatory disorders. Pathway analysis, rather than cell-type analysis, might provide novel insights into mechanisms of hypoglycorrhachia in aseptic meningitis. Thus, other aspects of meningeal inflammation, which were not directly measured here, may be the common denominator in determining hypoglycorrhachia.

### Tuberculous meningitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, diagnostic challenges, and the potential of biomarker-based approaches [^111f3wnb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The methods currently used for diagnosing TBM in children are unreliable. Symptoms and signs of the disease are not specific, and the tests used for diagnosis of the disease are highly invasive and time-consuming. General diagnostic tests, including CSF white cell count (WBC) with differential, total protein, and glucose level measurements, are performed for the diagnosis of meningitis. Typical CSF findings in TBM include increased total protein, decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with lymphocytic pleocytosis. Bacterial meningitis is characterized by mild-to-marked elevated total protein, mild-to-marked decreased CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and increased total WBC with neutrophil predominance. In viral meningitis, there are normal-to-elevated levels of total protein, usually normal CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC, with lymphocyte predominance; while fungal meningitis is characterized by elevated total protein, low CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, and minimal total WBC with lymphocyte predominance. Various diagnostic algorithms that take into account the symptoms and signs, in conjunction with results from laboratory and imaging tests, have been suggested for use in classifying individuals suspected of having TBM, at least for research purposes. The clinical management of TBM is challenging due to an incomplete understanding of the immunopathogenesis underlying the disease. Further investigations are required to update and refresh the body of knowledge for management of the disease, including the development of effective TB drugs, host-directed therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. In the current review, we summarize evidence published in the literature on different diagnostic approaches for TBM in children, the pathogenesis and immunology of TBM, and the recent advances in the search for novel approaches, mainly biomarkers, in the diagnosis of the disease.

### Cerebrospinal fluid: serum glucose ratio in the ventricular and lumbar compartments: implications for clinical practice [^113dWVND]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Calculation of the cerebrospinal fluid:serum glucose (CSF:S G lu) ratio is part of the routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) work-up. Reference values have been defined for lumbar CSF, but are lacking for ventricular CSF. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the CSF:S G lu ratio is similar in lumbar and ventricular compartments, and to determine cut-off values for CSF:S G lu ratio in ventricular CSF.

Methods

We included CSF samples that were collected by either lumbar puncture or ventricular drainage, with a red blood cell count < 500/μL, normal white blood cell count and age-related normal total protein content, with simultaneously withdrawn serum sample and time to laboratory processing of ≤ 2 h. This resulted in 1808 sample pairs. Glucose concentrations in CSF and serum were measured by enzymatic spectrophotometry.

Results

The CSF:S G lu ratio was similar in ventricular and lumbar compartments after controlling for age, sex, time between sample withdrawal and laboratory processing, CSF white blood cell and red blood cell count, CSF total protein and serum glucose concentration using a multiple linear regression model. Lower limits for CSF:S G lu ratio in the ventricular compartment, defined as 5 th percentile, were 0.51 for patients with serum glucose concentration < 100 mg/dL, 0.45 for those with serum glucose concentration ≥ 100 mg/dL and < 150 mg/dL, and 0.36 for those with serum glucose concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL.

Conclusions

The CSF:S G lu ratio was similar in the ventricular and lumbar compartments, and depended mainly on time to laboratory processing and absolute serum glucose levels. Previously established lower limits for CSF:S G lu ratio in lumbar CSF can be also applied for ventricular CSF.

### A simple blood test expedites the diagnosis of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome [^113W8TFu]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome (GLUT1‐DS) is caused by impaired glucose transport across the blood–brain barrier and into astrocytes attributed to heterozygous, likely mostly de novo, mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the glucose transporter, GLUT1. 1 GLUT1 is a membrane‐bound glycoprotein expressed in erythrocytes, brain microvessels, and glial cells. SLC2A1 mutations limit brain glucose availability and lead to cerebral energy deficiency. As a consequence, GLUT1‐DS manifests with a wide range of neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, epilepsy, and permanent and/or paroxysmal motor disorders that usually start in early childhood. 1, 2 Early detection of GLUT1‐DS is critical given that the disease is treatable with ketogenic diets 3 and, possibly, novel experimental therapies. 4, 5

Any neuropediatrician or neurologist can encounter patients with GLUT1‐DS. Its diagnosis is, however, challenging because of the great heterogeneity of symptoms and ages at onset. Besides the classical severe infantile‐onset epileptic encephalopathy, adult‐onset forms have been described with epilepsy or paroxysmal movement disorders as the sole manifestations. 6 The 3‐O‐methyl‐D‐glucose (OMG) uptake assay is an important functional measure of glucose transport across the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, 7 but is not available on a clinical basis because it implies the use of radioactivity and precautions in blood sample storage and preanalytical steps. 8 In a patient whose phenotype suggests GLUT1‐DS, the diagnosis thus relies on lumbar puncture (LP) — that is, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentration, supported by low CSF lactate — and SLC2A1 molecular analysis. These approaches have some limitations. LP must be performed after at least 6 hours of fasting, is invasive, and runs the risk of complications. 9 Moreover, an unequivocal cutoff has not been set to date for CSF glucose, with an heterogeneity in current practice although the most used value is 2.2mM. 8 On the other hand, the analysis of the coding regions of SLC2A1 can be tedious, inconclusive in case of variants of unknown significance, or may fail at identifying variants despite a very suggestive clinical and biochemical phenotype. 10

Acute or chronic neurologic changes while on CM therapy — reassessment: We recommend that repeat MRI of the brain and possibly the spinal cord, with and without contrast, as well as reanalysis of spinal fluid be obtained either from a lumbar or cisternal aspiration (strong, low). Occasionally, patients develop new neurologic problems while on a management regimen that initially had resulted in improvement, and new neurologic problems may be due to drug failure, in which case the cerebrospinal fluid findings demonstrate increased leukocyte count and lower glucose.

### Pyrexia in a young infant-is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection? [^115VUJun]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables – investigations

The following investigations were performed following admission in the well-looking infant who had 2 separate readings of fever ≥ 38.0 °C (including the temperature from triage) or a single temperature reading of ≥ 38.5 °C, or earlier if there were clinical findings of an unwell infant: full blood count (FBC) – looking specifically at the total white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), haemoglobin levels, platelets, and the C-reactive protein (CRP). Bacteraemia was defined as bacterial growth in blood cultures (excluding common contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococcus). Urine for analysis and culture were routinely performed. Urinary tract infections were defined as a positive urine culture with a growth of a single bacteria of more than 10⁵ colony forming units (CFU)/L from a mid-stream urine sample, or 10⁴ CFU/L from a catheterized specimen. Lumbar puncture, CSF analysis and culture were performed when clinically indicated as decided by the attending physician. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made following a positive CSF culture, or if the CSF fluid was suggestive of a bacterial meningitis such as significant pleocytosis (> 1000 cells/mm³), low CSF glucose or low CSF glucose to serum ratio (< 0.4), high CSF protein levels (> 100 mg/dL), in the absence of a positive culture. We included the latter because bacteria growth from CSF culture depends on the amount of bacteria present (which may be transient) and other supportive biochemical features on CSF analysis are vital for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. In specific cases, cultures would be obtained from stool, wounds or abscesses. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were also obtained from infants with respiratory symptoms to test for common viral respiratory infections. In infants with hemodynamic instability or evidence of shock, resuscitation with fluid resuscitation, consideration for inotropic support and emergency intravenous antibiotics were initiated in the ED.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^1155SkzG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

CSF analysis

This is the most important test in AE evaluation and is usually the second step in the workup after brain MRI. Regardless of MRI findings, all patients with suspected encephalitis require a lumbar puncture (LP) unless there is a significant contraindication (eg, risk of herniation on brain imaging). In some cases, inflammatory CSF may be the only abnormality found on initial testing serving as the sole indication for empiric immunotherapy after infection is excluded. If timely brain MRI is not possible due to patient agitation or lack of access, clinicians should proceed with LP after a screening head CT so as not to delay immunotherapy. CSF analysis should include cell count and differential, protein, glucose, CSF/serum glucose ratio, albumin quotient, IgG index and synthesis rate, oligoclonal bands, broad viral studies including HSV1/2 PCR and varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR and IgG/IgM, bacterial/fungal cultures when appropriate, cytology, flow cytometry, NAAs panel (eg, Autoimmune encephalopathy/encephalitis panel, etc), and in some cases, prion disorder panel (preferably RTQuIC when available). Common CSF findings in AE include mild to moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis (commonly 20–200 cells but can be as high as 900 cells with some antibodies), hyperproteinorrachia, and in some cases, elevated IgG index and/or IgG synthesis rate and positive intrathecal oligoclonal bands (unmatched in the serum). These findings in the setting of negative infectious and cytological studies support an immune-mediated aetiology but would not differentiate AE from other immune-mediated conditions (eg, neurosarcoidosis) so clinical correlation is always needed. In many patients, testing NAAs in both CSF and serum is needed because CSF detection is more sensitive for some antibodies (eg, NMDAR and GFAP antibodies) while serum is more sensitive for other antibodies (eg, onconeuronal, LGI1, and AQP4 antibodies). If the clinical picture is highly suggestive of an antibody with a higher serum sensitivity (eg, FBDS suggestive of LGI1-antibody encephalitis), then it might be reasonable to avoid CSF testing in clinical situations where CSF sampling is challenging. Although symptomatology can guide which neuronal antibodies (or antibody panels) to test for in some patients, it may be most practical to send the most comprehensive panel especially in patients with less defined presentations. This is because there is a significant syndromic overlap between most of these antibodies and because more than one antibody can coexist in the same patient. Notably, routine CSF studies may be normal in some AE patients and this does not exclude the diagnosis when other parameters are consistent with AE; therefore, testing NAAs panels is recommended in case of high clinical suspicion even if the CSF is normal.

### Xpert MTB / RIF ultra for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis: a small step forward [^112MNWJS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Summary of Tuberculous Meningitis Diagnostic Studies Using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra

What can be learned from these studies? First, diagnostic tests cannot be expected to perform identically in all settings. Differences in tested CSF volume, CSF processing, HIV coinfection, genetics influencing host response to Mtb, and Mtb lineages could all contribute to these different results, as could the differences in study design (eg, dividing specimens among the tests vs randomizing samples) and smear microscopy sensitivity. Second, regardless of the differences in the exact performance of Xpert Ultra, the most important point is that, while Xpert Ultra seems to be some improvement on Xpert, its negative predictive value is not sufficiently high to exclude TBM when the result is negative. Following on from the opinion piece published by Bahr et al in 2016, we wish to caution against the use of Xpert Ultra or Xpert as single diagnostic tests for TBM. Focus should be placed on collecting and processing large volumes of CSF (> 6 mL, just for mycobacterial testing), maximizing the number of Mtb bacteria in the tested sample, and improving chances of confirming a diagnosis of TBM. Centrifugation of CSF (3000 g for 15 minutes) concentrates Mtb in the pellet and improves diagnostic sensitivity. To optimize the performance of ZN smear microscopy, an appropriate time should be spent reading CSF smear slides before considering them negative. Microscopist skill and experience are hugely important, although they are hard to quantify.

Clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters remain essential. Symptoms of meningitis for more than 5 days should lead to suspicion of TBM, and focal neurological deficits are common. Chest radiograph may demonstrate miliary or pulmonary TB, and brain imaging may show evidence of cerebral infarcts, basal meningeal enhancement, or hydrocephalus. Where CSF testing fails, diagnostic testing of other potentially involved sites may provide microbiological evidence of TB elsewhere. For example, sputum Xpert may detect Mtb, or urine TB-lipoarabinomannan (TB-LAM) may provide evidence of disseminated TB in patients coinfected with HIV. Lymphocytic, low-glucose, high-protein CSF is classically seen in TBM but is not always present and exclusion of cryptococcal meningitis is essential in immunosuppressed patients. Repeat lumbar puncture after 48–72 hours may be valuable in patients who fail to improve with routine antibiotics, or in whom diagnosis remains unclear.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Qyh3L]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Central nervous system histoplasmosis — cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostics: The usual CSF findings are lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose; fungal stains are usually negative, and CSF cultures are positive in a minority of cases, with cultures positive in 38% of study participants in a review of CNS histoplasmosis that included people with HIV. Histoplasma antigen can be detected in CSF in a far greater number of cases, antibodies against H. capsulatum are seen in at least one-half of cases, and a positive antigen or antibody test result from CSF is diagnostic for histoplasmosis; if none of these specific tests are positive, a presumptive diagnosis of Histoplasma meningitis is appropriate when disseminated histoplasmosis and findings of CNS infection not attributable to another cause are present.

### Clinical features and long-term outcomes of children with pneumococcal meningitis in China: a 10-year single-centre retrospective analysis [^112BSvak]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical changes in the CSF during BM infection include increased protein and decreased glucose concentration. Vasilopoulou et al. found that a decrease in CSF glucose concentration (< 40 mg/dL) and an increase in protein concentration (> 1.00 g/L) were high-risk factors for poor prognosis in children with BM. Previous studies from our group have shown that CSF protein > 1.00 g/L and CSF glucose < 1.5 mmol/L may indicate a poor prognosis in children with BM. Here, the median CSF protein concentration was significantly higher in the poor prognosis group than in the good prognosis group (P < 0.001), while the median CSF glucose concentration was significantly lower in the poor prognosis group compared to the good prognosis group (P < 0.05). The balance between the inflow across the blood–brain barrier and outflow with CSF determines the CSF protein content. Therefore, the increase in protein levels may be related to the degree of blood–brain barrier damage or circulation in the CSF.

### Normal values for cerebrospinal fluid in neonates: a systematic review [^117EQ8HN]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of neonatal meningitis often rests on microscopic and biochemical findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There is ongoing uncertainty about age-related normal values for CSF findings in neonates, and many previous studies have included infants in whom antibiotics were administered before lumbar puncture or in whom viral meningitis was not excluded.

Methods

A systematic search was done using MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies which investigated CSF normal values in either healthy neonates or febrile neonates in whom bacterial and viral meningitis were reliably excluded.

Results

We identified seven studies investigating 270 term and 96 preterm neonates. There were minimal differences between preterm and term neonates in the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count and glucose concentration. In contrast, the CSF neutrophil count and protein concentration were influenced by gestational and chronological age. In the four studies that reported individual patient data, in 95% of cases the CSF WBC count was < 12 cells/μL in preterm and < 10 cells/μL in term neonates, the neutrophil count was < 16 and 8 cells/μL, and the protein concentration was < 210 and 110 mg/dL, respectively.

Conclusion

The normal range for CSF parameters in neonates is different to that in older infants, and some parameters are influenced by gestational and chronological age. CSF parameters alone are not sufficiently reliable to exclude meningitis.

Decision rules and models that include IMs have sensitivities greater than 90%.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in HIV-infected children — organ involvement and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings — is characterized by increased risk of CMV retinitis at lower CD4 counts, where CD4 cell counts < 100 cells/mm3 are more likely than higher counts to develop CMV retinitis; gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations include CMV colitis (the most common GI manifestation), oral and esophageal ulcers, hepatitis, ascending cholangiopathy, or gastritis; the role of CMV in pulmonary disease is difficult to assess because it often is isolated with other organisms and histologic evidence of CMV disease is needed to determine whether active disease is present; CMV central nervous system (CNS) involvement may show CSF leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear predominance (> 50% of neutrophils), elevated protein concentration (often > 100 mg/dL), and low glucose concentration (< 40 mg/dL), although up to 20% of children with CMV CNS involvement have completely normal CSF indices, and CMV can cause a rapidly progressive, often fatal, CNS disease with cranial nerve deficits, nystagmus, and increasing ventricular size.

### Lack of value of routine analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for prediction and diagnosis of external drainage-related bacterial meningitis [^115ixMRT]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Object

Routine microbiological and chemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is often performed to diagnose external drainage-related bacterial meningitis (ED-BM) at an early stage. A cohort study was performed to investigate the value of several commonly used CSF parameters for the prediction and diagnosis of ED-BM.

Methods

In a cohort of 230 consecutive patients in whom external drains had been placed, CSF samples were collected daily, prospectively evaluated for the presence of bacteria using Gram stain and microbiological culture, and analyzed for leukocyte count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, and ratio of CSF glucose to blood glucose. In addition, the CSF concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was determined. The definition of ED-BM was based on positive culture results in combination with clinical symptoms. A matched case-control study was performed to evaluate the cohort longitudinally and to control for biasing factors such as duration of external drainage. External drainage-related bacterial meningitis developed in 22 patients (9.6%). Results from analyses of 1516 CSF samples showed no significant differences between the patients in whom ED-BM developed and a control group without ED-BM during the first 3 days of infection or during the 3 days preceding the infection with regard to leukocyte count, protein concentration, glucose concentration, and CSF/blood glucose ratio. No significant difference between groups was found for the CSF IL-6 concentration during the 3 days preceding the infection. In the matched case-control study, none of the parameters had significant predictive or diagnostic value for ED-BM in analyses using absolute values, ratios, and differences between the current and previous day's values. A comparison of the results from Gram stains and CSF cultures showed that the Gram staining had a very high specificity (99.9%) but a low sensitivity (18% [four of 22 patients] on the 1st day of infection and 60% [nine of 15 patients] on the 2nd day).

Conclusions

Severe disturbances in the CSF of patients with external drains limit the value of routine CSF analysis for prediction or diagnosis of ED-BM. Routine Gram stain of CSF has also limited predictive or diagnostic value due to its low sensitivity in screening for ED-BM.

### Cerebrospinal fluid proteomic associations of APOE genotypes reveal distinct protective and risk mechanisms for Alzheimer's disease [^1111RRtV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene includes the strongest protective (ε2) and risk (ε4) variants for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied APOE genotype effects on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome.

METHODS

Using untargeted tandem mass tag mass spectrometry, we analyzed CSF from 227 cognitively normal (CN) controls (A–T–), 165 CN A+, and 177 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI A+) from two large cohorts. We compared protein levels across APOE genotypes using linear regression and characterized biological pathways.

RESULTS

Five hundred forty‐nine of 978 proteins (56%) differed between ε2/ε3 (n = 32 individuals) or ε4 carriers (n = 181 individuals) and ε3/ε3 controls. ε2/ε3 controls showed the most differences, with higher levels of 280 proteins enriched for neuronal plasticity. ε4 carrier controls showed increased proteins linked to blood–brain barrier dysfunction, and A+ ε4 carriers were related to glucose metabolism.

DISCUSSION

Combining two cohorts enabled analysis of the rare APOE ε2 genotype, suggesting protective effects may occur through improved neuronal plasticity.

Highlights

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes show distinct cerebrospinal fluid proteomic mechanisms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Combining cohorts enabled analysis of rare APOE ε2–associated protection in AD.
The rare ε2 genotype may confer protection through improved neuronal plasticity.
APOE ε4 carriers show increased blood–brain barrier dysfunction and glucose metabolism.
These findings offer new insights into genotype‐specific mechanisms in early AD.

### Cerebrospinal fluid characteristics of infants who present to the emergency department with fever: establishing normal values by week of age [^1132pM7z]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND This study describes differences in the values of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC), glucose, and protein counts in infants less than 60 days of age with fever who were not proven to have viral or bacterial meningitis.

Methods

Three independent retrospective medical record reviews were conducted using a population of infants less than 60 days of age who presented to the Emergency Department with fever. Full-term infants were included if a lumbar puncture was performed within 24 hours of admittance and bacterial or viral meningitis was not identified as the cause of fever.

Results

A total of 1091 infants were included and grouped by week of age. Significant trends were found for CSF WBC and CSF protein with the highest values observed during the first week of life. Mean for CSF WBC was 8.63 cells/mm for infants aged 0 to 1 week and decreased for each age group ending with infants 8 weeks of age having a mean of 2.22 cell/mm. For CSF protein, a similar trend was observed. No significant differences were found for CSF glucose.

Conclusions

Significant differences exist for infants by week of age for CSF WBC and CSF protein. These values can be used to assist in interpreting laboratory findings and making management decisions for infants less than 60 days of age.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic updates in leptomeningeal disease [^113U6TnF]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics

Due to its variable and often nonspecific presentation, LMD is frequently overlooked until symptoms become severe. The core diagnostic workup for suspected LMD includes clinical exam, CNS imaging, and CSF sampling. Older case series reported that neurologic symptoms were clinically apparent in all patients at LMD diagnosis. However, autopsy series have shown that the incidence of asymptomatic or undiagnosed LMD is ~ 20%. On gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine, findings indicative of LMD include focal or diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, subarachnoid nodules, and cranial or spinal nerve enhancement. Some studies suggested that delayed enhanced FLAIR sequences may provide better visualization of superficial meningeal enhancement compared to traditional post-contrast T1-weighted scans. However, CNS imaging for LMD has limited sensitivity; in a cohort of patients with cytology-proven LMD, 37% did not demonstrate LMD on MRI, with false negatives occurring more often with hematologic malignancies (52%) than solid tumors (28%). The specificity of CNS imaging of LMD is also limited, given that meningeal enhancement can result from a variety of non-neoplastic processes, including infectious or aseptic meningitis.

Given the limitations of clinical and radiologic techniques, CSF analysis is integral to LMD diagnosis. While the pattern of high cell count, low glucose, and high protein in CSF has been considered "suggestive" of LMD, these abnormalities in isolation are relatively nonspecific. CSF cytology has high specificity for solid tumor LMD and is often considered the diagnostic gold standard; however, the sensitivity of cytology is limited, due to low volume of malignant cells within the CSF and technical variability. In a retrospective study of patients with paired CSF cytology who later underwent autopsy, the sensitivity of a single CSF cytology analysis was 59%. Due to the volume-dependent sensitivity of cytology, it is recommended to send at least 10 mL of CSF, with repeat CSF sampling indicated if initial cytology is negative. In hematologic malignancies, suspected LMD is evaluated with both cytology and flow cytometry; the latter has increased sensitivity for LMD secondary to leukemia or lymphoma and only requires ~ 2 mL CSF due to a lower limit of detection. Unlike cytology, flow cytometry is also a quantitative measure that can be serially monitored as a measure of disease burden and treatment response.

### Novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome: implications beyond the brain's energy deficit [^111BmH21]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

While the attachment of Xyl‐Glc and Xyl‐Xyl‐Glc as a post‐translational modification of many human proteins is firmly established, their presence in unbound form in body fluids has not been documented before. Possibly, both oligosaccharides result from the degradation of their proteins of origin. We hypothesize that their low CSF concentrations in GLUT1DS reflect compromised O ‐glucosylation capacity of cells within the CNS, as a consequence of insufficient glucose availability due to defective transport into the CNS. Since the CSF xylose levels in GLUT1DS patients also showed a significant decrease (Figure 1), GLUT1 deficiency may contribute to diminished xylose transport and if so, brain O ‐glucosylation would be compromised by limited availability of both glucose and xylose.

A limitation of this study was the relatively small number of CSF samples, necessitating future studies in larger patient cohorts to determine the exact diagnostic values of (the combination of) various CSF biomarkers in GLUT1DS. Also, a larger control sample size should be evaluated for possible age‐dependency of biomarker concentrations, the influence of KDT, adequate CSF fraction to be collected, and possible effects of fasting before lumbar puncture. Furthermore, our samples had variable preanalytical conditions. While this did not directly negatively influence our study, a prospective design and standardized sample collection and storage methods are preferred for future studies.

In conclusion, our NGMS methodology confirmed the typical diagnostic CSF profile of GLUT1DS with low values of glucose, lactate and xylose, and increased glutamine. Importantly, we identified three novel CSF biomarkers of GLUT1DS: gluconic + galactonic acid, Xyl‐Glc, and Xyl‐Xyl‐Glc. All were significantly decreased in CSF of patients compared to controls. Our findings improve the diagnostic accuracy of CSF analysis in GLUT1DS, and provide new leads towards a full understanding of the multiple roles of glucose in the brain and how these different roles may be compromised in GLUT1DS. As such, this study guides therapy development and adds new biomarkers for monitoring of novel therapeutic strategies.

### Cortisol levels in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with severity and bacterial origin of meningitis [^113dCaYR]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial meningitis represents a serious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of bacterial meningitis has remained stable since the advent of antibiotics, with the case fatality being as high as 25%. Furthermore, long-term sequelae such as hearing loss, palsies and personality changes affect approximately 40% of survivors. Early antibiotic therapy is crucial for optimizing the outcome of bacterial meningitis. Therefore, it is important to distinguish bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis during the acute phase of the disease, when clinical symptoms are often similar. Current microbiological tests are highly specific, but they lack sufficient sensitivity. Use of various biological markers in blood (C-reactive protein, white blood cell count [WBC], and procalcitonin) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; for instance, protein, glucose, WBC, lactate, inflammatory cytokines and combinations thereof) has been suggested to improve sensitivity in determining the aetiological diagnosis. However, a sensitive laboratory test that is easy to perform is still required, so that all patients with bacterial meningitis can be identified reliably on admission.

Healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — diagnostic definitions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) thresholds: There is no gold standard for defining infection, and the CDC/NHSN definition is described as useful for estimating the likelihood of true infection. One study combined a positive CSF culture with CSF pleocytosis (at least 11 WBCs/mm³ and ≥ 50% neutrophils) plus clinical symptoms, later refined to require 2 positive CSF cultures with the same organism on different days. Reports note that healthcare-associated meningitis can occur with a normal CSF white cell count. Post-neurosurgery, CSF white cell counts can be high with low glucose, and if CSF white blood cells are > 7500/mm³ there is usually an increased number of eosinophils.

Methods

Study design and participants

We did a prospective, randomised, observational study to compare the performances of Xpert Ultra and Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. In this study, diagnostic tests were randomly allocated to patients and diagnostic performances were evaluated; as this study was not a randomised clinical trial, it was not registered as such. Patients aged 16 years or older with suspected tuberculous meningitis based on clinical and CSF findings (clear or mildly cloudy CSF, plus > 5 days of symptoms constistent with tuberculous meningitisor low CSF glucose or raised CSF lactate concentrations) at The Hospital for Tropical Diseases (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) were eligible for enrolment. Patients were excluded if lumbar puncture was contraindicated or informed consent was not given by the patient or by a relative if the patient did not have capacity. The study was approved by the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee.

### Assessment of diagnostic yield of nonculture infection testing on cerebrospinal fluid in immune-competent children [^116NwGib]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Definitions

Normal cell counts were defined as CSF WBC lower than 5 cells/μL and CSF RBC lower than 500 cells/μL; elevated cell counts were defined as CSF WBC 5 cells/μL or higher and/or CSF RBC 500 cells/μL or higher. When more than 1 set of cell counts were obtained for a given lumbar puncture specimen, we used the lowest value of each WBC and RBC count. We recorded CSF protein and glucose values less than a lower limit of detection (eg, CSF glucose < 10 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) as the lower limit of detection.

The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes used to define exclusion criteria are summarized in the eMethods in the Supplement. Corticosteroids were not included as an exclusionary immune-suppressing medication given the varying immune outcomes by medication and dosing by body weight.

### Meningitis in preterm neonates: importance of cerebrospinal fluid parameters [^116mytGE]. American Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid parameters are of great importance in diagnosing meningitis, but normal values for preterm neonates are based on small, single-center studies. We sought to determine current values for preterm neonate cerebrospinal fluid parameters and assess the association of cerebrospinal fluid parameters with culture proven meningitis. We performed a cohort study of the first lumbar puncture from 4632 neonates < 34 weeks' gestation performed in the years 1997 to 2004 at 150 neonatal intensive care units managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group. We identified 95 cases of meningitis from the 4632 lumbar punctures. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for white blood cell count, glucose, and protein were 0.80, 0.63, and 0.72, respectively, for prediction of culture-proven meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid parameters used to diagnose meningitis in the absence of dependable cerebrospinal fluid cultures are unreliable. Caution should be employed when interpreting cerebrospinal fluid parameters in the premature neonate.

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of laboratory and genetic testing (an evidence-based review) [^113RFP41]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) — screening laboratory testing yield and indicated tests: The cause of most polyneuropathies is evident when history, examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX) studies, and simple screening laboratory tests are combined, producing an etiological diagnosis in 74%–82% of patients with polyneuropathy, whereas laboratory tests alone had only a 37% diagnostic yield in idiopathic cases and in another study abnormalities were found in 58% of 91 patients but only 9% were etiologically diagnostic. Screening panels comprising complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, comprehensive metabolic panel (blood glucose, renal function, liver function), thyroid function tests, serum B12, and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis are indicated for most patients, with the highest yield from blood glucose, serum B12, and serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis; in DSP cohorts blood glucose was elevated in ~11%, serum protein electrophoresis or immunofixation in 9%, and serum B12 low in ~3.6%. Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis had a low diagnostic yield except in demyelinating polyneuropathies, which usually showed increased CSF protein.

### The utility of cerebrospinal fluid analysis in patients with multiple sclerosis [^11418UTZ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires the exclusion of other possible diagnoses. For this reason, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be routinely analysed in patients with a first clinical event suggestive of MS. CSF analysis is no longer mandatory for diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS, as long as MRI diagnostic criteria are fulfilled. However, caution is required in diagnosing MS in patients with negative MRI findings or in the absence of CSF analysis, as CSF investigation is useful to eliminate other causes of disease. The detection of oligoclonal IgG bands in CSF has potential prognostic value and is helpful for clinical decision-making. In addition, CSF analysis is important for research into the pathogenesis of MS. Pathophysiological and neurodegenerative findings of inflammation in MS have been derived from CSF investigations. Novel CSF biomarkers, though not yet validated, have been identified for diagnosis of MS and for ascertaining disease activity, prognosis and response to treatment, and are likely to increase in number with modern detection techniques. In this Review, we summarize CSF findings that shed light on the differential diagnosis of MS, and highlight the potential of novel biomarkers for this disease that could advance understanding of its pathophysiology.

Neurosurgery or head trauma culture interpretation — CSF pleocytosis with a positive culture and symptoms of infection are indicative of a diagnosis of healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis (strong, high). Hypoglycorrhachia and elevated CSF protein concentrations are suggestive of this diagnosis (weak, low). Growth of a contaminant organism in enrichment broth only or on just 1 of multiple cultures with normal CSF and no fever is not indicative (strong, low). CSF cultures with multiple organisms from a single sample may be contaminants when there are no symptoms or CSF pleocytosis (weak, low). CSF cultures that grow Staphylococcus aureus or aerobic gram-negative bacilli are indicative of infection (strong, moderate), and growth of a fungal pathogen is indicative of infection (strong, moderate).

### The role of hypoglycorrhachia as a cerebrospinal fluid to serum glucose ratio in adults with encephalitis [^1118sW6L]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of hypoglycorrhachia in adults with encephalitis.

Methods

We conducted an IRB-approved, retrospective chart review of adult patients diagnosed with encephalitis from Greater Houston and Baltimore regions from 2005 to 2022 based on the 2013 International Encephalitis Consortium criteria. Data was collected on demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic findings, and clinical outcomes. Hypoglycorrhachia was defined as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to serum glucose ratio ≤ 0.6. Patients were dichotomized based on presence or absence of hypoglycorrhachia.

Results

Of 556 patients (47.5% infectious, 15.6% seropositive autoimmune, 36.9% unknown etiology), 69.8% had hypoglycorrhachia (n = 388). Patients with hypoglycorrhachia were more often immunocompromised and presented with fever, headache, nausea, and neck stiffness (p < 0.05), while patients without hypoglycorrhachia more frequently presented with seizures, memory deficits, and psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Hypoglycorrhachia was associated with CSF pleocytosis (CSF white blood cell level ≥ 5 cells/μL), a higher CSF protein level (p < 0.05), and infectious etiology. Absence of hypoglycorrhachia was associated with seropositive autoimmune etiology, greater use of immunotherapies, higher intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, and longer hospitalization (p < 0.05). Prevalence rates and etiology distribution of patients with hypoglycorrhachia were comparable to those in a subset of patients with concomitant CSF/serum glucose collection.

Conclusions

Hypoglycorrhachia is strongly associated with bacterial and fungal etiologies and their clinical features, while absence of hypoglycorrhachia is linked to higher ICU admission rates and prolonged hospitalization, likely due to autoimmune encephalitis. The CSF/serum glucose ratio captures greater variability in serum glucose levels yet reliably rules out absolute hypoglycorrhachia when > 0.6, regardless of concomitant collection.

### Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid evolution in childhood tuberculous meningitis [^112kUMnX]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

As early diagnosis of childhood tuberculous meningitis cannot rely on mycobacterial confirmation, clinical, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging features are essential. We aimed to describe the evolution of serially analyzed lumbar cerebrospinal fluid parameters. We performed a retrospective observational study including children < 13 years with suspected tuberculous meningitis at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Cerebrospinal fluid parameters at admission and weeks 1, 2, and 3 were analyzed. Of 318 children with suspected tuberculous meningitis, 53 (17%) had "definite" tuberculous meningitis and 265 (83%) "probable" tuberculous meningitis. Longitudinal clustering revealed 3 distinct profiles, with 1 group atypically demonstrating initial increase in lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and protein concentration. The decreasing cerebrospinal fluid glucose trend remained uniform among all groups. A gradual decline in cerebrospinal fluid lymphocyte, neutrophil and protein count, and rise in cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration is expected; however, normal variability exists.

### Cerebrospinal fluid reference proteins increase accuracy and interpretability of biomarkers for brain diseases [^117CAreh]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflect brain pathophysiology and are used extensively in translational research as well as in clinical practice for diagnosis of neurological diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, CSF biomarker concentrations may be influenced by non-disease related inter-individual variability. Here we use a data-driven approach to demonstrate the existence of inter-individual variability in mean standardized CSF protein levels. We show that these non-disease related differences cause many commonly reported CSF biomarkers to be highly correlated, thereby producing misleading results if not accounted for. To adjust for this inter-individual variability, we identified and evaluated high-performing reference proteins which improved the diagnostic accuracy of key CSF AD biomarkers. Our reference protein method attenuates the risk for false positive findings, and improves the sensitivity and specificity of CSF biomarkers, with broad implications for both research and clinical practice.

### Assessment of diagnostic yield of nonculture infection testing on cerebrospinal fluid in immune-competent children [^1139V2JK]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

This current study adds to the growing body of literature on CSF testing and low-value care. It provides pediatric data on diagnostic yield of nonculture CSF infection testing across a broad battery of common tests. Unlike the adult studies, protein levels were largely normal among the children in this cohort with positive nonculture CSF infection testing with the exception of 1 child (elevated to 49 mg/dL; Table 3).

Ultimately, the decision to send specimens for nonculture CSF infection testing requires a nuanced approach. It should incorporate community prevalence of infection, known pathogen risk factors, and patient-specific clinical judgment.

First nonfebrile seizure — lumbar puncture (LP): Evidence is limited; in one report of 57 spinal fluid samples from children aged 2 to 24 months after nonfebrile seizures, 12.3% had > 5 leukocytes/mm³ in the CSF without CNS infection, and CSF glucose ranged 32 to 130 mg/dL while CSF protein ranged 9 to 115 mg/dL. The document states there is "no evidence regarding the yield of routine LP" after a first nonfebrile seizure and notes prior AAN guidance did not list nonfebrile seizure as an LP indication. Conclusions specify that in very young children "(< 6 months)", any age with persistent altered mental status or failure to return to baseline, or any child with meningeal signs, LP should be performed, and if increased intracranial pressure is suspected, neuroimaging should precede LP. The recommendation is: "In the child with a first nonfebrile seizure, LP is of limited value and should be used primarily when there is concern about possible meningitis or encephalitis. (Option)".

### Predictive performance of cerebrospinal fluid parameters for diagnosis of meningitis in infants: a cohort study [^116ryfJu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The gold standard for diagnosis of meningitis is the isolation of a pathogen from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by culture or PCR. However, treatment is routinely commenced based on CSF findings prior to microbiological results. This study determined the predictive value of CSF parameters for diagnosing bacterial and viral meningitis in young infants.

Methods

Multicentre retrospective (2010–2020) cohort study of 1088 CSF results from infants aged 0–90days. The predictive value of CSF parameters (white blood cell count (WCC), neutrophil, protein, glucose) was evaluated in 538 meningitis cases (39 bacterial, 499 viral) compared with controls with negative CSF microbiological testing and no prior antibiotics.

Results

For bacterial meningitis, the sensitivity of the commonly used CSF WCC cut-off of 20×10⁶/L for neonates, 15×10⁶/L for infants 1–2months old and 5×10⁶/L for infants 2–3months old was 89%, 91% and 86% and the specificity was 78%, 77% and 61%, respectively. CSF protein levels ≥ 1g/L in neonates and ≥ 0.8g/L in infants aged 1–3month, or CSF neutrophils ≥ 2×10⁶/L, independently increased the likelihood of bacterial meningitis (positive likelihood ratios ≥ 5and ≥ 3, respectively). 3 of 39 cases of bacterial meningitis would have been missed using the commonly used WCC cut-offs alone. However, two would have been identified using CSF protein and neutrophil thresholds. All CSF parameters were poor at identifying viral meningitis.

Conclusion

A single CSF parameter cannot reliably diagnose bacterial meningitis. For identification of bacterial meningitis, elevation of CSF WCC, neutrophil count or protein levels above threshold values improves accuracy of diagnosis.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^115Zecuh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Neurosurgery or head trauma recommendations — diagnostic interpretation of CSF findings and cultures: CSF pleocytosis with a positive culture and symptoms of infection are indicative of a diagnosis of healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis (strong, high). Hypoglycorrhachia and elevated CSF protein concentrations are suggestive of the diagnosis of healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis (weak, low). Growth of an organism that is commonly considered a contaminant in enrichment broth only or on just 1 of multiple cultures in a patient with normal CSF and no fever is not indicative of healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis (strong, low). CSF cultures with multiple organisms from a single sample may be contaminants in patients with no symptoms of infection or CSF pleocytosis (weak, low). CSF cultures that grow S. aureus or aerobic gram-negative bacilli are indicative of infection (strong, moderate). CSF cultures that grow a fungal pathogen are indicative of infection (strong, moderate).

### Accuracy of clinical and cerebrospinal fluid indicators in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in infants [^113QsDkw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) is problematic in young infants, as clinical features may be nonspecific or even absent. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis usually confirms the diagnosis, but the CSF parameters can be normal also in culture-proven BM. Our objective was to identify the clinical and CSF indices, that quickly and without laboratory likely lead to the diagnosis of confirmed of probable BM in young infants in Angola.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational, single-site study from February 2016 to October 2017 in the Pediatric Hospital of Luanda. All assessed infants showed symptoms and signs compatible of BM or neonatal sepsis and were < 90 days of age.

Results

Of the 1088 infants, 212 (19%) showed bacteria in CSF, while 88 (8%) had probable BM. Independent clinical indicators of BM were not-clear CSF, seizures, weight < 2500g and illness > 7 days. In infants with BM, CSF leukocytes were > 10 × 106/L in 46%, CSF glucose < 25mg/dL in 43% and CSF protein > 120mg/dL in 58%. All measured parameters were in normal range in 25% of patients. In 515 infants with normal CSF parameters, bacteria were found in 74 (14%). In these infants, illness > 7 days, weight < 2500g and malnutrition increased the probability of BM.

Conclusions

Our study confirms and underlines the problems in diagnosing BM in young infants. While the CSF parameters were normal in 25% of infants, the easily recognizable unclear appearance of CSF was the single strongest predictor of BM.

### Cerebrospinal fluid reference proteins increase accuracy and interpretability of biomarkers for brain diseases [^112HF7Cb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflect brain pathophysiology and are used extensively in translational research as well as in clinical practice for diagnosis of neurological diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, CSF biomarker concentrations may be influenced by non-disease related inter-individual variability. Here we use a data-driven approach to demonstrate the existence of inter-individual variability in mean standardized CSF protein levels. We show that these non-disease related differences cause many commonly reported CSF biomarkers to be highly correlated, thereby producing misleading results if not accounted for. To adjust for this inter-individual variability, we identified and evaluated high-performing reference proteins which improved the diagnostic accuracy of key CSF AD biomarkers. Our reference protein method attenuates the risk for false positive findings, and improves the sensitivity and specificity of CSF biomarkers, with broad implications for both research and clinical practice.

### Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in leptomeningeal metastasis: diagnostic and prognostic value [^1123jGWo]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The aggressive treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) with intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy should require the unequivocal demonstration of tumour cell dissemination within the subarachnoid space. Malignant cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and contrast-enhancing leptomeningeal lesions on neuroimaging, suggestive of tumour cell deposits, are regarded diagnostic of LM. In any other situation suggestive, but not diagnostic, of LM, additional CSF parameters, would be helpful for establishing the diagnosis. Ideally, such parameters would not only be of diagnostic, but also of prognostic value, thus helping to choose the adequate therapy. Apart from the fact that elevated CSF protein was almost uniformly found as a negative prognostic factor, the literature remains controversial on the prognostic value of low CSF glucose or high CSF lactate levels or high age. The many attempts at defining additional diagnostic or prognostic CSF parameters for LM have met with little success, mostly because of low specificity. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a strong inducer of angiogenesis and possibly a cellular survival factor in many types of cancer, has been evaluated in one preliminary study: VEGF levels were uniquely high in 11 patients with LM, while VEGF remained low in patients with non-neoplastic neurological diseases. The present study assesses the differential diagnostic value of CSF VEGF levels in a substantially larger population with a broader spectrum of primary tumours. Furthermore, VEGF was investigated as a prognostic parameter in LM, thus extending the scope of application for the measurement of VEGF in LM.

### Validation of a diagnostic algorithm for adult tuberculous meningitis [^113yfQwJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) remains difficult to diagnose. We prospectively evaluated a diagnostic algorithm for TBM in 205 HIV-negative patients with meningitis and a low CSF glucose. Patients were classified as having TBM or bacterial meningitis (BM) by two diagnostic methods: logistic regression method (LRM) and classification and regression tree (CART). We performed analyses of TBM versus BM and TBM versus non-TBM in all patients and in patients with microbiologically confirmed diagnoses. Diagnostic sensitivities for TBM were 99% (LRM) and 87% (CART). For BM, diagnostic sensitivities were 81.5% (LRM) and 86.5% (CART) in the primary analysis and 86.5% (LRM) and 74% (CART) in the secondary analysis. In microbiologically confirmed cases, similar rates were achieved. These figures are superior to microbiological confirmation rates in routine laboratories and support the use of this algorithm in high-prevalence TB settings with limited diagnostic facilities. Validation in an HIV-endemic setting is required.

### Cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate levels after subarachnoid hemorrhage: a multicenter retrospective study [^1119mnjc]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), abnormalities in glucose and lactate metabolism have been described using cerebral microdialysis. Glucose and lactate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are more easily accessible, but scarce data are available in this setting. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship of CSF glucose and lactate with blood concentrations and with unfavorable neurological outcome after SAH.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 5 European University intensive care units. Patients aged 18 years and above who were admitted after a nontraumatic SAH over a 4-year period (2011 to 2014) were included if they had an external ventricular drain placed, daily analysis of CSF including glucose (± lactate) concentrations for 1 to 4 consecutive days, and concomitant analysis of glucose and lactate concentrations in the arterial blood.

Results

A total of 144 patients were included in the final analysis (median age: 58 [49 to 66]y; male sex: 77/144). Median time from admission to external ventricular drain placement was 1 (0 to 3) day; median Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was 10 (7 to 13), and CT-scan Fisher scale was 4. A total of 81 (56%) patients had unfavorable neurological outcome at 3 months (Glasgow Outcome Scale ≤ 3). There was a weak correlation between blood and CSF glucose (r = 0.07, P = 0.007), and between blood and CSF lactate levels (r = 0.58, P < 0.001) on day 1, which were not influenced by insulin therapy. The presence of shock and low CSF glucose/lactate ratio were the only independent predictors of unfavorable outcome.

Conclusions

CSF glucose and lactate levels poorly correlated with blood concentrations. Low CSF glucose/lactate ratio was associated with poor neurological outcome.

### Reassessing the value of CSF protein and glucose measurement in pediatric infectious meningitis… [^115oayrS]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Among these initial tests, the traditional rationale for ordering CSF protein and glucose is that elevated protein or low glucose may indicate higher risk of serious meningitis among patients with evidence of central nervous system infection; abnormal results may support the need for rapid antimicrobial treatment, whereas normal results may provide reassurance that less aggressive strategies are safe. To further assess the potential impact of dropping protein and glucose from routine CSF evaluation for IM, we sought to characterize how CSF protein and glucose results were explicitly documented in clinical decision-making among suspected IM cases. Abnormally low glucose occurred in only 8 of 735 patients, all with a value of 19 mg/dL. Data on concurrent serum glucose measurements were not available. Low glucose had sensitivity of 13. 3%, specificity of
99. 7%, PPV of 75. 0%, and NPV of
94. 6% for microbiologically confirmed meningitis.

In parallel testing, abnormal CSF glucose and WBC combined had zero impact on test characteristics compared with using CSF WBC alone across all cases and age subgroups. Because our institutional normal value for CSF glucose may be lower than some published in the literature, we repeated the analysis with lower limits of 30 and 40 mg/dL. 7 These changes predictably increased the sensitivity and slightly decreased the specificity of CSF glucose alone, but resulted in no meaningful change in the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or NPV of glucose plus WBC when compared with WBC alone. The 3 patients noted above with IM caused by bacterial organisms not detected on the MEP had elevated protein and 2 had low glucose in addition to all 3 having elevated WBC; 2 had positive Gram stain. Clinicians in these cases cited both elevated CSF WBC count and protein as contributing to the decision to continue antibiotics despite negative initial microbiologic testing. CSF glucose was not mentioned.

Discussion In a large cohort of children undergoing testing for infectious meningitis, abnormal WBC or MEP identified all patients with a final diagnosis of either microbiologically proven or clinical IM; in no patient was an abnormal protein or glucose the only indicator of IM. CSF protein and glucose had very low PPV for prediction of meningitis in isolation, and when combined with WBC have at best no impact on the prediction of meningitis, and in the case of CSF protein, actually reduced the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.
