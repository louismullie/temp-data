## Question

Antibiotic choice for group B strep UTI no complications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic choice for a group B Streptococcus (GBS) urinary tract infection (UTI) without complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is truly an uncomplicated lower UTI and not pyelonephritis or a complicated UTI. Then, I should verify the diagnostic threshold for GBS bacteriuria and whether treatment is indicated. Next, I will review first-line agents and their pharmacokinetics in the bladder, check resistance patterns and stewardship guidance, and finally determine duration and whether to obtain a test-of-cure, adjusting for special populations like pregnancy if relevant.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. An uncomplicated GBS UTI implies acute cystitis in a nonpregnant, immunocompetent woman without fever, flank pain, structural urinary tract abnormalities, recent urologic instrumentation, or other complicating factors, so I need to ensure we are not dealing with pyelonephritis or a complicated UTI that would change management and duration [^4f472036] [^8144d778].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold for GBS bacteriuria. In nonpregnant adults, GBS is not a typical uropathogen, and treatment is generally reserved for symptomatic patients with significant bacteriuria, typically defined as at least 10^5 CFU/mL in a clean-catch specimen, whereas lower counts may represent colonization rather than infection; in pregnancy, any GBS bacteriuria at or above 10^4 CFU/mL warrants treatment because it predicts heavy genital colonization and neonatal risk, but that threshold does not automatically apply to nonpregnant adults, so I should not conflate these [^74972032] [^5e41243f] [^366707c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy. I should confirm that standard first-line agents for uncomplicated cystitis remain appropriate even when GBS is isolated, because GBS is generally susceptible to agents with good bladder concentrations; nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin are recommended first-line choices for uncomplicated cystitis, with selection guided by local resistance and patient factors, and beta-lactams reserved as alternatives when first-line options are unsuitable or resistance is present [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] [^753ac986].

> I need to check pharmacokinetic considerations for GBS. GBS is a streptococcal pathogen in the bladder, so agents that achieve high urinary concentrations and cover streptococci are suitable; nitrofurantoin has excellent urinary levels and streptococcal activity, TMP-SMX is active if susceptible, and fosfomycin has broad gram-positive coverage including streptococci, while beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, and cefpodoxime are reasonable alternatives when first-line agents are contraindicated or resistance is present, though they are less favored for empiric therapy due to resistance and collateral damage concerns [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] [^753ac986].

> Let me consider resistance and stewardship. I should confirm local TMP-SMX resistance before using it empirically, as resistance exceeding about 20% makes it a poor choice; fluoroquinolones are not recommended for empiric uncomplicated cystitis because of resistance selection and adverse effects, and beta-lactams should be reserved as alternatives rather than first-line due to lower efficacy and broader ecological impact; if GBS is isolated, susceptibility testing can refine therapy, but in many cases a first-line agent will already be active [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] [^753ac986].

> Next, I should review duration. For uncomplicated cystitis, short-course therapy is preferred: nitrofurantoin for 5 days, TMP-SMX for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose are all acceptable regimens; longer courses increase adverse effects without improving outcomes, so I should avoid extending therapy beyond these durations unless there are complicating factors or treatment failure [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] [^85c92aa4].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has recurrent UTIs. I should double-check that in pregnancy any GBS bacteriuria at or above 10^4 CFU/mL warrants a 5–7 day course of targeted therapy and also mandates intrapartum prophylaxis regardless of later colonization status; in women with recurrent UTIs, obtaining a urine culture with susceptibilities for each symptomatic episode is advised to guide therapy and avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum agents, though empiric first-line therapy can still be used when reliable and aligned with prior susceptibilities [^366707c4] [^b606c27a] [^68b5e22b].

> I will now examine whether a test-of-cure is needed. In nonpregnant adults with uncomplicated cystitis, routine test-of-cure is not recommended if symptoms resolve; if symptoms persist or recur within about 2–4 weeks, then obtaining a urine culture and reassessing for resistant organisms, atypical pathogens, or anatomic issues is appropriate, so I should not order a follow-up culture if the patient is clinically well [^4f472036] [^cbb88f68].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: for a nonpregnant adult with an uncomplicated GBS UTI, treat with a short course of a first-line agent such as nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, TMP-SMX double-strength twice daily for 3 days if local resistance is low, or fosfomycin 3 g as a single dose, reserving a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalexin for 5–7 days if first-line options are unsuitable or resistance is present; no test-of-cure is needed if symptoms resolve, but reassess if symptoms persist or recur [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] [^753ac986].

---

For uncomplicated GBS UTI, **nitrofurantoin 5 days** is first-line because it achieves high urinary levels and is effective against GBS [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6]. If nitrofurantoin is unsuitable, **amoxicillin or cephalexin for 5–7 days** are acceptable alternatives based on susceptibility [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6]. Avoid **fluoroquinolones** unless there is no alternative due to resistance and collateral damage [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6]. Treat for 5–7 days; no test-of-cure is needed if symptoms resolve [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg orally twice daily | 5 days | First-line; high urinary levels; effective against GBS [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] |
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally three times daily | 5–7 days | Alternative; use if susceptible [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally four times daily | 5–7 days | Alternative; use if susceptible [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6] |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)**: Reserve for resistant cases due to resistance and collateral damage [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].
- **Fosfomycin**: Not recommended for GBS due to limited evidence and lower efficacy [^notfound].
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Avoid if resistance > 20% or if GBS is resistant [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Duration**: 5–7 days; shorter courses (e.g. 3 days) are less effective for GBS [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].
- **Test of cure**: Not required if symptoms resolve; consider only if symptoms persist or recur [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or recur within 2 weeks [^4f472036] [^5c5476b6].

---

## Special populations

In pregnancy, treat GBS bacteriuria at ≥ 10^4 CFU/mL with **penicillin G or ampicillin** for 5–7 days and provide intrapartum prophylaxis [^366707c4] [^b606c27a]. In pediatric patients, use **amoxicillin or cephalexin** for 7–10 days, guided by susceptibility [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin for 5 days is **first-line** for uncomplicated GBS UTI; amoxicillin or cephalexin for 5–7 days are alternatives if needed. Avoid fluoroquinolones unless there is no better option, and tailor therapy to susceptibilities.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) treatment in pregnant individuals — clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics for colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment; ASB is clinically significant at 100,000 CFU/mL (10^5 CFU/mL) or higher, treatment should start once bacteriuria is confirmed and be adjusted per sensitivities, and normal vulvovaginal flora should not be treated. Group B strep should be treated if present in counts greater than 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower colony counts do not require treatment but should be noted for group B streptococcus prophylaxis at delivery; several randomized studies show that a 5–7-day duration is superior to single-dose treatment, with no difference in ASB recurrence, pyelonephritis, or preterm birth. Fosfomycin is an exception with single-dose efficacy making it a reasonable choice for 1-day treatment of ASB, and there are no studies assessing a 3-day treatment duration for ASB; there are also no studies to recommend for or against whether a test of cure or repeat screening is indicated after treatment.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^24e7615f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

Box 3. Antepartum group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria — key points for intrapartum prophylaxis and antepartum management state that GBS bacteriuria at any concentration identified at any time in pregnancy indicates the need for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis without the need for a subsequent screening culture at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks; GBS bacteriuria at levels of 105 CFU/mL or greater warrants acute treatment and indicates the need for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of birth; asymptomatic bacteriuria with GBS at a level less than 105 CFU/mL does not require maternal antibiotic therapy during the antepartum period but is an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of birth; a urine culture in pregnancy should be marked as that of a pregnant woman and, for those with a reported penicillin allergy, the requisition should be specifically marked to ensure clindamycin susceptibility testing; clindamycin susceptibility results are ONLY for guiding the choice of antibiotic for intrapartum prophylaxis during labor, and if antepartum treatment of a urinary tract infection or bacteriuria is indicated, clindamycin is not recommended as a treatment agent.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^68b5e22b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^753ac986]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Key points… [^d95c5f28]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus bacteria can cause severe infection in anyone.
- Certain factors can increase someone's risk.
- Help prevent early-onset GBS disease through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.
- No effective strategy has yet been identified for how to prevent late-onset disease or adult disease. How it spreads Asymptomatic carriage in gastrointestinal and genital tracts is common. Intrapartum transmission via ascending spread from the vagina occurs. Mode of transmission of disease in men and non-pregnant women is not completely known. Disease rates and trends Since its introduction, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased disease in neonates in the first week of life. However, GBS bacteria remain a leading cause of meningitis and bloodstream infections in neonates younger than 3 months old. Keep Reading: Surveillance and Trends.

Adults Most common manifestations of severe infections in adults are bacteremia and skin and soft tissue infections. During pregnancy Pregnancy-related infections and complications include:

- Bloodstream infections
- Intraamniotic infection
- Urinary tract infection
- Preterm delivery
- Stillbirth. Prevention Early-onset GBS disease can be prevented through intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. However, no effective strategy has yet been identified for how to prevent late-onset disease or adult disease. Keep Reading: Clinical Guidelines Complications Neurologic sequelae include sight or hearing loss and cerebral palsy. Death occurs in about 5% of infants and adults. Drug resistance There has been widespread use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset GBS disease. This antibiotic use has raised concern about the development of antibiotic resistance among GBS isolates.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^4f472036]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^a008a86f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ca0d435c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^9026c0c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) management — Given the presence of bacteria in a healthy urinary tract, the text emphasizes that concepts about when antibiotics are necessary must evolve, noting that symptomatic treatment and expectant management can be appropriate for some even when acute bacterial cystitis is confirmed. It urges re-evaluating the assumption that all symptomatic bacteriuria requires antibiotics and states that rUTI care should focus on symptom relief and prevention of complications rather than bacterial eradication.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^5c5476b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Antimicrobial overuse is a major health care issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Such overuse includes unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy in patients with common bacterial infections, such as acute bronchitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cellulitis. This article describes best practices for prescribing appropriate and short-duration antibiotic therapy for patients presenting with these infections.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative literature review of published clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual studies that addressed bronchitis with COPD exacerbations, CAP, UTIs, and cellulitis. This article is based on the best available evidence but was not a formal systematic review. Guidance was prioritized to the highest available level of synthesized evidence.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with COPD exacerbations and acute uncomplicated bronchitis who have clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia for a minimum of 5 days. Extension of therapy after 5 days of antibiotics should be guided by validated measures of clinical stability, which include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation.

Best Practice Advice 3

In women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, clinicians should prescribe short-course antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose. In men and women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, clinicians should prescribe short-course therapy either with fluoroquinolones (5 to 7 days) or TMP-SMZ (14 days) based on antibiotic susceptibility.

Best Practice Advice 4

In patients with nonpurulent cellulitis, clinicians should use a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci, particularly for patients able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^7674ffaa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e8c912dd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^2ee308e5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis are very common infections affecting many women throughout their lives. The determinants of infection have been well described and current strategies to prevent recurrent infections are highly effective. While antimicrobial management is straightforward for most episodes, the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli in community-acquired infection requires continuing re-evaluation of appropriate empiric therapy.

Discussion

Our study shows that PCPs do not always adhere to guidelines because they believe broad-spectrum antibiotics may be more likely to cure an infection, a finding corroborated by the well-documented overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the perception of better cure rates when using broad-spectrum agents is unfounded. For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, a pathogen frequently implicated in bacterial respiratory infections, has a much higher prevalence of resistance to macrolides than it does to amoxicillin. Nevertheless, azithromycin is often chosen over amoxicillin for the empiric treatment for AOM, sinusitis, and other respiratory infections. Similarly, for the treatment for acute uncomplicated cystitis, widespread use of fluoroquinolones has contributed to rising antimicrobial resistance, rendering ciprofloxacin far less active against urinary tract Escherichia coli infections than the more narrow-spectrum, first-line agent nitrofurantoin. The perceived association between broad-spectrum antibiotic use and better cure rates may regularly contribute to inappropriate antibiotic selection and warrants further attention from appropriate antibiotic use initiatives.

There is no widely accepted definition of broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotics among PCPs or their professional organizations. Although a list of "antibiotics of concern" has been published by the National Committee on Quality Assurance and has been used in previous research to classify antibiotics as broad-spectrum, the list was not originally intended for this purpose. Clinical practice guidelines emphasize use of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents instead of their broad-spectrum counterparts. However, the effect of these messages may be limited because of lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a narrow- versus broad-spectrum antibiotic. For example, few participants in our study were able to confidently categorize macrolides and penicillins, which are among the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics, as broad or narrow spectrum. Although this issue is largely one of semantics, it has critical implications for medical education, public health messaging, and community antibiotic resistance. Communication to PCPs related to antibiotic choice should not focus on dichotomous narrow- versus broad-spectrum terminology, but rather promote specific recommended first-line and targeted antibiotic therapies for individual diagnoses.

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^9e504cdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; P = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^9088d3c0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cc6759dd]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — antibiogram to tailor empiric therapy: In patients with sepsis assumed to be caused by complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice only if the antibiogram is local, recent, and relevant to the patient (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). An antibiogram is considered local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. If an antibiogram is being used to further tailor empirical antibiotic choice, consider selecting an antibiotic for which 90% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which 80% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock; these cutoffs are based on modeling of increased mortality risk associated with inappropriate empiric antibiotics in sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined by the Sepsis-3 Task Force as a subset of sepsis in which despite volume resuscitation, vasopressors are required to maintain blood pressure and serum lactate level is greater than 2 mmol/L, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 40%.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

A complicated urinary tract infection is that which occurs in a patient with an anatomically abnormal urinary tract or significant medical or surgical comorbidities. Whereas this definition may not cover each and every situation, it does serve to encompass the great majority of these patients and guide their care. The definition is necessarily broad, to assure that these potentially complex patients are appropriately managed. Thus, complicated urinary tract infection describes a group of patients that usually need a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy, with all its attendant morbidities, costs, and outcome differences.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^2b18ac11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in children — antimicrobial treatment trials — show limited benefits on long-term outcomes: In an uncontrolled trial in school-aged girls with persistent ASB (≥ 3 consecutive positive urine cultures), antimicrobial therapy reduced recurrent bacteriuria by 25% in white and 40% in black girls, but 10% developed acute pyelonephritis. A Swedish randomized trial allocated 30 to nitrofurantoin and 31 to no treatment, with 1 pyelonephritis and 1 cystitis in each group (RD for both, 0.1% [95% CI, −8.8% to 9.1%]). In American schoolgirls, a randomized controlled trial of nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in 63 subjects reported lower ASB recurrence in the first 6 months with treatment, but no differences in ASB at 4 years and no differences in renal scarring compared to untreated controls. In a British schoolgirl cohort, a nonrandomized, open-label, controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for 7–14 days in 110 girls with ASB reported no differences in subsequent symptoms of urinary tract infection, resolution of VUR, kidney growth, or renal scarring in treated vs untreated girls. A retrospective series of 66 Swedish school-aged girls receiving penicillin V or erythromycin for streptococcal pharyngitis noted eradication of bacteriuria in 5 girls in the penicillin group, but 6 developed acute pyelonephritis and 1 developed cystitis within 5 months following the penicillin.

### The revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the era of antibiotic stewardship [^6c77b5e9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, this review highlights the advantages of revival of old antibiotics for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs).

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown that these four oral old antibiotics, fosfomycin trometamol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline and pivmecillinam, show no increasing antibiotic resistance against uropathogens causing uUTI, are still effective for the treatment of uUTI and exhibit only minimal or no collateral damage as compared with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporines.

Summary

According to the principles of antibiotic stewardship, the prudent use of antibiotics is needed. Therefore, recent international and national guidelines already favour these old oral antibiotics as first-choice treatment of uUTI. Unfortunately, implementation of these guidelines is still suboptimal.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^4c9a502c]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Targeting asymptomatic bacteriuria in antimicrobial stewardship: the role of the microbiology laboratory [^74972032]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This minireview focuses on the microbiologic evaluation of patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, as well as indications for antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as two consecutive voided specimens (preferably within 2weeks) with the same bacterial species, isolated in quantitative counts of ≥ 10 5 CFU/ml in women, including pregnant women; a single voided urine specimen with one bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count ≥ 10 5 CFU/ml in men; and a single catheterized urine specimen with one or more bacterial species isolated in a quantitative count of ≥ 10 5 CFU/ml in either women or men (or ≥ 10 2 CFU/ml of a single bacterial species from a single catheterized urine specimen). Any urine specimen with ≥ 10 4 CFU/ml group B Streptococcus is significant for asymptomatic bacteriuria in a pregnant woman. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs, irrespective of pyuria, in the absence of signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The two groups with the best evidence of adverse outcomes in the setting of untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria include pregnant women and patients who undergo urologic procedures with risk of mucosal injury. Screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in the following patient populations: pediatric patients, healthy nonpregnant women, older patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting, diabetic patients, patients with an indwelling urethral catheter, patients with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury, patients undergoing nonurologic surgeries, and nonrenal solid-organ transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients beyond 1 month posttransplant should not undergo screening and treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening of renal transplant recipients within 1 month, patients with high-risk neutropenia, or patients with indwelling catheters at the time of catheter removal. Unwarranted antibiotics place patients at increased risk of adverse effects (including Clostridioides difficile diarrhea) and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Methods to reduce unnecessary screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria aid in antibiotic stewardship.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and complications… [^81dde1a0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis, Treatment, and ComplicationsEspañol | Print Group B strep disease is often serious. Early diagnosis and treatment are very important. Diagnosis If doctors suspect someone has GBS disease, they
- Will take samples of sterile body fluids such as blood and spinal fluid. Doctors look to see if GBS bacteria grow from the samples. It can take a few days to get these results since the bacteria need time to grow.
- May also order a chest x-ray to help determine if someone has GBS disease. Sometimes GBS bacteria can cause urinary tract infections. Doctors use a sample of urine to diagnose UTIs. Treatment Doctors usually treat GBS disease with antibiotics. Sometimes people with soft tissue and bone infections may need additional treatment, such as surgery. Treatment will depend on the kind of infection caused by GBS bacteria. It is important to start treatment as soon as possible.

Complications Babies Babies may have long-term problems, such as deafness and developmental disabilities, due to having GBS disease. Babies who had meningitis are especially at risk for having long-term problems. Even with good care, babies can still die Care for sick babies has improved a lot in the United States. However, 2 to 3 in every 50 babies who develop GBS disease will die. GBS bacteria may be one of many different factors that can cause some miscarriages, stillbirths, and preterm deliveries. Most of the time, the cause for these events is not known. Adults Serious GBS infections, such as bacteremia, sepsis, and pneumonia, can also be deadly for adults. On average, about 1 in 20 non-pregnant adults with serious GBS infections dies. Risk of death is lower among younger adults and adults who do not have other medical conditions.

### CDC grand rounds: getting smart about antibiotics [^733090d0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic use is not limited to the outpatient setting. A recent evaluation of prescribing for inpatients in two specific scenarios (urinary tract infections in patients without indwelling catheters and treatment with intravenous vancomycin) identified that antibiotic use could have been improved in 37% of cases. Frequency of antibiotic prescribing among inpatients varies considerably among hospitals. A recent study of 19 hospitals that had completed data validation and submitted antibiotic use data from one or more patient care settings, found threefold differences in usage rates among 26 medical/surgical wards.

Visits for acute respiratory tract infections lead to more inappropriate antibiotic prescribing than visits for any other group of diagnoses. For example, antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bronchitis is not recommended, and despite decades-long, widespread efforts to curb antibiotic prescribing, in 2010, 71% of all outpatient visits for this condition resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Similarly, overprescribing for pharyngitis is common. Only 5%–10% of pharyngitis cases among adults are caused by group A Streptococcus, for which antibiotic treatment is recommended, yet antibiotics are prescribed for approximately 60% of ambulatory care visits for adult pharyngitis. Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for children with acute respiratory tract infections has been decreasing since the mid- to late-1990s, but the rate of decline has slowed and might have reached a plateau. Several factors have been hypothesized to have contributed to this decrease, including the increased use of pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, national education campaigns to promote appropriate antibiotic use, and increasing concern among both the general public and health care professionals about antibiotic resistance.

In addition to the problem of overuse, antibiotic selection is often inappropriate. Prescribers often choose second- or third-line antibiotics, which are typically broad-spectrum drugs, despite established clinical practice guidelines recommending more targeted agents. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. second- or third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones) is especially problematic because of their potential for increased selection of resistant bacterial populations and their role in treating serious infections. Among U.S. ambulatory care visits during 2007–2009, broad-spectrum antibiotics accounted for 74% of antibiotics prescribed to patients during visits for respiratory conditions. Among hospitalized patients, 56% received an antibiotic during their stay and 30% received at least 1 dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

Key points
- Group B Streptococcus bacteria cause GBS disease.
- GBS disease includes many types of infections — some can be life threatening.
- Anyone can get GBS disease, but it's most common in newborns.
- If pregnant, get tested for GBS bacteria and get antibiotics during labor, if needed. Types GBS bacteria can cause many types of infections. Some of these infections can be life threatening. Infections include:

- Bacteremia
- Sepsis
- Bone and joint infections
- Urinary tract infections
- Meningitis
- Pneumonia
- Skin and soft tissue infections. Most common infections Newborns: GBS bacteria most commonly cause bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in newborns.

Adults: Bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and skin and bone infections are the most common GBS infections among men and non-pregnant women. It's very uncommon for GBS bacteria to cause meningitis in adults. Symptoms Symptoms and complications of GBS disease depend on the part of the body that's infected. Keep Reading: Symptoms and Complications Who is at risk Anyone can get GBS disease, but some people are at greater risk than others. Being a certain age or having certain medical conditions can put you at increased risk for GBS disease. Keep Reading: Risk Factors. Screening and diagnosis Screening Healthcare providers should screen all pregnant women for GBS bacteria.

Keep Reading: GBS Screening During Pregnancy Diagnosing GBS disease After seeing someone who is sick, healthcare providers may take samples depending on the type of infection they suspect:

- Blood
- Spinal fluid
- Urine Healthcare providers may also order a chest x-ray to help determine if someone has GBS disease. Treatment and recovery Healthcare providers usually treat GBS disease with antibiotics. Sometimes people with soft tissue and bone infections may need additional treatment, such as surgery. Treatment will depend on the type of infection caused by the GBS bacteria.

### A phase 2b trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 6-valent group B. streptococcus vaccine administered concomitantly with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine in healthy nonpregnant female individuals [^b20162fa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause serious disease such as sepsis, pneumonia, and, less frequently, meningitis. GBS infection of the maternal urinary tract is associated with chorioamnionitis and can cause preterm labor, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Annually, invasive GBS disease is associated with approximately 392 000 cases, 91 000 infant deaths, and 46 000 stillbirths. Additionally, up to 3.5 million preterm births annually are thought to be attributable to GBS.

The primary risk factor for early-onset GBS disease in neonates (characterized as infection within 7 days of birth) is maternal rectovaginal GBS colonization. Global prevalence of rectovaginal GBS colonization in pregnant individuals is about 18%, although there is considerable regional variation (11%–35%). A recent meta-analysis estimated that 19.7 million pregnant individuals in 2020 had maternal GBS colonization, with approximately 231 800 neonates developing early-onset invasive GBS disease and 162 200 infants developing late-onset invasive GBS disease (7‒89 days after birth).

Prophylactic antibiotic treatment from onset of labor is effective at preventing early-onset GBS disease in infants born to individuals with positive GBS cultures following screening between 35 and 37 weeks of each pregnancy, since colonization in individuals can vary over time, or in those who have other risk factors for intrapartum GBS colonization, including a previous infant with GBS disease, preterm labor, prolonged rupture of membranes > 18 hours, age ≥ 35 years, and diabetes mellitus. Limitations with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) include potential availability issues and variable implementation policies, potential contribution to antimicrobial resistance (ie, non-GBS pathogens, including Escherichia coli), and potential adverse effects such as disruption of the microbiome. IAP also does not prevent GBS-associated stillbirth or maternal peripartum infections and is not effective against late-onset GBS disease in infants.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^16b6bc0f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^cbb88f68]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: randomised controlled trial [^04a1266f]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are common in many clinical settings but especially in general practice, where they account for 25% of antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription of antibiotics when many cases are self limiting contributes to increased resistance rates, posing a serious health threat. Disease burden and treatment costs have to be considered as well. Escherichia coli, the main causative agent, is increasingly resistant to current antibiotics, and the number of new antibiotics being developed is declining. Many current primary care guidelines, however, still recommend antibiotics as a first line treatment, at least when standard measures do not lead to symptom relief. As urinary tract infection is often self limiting, and less antibiotic prescribing lowers levels of antibiotic resistance, efforts should be made to reduce rates of prescription.

Earlier trials assessed placebo compared with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection as well as delayed prescription of antibiotics. These trials reported a delayed resolution of symptoms and prolonged time to bacterial clearance but no serious complications. From qualitative studies and surveys, we know that many affected women are aware of the potential disadvantages of antibiotics and might agree to avoid or postpone such treatment.

In a pilot study we compared symptomatic (ibuprofen) with antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin) in 79 women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Although this study was inadequately powered for a definitive result, it showed that ibuprofen was not inferior for symptom resolution, with 24/36 women recovering without antibiotic treatment. In the current study we assessed whether the number of antibiotic prescriptions issued for uncomplicated urinary tract infection can be reduced by symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen, reserving antibiotics for women who return with worsening or recurrent symptoms, and without an increase in symptom burden, recurrences, or complications.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^a77bdb9d]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to choice of antibiotics, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend to complete a course of antibiotic therapy for as short a duration as reasonable, generally no longer than 7 days, in patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^c10af6fc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^182b3ddf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^f5916536]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1b80a32c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urine culture and microbial identification strategy in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — When clinical presentation and urinalysis suggest possible infection, examination for urinary bacteria using standard urine culture should be performed to inform antibiotic selection; in a propensity-matched cohort study of 48,283 women with localized UTIs, having a urine culture > 50% of the time was associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic usage compared with not having cultures > 50% of the time; nonetheless, standard urine culture has significant limitations with contamination, mishandling, and false negatives affecting up to 40% of clinically apparent UTIs, and no current test reliably distinguishes infection from colonization across all patients, so the Guideline emphasizes individualized interpretation and serial evaluation; the Panel recognizes that, in select rUTI recurrences, presumptive treatment with antibiotics can be initiated prior to finalization of testing results based on prior speciation, susceptibilities, and local antibiogram, and for reliable patients the Panel recommends a process of shared decision-making regarding deferring therapy prior to obtaining urine culture results.

This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1a72a468]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Cefixime (Suprax) [^54bff055]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.

1.2 Otitis Media

SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with otitis media caused by susceptible isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. (Efficacy for Streptococcus pyogenes in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.)

Note: For patients with otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, overall response was approximately 10% lower for cefixime than for the comparator [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.3 Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis

SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes. (Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. SUPRAX is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of SUPRAX in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever is not available.)

1.4 Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis

SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

1.5 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral)

SUPRAX is indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with uncomplicated gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by susceptible isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates).

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SUPRAX and other antibacterial drugs, SUPRAX should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^6367ad96]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^03e88d61]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Maternal origins of neonatal infections: what Do obstetrician-gynecologist should / could Do? [^b0e060e9]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neonatal infections are responsible for 20% of neonatal deaths yearly. In this review, we focused on the origins of the commoner neonatal infections, and we define the role of obstetricians. Regarding group B Streptococcus, a key measure for the prevention of neonatal infection is the vaginal-rectal culture screening at term pregnancy. Intravenous penicillin is the first-line prophylaxis at the start of labor, with intravenous ampicillin as an alternative. First-generation cephalosporins or clindamycin are recommended in case of penicillin allergy. Concerning urinary tract infections (UTIs), guidelines recommend complete urinalysis and urine culture in the first trimester of pregnancy for the screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria. For lower UTIs, guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first-choice antibiotic. Amoxicillin or cefalexin are second-line antibiotics. For upper UTIs, guidelines recommend cephalexin per os as first line. Candida spp. colonization affects 20% of pregnant women; however, congenital fetal candidosis and Candida amnionitis are rare. First-line treatment in case of symptomatic vaginitis during pregnancy or asymptomatic colonization during the third trimester is vaginal clotrimazole. Fluconazole is not approved in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Genital mycoplasmas colonization during pregnancy is usually asymptomatic and associated with bacterial vaginosis. Colonization is related to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. Macrolides are the first-line treatment along with lactobacillus supplementation. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and metronidazole are required to prevent intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection affects 1 to 5% of deliveries at term and one-third of preterm ones and is associated with perinatal death, early-onset neonatal sepsis, RDS, BPD, pneumonia, meningitis, and prematurity-related diseases. Guidelines recommend a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin, and in case of caesarean section, an additional dose of clindamycin or metronidazole is required. In conclusion, obstetricians should be aware that the treatment of maternal infection during pregnancy can prevent potentially lethal infections in the newborn. KEY POINTS: · Part of neonatal infections starts from maternal infections that must be treated during pregnancy. · Streptococcus group B and asymptomatic bacteriuria should be investigated in pregnancy and treated. · Mycoplasma and ureaplasma vaginal colonization during pregnancy is related to negative neonatal outcomes.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^5a312366]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike upper respiratory infections, which typically involve viral infections for which antibiotics are not indicated, a symptomatic UTI merits treatment with antibiotics, as recommended by the IDSA guidelines. Thus, the focus in implementing antibiotic stewardship for UTI needs to be optimisation of antibiotic choice and duration, which may present a different cognitive challenge for practitioners than deciding whether a patient needs antibiotics or not. One evidence-based strategy shown to be effective in implementing an antimicrobial stewardship for UTI in acute and long-term care settings is audit and feedback. Multiple strategies have been employed for implementing stewardship such as feedback to prescribers on antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial stewardship committee. Based on our prior successful experience with audit and feedback in acute and long-term care, we implemented a multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship intervention using audit and feedback to improve compliance with acute cystitis guidelines in a family medicine setting (general practice). The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted stewardship intervention on adherence to the evidence-based practice guidelines on treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in primary care. We hypothesised that our intervention would increase guideline adherence in terms of antibiotic choice and duration of treatment.

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^4eeb6900]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women comprise uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are very common infections in otherwise healthy women, with a high tendency to recur. Although severe complications are rare, their high prevalence causes remarkable costs in the healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

As most scientific evidence has been gathered in uncomplicated UTI, this study focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, pathogenesis, cause, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTI and recurrent UTI in women.

Summary

A remarkable increase of antibiotic resistance is also noted in uncomplicated UTI. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotic substances in uncomplicated UTI is increasingly important.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^cd8ef029]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^402463ca]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice – an observational study [^e529bdde]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is an emerging and serious public health problem resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. In urinary tract infections (UTI), resistance rates against commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents are constantly rising. Nowadays, in many countries more than 20% of responsible uropathogens are resistant to trimethoprim /sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx) and to cephalosporins. This increasing resistance is also being observed for fluoroquinolones with resistance rates, risen up to 10%. As medicine faces a bleak outlook on availability of effective antibiotic treatment, new therapeutic strategies for urinary tract infections are necessary.

In 2011 an action plan has been launched by the European Commission to tackle these problems. Aims and strategies include the promotion of a restrictive and appropriate use of antibiotics as well as the promotion of national surveillance programs. To optimize antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated UTI, the latter is urgently required for several reasons:

● Although the majority of antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated UTI takes place in primary care, information on antibiotic resistance is mainly based on data from hospitals or laboratories, i.e. - highly selected patients. Thus, results cannot be generalized to UTI patients in general practice who are likely to present with lower resistance rates.

● In general practice, urine sample of patients with UTI are not routinely tested for resistance patterns. According to German guidelines on UTI, resistance testing is recommended only in cases of treatment failure or suspected complications.

● Resistance patterns of causative uropathogens are known to vary considerably between regions and countries.

In Germany, as in many other countries, there is no sentinel network which routinely assesses resistance rates of urinary tract infections in general practice.

In face of all these facts, a prospective observational study to target antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated UTI tackles the following questions:

Which uropathogens cause uncomplicated UTI in general practice?

To what extent are these uropathogens susceptible to antibiotics recommended in German guidelines?

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^8d70c7bb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Evidence about the contribution of excessive treatment duration to antibiotic overuse in primary care is limited. A recent study from the US showed that more than two thirds of antibiotic courses for acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, whereas the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends treatment of uncomplicated cases for five to seven days. A small study from the Manitoba region in Canada, that focused on urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, skin or soft tissue infections, and pneumonia estimated that 15% of prescriptions with the appropriate antibiotic were for treatments longer than guideline based recommendations.

An up-to-date picture on prescribed antibiotic durations for common infections in English primary care is lacking. Such an overview is especially relevant given the increasing evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that shorter antibiotic courses clear infection comparable to longer courses, while minimising selection, proliferation, and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the likelihood of side effects from antibiotic use.

We therefore assessed the extent to which durations of antibiotic courses prescribed for common infections in English primary care are in line with relevant guidelines. If substantial proportions of antibiotic prescriptions are longer than recommended, this would indicate that there is potential to safely reduce total antibiotic use simply by better application of guidelines in clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^fde217b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^10627108]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Group B streptococcus (GBS) bacteriuria in pregnancy — prevalence, risk, colony counts, and screening — includes that GBS is found in the urine of 2%–7% of pregnant women, and maternal GBS bacteriuria is a marker for heavy genital tract colonization with an increased risk for early-onset disease in the newborn; antibiotics do not eliminate GBS and recolonization after a course of antibiotics is typical. Some women with GBS bacteriuria during the first trimester might not have vaginal-rectal colonization detected at 35–37 weeks' gestation or at the time of delivery, yet maternal GBS bacteriuria at any point during pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for early-onset GBS disease and has been included as an indication for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis since 1996. Most risk data concern significant GBS bacteriuria (generally > 10^5 colony-forming units per milliliter of urine); lower concentrations (< 10^4 cfu/ mL) can be associated with vaginal-rectal colonization, but relatively few data address risk among women with low-colony-count bacteriuria. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended in pregnant women, and identification of GBS through this screening represents an opportunity to detect women at high risk; however, in the context of universal late antenatal GBS screening, it is unclear how much additional disease is prevented by screening for low colony-count GBS bacteriuria and whether identification of low colony-count bacteriuria is cost-effective.

### Neonatal group B. streptococcus sepsis after negative screen in a patient taking oral antibiotics [^d284ac3a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of serious neonatal infection. Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced by appropriate prenatal screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Case

A 20-year-old primigravida was treated with oral antibiotics at 35 weeks for a recurrent urinary tract infection. Her GBS screen following the antibiotic treatment showed a negative culture. The patient, therefore, did not receive intravenous antibiotics during her induction of labor for mild preeclampsia. The infant developed early onset neonatal GBS pneumonia and sepsis.

Conclusion

Oral antibiotics can cause a temporary negative culture in a GBS-colonized patient. Relying on a negative culture for management may not be appropriate in a patient treated with oral antibiotics. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of oral antibiotics on GBS.

### Effects of a multimodal intervention in primary care to reduce second line antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections in women: parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial [^c49ba496]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether a multimodal intervention in general practice reduces the proportion of second line antibiotic prescriptions and the overall proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

Design

Parallel, cluster randomised, controlled trial.

Setting

General practices in five regions in Germany. Data were collected between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022.

Participants

General practitioners from 128 randomly assigned practices.

Interventions

Multimodal intervention consisting of guideline recommendations for general practitioners and patients, provision of regional data for antibiotic resistance, and quarterly feedback, which included individual first line and second line proportions of antibiotic prescribing, benchmarking with regional or supra-regional practices, and telephone counselling. Participants in the control group received no information on the intervention.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was the proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed by general practices, in relation to all antibiotics prescribed, for uncomplicated urinary tract infections after one year between the intervention and control group. General practices were randomly assigned in blocks (1:1), with a block size of four, into the intervention or control group using SAS version 9.4; randomisation was stratified by region. The secondary outcome was the prescription proportion of all antibiotics, relative within all cases (instances of UTI diagnosis), for the treatment of urinary tract infections after one year between the groups. Adverse events were assessed as exploratory outcomes.

Results

110 practices with full datasets identified 10323 cases during five quarters (ie, 15 months). The mean proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed was 0.19 (standard deviation 0.20) in the intervention group and 0.35 (0.25) in the control group after 12 months. After adjustment for preintervention proportions, the mean difference was -0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.21 to -0.06, P < 0.001). The overall proportion of all antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections over 12 months was 0.74 (standard deviation 0.22) in the intervention and 0.80 (0.15) in the control group with a mean difference of -0.08 (95% confidence interval -0.15 to -0.02, P < 0.029). No differences were noted in the number of complications (ie, pyelonephritis, admission to hospital, or fever) between the groups.

Conclusions

The multimodal intervention in general practice significantly reduced the proportion of second line antibiotics and all antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.

Urinary tract (252 of 1076 [23%]), bone and joint (173 of 1076 [16%]), and bloodstream (115 of 1076 [11%]) infections comprised the remaining majority (Table 2). The 10 most common diagnoses were skin abscess, treated bacteriuria (abnormal urinalysis and antibiotic prescribed), osteomyelitis, secondary bacteremia, skin ulcer, necrotizing myositis, pyelonephritis, cystitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and community-acquired pneumonia, accounting for 84% (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Results were similar when pregnant or puerperal women were excluded from the analyses (data not shown).

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^8ef453e7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC 2010 prevention of perinatal group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease — key updates and prevention approach: GBS remains the leading cause of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States, and initial case series reported case-fatality ratios as high as 50%. Universal screening at 35–37 weeks' gestation for maternal GBS colonization and use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has resulted in sustained reductions in early-onset disease, although rates of maternal GBS colonization remain unchanged since the 1970s. The key 2010 changes include expanded recommendations on laboratory methods, clarification of the colony-count threshold for reporting GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy, updated screening and intrapartum chemoprophylaxis algorithms for women with preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes, a change in the recommended dose of penicillin-G for chemoprophylaxis, updated prophylaxis regimens for women with penicillin allergy, and a revised algorithm for management of newborns with respect to risk for early-onset GBS disease. Colonization with GBS in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts is identified as the primary risk factor, trials showed that administering intravenous antibiotics during labor to women at risk could prevent early-onset disease, and in the absence of a licensed GBS vaccine, universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis continue to be the cornerstones of prevention.

Acute UTI with complicating factors — Women with rUTI who have complicating factors, such as abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, require additional vigilance in diagnosis and management. Initial empiric therapy until culture results are available to guide therapy (consider only if local resistance < 20%) can include a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), an aminopenicillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3a (parenteral), or an aminoglycoside. For empirical treatment in severe cases or initial failure, options include a fluoroquinolone (if not used for initial therapy), piperacillin plus a β-lactam inhibitor, a cephalosporin group 3b (parenteral), or a carbapenem. Not recommended for empirical treatment are aminopenicillins (eg, ampicillin, amoxicillin, bacampicillin), TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin trometamol.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c8894dfb]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship and the consideration of collateral damage in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) highlight rising resistance and drug-specific risks, noting, "In the past 20 years, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens has increased dramatically". The text states, "Fluoroquinolones have been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while broad spectrum cephalosporins have been linked to subsequent infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, ESBL–producing K. pneumoniae, β-lactam resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)". Stewardship adherence "may significantly mitigate increasing fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance", yet "Non-adherence to Guidelines for the treatment of acute cystitis, however, is more common in patients who have rUTIs than patients with an isolated episode of acute cystitis". Practices such as "lengthening the antimicrobial course, broadening antibiotic treatment, or increasing antibiotic doses" lack evidence and "have not been demonstrated to be efficacious and have the potential for harm", and "Providers should combine knowledge of the local antibiogram with the selection of antimicrobial agents with the least impact on normal vaginal and fecal flora", with an antibiogram described as providing "a profile of the local results of antimicrobial sensitivity testing", and aggregate results "usually annually, providing the percentage of a given organism sensitive to a particular antimicrobial".

The mean proportion of second line antibiotics prescribed was 0.19 (standard deviation 0.20) in the intervention group and 0.35 (0.25) in the control group after 12 months. After adjustment for preintervention proportions, the mean difference was −0.13 (95% confidence interval −0.21 to −0.06, P < 0.001). The overall proportion of all antibiotic prescriptions for urinary tract infections over 12 months was 0.74 (standard deviation 0.22) in the intervention and 0.80 (0.15) in the control group with a mean difference of −0.08 (95% confidence interval −0.15 to −0.02, P < 0.029). No differences were noted in the number of complications (ie, pyelonephritis, admission to hospital, or fever) between the groups.

Conclusions

The multimodal intervention in general practice significantly reduced the proportion of second line antibiotics and all antibiotic prescriptions for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women.
