## Question

Cloudy infiltration tuberculosis x-ray picture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a "cloudy infiltration" on chest X-ray means in the context of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, how to interpret it, and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cloudy infiltration" actually represents radiologically. Then, I should verify how often this pattern occurs in active TB and whether it is specific. Next, I will consider host factors that modify the radiographic pattern, especially HIV and immunocompromise. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and the limitations of chest radiography. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-based diagnostic pathway and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Cloudy infiltration" on chest radiography generally corresponds to ill-defined, patchy airspace opacities reflecting consolidation or ground-glass change, often with heterogeneous density and poorly demarcated margins. In TB, this is commonly described as patchy, poorly defined consolidation in the upper lobes, which may evolve to cavitation as disease progresses [^8eb4858c] [^134a657b].

> Wait, let me verify how specific this is for active TB. I initially thought "cloudy infiltration" might be pathognomonic, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Patchy consolidation is a nonspecific pattern seen in many pneumonias and inflammatory processes; in TB, it is particularly associated with post-primary disease and early bronchogenic spread, and it may coexist with or evolve into cavitation, which is more specific for active TB [^8eb4858c] [^134a657b].

> I need to check the anatomic distribution. In immunocompetent adults, TB consolidation classically involves the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes and the superior segment of the lower lobes, often multifocal. In children and adolescents, post-primary TB can show similar upper-lobe consolidation and cavitation, though primary TB more often features lymphadenopathy rather than consolidation [^8eb4858c] [^081abb19].

> Next, I should review host modifiers. In HIV, especially with low CD4 counts, the chest radiograph frequently shows atypical patterns: lower-lobe infiltrates, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, or even a normal film despite active disease. I should double-check that this is supported by high-quality data, and yes, molecular epidemiology and contemporary guidelines confirm that HIV status, not recency of infection, is the dominant predictor of atypical radiography in TB [^8dcfc460] [^434d3a7f].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential when I see "cloudy infiltration". Bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonias including COVID-19, fungal infections, and noninfectious processes can all produce patchy consolidation. In endemic settings, TB remains high on the list, but I need to ensure we do not anchor prematurely on TB without microbiologic confirmation or a compatible clinical context [^notfound].

> I will now examine the diagnostic implications. An abnormal chest radiograph increases the pretest probability of TB, but it cannot establish the diagnosis. I should confirm that guidelines recommend obtaining chest radiography in patients with suspected TB and then pursuing microbiologic confirmation with sputum smear, culture, and preferably a WHO-recommended molecular test such as Xpert MTB/RIF, while recognizing that a normal CXR does not exclude TB, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^99e383c3] [^89a429fa] [^434d3a7f].

> Let me consider next steps when "cloudy infiltration" is seen. First, I should correlate with symptoms and risk factors. Persistent cough beyond 2–3 weeks, fever, night sweats, weight loss, or hemoptysis heighten suspicion. Second, I should order three sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture and perform Xpert MTB/RIF on at least one specimen. Third, if the CXR is nondiagnostic or suspicion remains high despite a normal film, I should obtain chest CT to better characterize disease extent, cavitation, and bronchogenic spread, which can guide isolation and management decisions [^80161c3b] [^b359d34b] [^9e46c0ee].

> But wait, what if the patient is smear-negative with only "cloudy infiltration" on CXR? I should double-check the evidence on culture-negative TB. Culture-negative TB accounts for a meaningful fraction of cases and is associated with less cavitation and milder symptoms; in such patients, a compatible radiograph plus clinical response to empiric therapy supports the diagnosis, though I must strive for microbiologic confirmation whenever possible to enable drug-susceptibility testing and optimal regimen selection [^bd8996db].

> Let me reconsider prognostic implications briefly. Extent of disease and cavitation on chest radiograph correlate with higher bacillary burden, slower microbiologic response, and increased relapse risk, reinforcing the need for adequate treatment duration and close follow-up when "cloudy infiltration" reflects more extensive or cavitary disease [^8dc8b314] [^1da11fb8].

> In summary, I should confirm that "cloudy infiltration" on chest X-ray in suspected TB most often reflects patchy, ill-defined consolidation that is consistent with active post-primary TB, particularly in the upper lobes, but it is not specific and must be interpreted alongside clinical context and host immune status. The next step is always to pursue microbiologic confirmation and, when needed, cross-sectional imaging to define disease extent and guide management [^8eb4858c] [^99e383c3] [^89a429fa].

A "cloudy infiltration" on chest X-ray in tuberculosis refers to **patchy, ill-defined opacities** in the lungs, most often in the upper lobes, reflecting airspace consolidation from inflammatory exudate and caseous necrosis [^8eb4858c]. This pattern is **nonspecific** and can mimic bacterial pneumonia, so it must be confirmed with sputum smear/culture or NAAT [^89a429fa] [^2b184ed6]. Cavitation, nodules, or a miliary pattern may coexist, and HIV or immunocompromise can alter the distribution and appearance [^8dcfc460] [^434d3a7f]. Management should follow microbiologic confirmation and guideline-based therapy [^ca303afe].

---

## Radiographic features of cloudy infiltration in tuberculosis

- **Location**: Predominantly upper lobes (apical/posterior segments), less often superior lower-lobe segments [^8eb4858c].
- **Appearance**: Patchy, ill-defined opacities with heterogeneous density; may coalesce into larger consolidations [^8eb4858c].
- **Evolution**: Early infiltrates can progress to cavitation, fibrosis, or bronchiectasis with treatment or natural history [^8eb4858c].
- **Associated findings**: Cavitation, nodules, miliary micronodules, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy may coexist [^d93ebeb4].

---

## Clinical significance of cloudy infiltration

- **Active disease**: Suggests ongoing inflammation and bacterial replication, often with symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^54823dca].
- **Infectiousness**: Higher likelihood of transmission, especially with cavitation or smear positivity [^36055f10].
- **Severity**: May reflect more extensive disease and worse outcomes if untreated [^8dc8b314].

---

## Differentiation from other pulmonary conditions

| **Condition** | **Radiographic features** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Tuberculosis | - Patchy upper-lobe consolidation <br/> - Cavitation <br/> - Slow progression | - Chronic cough <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - TB exposure |
| Bacterial pneumonia | - Lobar consolidation <br/> - Air bronchograms <br/> - Rapid progression | - Acute fever <br/> - Productive cough <br/> - Leukocytosis |
| Fungal infection | - Nodules <br/> - Cavitation <br/> - Halo sign | - Immunocompromise <br/> - Travel exposure |
| Malignancy | - Mass lesion <br/> - Well-defined nodules | - Hemoptysis <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Smoking history |

---

## Role of additional imaging modalities

CT provides **greater detail** than chest X-ray, revealing cavitation, tree-in-bud nodules, and extent of disease; it is useful when the CXR is inconclusive or to detect complications [^9e46c0ee] [^b359d34b]. Ultrasound is adjunctive in resource-limited settings, detecting consolidation and pleural effusion, but has limited sensitivity for cavitation [^1ed0a53a].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

- **Confirmation**: Obtain sputum smear/culture or NAAT (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) to confirm TB and guide therapy [^89a429fa] [^2b184ed6].
- **Treatment**: Initiate standard anti-tuberculous therapy per guidelines; adjust based on drug susceptibility results [^ca303afe].
- **Monitoring**: Serial CXRs can track response; persistent or worsening infiltrates despite therapy warrant reassessment for resistance, adherence, or alternative diagnoses [^1da11fb8].

---

## Prognostic implications

Extensive infiltration or cavitation correlates with higher relapse risk and poorer outcomes, whereas **early detection and treatment** improve prognosis [^8dc8b314]. Persistent infiltrates after therapy may indicate chronic lung damage or bronchiectasis [^notfound].

---

A "cloudy infiltration" on chest X-ray in TB reflects **patchy upper-lobe consolidation** from inflammatory exudate and caseous necrosis; it signals active disease and potential infectivity, but is not specific and requires microbiologic confirmation. CT can refine disease extent and complications, and management should follow confirmed diagnosis and guideline-directed therapy.

Active signs: including multiple nodular lesions, patchy, cloudy flocculent and lobar lung consolidations, mass-like opacities, and enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. These lesions are featured by heterogeneous density, high central density, peripheral low density, irregular distribution, and infiltrative changes. They may be accompanied by thick-walled, thin-walled, tension cavities, and multiple moth-eaten cavities, as well as satellite lesions, bronchial dissemination, bronchial dilation, lymphangitis, and pleural effusion. Stable signs: including dense nodules, plaques, calcified nodules, fibrous strands and residual purification cavities after treatment. These lesions have clear and sharp margins and may accompany pleural and/or mediastinal lymph node calcifications. Dense nodules and plaques are classified as sclerosing lesions, fibrous striated lesions are classified as fibrotic lesions. Calcified nodules and residual purgative cavities after treatment are classified as calcified lesions. Uncertain signs: including patchy lesions and non-patchy lesions (destroyed lungs, atelectasis, tuberculomas) and other lesions that have not yet been fully calcified, cannot make a diagnosis of inactive pulmonary tuberculosis based on these signs alone; further analysis after obtaining computed tomography scans is required.

Prior tuberculosis was defined as participants with tuberculosis treatment history registered through TBIMS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2019. Prevalence cases were defined as those identified either actively or passively among participants during the screening period. Individuals with tuberculosis found before the screening period were not included in this study. A one-month period was allowed for referral and diagnosis following screening, thus including prevalent cases found within one month after the last screening date. Therefore, screening took place from March to September, and all cases found during the time period of March to October were defined as prevalent. Incident cases were those identified and detected either actively or passively during the follow-up period. The follow-up was during the two years post-completion of the screening period. This was from 1 November 2020 to 31 October 2022. Tuberculosis patients occurred exclusively among those who participated in the baseline screening; data from follow-up years (year 1, year 2) did not include individuals who did not partake in the baseline screening.

Introduction

TB remains the leading adult infectious killer in the world. Despite an estimated nine per cent relative increase in case detection in 2018, there are still three million (30%) people with TB who are undiagnosed or not reported to national TB programmes. In an effort to identify missing people with TB, countries have adopted more sensitive diagnostic tools, including Xpert MTB/RIF, scaled up intensified active case finding (ACF), and adapted their screening and diagnostic algorithms to include chest X-ray (CXR) as a sensitive and efficient high-throughput initial screening test.

Historically, miniature radiography for mass TB screening activities was widely used in high-income countries throughout the 20th century. In lower-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), however, CXR has been used primarily as a complementary tool to support clinical diagnosis of patients who are sputum smear negative. Following the findings from national TB prevalence surveys that have employed CXR for screening, there is a renewed interest in the utility of CXR for TB screening, and to triage people seeking care with symptoms for further TB investigations. In TB prevalence surveys conducted in LMICs, CXR has shown high sensitivity for pulmonary TB (PTB) (94%, 95% CI 88% to 98%) but poor specificity (73%, 95% CI 68% to 77%), necessitating confirmation with a microbiological test. Mathematical modelling of various TB screening algorithms, as well as diagnostic algorithms, shows that CXR followed by Xpert MTB/RIF, though resource intensive, has the lowest number needed to screen to identify a case. Increased digital CXR availability, coupled with the development of computer aided detection (CAD) software for identification of TB, has enabled increasing use of CXR in screening for TB in areas with limited access to radiologists or expert clinicians.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^70f1ab5f]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

For presumed TB-related abnormalities, prevalence of minor post-TB lung changes, such as old/latent TB involving fewer than two lobes of damage/scarring, was 7.6% (95% CI 6.1% to 9.3%), active TB was 3.6% (95% CI 2.6% to 4.8%) and severe post-TB lung changes, that is, bronchiectasis and/or destroyed lung, 1.4% (95% CI 0.8% to 2.3%).

Between a quarter and a third of females had cardiomegaly (29%). For males, 11.7% had cardiomegaly and 11.2% mild/moderate post-TB lung changes. History of cough was a common feature across all diagnosis types, with 69 out of 250 (27.6%) of coughers having cardiomegaly. Out of the 40 participants with chest pain, 22.5% (10.8%–38.5%) had cardiomegaly and 20% (9.1%–35.6%) had minor post-TB lung changes. Bacteriological confirmation of TB was found in all categories of reported TB-related lung abnormalities and 4 out 27 (14.8%, 4.2%–33.7%) of images reported as non-specific patterns (table 2). Out of the 34 participants with a history of previous TB treatment, features consistent with minor post-TB lung changes were reported in 11 (32.4%, 95% CI 17.4% to 50.5%), active PTB in 6 (17.6%, 95% CI 6.8% to 34.5%) and severe post-TB lung changes in 4 (11.8%, 95% CI 3.3% to 27.5%).

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^0510a8cb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The findings of this study offer several important insights about mass screening and tuberculosis risk. First, after active screening, partnered interventions may be guided by the different types of abnormal imaging results for high-risk populations. For individuals exhibiting signs of active tuberculosis, uncertain signs, or those with cavities, strengthening pathogen detection based on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sampling, fully utilizing the sensitivity and timeliness advantages of molecular diagnostic technologies to achieve early diagnosis and prompt treatment. For clinical diagnoses without supporting pathogen evidence, standardized evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis treatment should be conducted to support clinical diagnosis and improve treatment completion rates. These recommendations need further validation in different regions and populations across China. Second, preventive interventions — such as preventive treatment or a full disease treatment regimen — among persons without microbiologically-positive tuberculosis but suggestive X-rays should be further explored. In China and most other settings, this population is not prioritized likely due a lack of empirical evidence regarding effective interventional approaches.

### Prompt recognition of infectious pulmonary tuberculosis is critical to achieving elimination goals: a retrospective cohort study [^3e235c15]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

An experienced chest radiologist, blind to the smear status of the patients, re-read the posterior-anterior and lateral chest images performed at the time of diagnosis. In the context of this study, d frontal images were divided into four quadrants by halving a perpendicular drawn from the apex of the lung to the dome of the hemidiaphragm. Documented were the presence or absence of (1) parenchymal infiltrates and their dominant location — no distinction was made between infiltrates that were airspace, interstitial, nodular or some combination of these; (2) cavities, defined as a gas-filled space within pulmonary consolidation, a mass, or a nodule; (3) adenopathy — hilar, mediastinal or both; and (4) pleural effusion.

As previously reported, we categorised patients as having 'typical' versus 'atypical' radiographs based on the characteristics listed above. For patients with infiltration localised to, or predominantly in the upper long zones, with or without cavitation, but with no discernable intrathoracic adenopathy, the radiograph is 'typical' for adult-type PTB. In patients with (1) no abnormality; (2) intrathoracic adenopathy with or without parenchymal disease; (3) a localised or predominant lower lung zone infiltrate, with or without cavitation; (4) an isolated pleural effusion; and (5) a miliary (diffuse micronodular) pattern, the radiograph is 'atypical' for adult-type PTB. We report extent of disease on chest radiograph as normal, minimal, moderately, far advanced or miliary according to criteria established by the US National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association.

### CT of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [^9e46c0ee]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Radiologic manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can vary according to several host factors, including prior exposure to TB, age, and underlying immune status. Although chest radiography is the mainstay in the evaluation of pulmonary TB, CT generally is required to detect fine lesions overlooked on chest radiographs, to define equivocal lesions, or to evaluate complications. High-resolution CT is useful in understanding the pathologic process of the disease and in determining disease activity in selected cases. This article describes the characteristic CT findings of various forms of pulmonary TB and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection according to immune status of the patients, and assesses the role of CT in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary TB.

### Clinical and imaging factors that can predict contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis [^43823a46]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistically not significant results

The following criteria were not helpful in identifying highly contagious patients as they revealed no significant difference: Infiltrate in CXR, infiltrate in CT, miliary picture, pleural effusion.

Other relevant results

34% of all patients were clinically asymptomatic (no haemoptysis, cough, weight loss, auscultation).

20% of the highly contagious patients were asymptomatic, 50% of the lowly contagious group. This is a statistically significant difference (p < .001) (Table 4).

CXR and CT detected abnormal findings in a similar accuracy, while CT showed more TB specific findings than CXR (cavitation, tree-in-bud sign).

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^60b6c07d]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of diseases other than TB detected during chest X-ray (CXR) screening is unknown in sub-Saharan Africa. This represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment of potentially significant disease. Our aim was to describe and quantify non-TB abnormalities identified by TB-focused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey.

Methods

We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult (≥ 15 years) CXRs classified as 'abnormal, suggestive of TB' or 'abnormal other' during field interpretation from the TB prevalence survey. Each image was read (blinded to field classification and study radiologist read) by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological findings. A third reader resolved discrepancies. Prevalence and 95% CIs of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated.

Findings

Cardiomegaly was the most common non-TB abnormality at 259 out of 1123 (23.1%, 95% CI 20.6% to 25.6%), while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17 out of 1123 (1.5%, 95% CI 0.9% to 2.4%). We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected COPD in 3.2% (95% CI 2.3% to 4.4%) and non-specific patterns in 4.6% (95% CI 3.5% to 6.0%). Prevalence of active-TB and severe post-TB lung changes was 3.6% (95% CI 2.6% to 4.8%) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.8% to 2.3%), respectively.

Interpretation

Based on radiological findings, we identified a wide variety of non-TB abnormalities during population-based TB screening. TB prevalence surveys and active case finding activities using mass CXR offer an opportunity to integrate disease screening efforts.

HIV coinfection and tuberculosis (TB) — case detection and case management — are complicated by altered presentations and the need for coordinated care. HIV-infected patients are more likely to have extrapulmonary or miliary TB and, when pulmonary, tend toward atypical findings; features depend on CD4 count, with those having more than 300 cells/μl usually showing upper lobe cavitary infiltrates, and pulmonary TB can occur despite a normal chest radiograph. In congregate settings with HIV-infected persons, screening has been successfully conducted using symptom checklists, tuberculin skin testing, and chest radiographs. Comprehensive case management, including directly observed therapy (DOT), is particularly important, and among HIV-infected TB patients, more favorable outcomes and survival have been associated with DOT than with self-administered therapy.

### Standardized radiographic interpretation of thoracic tuberculosis in children [^081abb19]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Post-primary tuberculosis

Post-primary tuberculosis is also known as adult-type, reactivation or secondary tuberculosis and sometimes phthisis. This results from the reactivation of dormant foci. It is further observed in the pediatric age group, mostly in adolescents. It is considered a late disease progression of the primary infection, which can occur 8–24 months from exposure and in children as young as 8 years.

The most commonly affected locations are the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes and the apical segment of the lower lobes because of higher oxygen tension (Fig. 18). Initially there might be cloudy opacification in a segment before coalescence and parenchymal breakdown. Complications include cavitation, bronchogenic spread with bronchopneumonic consolidation, exudative pleuritis, cicatrization atelectasis of the upper lobe with retraction of hilum and formation of traction bronchiectasis. Lymph node enlargement is not common in comparison to primary tuberculosis.

Fig. 18
Diagram of a post-primary tuberculosis with upper lobe predominance

Cavitation is radiographically evident in 40% of cases of post-primary disease. The walls of the cavities might appear thin and smooth or thick and nodular. It is difficult to distinguish thin-walled cavities from bullae, cysts or pneumatoceles. Cystic bronchiectasis should also be considered when multiple cavities are present (Figs. 18 and 19).

Fig. 19
Post-primary tuberculosis in a 14-year-old girl. a, b Posteroanterior chest radiograph (a) and volume-rendered CT (b) show cavitations, traction and cystic bronchiectasis in the right lung

In 20% of post-primary tuberculosis cases, bronchogenic spread appears on radiographs as multiple, ill-defined micronodules in a segmental or lobar distribution, typically in the lower-lung zones. High-resolution CT, the modality of choice, demonstrates centrilobular nodules ranging 2–4 mm with linear branching opacities ("tree-in-bud" sign) which represent caseous necrosis at and around terminal and respiratory bronchioles (Fig. 20). Complete destruction of the entire lung or a large part of a lung is not uncommon in the end stage of tuberculosis. Secondary pyogenic or fungal infection can occur. Miliary tuberculosis and tuberculomas might also be encountered in post-primary tuberculosis.

### Radiological manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis [^134a657b]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a common worldwide lung infection. The radiological features show considerable variation, but in most cases they are characteristic enough to suggest the diagnosis. Classically, tuberculosis is divided into primary, common in childhood, and postprimary, usually presenting in adults. The most characteristic radiological feature in primary tuberculosis is lymphadenopathy. On enhanced CT, hilar and mediastinal nodes with a central hypodense area suggest the diagnosis. Cavitation is the hallmark of postprimary tuberculosis and appears in around half of patients. Patchy, poorly defined consolidation in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes, and in the superior segment of the lower lobe is also commonly observed. Several complications are associated with tuberculous infection, such as hematogenous dissemination (miliary tuberculosis) or extension to the pleura, resulting in pleural effusion. Late complications of tuberculosis comprise a heterogeneous group of processes including tuberculoma, bronchial stenosis bronchiectasis, broncholithiasis, aspergilloma, bronchoesophageal fistula and fibrosing mediastinitis. Radiology provides essential information for the management and follow up of these patients and is extremely valuable for monitoring complications.

### Clinical characteristics and predictive model of pulmonary tuberculosis patients with pulmonary fungal coinfection [^6e2157d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Following are the diagnostic criteria for pulmonary fungal infection according to the "Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pulmonary Mycosis" proposed by the Infections Group of the Respiratory Society of the Chinese Medical Association in 2007: 1. at least present one host incidence risk factor. 2. Those who meet clinical characteristics of pulmonary mycosis {(1) Main clinical features: 1. invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with chest X-ray and Computed Tomography examination showing increased subpleural nodules or halo symptoms around the lesions in the early stages of the disease; chest X-ray and CT examination showing pulmonary cavity or a crescent sign 10–15 days after onset; 2. Pneumocyte pneumonia: chest CT examination showing hair glass lung interstitial infiltration. (2) Secondary clinical features: 1. continuous fever > 96 h with no significant improvement after aggressive antibiotic treatment; 2. symptoms and signs of a lung infection, including cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, moist rales or pleural friction sound; 3. imaging examination showing new non-specific lung infiltration other than the main clinical features}, 3. Those presenting lung histopathological evidence. 4.

### Active pulmonary tuberculosis: something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue [^b662451d]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a major global health issue affecting all countries and age groups. Radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This review aims to improve understanding and diagnostic value of imaging in PTB. We present the old, well-established findings ranging from primary TB to the common appearances of post-primary TB, including dissemination with tree-in-bud nodularity, haematogenous dissemination with miliary nodules and lymphatic dissemination. We discuss new concepts in active PTB with special focus on imaging findings in immunocompromised individuals. We illustrate PTB appearances borrowed from other diseases in which the signs were initially described: the reversed halo sign, the galaxy sign and the cluster sign. There are several radiological signs that have been shown to correlate with positive or negative sputum smears, and radiologists should be aware of these signs as they play an important role in guiding the need for isolation and empirical anti-tuberculous therapy.

### The natural history of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e55dc344]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Stages of tuberculosis disease can be delineated by radiology, microbiology, and symptoms, but transitions between these stages remain unclear. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of individuals with untreated tuberculosis who underwent follow-up (34 cohorts from 24 studies, with a combined sample of 139063), we aimed to quantify progression and regression across the tuberculosis disease spectrum by extracting summary estimates to align with disease transitions in a conceptual framework of the natural history of tuberculosis. Progression from microbiologically negative to positive disease (based on smear or culture tests) in participants with baseline radiographic evidence of tuberculosis occurred at an annualised rate of 10% (95% CI 6·2–13·3) in those with chest x-rays suggestive of active tuberculosis, and at a rate of 1% (0·3–1·8) in those with chest x-ray changes suggestive of inactive tuberculosis. Reversion from microbiologically positive to undetectable disease in prospective cohorts occurred at an annualised rate of 12% (6·8–18·0). A better understanding of the natural history of pulmonary tuberculosis, including the risk of progression in relation to radiological findings, could improve estimates of the global disease burden and inform the development of clinical guidelines and policies for treatment and prevention.

### Do private providers initiate anti-tuberculosis therapy on the basis of chest radiographs? A standardised patient study in urban India [^ad5f8f3a]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

An important marker of high-quality tuberculosis (TB) care is the initiation of anti-TB treatment (ATT) based on the results of WHO-approved microbiological diagnostics. Only 60% of the 4.8 million people diagnosed with pulmonary TB worldwide in 2020 were microbiologically confirmed. Remaining patients are diagnosed clinically, that is, based on signs and symptoms, and/or by abnormalities on chest radiographs (CXR) or other non-microbiological tests. Microbiological detection of TB is critical because it allows patients to be correctly diagnosed, is a prerequisite to test for drug resistance, and ensures that the most effective treatment regimen is initiated, based on the drug resistance pattern.

The WHO thus urges National TB Programs (NTPs) to make use of WHO recommended diagnostics (WRDs) that are more sensitive than smear microscopy. Recently, WHO updated its guidelines for the use of molecular assays intended as initial tests for the diagnosis of TB: amongst both adults and children in the general population with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB or with CXR with lung abnormalities or both, Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) or TrueNAT MTB (Molbio Diagnostics, India) should replace smears as the initial test for pulmonary TB. In India, the NTP's current algorithm has been revised to reflect current standards, and includes the use of CXR as a screening test and the upfront use of rapid molecular tests. The NTP guidelines recommend that all efforts must be made to confirm a TB diagnosis microbiologically, and defines an CXR-based diagnosis as 'clinically diagnosed TB'.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^61b0dbf2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) disease in people with HIV are characterized as follows: people with HIV and TB disease may be asymptomatic but have positive sputum cultures with or without abnormal chest radiograph findings (subclinical TB). In ambulatory people with HIV, the presence of any one of cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss has high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing TB in resource-limited settings, and compared to treatment-naive patients with HIV, the sensitivity of classic TB symptoms is lower in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In people with HIV and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3, HIV-related TB generally resembles TB among people without HIV. Most people with or without HIV have disease limited to the lungs, with common chest radiographic manifestations of upper lobe infiltrates with or without cavitation.

### Active pulmonary tuberculosis: something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue [^8eb4858c]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Patchy, poorly defined areas of heterogeneous consolidation are among the earliest manifestations of active PTB. The distribution is primarily in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes and less frequent in the apical segments of the lower lobes, with commonly more than one pulmonary segment involved. Tuberculous consolidation can be challenging to distinguish from bacterial pneumonia in absence of associated findings such as lymphadenopathy or cavitation and the lack of response to conventional antibiotics. In their evolution, these regions liquefy and form cavities by draining through the tracheobronchial tree. Cavitation affects about 50% of patients. The cavities are usually multiple and typically have thick, irregular walls, which become smooth and thin with successful treatment. Cavities may demonstrate air-fluid levels which can also indicate superinfection (Fig. 2), (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

Fig. 2
An 83-year-old male presented with pyrexia of unknown origin. CT (lung window) demonstrates extensive consolidation in the right upper lobe (coronal plane — a), bilateral thick-walled cavities (axial planes — b, c, circled) and centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud appearance (arrowheads)

Bronchogenic spread manifests as multiple, 2–4 mm centrilobular nodules and sharply marginated linear branching opacities, described as a "tree-in-bud" pattern (Fig. 3). These have a tendency to coalesce in a segmental or lobar distribution, typically involving the lower lung zones and the peripheral areas of consolidation or cavities. Micronodules are difficult to identify on standard chest radiography, therefore CT is the imaging technique of choice to reveal early bronchogenic spread. The term "tree-in-bud" was first used to describe the characteristic appearance of the endobronchial spread of TB, however, it is not pathognomonic for active TB. Patchy areas of air trapping are also seen in some patients with tuberculous bronchiolitis.

### Computed tomography features of acute pulmonary tuberculosis [^a48e16f2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the computed tomography (CT) features of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with acute clinical manifestations. The emergent CT images of 46 non-AIDS patients with acute clinical presentations of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were analyzed. The distribution and characterization of the pulmonary and pleural lesions were specifically focused. Multifocal airspace consolidation in multiple lobes was most commonly seen on the CT in 32 of 46 patients (70%), followed by cavitary pulmonary nodular shadows (50%). Other CT manifestations included pleural effusion (40%), TB empyema (20%), and lymphadenopathy (11%). On followup, 12 patients (26%) developed acute respiratory failure. Patients presenting with multifocal pulmonary consolidation, with or without cavitations, on CT should undergo early pulmonary TB workup. These findings could help early detection for pulmonary TB.

### A simple, valid, numerical score for grading chest X-ray severity in adult smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis [^1da11fb8]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The grading of radiological severity in clinical trials in tuberculosis (TB) remains unstandardised. The aim of this study was to generate and validate a numerical score for grading chest x-ray (CXR) severity and predicting response to treatment in adults with smear-positive pulmonary TB.

Methods

At a TB clinic in Papua, Indonesia, serial CXRs were performed at diagnosis, 2 and 6 months in 115 adults with smear-positive pulmonary TB. Radiographic findings predictive of 2-month sputum microscopy status were used to generate a score. The validity of the score was then assessed in a second data set of 139 comparable adults with TB, recruited 4 years later at the same site. Relationships between the CXR score and other measures of TB severity were examined.

Results

The estimated proportion of lung affected and presence of cavitation, but not cavity size or other radiological findings, significantly predicted outcome and were combined to derive a score given by percentage of lung affected plus 40 if cavitation was present. As well as predicting 2-month outcome, scores were significantly associated with sputum smear grade at diagnosis (p < 0.001), body mass index, lung function, haemoglobin, exercise tolerance and quality of life (p < 0.02 for each). In the validation data set, baseline CXR score predicted 2-month smear status significantly more accurately than did the proportion of lung affected alone. In both data sets, CXR scores decreased over time (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

This simple, validated method for grading CXR severity in adults with smear-positive pulmonary TB correlates with baseline clinical and microbiological severity and response to treatment, and is suitable for use in clinical trials.

### Pulmonary involvement in pleural tuberculosis: how often does it mean disease activity? [^b10aef81]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate in chest X-rays and high-resolution computed tomographies of patients with pleural tuberculosis, the incidence of parenchymal and mediastinal lung lesions suggestive of active disease.

Methods

Prospective study (2008–2009) evaluating the radiographic and tomographic abnormalities of 88 HIV-negative patients with pleural tuberculosis (unilateral effusion). The images were reviewed by 3 independent specialists, and the observed changes were classified according to previously established criteria: presence or absence of signs suggestive of disease activity, and nonspecific findings.

Results

Abnormal changes were observed in chest X-rays of 22 (25%) patients and in the computed tomography of 55 (63%). Images compatible with active pulmonary tuberculosis were detected by radiography in 9 (10%) patients and by tomography in 38 (43%). Only 4 (4.5%) patients had tomography images suggestive of residual disease.

Conclusion

The present study demonstrates that pulmonary involvement is quite common in pleural tuberculosis. This finding is mainly observed in high-resolution computed tomography and has important epidemiological implications, since patients with pleural tuberculosis are significant sources of infection and disease dissemination.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for tuberculosis… [^2b184ed6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Considerations All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease or a positive result from a TB blood test or tuberculin skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease. Some signs of extrapulmonary TB disease may be observed during a physical examination. There are two tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria:

- TB blood test
- TB skin test. Chest radiographs help differentiate between latent TB infection and pulmonary TB disease in people with positive results from a TB blood test or TB skin test. A posterior-anterior chest radiograph is used to detect chest abnormalities. Lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs and may differ in size, shape, density, and cavities.

These abnormalities may suggest TB disease but cannot be used to definitively diagnose TB disease. Normal findings on chest radiography generally can be used to rule out pulmonary TB in a person who has had a positive reaction to a TB blood test or TB skin test and no symptoms of disease. Rare exceptions have been noted in patients with HIV whose immune status has not been restored by anti-viral treatment. Examinations of clinical specimens are of critical diagnostic importance. The specimens should be examined and cultured in a laboratory that specializes in testing for. AFB smear classification Specimens are smeared onto a glass slide and stained so that they can be examined for acid-fast bacilli under a microscope. M. tuberculosis complex organisms are one kind of AFB. Smear examination is a quick procedure, and results should be available within 24 hours of specimen collection. Direct detetion of M.

tuberculosis in clinical specimens using nucleic acid amplication and, as applicable, molecular detection of resistance Nucleic acid amplification tests are used to amplify DNA and RNA segments to rapidly detect M. tuberculosis DNA in specimens in just hours, compared to a week or more for detection of TB bacteria in culture. CDC recommends that NAA testing be performed on at least one respiratory specimen from each patient with symptoms of pulmonary TB disease for whom:

### Tuberculosis revisted: classic imaging findings in childhood [^6dc65e61]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of infectious disease in the chest and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In this review, we have described and illustrated the classic findings of childhood TB in each of the systems. Identifying the classic radiological features of paediatric TB is important for the individual management of patients and for a deeper understanding of the disease process. Repeat imaging provides valuable information on disease progression and resolution. Diagnosis of TB in paediatric patients in certain systems remains a clinical challenge given its vague presentation and lack of pathognomonic features. A high index of clinical suspicion and early recognition of classic imaging features are key to prompt diagnosis, initiation of treatment and prevention of long-term morbidity.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^6eafae03]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Development of confirmed tuberculosis in populations with distinct chest X-ray findings.

Abbreviations: aHR, adjusted hazard ratio. Models are adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and prior tuberculosis. Referent category are persons with no abnormal X-ray findings at the baseline mass screening visit. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals (CI). A Follow-up was not restricted and included all follow-up (up to 2 years) for participants after screening (all cases). B Follow-up time for development of tuberculosis began 1 year post-completion of the mass screening intervention.

Throughout the 2-year follow-up period, the aHRs of tuberculosis in those with fibrous lesions, sclerotic lesions, and calcifications on baseline X-rays was 3.96 (95% CI, 2.94–5.34), 5.56 (95% CI, 3.60–8.61), and 1.64 (95% CI, 0.87–3.11) times higher than participants without abnormalities. Among participants with patchy and non-patchy lesions, the increased risk of tuberculosis was 4.25 (95% CI, 2.91–6.21) and 6.83 (95% CI, 4.81–9.69), respectively. When restricting to second year of follow-up, participants with fibrous lesions, sclerotic lesions and calcifications had risks of 3.87 (95% CI, 2.53–5.92), 4.26 (95% CI, 2.15–8.47) and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.49–3.62), respectively, compared with those without chest X-ray abnormalities. The HRs of pulmonary tuberculosis among participants with patchy lesions and non-patchy lesions (compared to a reference group without abnormal X-ray findings) was 3.92 (95% CI, 2.26–6.79) and 4.98 (95% CI, 2.83–8.78) (see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 11).

### Tuberculosis and its treatment: an overview [^58d651a9]. Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary tuberculosis:

- **Definition**: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria.
- **Pathophysiology**: Tuberculosis is caused by AFB Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of tuberculosis in the US is estimated at 2.8 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The early infiltration either regresses asymptomatically or spreads via bronchi as obstructive lobular pneumonia that develops into caseous pneumonia and fragments to produce cavities or becomes the focus of post-primary granulomas and fibrocaseous disease. The dissemination of tuberculosis can lead to extrapulmonary granulomas. Active pulmonary infection results in either transmission of infection to other humans via coughing or the host may die of illness.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) has a success rate of > 95%. Approximately 20% of cases of MDR-TB are classified as XDR-TB in some areas.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^434d3a7f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-related tuberculosis — radiographic patterns and immunodeficiency effects include atypical chest findings when CD4 counts are low, with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 associated with infiltrates showing no upper-lobe predilection and uncommon cavitation; normal chest radiographs can occur despite respiratory symptoms and positive sputum cultures, and thoracic CT scans may show mild reticulonodular infiltrates despite a normal chest radiograph. With increasing immunodeficiency, extrapulmonary or disseminated TB are more common, and in markedly immune-suppressed people TB can be a severe systemic disease with high fevers, rapid progression, and features of sepsis; TB must be considered at any site, especially with central nervous system disease when early TB treatment is essential to improve outcomes. After initiation of ART, immune reconstitution can unmask subclinical TB disease, resulting in pronounced inflammatory reactions at sites of infection.

### Respiratory samples to diagnose tuberculosis in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities [^80d0d704]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organisation states that the chest x-ray (CXR) has a 'high sensitivity for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)' [1] and as such, is relied on worldwide as the cornerstone of screening for active pulmonary TB (pTB).

Method

This is a retrospective analysis of plain chest radiographs and microbiological yield in all patients who were diagnosed with pTB or intra-thoracic nodal tuberculosis (ITLN) in two London NHS Trusts.

Results

Between 2011 and 2017 8% of those diagnosed with pTB and 32% with ITLN TB had normal CXR appearances in the 6 weeks preceding diagnosis.

Discussion

Pulmomary TB was diagnosed in an additional 51 people based on CT scan and 43 people based on respiratory samples. ITLN TB was also diagnosed in a further 20 people using CT but only an extra 3 people from standard respiratory sampling. Our data suggests that CT imaging and respiratory samples should be sent on all suspected cases of pTB and ITLN TB even if the CXR is normal.

### Pulmonary tuberculosis: up-to-date imaging and management [^498db3a1]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a common worldwide infection and a medical and social problem causing high mortality and morbidity, especially in developing countries. The traditional imaging concept of primary and reactivation TB has been recently challenged, and radiologic features depend on the level of host immunity rather than the elapsed time after the infection. We aimed to elaborate the new concept of the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary TB, to review the characteristic imaging findings of various forms of pulmonary TB, and to assess the role of CT in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary TB.

Conclusion

Fast and more accurate TB testing such as bacterial DNA fingerprinting and whole-blood interferon-gamma assay has been developed. Miliary or disseminated primary pattern or atypical manifestations of pulmonary TB are common in patients with impaired immunity. CT plays an important role in the detection of TB in patients in whom the chest radiograph is normal or inconclusive, in the determination of disease activity, in the detection of complication, and in the management of TB by providing a roadmap for surgical treatment planning. PET scans using 18F-FDG or 11C-choline can sometimes help differentiate tuberculous granuloma from lung malignancy.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^a0c2daa3]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Forty-four per cent of the participants in our study with reported post-TB lung changes had a history of TB treatment. Among those, CXR revealed bronchiectasis and/or destroyed lung in 11% (95% CI 3.3%–27.5%), which is lower than reported in a prospective study in Malawi, that used CT and reported > 40% bronchiectasis and 10% lobar destruction post-TB treatment. Bronchiectasis has a lower detection rate on CXR than CT and will likely have been underestimated in our study. PTB is a risk factor for CRD and in the Malawi study ongoing clinical symptoms were associated with damage of three or more lobes, which is comparable to the 'destroyed lung' category in our CXR study. Unfortunately, patients with post TB lung disease (PTLD) and chronic symptoms are likely to be treated empirically for recurrent TB. We therefore recommend that TB screening programmes look into developing the area of PTLD further. Latent TB infection treatment should be offered to eligible patients with PTLD. Our study also identified other less common findings for which interventions may be costly. For example, mediastinal and lung masses/nodules (0.4%) that may represent lymphoma/ malignancy and would need referral for definitive diagnosis and management.

In our study, half the images reported as abnormal by the field clinical officers were subsequently reported by our radiologists as normal. This finding is not surprising as TB prevalence surveys by design encourage high sensitivity with field officers having a low threshold for identification of abnormalities and referral for sputum-based testing to maximise sensitivity in the initial prevalence survey screening stage.CAD software has been shown to have a role in TB screening activities especially prevalence surveys with diagnostic accuracy higher than clinical officers and comparable with expert radiologists. Inter-reader variability of CXR reporting is an acknowledged limitation and was also the case in our study with inter reader agreement moderate at 0.41. This moderate agreement can be partly explained by the limited clinical information available to our reporting radiologists. Though CAD for TB software has an accuracy equal to expert readers, the software provides TB risk scores only. To characterise non-TB findings, once TB has been excluded, a human reader remains the only current solution available. CAD for cardiomegalyis under development and may provide an automated solution for the detection of cardiomegaly in the future.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^d6b92c00]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This study has considerable strengths. This cohort is amongst the largest mass chest X-ray screenings. Most mass screenings do not include substantial secondary information such as prior tuberculosis, tuberculosis-related symptoms, diabetes, or body mass index. This secondary data on this large sample allowed us to further identify potential confounders as well as refine specific populations in which this relationship may be most relevant. The well-defined chest X-ray data–including stratifications of stable and unknown X-ray categorizations–on such a large sample are rare.

There are limitations of this work. First, a proportion of individuals with abnormal X-rays at baseline did not undergo microbiological testing to determine if they had tuberculosis at that time. Hence, there is potential for prevalent tuberculosis to have been misclassified as incident tuberculosis. To account for this potential misclassification, we performed additional analyses that began one year after the end of the mass screening intervention, excluding cases occurring early in the follow-up time period. Our results remained largely the same. Second, although our study was prospective, the follow-up was based on a case-registry based diagnoses. Underdiagnoses would likely bias our hazard ratio estimates from our regression analyses towards the null. Third, tuberculosis case information was not electronically registered before 2005, precluding access to patient data prior to that year. Attempts to inquire about patient history were largely unsuccessful due to patients' inability to recall details. Therefore, we were able to record a history of tuberculosis only from 2005 onward which may have resulted in misclassification. Fourth, in some subgroups of chest X-ray findings, such as fibrotic and sclerotic lesions, the number of tuberculosis events remained low despite the large sample size. This may compromise the precision of our estimates, reflecting the inherent characteristics of this cohort. The statistical power is potentially affected. Fifth, pandemic control measures during COVID-19 may have introduced potential selection bias through altered health behaviors (e.g. avoidance of crowded settings). Although the daily incidence of COVID-19 in Quzhou was low, we cannot exclude the possibility that high-risk individuals avoided screening due to perceived exposure risks. Sixth, in some participants, tuberculosis at baseline was excluded through Xpert and not culture. Although Xpert has high sensitivity, some participants with tuberculosis may have been classified as healthy at baseline. To account for this potential misclassification, we performed additional analyses that began one year after the end of the mass screening intervention, excluding individuals with tuberculosis occurring early on in the follow-up time period. Our results remained largely the same. Seventh, despite strict adherence to national guidelines, operational constraints at the primary healthcare level, including resource limitations, varying levels of staff training, and complex workflows, pose challenges to ensuring the consistency and completeness of all screening and diagnostic procedures. This inconsistency may have resulted in some participants not undergoing the full suite of scheduled examinations, thereby affecting data quality and result accuracy. Future research should focus on enhancing standardization within primary healthcare services to improve screening efficiency and diagnostic precision. Lastly, in our baseline screening, we designed the screening protocol with reference to WHO guidelines, taking into comprehensive consideration the pandemic situation, screening principles, and cost-effectiveness. Although not all screening participants underwent microbiological testing — which might have missed some potential patients — the vast majority of those with chest X-ray findings suggestive of tuberculosis received confirmatory pathogenetic examinations. Among participants with other abnormal or normal radiographic findings, microbiological testing was largely omitted; however, the number of potential undetected patients is expected to be minimal, thus exerting a limited impact on the study.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^f8aebf54]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — suggestive features distinguishing COPD from common mimics are listed as follows. COPD presents with symptoms slowly progressive and a history of tobacco smoking or other risk factors. Asthma shows variable airflow obstruction with symptoms that vary widely from day to day, symptoms worse at night/early morning, allergy, rhinitis, and/or eczema also present, often occurs in children, and family history of asthma. Congestive heart failure is suggested by chest X-ray showing a dilated heart and pulmonary edema, and pulmonary function tests indicating volume restriction, not airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, is commonly associated with bacterial infection, and chest X-ray/HRCT shows bronchial dilation. Tuberculosis can have onset at all ages, chest X-ray shows lung infiltrate, microbiological confirmation, and high local prevalence of tuberculosis. Obliterative bronchiolitis can occur in children, is seen after lung or bone marrow transplantation, and HRCT on expiration shows hypodense areas. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is predominantly seen in patients of Asian descent; most patients are male and nonsmokers; almost all have chronic sinusitis; and chest X-ray & HRCT show diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities & hyperinflation. These features are characteristic but not mandatory; for example, a person who has never smoked may develop COPD, especially in LMICs where other risk factors may be more important than cigarette smoking.

The most common entities with this pattern are miliary tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, metastases, and hypersensitivity pneumonia. According to the distribution of the nodules in relation to the secondary lobule, high-resolution computed tomography findings divide miliary patterns into 3 groups: centrilobular, perilymphatic, and random presentation. The radiologic features that help in the differential diagnosis are discussed.

### Pediatric postprimary pulmonary tuberculosis [^df3fc9f4]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Postprimary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is not commonly seen in children.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the radiographic findings and patient characteristics of pediatric postprimary pulmonary TB.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the clinical charts and chest radiographs in six patients.

Results

The radiographic findings of pediatric postprimary pulmonary TB include upper-lobe consolidation and cavitation, multifocal ill-defined airspace opacities, evidence of prior pulmonary TB, and apical pleural thickening. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not commonly present. Although postprimary disease typically does not affect young children, five of the children in this series were less than ten years of age at the time of presentation.

Conclusion

The possibility of postprimary TB should be considered in pediatric patients at risk for this disease who present with upper-lobe pulmonary consolidation and cavitation. These patients are highly infectious and early recognition and treatment can limit transmission of TB.

### Clinical and imaging factors that can predict contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis [^36055f10]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Knowledge on predicting pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) contagiosity in the hospital admission setting is limited. The objective was to assess clinical and radiological criteria to predict PTB contagiosity.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 7 clinical, 4 chest X-ray (CXR) and 5 computed tomography (CT) signs in 299 PTB patients admitted to an urban tertiary hospital from 2008 to 2016. If the acid fact bacilli stain was positive (AFB+) on admission, the case was considered high contagiosity.

Results

Best predictors for high PTB contagiosity (AFB+) were haemoptysis (OR 4.33), cough (3.00), weight loss (2.96), cavitation in CT (2.75), cavitation in CXR (2.55), tree-in-bud-sign in CT (2.12), German residency of the patient (1.89), and abnormal auscultation findings (1.83). A previous TB infection reduced the risk of contagiosity statistically (0.40). Radiographic infiltrates, miliary picture, and pleural effusion were not helpful in predicting high or low contagiosity. 34% of all patients were clinically asymptomatic (20% of the highly contagious group, 50% of the low contagious group).

Conclusion

Haemoptysis, cough and weight loss as well as cavitation and tree-in-bud sign in CXR/CT can be helpful to predict PTB contagiosity and to improve PTB management.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in adults — five clinical scenarios are outlined with specific recommended evaluations as follows: For any patient with a cough of > 2–3 wk duration with at least one additional symptom (fever, night sweats, weight loss, or hemoptysis), the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB (or if patient has HIV infection), collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms, of > 2–3 wk duration, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB, collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient with HIV infection and with cough and fever, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 d of treatment, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an abnormal chest radiograph suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal or absent, the recommended evaluation is review of previous chest radiographs if available, three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture.

### Reproducibility of a protocol for standardized reading of chest X-rays of children household contact of patients with tuberculosis [^ad7dfb35]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which is present throughout the world. It is the ninth leading cause of death, with a predominance in developing countries; where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high and resources are insufficient for disease identification and treatment.

Approximately 10 million people became ill with TB in 2019, 12% were children under the age of 15. Geographically, the majority were in regions of Southeast Asia (44%), East Africa (8.2%), America (2.9%) and Europe (2.5%); furthermore, only 54 countries had a low incidence of TB (less than 10 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year). Of the 1.3 million household contacts with TB who should access preventive treatment in 2019, only 538,396 (33%) received it, and 81% of them were children under the age of 5.

The strategy to reduce the incidence of active TB in childhood is only efficient when adequate and timely treatment is given for latent TB. Additionally, the diagnosis of TB in pediatrics is difficult, since the symptoms and radiographic changes are less specific at this age. The grouping of factors such as: paucibacillary characteristic of the infection, the laborious collection of respiratory samples, the variable symptoms and the severity of the disease exacerbated by other childhood infections such as pneumonia, malnutrition and HIV; limit the diagnostic approach, resulting in unreliable statistics due to insufficient recognition of the disease.

The notion of TB diagnosis in children under the age of 5 household contacts with TB patients, is based on the risk of developing active TB, for having contact with the infection at home, for which is necessary to intervene on time to prevent progression to disease. Laboratory tests showing infection are required initially, in addition to a chest X-ray. Having a positive immunological test in the absence of clinical manifestations and a normal chest X-ray, guides the diagnosis of latent TB; which requires treatment to prevent the disease.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' chest X-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^76d112c4]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding from this analysis of X-ray images from the 2016 Kenya TB Prevalence Survey was that the use of CXR for TB population-based studies identified a large number of patients with non-TB-related abnormalities. Cardiac and pulmonary diseases accounted for 66% of the non-TB abnormalities in our setting. The radiological findings were consistent with complications of potential underlying NCDs. To our knowledge, this is the first study in sub-Saharan Africa to describe and quantify non-TB CXR findings among participants who underwent mass screening as part of a population-based TB prevalence survey. TB prevalence surveys and ACF activities using mass CXR offer an opportunity to identify other potential diseases; however, as currently structured, when TB is not confirmed, there is limited further diagnosis and management of these other conditions. The findings of our study are also timely in the wake of disruption in the health system caused by COVID-19. As countries accelerate ACF activities using CXR screening to make up for reductions in TB case-notification rates due to COVID-19, they could plan systems to manage other findings.

At the outset of the study, we expected abnormalities to be primarily related to non-TB pulmonary disease. However, the most prevalent findings were cardiac abnormalities with cardiomegaly at 23.1% (95% CI 20.6%–25.6%). An outpatient research clinic pilot study in The Gambia reports a similar finding of cardiac abnormalities being prevalent among patients without TB (n = 108). The prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in our study is higher than in The Gambia (26.3% vs 20%). Cardiac abnormality diagnosis in The Gambia was through clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography (as indicated) versus CXR only in our study. This, together with higher median age in our study compared with The Gambia (51 years vs 40 years), could explain our higher observed prevalence.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^b75586f6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In total, 429 confirmed active tuberculosis patients were identified, with an incidence rate of 118 cases per 100,000 person-years. with a predominance of males diagnosed (N = 318, 74.1%). We first analyzed the study population by all post-screening follow-up. At baseline, the incidence per 100,000 person-years were 464 and 58 among those with and without abnormal chest radiographs. More total incident tuberculosis patients were diagnosed among participants with an abnormal chest X-ray at baseline (N = 249) compared with those without (N = 180), despite far fewer participants in this subgroup (27,549 versus 155,833). People with abnormal chest X-rays had 5.90 (95% CI, 4.83–7.21) higher risk of developing tuberculosis than those without. In the primary analysis (second year of follow-up), 192 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were identified, with an overall incidence rate of 108 per 100,000 person-years. Most patients were male (N = 143, 74.5%). The rates were 371 and 61 per 100,000 person-years for those with and without abnormal chest X-rays, respectively. Results from a multivariable Cox model was similar to the prior model with longer follow-up (aHR, 4.54; 95% CI, 3.38–6.10) (Table 2).

### Prospective multi-site validation of AI to detect tuberculosis and chest X-ray abnormalities [^cb0661cb]. NEJM AI (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret chest X-rays (CXRs) could support accessible triage tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in resource-constrained settings.

Methods

The performance of two cloud-based CXR AI systems - one to detect TB and the other to detect CXR abnormalities - in a population with a high TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden was evaluated. We recruited 1978 adults who had TB symptoms, were close contacts of known TB patients, or were newly diagnosed with HIV at three clinical sites. The TB-detecting AI (TB AI) scores were converted to binary using two thresholds: a high-sensitivity threshold and an exploratory threshold designed to resemble radiologist performance. Ten radiologists reviewed images for signs of TB, blinded to the reference standard. Primary analysis measured AI detection noninferiority to radiologist performance. Secondary analysis evaluated AI detection as compared with the World Health Organization (WHO) targets (90% sensitivity, 70% specificity). Both used an absolute margin of 5%. The abnormality-detecting AI (abnormality AI) was evaluated for noninferiority to a high-sensitivity target suitable for triaging (90% sensitivity, 50% specificity).

Results

Of the 1910 patients analyzed, 1827 (96%) had conclusive TB status, of which 649 (36%) were HIV positive and 192 (11%) were TB positive. The TB AI's sensitivity and specificity were 87% and 70%, respectively, at the high-sensitivity threshold and 78% and 82%, respectively, at the balanced threshold. Radiologists' mean sensitivity was 76% and mean specificity was 82%. At the high-sensitivity threshold, the TB AI was noninferior to average radiologist sensitivity (P < 0.001) but not to average radiologist specificity (P = 0.99) and was higher than the WHO target for specificity but not sensitivity. At the balanced threshold, the TB AI was comparable to radiologists. The abnormality AI's sensitivity and specificity were 97% and 79%, respectively, with both meeting the prespecified targets.

Conclusions

The CXR TB AI was noninferior to radiologists for active pulmonary TB triaging in a population with a high TB and HIV burden. Neither the TB AI nor the radiologists met WHO recommendations for sensitivity in the study population. AI can also be used to detect other CXR abnormalities in the same population.

### Lung ultrasound findings compared with chest X-ray findings in known pulmonary tuberculosis patients: a cross-sectional study in lima, Peru [^1ed0a53a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Future studies should compare LUS findings in PTB with those in other common pulmonary diseases, especially bacterial pneumonia, pneumocystis pneumonia, and cancer, to determine the ability of LUS to differentiate between these processes. In addition, radiographic sequelae of prior PTB infection, which are frequently localized in the apical regions, could represent a potential confounder, and this should be investigated in future studies.

Strengths of this study include a systematic LUS technique with data capture in 18 regions across the thorax, external expert review of LUS images with excellent agreement, and comparison of LUS findings to CXR interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. Study limitations include lack of a control group without PTB and the possibility for over-identification of LUS findings expected in PTB. Results from this proof-of-concept study suggest LUS has high potential as a sensitive method for diagnosis of PTB and could be particularly useful in settings where CXR is not possible.

In conclusion, an LUS composite of consolidation or SPC may be a sensitive marker for PTB. Lung ultrasound demonstrated poor ability to detect radiographically identified cavity, although previous studies suggest SPC might add specificity for the diagnosis of PTB. Based on its portability and evidence base for diagnosing other pulmonary disease, LUS may have a role in screening and diagnosis of PTB in areas without ready access to CXR. Further studies should evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in patients with and without PTB.

### Pulmonary tuberculosis presenting with cluster sign and galaxy sign [^83228af8]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Case presentation

An asymptomatic Asian man in his 20s underwent a chest X-ray for a medical check-up, which revealed an abnormality in the left upper lung field. No abnormality was noted on his chest X-ray in the previous year. The patient had taken an overseas business trip to several countries 2 years earlier but had not gone abroad since that time. There was no family history of tuberculosis, and his medical background did not feature any distinctive occurrences. He had no previous history of suspected or treated sarcoidosis. He smoked several cigarettes a day for the past 5 years. The patient had an office job and rarely went out except for frequent visits to a sauna as a hobby.

### Clinical and radiographic correlates of primary and reactivation tuberculosis: a molecular epidemiology study [^8dcfc460]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

The traditional teaching that pulmonary tuberculosis characterized by lymphadenopathy, effusions, and lower or mid lung zone infiltrates on chest radiography represents "primary" disease from recently acquired infection, whereas upper lobe infiltrates and cavities represent secondary or reactivation disease acquired in the more distant past, is not based on well-established clinical evidence. Furthermore, it is not known whether the atypical radiograph common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis is due to a preponderance of primary progressive disease or altered immunity.

Objective

To analyze the relationship between recently acquired and remotely acquired pulmonary tuberculosis, clinical and demographic variables, and radiographic features by using molecular fingerprinting and conventional epidemiology.

Design, Setting, and Population

A retrospective, hospital-based series of 456 patients treated at a New York City medical center between 1990 and 1999. Eligible patients had to have had at least 1 positive respiratory culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and available radiographic data.

Main Outcome Measures

Radiographic appearance as measured by the presence or absence of 6 features: upper lobe infiltrate, cavitary lesion, adenopathy, effusions, lower or mid lung zone infiltrate, and miliary pattern. Radiographs were considered typical if they had an upper lobe infiltrate or cavity whether or not other features were present. Atypical radiographs were those that had adenopathy, effusion, or mid lower lung zone infiltrates or had none of the above features.

Results

Human immunodeficiency virus infection was most commonly associated with an atypical radiographic appearance on chest radiograph with an odds ratio of 0.20 (95% confidence interval, 0.13–0.31). Although a clustered fingerprint, representing recently acquired disease, was associated with typical radiograph in univariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.99), the association was lost when adjusted for HIV status.

Conclusions

Time from acquisition of infection to development of clinical disease does not reliably predict the radiographic appearance of tuberculosis. Human immunodeficiency virus status, a probable surrogate for the integrity of the host immune response, is the only independent predictor of radiographic appearance. The altered radiographic appearance of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV is due to altered immunity rather than recent acquisition of infection and progression to active disease.

### Pulmonary tuberculosis presenting with cluster sign and galaxy sign [^e0bb17de]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Based on the results of previous tests, the patient believed there was less likelihood of having pulmonary tuberculosis. The pathology results were consistent with sarcoidosis, and a watch-and-wait approach was considered appropriate. We did not list any disease other than tuberculosis or sarcoidosis as differential diagnoses.

Fourteen months after the initial medical check-up, the patient developed fever and malaise that continued for 3 weeks. On chest X-ray, a cavitatory shadow was noted in the left lung field (figures 1B and 2B). Blood tests showed a positive interferon-γ release assay with an ACE level of 7.5 U/L and lysozyme level of 8.7 µg/mL. Sputum examination was smear-positive, PCR detected M. tuberculosis, and subsequent culture identified M. tuberculosis. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. Regarding the resistance profile, GeneXpert testing could not be performed because it was unavailable at our hospital. Antitubercular medication susceptibility confirmed by culture strains showed no resistance to antimicrobials, including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.

Investigation revealed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, negative sputum smear examination for acid-fast bacilli, x-ray and high-resolution CT chest showed bilateral, diffuse infiltration of lung parenchyma with miliary shadows. The patient was treated as a case of miliary tuberculosis with antitubercular therapy (ATT). On the 10th day of treatment the patient developed high-grade fever, cough and breathlessness. Chest x-ray showed an increased infiltration of lung parenchyma. The patient was diagnosed as a case of paradoxical reaction to ATT and was managed successfully with steroids.

BACKGROUND

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret chest X-rays (CXRs) could support accessible triage tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in resource-constrained settings.

METHODS

The performance of two cloud-based CXR AI systems — one to detect TB and the other to detect CXR abnormalities — in a population with a high TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden was evaluated. We recruited 1978 adults who had TB symptoms, were close contacts of known TB patients, or were newly diagnosed with HIV at three clinical sites.

At the balanced threshold, the TB AI was comparable to radiologists. The abnormality AI's sensitivity and specificity were 97% and 79%, respectively, with both meeting the prespecified targets.

CONCLUSIONS

The CXR TB AI was noninferior to radiologists for active pulmonary TB triaging in a population with a high TB and HIV burden. Neither the TB AI nor the radiologists met WHO recommendations for sensitivity in the study population. AI can also be used to detect other CXR abnormalities in the same population.

### Classification and regression tree (CART) model to predict pulmonary tuberculosis in hospitalized patients [^da6fd320]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

We performed a cross sectional study among patients admitted to IR of the Clementino Fraga Filho Hospital (CFFH) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. CFFH is a tertiary hospital, reference for the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS. In 1998, a TB control program (TCP) was implemented in CFFH as a novel strategy for the control of TB with significant reduction of LTBI in health care workers (HCW). The program consisted of isolation of TB suspects and confirmed TB inpatients, quick turnaround for acid-fast bacilli sputum tests and HCW education in use of protective respirators, with a consistent reduction in tuberculin skin test conversion among HCW.

From March 2003 to December 2004, a convenience sample of all patients admitted in IR had their medical charts reviewed. Inclusion criterion was clinical suspicion of TB. We defined clinical suspicion in the same way patients in our hospital are selected for RI: cough for more than 2 weeks associated with any radiologic abnormality, or any respiratory symptom in patients with confirmed or suspected HIV infection. Patients with active TB diagnosis previous to the admission, with extra-pulmonary TB and without a final diagnosis were excluded. Decision to isolate these patients was made by emergency room or TB control program physicians according to the TB program criteria. Patients HIV negative with cough for more than 2 weeks and an associated abnormality in a chest X-ray were considered suspect of having TB and were isolated. For patients HIV positive were considered suspects if they had any respiratory symptom and were also isolated. Clinical data regarding demographic characteristics, respiratory and constitutional symptoms, potential predictive factors for TB diagnosis, radiologic test results and final diagnosis of admission were analyzed retrospectively. Radiologic tests were analyzed in a standard manner by a pulmonologist (L.L. A.) with experience in TB care, blinded to patient's information. The tests were classified as either normal or sequelae from a previous TB episode, suggestive of TB by typical or possible X-ray findings and atypical findings (Table 1). Typical were those considered as having any parenchymal infiltrate or cavity localized in the upper zone (defined as the area above the posterior third rib); possible were those presenting a miliary pattern, pleural effusion or thoracic adenopathy, and atypical those showing any other abnormality.

Differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lists suggestive features for COPD and common mimics: COPD is associated with midlife onset, slowly progressing symptoms, and a long history of smoking; asthma presents with early onset, varying symptoms, night/early-morning symptoms, allergy/rhinitis/eczema, a family history, and airflow limitation that is largely reversible; congestive heart failure shows fine basilar crackles, a dilated heart on chest radiography, peripheral edema, a history of ischemic heart disease, and volume restriction not airflow limitation on pulmonary function tests; bronchiectasis features large volumes of purulent sputum, bacterial infection, coarse crackles, clubbing, and bronchial dilation and bronchial wall thickening on chest radiography/computed tomography (CT); tuberculosis includes lung infiltrate on chest radiography and microbiological confirmation with high local prevalence; obliterative bronchiolitis has younger onset in nonsmokers with a history of rheumatoid arthritis/fume exposure and hypodense areas on expiration on CT; and diffuse panbronchiolitis affects mostly male nonsmokers, almost all have chronic sinusitis, and shows diffuse small centrilobular nodular opacities and hyperinflation on chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

### Evaluation of prediagnosis emergency department presentations in patients with active tuberculosis: the role of chest radiography, risk factors and symptoms [^549e9285]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary TB cases represented approximately half of the study population; in this group tachycardia and fever were the most commonly abnormal observations and cough, weight loss and fevers were the most common classical TB symptoms that were present. Almost half of the EPTB patients had no classical TB symptoms and three-quarters presented with other symptoms of which gastrointestinal were the most common. The low incidence rate of classical symptoms, particularly in the EPTB group, makes diagnosis on symptoms alone unfeasible. As would be expected, cases of PTB more frequently displayed chest radiograph abnormalities than EPTB. In keeping with these findings, PTB was more often suspected as a diagnosis in the ED than EPTB (55% vs 19% of cases).

Overall, patients where TB was suspected in the ED had a much greater frequency of chest radiograph, 93% compared with 66%. However, patients where TB was suspected had a greater frequency of all pulmonary symptoms and were therefore more likely to have had a chest radiograph requested. On multivariable analysis, cough, country of birth outside the UK, a TB contact history, a history of night sweats and an abnormal chest radiograph were independently associated with suspicion of TB in ED. The significant proportion of patients where TB was not suspected in the ED but had abnormal radiograph findings (35 patients, 54%) highlights the importance of carefully reviewing all imaging undertaken in the ED and ensuring that any abnormal reports are acted on. Contemporary reporting of imaging while the patient is still in the ED could mean that clinical review can be correlated with radiograph findings. It is important to note that the plain chest radiograph had the best sensitivity when comparing this to symptoms. Importantly, our results indicate that even in cases of EPTB, there is an important role for performing a plain chest radiograph and that this has a broadly similar sensitivity compared with the incidence of classical symptoms. However, the most common chest radiograph abnormalities were consolidation, reduced volume and effusion; these radiographic characteristics can be present for a wide differential of respiratory infections.

### Lung ultrasound findings compared with chest X-ray findings in known pulmonary tuberculosis patients: a cross-sectional study in lima, Peru [^60a987c2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

These findings indicate that the presence of an LUS composite of consolidation or SPC has high sensitivity for PTB. Although we cannot describe specificity with the current model, previous studies suggest the presence of SPC may add specificity for the diagnosis of PTB, with a reported specificity of 67%. The specificity of CXR for diagnosis of PTB reported in the literature is similar, ranging from 63% to 67%.

Although SPCs — subpleural, nodular hypoechoic lesions typically < 1 × 1 cm — are described in other conditions such as pulmonary embolism, viral pneumonia including COVID-19, pneumocystis pneumonia, and early bacterial pneumonia, our data show that these sonographic lesions are frequently encountered in the patchy fibronodular infiltrates commonly seen in PTB. Lung ultrasound detects lesions that touch the pleural line, and most acute pulmonary disorders reach the pleural line, including 98.5% of acute consolidations seen in critically ill patients by chest computed tomography. Typically, where these consolidations touch a large segment of the pleura, they produce the sonographic appearance of a consolidation. However, patchy or fibronodular consolidations such as those often found in PTB may contact the pleural surface in only a patchy or limited manner. A review of the LUS and CXR images from this study suggests that where radiographic lesions touch the pleura in a patchy or limited manner, they may produce the sonographic appearance of an SPC rather than a consolidation (Figure 1). This suggests that SPCs could be a potential marker for CXR consolidation in PTB, particularly if that CXR consolidation is patchy, irregular, or small in size.

### Prognostic value of an abnormal chest X-ray result in predicting the development of tuberculosis [^56ad4a20]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Although tuberculosis is preventable, whom to prioritize for preventive interventions is debated. As part of a follow-up to a mass tuberculosis screening, we aimed to evaluate tuberculosis incidence among persons with distinct baseline X-ray results. From March to October 2020, we implemented a mass tuberculosis screening intervention among elderly persons in eastern China. Participants were followed for incident tuberculosis until October 2022. Tuberculosis incidence over two years among participants with differing baseline chest X-ray results were assessed. Physical examinations and X-rays were administered to all participants. Among persons suspected of tuberculosis, computed tomography, culture or GeneXpert MTB/RIF was performed. Among 183,808 participants, 27,796 had a baseline abnormal X-ray. The annualized incidence per 100,000 person-years was 1,525 (95% CI, 989–2,243), 278 (202–373), 325 (218–466), and 61 (50–75) among participants with X-rays suggestive of active, stable, uncertain and normal, respectively. Among persons with X-ray findings suggestive of tuberculosis, the increased hazard was 16.7 (95% CI, 11.9–23.4). These results demonstrate the risk of developing tuberculosis among persons with an abnormal chest X-ray was very high. Combining mass screening with preventive interventions based on X-ray findings should be explored as a combination intervention package to reduce tuberculosis in high-risk populations.

### Chest X-ray features of drug resistance tuberculosis in pediatric population; A prospective study in high-endemic area [^57b48de4]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify chest X-ray (CXR) characteristic of Pediatric pulmonary drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB) in comparison to drug sensitive tuberculosis (DSTB) for early identification and treatment of DRTB.

Methods

This was a prospective cross-sectional study in which CXR patterns of DS and DR patients aged 1 month to 18 years were categorized into different variants including pleural effusion, cavity lesion, hilar or mediastinal lymph node (LN), consolidation, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, miliary TB, nodular shadow, and collapse. The consensus between the pulmonary physician and radiologist was measured using weighted kappa test. Adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to identify DRTB suggestive CXR pattern.

Results

From June 1, 2022 to May 31, 2023, 237 pulmonary TB subjects were recruited. Out of 175 DSTB subjects, 47 were below the age of 12 and 128 were above the age of 12. 62 were microbiologically confirmed DRTB where 12 were below the age of 12 and 50 were above the age of 12. Cavitary TB lesions (p = 0.001) and Consolidation (p = 0.003) were found significant in DR patients. Adjusting for age, gender, socioeconomic status DRTB was associated with cavity lesion (OR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.39–4.93; p = 0.001) and consolidation (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.27–4.14; p = 0.003).

Conclusion

We conclude that presence of cavitary lesion or consolidation in "presumptive" or "probable" DRTB patients should alert pediatricians. Our findings suggest that these DR suggestive CXR pattern can guide for early start of therapy while awaiting microbiological report.

Recent studies found that a chest x-ray (CXR) has limited value in the assessment of asymptomatic adults with tuberculosis (TB) infection. We aimed to determine in asymptomatic children with a positive tuberculin skin test and/or interferon-γ release assay (TST/IGRA) whether a CXR identifies findings suggestive of pulmonary TB.

Design, Setting and Patients

All children with TB infection (defined as TST ≥ 10 mm and/or positive IGRA) presenting to The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne during a 54-month period were included. All CXRs were reviewed by a senior radiologist blinded to the clinical details. The medical records of those with radiological abnormalities suggestive of TB were examined to identify those who were asymptomatic when the CXR was done. Demographical data were also collected.

Results

CXRs were available for 268 of 330 TB-infected children, of whom 60 had CXR findings suggestive of TB. Of the 57 for whom clinical details were available, 26 were asymptomatic. Of these asymptomatic children with radiological abnormalities suggestive of TB, 6 had CXR findings suggestive of active TB, 14 had CXR findings suggestive of prior TB and 6 had isolated non-calcified hilar lymphadenopathy. The six with findings suggestive of active TB represented 2.6% (95% CI 0.9 to 5.5%) of asymptomatic TST/IGRA-positive children with evaluable CXRs. One child with isolated hilar lymphadenopathy had microbiologically-confirmed TB.

Conclusions

In contrast to the results from studies in adults, a CXR identified a small but noteworthy number of children with findings suggestive of pulmonary TB in the absence of clinical symptoms.

### CT andF-FDG PET abnormalities in contacts with recent tuberculosis infections but negative chest X-ray [^46e767fc]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Chest CT and 18 F-FDG PET examinations in TB contact investigations can depict minimal pauci-nodular infiltrations in the lung parenchyma and metabolic uptake in the opacity and mediastinal LNs, in patients without any symptoms, X-ray abnormalities, or bacteriological/molecular evidence of active TB. Despite the paucity of follow-up data, human and nonhuman primate studies have found that such abnormalities may spontaneously regress, remain stagnant, or progress to active TB, and contacts with such abnormalities have a higher risk for progression than those without any abnormalities. In a contact investigation where the risk for TB infection and developing active TB is intense and active TB is more likely to manifest with normal radiographs, chest CT and 18 F-FDG PET examinations may help further stratify contacts recently infected with M. tuberculosis along a continuous spectrum from latent tuberculosis to incipient, subclinical and active TB. In most contact investigations, a chest CT scan is preferable over an 18 F-FDG PET scan, considering the accessibility, cost, and radiation dose. Identifying incipient TB would provide an opportunity for earlier and tailored treatment before active TB is established.

### Tuberculosis of the chest [^b708cc42]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The relationship between tuberculosis and mankind has been known for many centuries, with the disease being one of the major causes of illness and death. During the early 1980s, there was a widespread belief that the disease was being controlled, but by the mid-1980s, the number of cases increased. This change in the epidemiological picture has several causes, of which the AIDS epidemic, the progression of poverty in developing countries, the increase in the number of elderly people with an altered immune status and the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are the most important. Mainly due to this epidemiological change, the radiological patterns of the disease are also being altered, with the classical distinction between primary and postprimary disease fading and atypical presentations in groups with an altered immune response being increasingly reported. Therefore, the radiologist must be able not only to recognize the classical features of primary and postprimary tuberculosis but also to be familiar with the atypical patterns found in immuno-compromised and elderly patients, since an early diagnosis is generally associated with a greater therapeutic efficacy. Radiologists are, in this way, presented with a new challenge at the beginning of this millennium.

### Standardized radiographic interpretation of thoracic tuberculosis in children [^8fa716d7]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is a lack of standardized approach and terminology to classify the diverse spectrum of manifestations in tuberculosis. It is important to recognize the different clinical and radiographic patterns to guide treatment. As a result of changing epidemiology, there is considerable overlap in the radiologic presentations of primary tuberculosis and post-primary tuberculosis. In this article we promote a standardized approach in clinical and radiographic classification for children suspected of having or diagnosed with childhood tuberculosis. We propose standardized terms to diminish confusion and miscommunication, which can affect management. In addition, we present pitfalls and limitations of imaging.

Development of confirmed tuberculosis among participants with differing subcategories of uncertain and stable X-ray findings, stratified by the time period of follow-up.

Cox proportional hazards models show adjusted hazard ratios for the development of confirmed tuberculosis among participants with differing subcategories of uncertain and stable chest X-ray findings. Models are adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and prior tuberculosis. The unit of study is the individual participant; all data points represent biological replicates (n = 183,382 independent subjects across all groups). The screening time period occurred from March 1 to October 31, 2020. The total follow-up time period was defined as November 1, 2020–October 31, 2022. Referent category are persons with no abnormal X-ray findings (n = 155,833) at the baseline mass screening visit. Precise sample sizes for each subgroup are as follows: Uncertain, non-patchy lesions (n = 4002); Uncertain, patchy lesion (n = 5243); Stable, fibrous lesion (n = 9290); Stable, sclerotic lesion (n = 2920); Stable, Calcification (n = 4277). To account for any undiagnosed, early tuberculosis patients that may have been diagnosed in year 1 of follow-up, a secondary follow-up period with a one year lead-in time was analyzed. This time period began > 1 year after completion of screening and ran from November 1, 2021–October 31, 2022. Referent category are persons with no abnormal X-ray findings (n = 154,447) at the secondary follow-up period. Precise sample sizes for each subgroup are as follows: Uncertain, non-patchy lesions (n = 3819); Uncertain, patchy lesion (n = 5202); Stable, fibrous lesion (n = 9080); Stable, sclerotic lesion (n = 2857); Stable, Calcification (n = 4163).

### Pulmonary tuberculosis presenting with cluster sign and galaxy sign [^a4182b3f]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

In a routine medical check-up, a healthy man in his 20s was found to have an upper left lung abnormality. Subsequent chest CT revealed the cluster sign (CS) and galaxy sign (GS). Although tests such as sputum analysis and interferon-gamma assays reduced the likelihood of tuberculosis, these abnormalities remained unchanged. A lung biopsy indicated non-caseating granuloma unrelated to tuberculosis. Initially suspected of sarcoidosis, the patient later developed fever and malaise. Follow-up CT showed CS progressing to a cavitatory shadow and GS intensification. The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in a subsequent sputum analysis prompted treatment with antitubercular drugs, leading to symptom relief.

CS and GS are usually associated with sarcoidosis but can also occur in tuberculosis, connected to slower pathogen growth and lower isolation rates. Furthermore, pulmonary tuberculosis may ultimately be present even when biopsies show non-caseating granulomas that are not typical of M. tuberculosis and sputum culture results are negative for M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis should not be ruled out lightly, and patients should be carefully followed-up.

Testing and diagnosis All persons with symptoms of TB disease, a positive TB blood test result or a positive tuberculin skin test result should be medically evaluated for TB disease. A complete medical evaluation for TB disease has five components:

- Provide valuable information about the patient's overall condition
- Inform the method of diagnosis
- Reveal factors that may affect treatment if the patient is diagnosed with TB disease There are two types of tests that are used to determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria:

- TB blood tests
- TB skin test. Keep Reading: Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Tuberculosis The chest radiograph is useful for diagnosis because pulmonary TB is the most common form of TB disease.

A chest radiograph can:

- Rule out the possibility of pulmonary TB disease in a person who has a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result, but no symptoms of TB disease
- Check for lung abnormalities in people who have symptoms of TB disease. Abnormal findings on chest radiograph cannot confirm a person has TB disease, but they support the diagnosis. Clinical specimens are examined and cultured in the laboratory for the bacteriologic examination. TB bacteriologic examination is done in a laboratory that specifically deals with.

### Radiological findings of unilateral tuberculous lung destruction [^8463406c]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. In 2014, an estimated 9.6 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died from the disease. The appearance of strains resistant to pharmacological treatment and immigrant influx from countries with a high incidence of this disease may increase the possibility of TB-related complications and sequelae in developed areas.

Pulmonary TB can be a source of severe complications, such as unilateral lung destruction occurring in the final phase of progressive disease or disease reactivation. This complication has been previously reported in a recent review of 5,926 cases of TB in 74 patients (1.3%). Lung destruction, particularly in association with bronchiectasis, is easily colonised by bacteria and fungi and this may be one reason why pulmonary TB is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The related literature contains few references to this complication, also known as the left bronchus syndrome. Pulmonary destruction by TB, particularly total destruction of an entire lung, is currently uncommon, and the imaging features may be confused with those of other entities. Hence, it is important to be familiar with the most significant radiological findings in this condition.

In this report, we present a review of 13 patients with UTLD secondary to TB attended in our centre, with the aim of describing the radiological findings in radiograph and chest CT of this late and uncommon complication of TB.

TUTLD is a late complication that requires years to develop; so it is difficult to estimate the influence of other superimposed nontuberculosus infections and to assemble a large sample or perform a prospective study with significant data. However, for this review article we were able to collect these cases to discuss the typical findings of UTLD against the background of findings in patients of our own department. This instructive patient sample was not obtained from a database containing all tuberculosis cases occurring in the study period; therefore the incidence of this complication in our setting will not be discussed in detail.

### Characteristic chest CT findings for progressive cavities in Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^1e0f79a3]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend surgery in cases with cavitary disease that is limited in site and extent; therefore, control of cavitary lesions is important. However, when the cavity is progressive and the lung destructive lesion enlarges, surgical intervention becomes difficult in clinical practice. According to a long-term observation of 125 cases involving pulmonary resection for NTM-PD, pneumonectomy and remnant cavitary lesions after surgery were found to be significant predictive factors for microbiological recurrence and survival. Therefore, it is important to recognize progressive cavities at an earlier stage. However, it is difficult to predict cavity progression because some cavities progress while others show a relatively stable course.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate chest computed tomography (CT) findings and the progression of cavitary lesions in patients with MAC-PD in order to clarify the types of cavities that are likely to progress at an early stage. If these can be clarified, the findings may facilitate the identification of treatment plans.

### The many faces of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection [^dd98602d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review clinical and radiologic manifestations of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection.

Conclusion

Common and well-recognized patterns of infection include cavitary and bronchiectatic disease and infection in AIDS patients. Less common or well-recognized manifestations include nodules or masses mimicking malignancy, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and others. Definitive diagnosis can be difficult and patterns may overlap. Timely diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and knowledge of the spectrum of clinical and radiologic features.

### It is time to focus on asymptomatic tuberculosis [^819f93ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

(.)

Respiratory exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can result in a spectrum of immunological and clinical outcomes. At one extreme is "Mtb resistance", a proposed state in which the innate immune system kills and clears organisms at the lung's mucosal surface, staving off infection and eventual disease. At the other extreme is "full-blown" tuberculosis (TB), symptomatic pneumonia that features systemic inflammation, expectoration of sputum that contains live Mtb, and classic signs of lung damage on chest X ray. In between these two extremes is a gradient of states that ranges from latent Mtb infection to subclinical disease. TB control strategies largely focus on identification and treatment of people with full-blown TB disease and provide scant guidance on how to identify and manage the spectrum of more "subtle" disease.

Subclinical TB disease is inherently difficult to identify and research, resulting in key gaps in our understanding of its features and implications for personal and public health. It may be entirely asymptomatic or may feature very subtle symptoms that are not reported by patients during classic TB symptom screening. It may feature negative or paucibacillary sputum and minimal or atypical radiological changes on chest X ray. Our ability to map this part of the spectrum of TB disease reliably to clinical signs, symptoms, and diagnostic tests is further complicated in endemic settings where Mtb exposures are difficult to pinpoint and may occur repeatedly. Courses of anti-TB therapy and immunosuppressing comorbidities such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diabetes further complicate attempts to define the clinical and immune correlates of this state. Thus, the field lacks clear definition of the borders between subclinical TB disease and its neighbors on the spectrum of disease.

### TB or not TB? Development and validation of a clinical decision support system to inform airborne isolation requirements in the evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^1fc8340b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictors of TB disease

Several predictors of TB infection were identified in the case–control analysis (Table 2). First, presence of a cavitary lesion or other findings specifically described as suspicious for TB on the radiology report was strongly associated with active TB as compared with the absence of these findings (chest radiograph [CXR]: odds ratio [OR]: 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5, 11.5; chest computed tomography [CT]: OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.7, 6.2; P < 0.01). Prior residence in a highly TB endemic country (defined as anywhere outside of the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, or New Zealand) was the strongest epidemiologic risk factor for TB identified (OR: 5.7; 95% CI: 2.6, 12.8; P < 0.01). Other traditional epidemiologic risk factors for TB were not significantly predictive, although our study was underpowered for such analysis (Table 2).

### Identifying pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with negative sputum smear results [^7c566056]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians need to decide whether to begin empiric therapy for patients who are suspected of having tuberculosis (TB) but have negative sputum smear results. Culture results may take weeks, and delaying treatment may allow further transmission of disease.

Study Objective

To identify the clinical, demographic, and radiographic characteristics that identify smear-negative patients who have TB, and to create a TB prediction rule.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

University-affiliated public hospital in San Francisco, CA, between 1993 and 1998.

Patients

Forty-seven patients with TB and 141 control patients who were hospitalized with a suspicion of pulmonary TB; all had negative sputum smear results.

Measurements and Results

Demographic, clinical, and radiographic variables were determined by chart review. In multivariate analysis, a positive tuberculin skin test result (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0 to 11.9) was independently associated with an increased risk of a positive TB culture finding. A radiographic pattern not typical of pulmonary tuberculosis (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.7) and expectoration with cough (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.6) were predictive of a decreased risk. An interaction between HIV seropositivity and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on the chest radiograph was also associated with a positive TB culture result (OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 36.0). The TB prediction score (TPS) was created with widely ranging likelihood ratios that could affect the posterior probability of TB by 30-fold.

Conclusion

The TPS put into context with the overall prevalence of TB in a given area may help clinicians decide if a patient with negative sputum smear results should start empiric antituberculous therapy or wait for culture results. These results need prospective validation.

### Clinical and imaging factors that can predict contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis [^87761435]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Clinical and radiological criteria

Signs and symptoms of PTB were identified by detailed literature search (see Additional file 1).

The admission process was analyzed step-by-step, and compared with the literature search results. Pre-existing conditions could not be included because of incompleteness and heterogeneity of the data. After excluding unspecific and rare signs, the following, directly available criteria during the admission process were extracted from the literature and included in the analysis:

Clinical

Sex, age, weight loss (loss of 10% or more body weight in 10 months or less), cough, haemoptysis, previous TB infection, foreign / German residency (main country of residence in the last years), positive auscultation (any abnormal chest auscultation finding, no further subdivision due to difficulty categorizing and depending on examiner).

Chest x-ray (CXR)

Infiltrate, cavitation, miliary picture, pleural effusion.

Computed tomography (CT)

Infiltrate, cavitation, miliary picture, pleural effusion, tree-in-bud sign.

CT was included since this diagnostic tool is widely available in emergency departments and admission units in developed countries. The tree-in-bud sign is a finding which can solely be found in CT images. Fever was not included, since it was suggested to be a rather unspecific clinical sign in the admission setting. Microbiological parameters and additional laboratory findings such as Interferon-gamma-release assays (IGRA), tuberculin-skin-test (TST) and HIV status were not included because of the diagnostic delay.

Case detection by active and passive case finding was also considered (Table 1).

Criteria analyzed for the purpose of the study

Study design

The study was carried out as a retrospective data analysis of all patients diagnosed and treated for PTB in a regional TB center in an urban tertiary care hospital in Germany (Klinikum Dortmund, Department of Respiratory Medicine) between 7/2008 and 12/2016.

Inclusion criteria

18 years of age on admission, lung parenchyma involvement, PTB diagnosis and treatment according to national and WHO standards.

Radiographic consolidation was detected in 98% (95% CI: 86.6–99.7) of participants, cavity in 51% (95% CI: 37.1–64.7), pleural effusion in 3.9% (95% CI: 0.9–15.0), and miliary pattern in none. Chest X-ray detected consolidation in the upper fields in 74.5% of participants, middle fields in 45.1%, lower fields in 21.6%, and bilaterally in 23.5%. Chest X-ray detected 58 individual cavities in 26 patients. Chest X-ray detected cavity in the upper fields in 43.1% of participants, middle fields in 9.8%, lower fields in 2%, and bilaterally in 2% (Table 5).

Table 5
Type and location of chest X-ray lesions seen in pulmonary tuberculosis patients

Chest X-ray detected consolidation in a significantly higher proportion of patients than LUS (98% versus 80.4%, P = 0.004). Lung ultrasound composite of consolidation or SPC was detected in a significantly higher proportion of patients than CXR consolidation in the middle (56.9% versus 45.1%, P = 0.004) and lower (43.1% versus 21.6%, P = 0.035) lung fields, and bilaterally (49% versus 23.5%, P = 0.015), although other anatomic locations showed no significant difference. Chest X-ray detected cavity in a significantly higher proportion of patients than LUS (51% versus 5.9%, P < 0.001). Linear regression showed that a 1% change in percentage of regions affected on LUS was associated with a 0.6% change in percentage of CXR affected (P < 0.01, R 2 = 0.215, Figure 2).

### Miliary tuberculosis in a young caucasian adult [^0d39cd1c]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A young Caucasian adult presented to the Accident and Emergency department with small bowel obstruction, which necessitated an exploratory laparotomy. Multiple firm nodules were found with biopsies leading to a diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis (TB). Retrospectively, the patient was noted to have classical radiological pulmonary TB findings on a chest radiograph 3 months previously, and 2 weeks later had developed bony infiltration, paravertebral abscesses and likely TB skin lesions. This case illustrates an unusual presentation in a patient with minimal risk factors yet widespread extra-pulmonary disease. It also highlights the importance of attentive reviewing of x-rays.

### Pulmonary infiltrates in the non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patient: etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and outcomes [^a2160d51]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications remain a major cause of both morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. When such individuals present with radiographic infiltrates, the clinician faces a diagnostic challenge. The differential diagnosis in this setting is broad and includes both infectious and noninfectious processes. Rarely are the radiographic findings classic for one disease, and most potential etiologies have overlapping clinical and radiographic appearances. In recent years, several themes have emerged in the literature on this topic. First, an aggressive approach to identifying a specific etiology is necessary; as a corollary, diagnostic delay increases the risk for mortality. Second, the evaluation of these infiltrates nearly always entails bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy allows identification of some etiologies with certainty, and often allows for the exclusion of infectious agents even if the procedure is otherwise unrevealing. Third, early use of CT scanning regularly demonstrates lesions missed by plain radiography. Despite these advances, initial therapeutic interventions include the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and other anti-infectives in order to ensure that the patients is receiving appropriate therapy. With the results of invasive testing, these treatments are then narrowed. Frustratingly, outcomes for immunocompromised patients with infiltrates remain poor.

### Identifying the most infectious lesions in pulmonary tuberculosis by high-resolution multi-detector computed tomography [^38f4dff3]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether characteristics detected by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) were predictive of highly infectious, smear-positive, active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).

Methods

Among 124 patients with active PTB, 84 had positive (group 1) and 40 had negative (group 2) smear results for acid-fast bacilli. Multiplanar MDCT, axial conventional CT and chest X-ray images were analysed retrospectively for morphology, number, and segmental (lobe) distribution of lesions.

Results

By multivariate analysis, consolidation over any segment of the upper, middle, or lingual lobes, cavitations, and clusters of nodules were associated with group 1, while centrilobular nodules were predictive of group 2. Using five independent variables associated with risk in group 1, a prediction model was created to distinguish between group 1 and group 2. ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.951 ± 0.021 for this prediction model. With the ideal cutoff point score of 1, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were 84.5%, 97.5%, and 98.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

A model to predict smear-positive active PTB on the basis of findings from MDCT may be a useful tool for clinical decisions about isolating patients pending sputum smear results.

### Utility of chest CT after a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies [^a212881e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chest radiography is the initial choice for thoracic imaging. However, the wide availability of computed tomography (CT) has led to a substantial increase in its use in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated the utility of chest CT after a chest X-ray in patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic thoracic emergencies, and determined if the diagnosis and management decision changed after CT.

Methods

The study enrolled 500 consecutive patients with both chest X-rays and CT who presented to the ED with non-traumatic complaints. Chest X-rays and CT images obtained within 12h before any definitive treatment were randomly evaluated in consensus by two radiologists blinded to the clinical information.

Results

The chest X-ray and CT image findings were concordant in 49.2% of the 500 patients and this concordance was negatively correlated with patient age. Leading diagnosis and management decisions based on the chest radiograph changed after CT in 35.4% of the study group and this finding was also correlated with age. In 55% of 205 patients, pneumonic infiltrations were undiagnosed with radiography. Pulmonary edema was the most specific (93.3%) and sensitive (85.4%) radiography finding. Posteroanterior chest radiographs taken in the upright position had higher concordance with CT than anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken in the supine position.

Conclusions

Chest CT may be an appropriate imaging choice in patients presenting to the ED for non-traumatic reasons, particularly for elderly patients and when the radiograph is taken with the AP technique in a supine position.

### Factors associated with sputum culture-negative vs culture-positive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^bd8996db]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Recognition of active tuberculosis (TB) in its earliest stages could reduce morbidity and prevent advancement to transmissible disease. Little is published about the occurrence and presentation of sputum culture-negative pulmonary TB (PTB), an early paucibacillary but often underrecognized disease state.

Objective

To assess differences between culture-negative and culture-positive PTB regarding occurrence, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, demographics, and comorbidities.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study in which surveillance data of adult patients with PTB reported to the New York City Department of Health in New York, New York, from 2011 through 2013, ie, years for which demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were collected. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had signs of pulmonary disease, and had mycobacterial sputum culture results; those with HIV coinfection or a TB diagnosis within 2 years prior to presentation were excluded. Culture-negative PTB was defined as clinical and radiographic presentation consistent with TB, 3 negative results on sputum culture, and improvement with antituberculous treatment. The analyses were performed between 2015 and 2016; notably, the proportion of reported patients with culture-negative PTB has remained consistent during the past 2 decades.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The occurrence of culture-negative PTB among all patients with PTB was calculated, and demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and radiographic findings were compared between culture-negative and culture-positive PTB.

Results

Of the 796 patients with PTB (median [interquartile range] age, 41 [29–54] years; 499 [63%] men) who met criteria for analysis, 116 (15%) had negative results on sputum culture. Patients with culture-negative PTB compared with culture-positive PTB were less frequently male (53% vs 64%; P = 0.03) and presented with a significantly lower frequency of cough (68% vs 89%; P < .001), weight loss (39% vs 51%; P = 0.03), and cavitation on both chest radiograph (7% vs 28%; P < .001) and chest computed tomographic scan (26% vs 59%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the lack of criterion-standard test confirmation and the relative paucity of symptoms and radiological abnormalities, culture-negative PTB is likely underdiagnosed and its occurrence underestimated globally. Awareness of these findings, enhanced diagnostic approaches, and, ideally, better biomarkers could improve detection and treatment of this early disease and reduce the development of transmissible TB.

### Symptom-and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^14b61d06]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease, reducing mortality, morbidity and transmission, and improving equity in access to care. Questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have historically been the most widely available tools to screen for tuberculosis disease. Their accuracy is important for the design of tuberculosis screening programmes and determines, in combination with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, the yield of a screening programme and the burden on individuals and the health service.

Objectives

To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are considered eligible for systematic screening for tuberculosis disease. Second, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially in relation to regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

Search Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms and consulted experts for unpublished reports, for the period 1992 to 2018. The search date was 10 December 2018. This search was repeated on 2 July 2021.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if participants were screened for tuberculosis disease using symptom questions, or abnormalities on CXR, or both, and were offered confirmatory testing with a reference standard. We included studies if diagnostic two-by-two tables could be generated for one or more index tests, even if not all participants were subjected to a microbacteriological reference standard. We excluded studies evaluating self-reporting of symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We categorized symptom and CXR index tests according to commonly used definitions. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 instrument. We examined the forest plots and receiver operating characteristic plots visually for heterogeneity. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities (and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for each index test using bivariate random-effects methods. We analyzed potential sources of heterogeneity in a hierarchical mixed-model.

Main Results

The electronic database search identified 9473 titles and abstracts. Through expert consultation, we identified 31 reports on national tuberculosis prevalence surveys as eligible (of which eight were already captured in the search of the electronic databases), and we identified 957 potentially relevant articles through reference checking. After removal of duplicates, we assessed 10,415 titles and abstracts, of which we identified 430 (4%) for full text review, whereafter we excluded 364 articles. In total, 66 articles provided data on 59 studies. We assessed the 2 July 2021 search results; seven studies were potentially eligible but would make no material difference to the review findings or grading of the evidence, and were not added in this edition of the review. We judged most studies at high risk of bias in one or more domains, most commonly because of incorporation bias and verification bias. We judged applicability concerns low in more than 80% of studies in all three domains. The three most common symptom index tests, cough for two or more weeks (41 studies), any cough (21 studies), and any tuberculosis symptom (29 studies), showed a summary sensitivity of 42.1% (95% CI 36.6% to 47.7%), 51.3% (95% CI 42.8% to 59.7%), and 70.6% (95% CI 61.7% to 78.2%, all very low-certainty evidence), and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 92.6% to 95.8%, high-certainty evidence), 87.6% (95% CI 81.6% to 91.8%, low-certainty evidence), and 65.1% (95% CI 53.3% to 75.4%, low-certainty evidence), respectively. The data on symptom index tests were more heterogenous than those for CXR. The studies on any tuberculosis symptom were the most heterogeneous, but had the lowest number of variables explaining this variation. Symptom index tests also showed regional variation. The summary sensitivity of any CXR abnormality (23 studies) was 94.7% (95% CI 92.2% to 96.4%, very low-certainty evidence) and 84.8% (95% CI 76.7% to 90.4%, low-certainty evidence) for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis (19 studies), and specificity was 89.1% (95% CI 85.6% to 91.8%, low-certainty evidence) and 95.6% (95% CI 92.6% to 97.4%, high-certainty evidence), respectively. Sensitivity was more heterogenous than specificity, and could be explained by regional variation. The addition of cough for two or more weeks, whether to any (pulmonary) CXR abnormality or to CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis, resulted in a summary sensitivity and specificity of 99.2% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.8%) and 84.9% (95% CI 81.2% to 88.1%) (15 studies; certainty of evidence not assessed).

Authors' Conclusions

The summary estimates of the symptom and CXR index tests may inform the choice of screening and diagnostic algorithms in any given setting or country where screening for tuberculosis is being implemented. The high sensitivity of CXR index tests, with or without symptom questions in parallel, suggests a high yield of persons with tuberculosis disease. However, additional considerations will determine the design of screening and diagnostic algorithms, such as the availability and accessibility of CXR facilities or the resources to fund them, and the need for more or fewer diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis (depending on screening test specificity), which also has resource implications. These review findings should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations in the included studies and regional variation in sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of an index test in a specific setting cannot be predicted with great precision due to heterogeneity. This should be borne in mind when planning for and implementing tuberculosis screening programmes.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to cause over 1 million deaths annually, challenging the WHO strategy to reduce deaths due to TB by 95% by 2035. Efficient strategies to find the "missing millions" are of particularly high priority in resource-limited settings where TB burden is high and access to diagnostics may be limited. In this context, community-based screening programs may play an important role in increasing case finding –. However, these programs are challenged by the high costs of TB diagnostic tests, including molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF ® and microbiological culture –. The WHO recommends using chest radiography to select individuals with lung field abnormalities for sputum testing. However, this approach requires a workforce of radiologically trained clinicians to interpret chest x-rays (CXR), which is often limited in rural low-resource settings.

Drug-susceptible tuberculosis — risk factors for poor outcomes and relapse include more extensive disease and slower treatment response, and multiple interrelated factors have been associated with the outcome of tuberculosis therapy; numerous studies have found an increased risk of relapse among patients with signs of more extensive disease (ie, cavitation or more extensive disease on chest radiograph) and/or slower response to treatment (ie, culture status at 2 or 3 months), and factors include patient factors, radiographic features, microbiologic factors, genetic factors, programmatic factors, pharmacokinetic factors, bacillary factors, and regimen factors.
