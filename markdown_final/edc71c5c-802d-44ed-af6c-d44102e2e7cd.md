## Question

ascending aorta 4.2cm when to follow up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to schedule follow-up surveillance for an adult with a 4.2 cm (42 mm) ascending aortic diameter and how to tailor it by risk factors and imaging modality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about where 4.2 cm sits relative to size-based intervention thresholds. Then, I should verify the core surveillance cadence recommended by major guidelines. Next, I will apply those principles specifically to 4.2 cm and check population growth-rate data to justify interval length. After that, I need to consider modifiers such as bicuspid valve or genetic aortopathy that would shorten intervals. Finally, I should confirm imaging modality choices, measurement technique consistency, and practical management details like blood pressure control and when to refer.

> Let me first confirm the size category and whether surgery is even on the table. A 4.2 cm ascending aorta is a moderate dilation below standard surgical thresholds of 5.0–5.5 cm for sporadic ascending aneurysms in adults without syndromic disease, so this is a surveillance scenario rather than a surgical one at present [^112tfT9f] [^113X7dsv].

> I should verify the guideline backbone for surveillance intervals. The 2022 ACC/AHA guideline advises initial repeat imaging in 6–12 months after a new diagnosis of thoracic aortic dilation to establish growth rate; if stable thereafter, surveillance every 6–24 months is reasonable, with the exact interval dependent on absolute diameter, growth, and etiology, using TTE, CT, or MRI as appropriate to the anatomy [^112tfT9f] [^116f1NVG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a fixed interval for everyone at 4.2 cm; I need to check real-world growth rates to justify stretching intervals. Population data from DANCAVAS show very slow mean growth of the ascending aorta in the 40–44.9 mm stratum (on the order of 0.07–0.13 mm/year), supporting the safety of annual or even 18–24 month intervals once stability is documented, provided no high-risk features are present [^113HFwB2].

> Applying this to a 4.2 cm ascending aorta without high-risk features, I would schedule the first surveillance at 12 months to characterize growth, balancing the ACC/AHA 6–12 month recommendation with the low average growth in this size range; if stable, I would extend to every 12–24 months, with the shorter end of the range chosen if measurement uncertainty exists, if blood pressure is suboptimally controlled, or if the patient is approaching 4.5–5.0 cm over time [^112tfT9f] [^113HFwB2]. Wait, let me verify I'm not being too lax here — some single-center data suggest faster expansion above 45 mm, but at 42 mm and with stability, annual to biennial imaging remains consistent with guideline latitude and observed growth kinetics [^1162smup] [^112tfT9f].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers that warrant tighter intervals. More frequent surveillance, generally every 6–12 months, is appropriate with bicuspid aortic valve once the root or ascending aorta is ≥ 40 mm, and lifelong surveillance is recommended, with modality chosen by visualization quality and consistency needs; rapid growth, family history of dissection, and poorly controlled hypertension are also reasons to shorten the interval; genetic aortopathies (Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Turner with elevated aortic size index) require syndrome-specific protocols and typically annual or more frequent imaging depending on stability and segment involved [^116UwJua] [^114queV1] [^113XAUR4] [^113K2Efi]. I should double-check the "rapid growth" trigger — practically, growth exceeding a few millimeters per year should prompt closer follow-up and consideration of earlier intervention in the appropriate context even if absolute size is modest, aligned with ACC/AHA intent to incorporate growth rate into decision-making [^112tfT9f].

> I will now examine imaging modality and measurement consistency because misclassification can masquerade as "growth". For distal ascending aorta and arch surveillance, cardiovascular CT or MRI is preferred because TTE often under-visualizes these segments, whereas TTE can be acceptable if the aortic root and proximal ascending are clearly visualized; choosing one modality and sticking to it improves reproducibility and comparability over time [^115d3FU3] [^112EvkFf] [^113zHaAx]. CT angiography and MR angiography are generally first-line for thoracic aortic surveillance; MRI can reduce cumulative radiation and contrast exposure during longitudinal follow-up, which is explicitly endorsed when aiming to limit radiation or avoid iodinated contrast [^111e41D2] [^116z1biL] [^1129zuZi].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement technique details to avoid artifactual "growth". For CT/MRI, measure perpendicular to the axis of blood flow at reproducible landmarks and, when the wall is visible, from outer edge to outer edge; for TTE, leading-edge to leading-edge measurements are recommended, and using the same modality and technique over time is key to detecting true change rather than variability from methods or planes of section [^114NRvBc] [^111y9muD] [^116FJ6G8] [^111ZeqXm].

> I need to ensure the care plan covers general management. Optimize blood pressure and atherosclerotic risk factors, consider beta-blockade or ARB in appropriate contexts, and counsel on avoiding extreme isometric exertion; refer to a multidisciplinary aortic team if there are high-risk features, discordant measurements, or uncertainty about growth or thresholds, consistent with the comprehensive care framework emphasized by ACC/AHA and ESC documents [^112Z2r61] [^112tfT9f] [^112EvkFf].

> Bottom line: For a 4.2 cm ascending aorta in an adult without genetic aortopathy, bicuspid valve–related high-risk features, or rapid enlargement, I would obtain follow-up imaging at 12 months; if stable, continue surveillance every 12–24 months thereafter, using the same high-quality modality (preferably CT or MRI if the distal ascending segment is of interest), and shorten to every 6–12 months if risk factors emerge, visualization is suboptimal, or growth exceeds a few millimeters per year [^112tfT9f] [^115d3FU3] [^113zHaAx] [^113HFwB2].

---

For a 4.2 cm ascending aorta, **repeat imaging in 12 months** is recommended to assess stability and growth [^112tfT9f]. If stable (growth < 0.5 cm/year), continue surveillance **every 1–2 years**; if growth is ≥ 0.5 cm/year or the diameter reaches 5.0 cm, shorten intervals to **every 6 months** and refer to a specialist [^112tfT9f] [^113X7dsv]. Use the same imaging modality and measurement technique for consistency, and tailor follow-up to patient-specific risk factors such as bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disorders, or family history [^112tfT9f] [^113zHaAx].

---

## Recommended follow-up intervals

The **2022 ACC/AHA guidelines** provide clear recommendations for **follow-up imaging intervals** based on aortic diameter and growth rate:

- **Initial follow-up imaging**: Obtain follow-up imaging (TTE, CT, or MRI) within 6–12 months after the initial diagnosis to determine the rate of aortic enlargement [^112tfT9f].
- **Stable aorta**: If the aortic diameter remains stable (growth rate < 0.5 cm/year), surveillance imaging every 1–2 years is appropriate [^112tfT9f].
- **Rapid growth or larger diameter**: If the aorta grows rapidly (≥ 0.5 cm/year) or reaches 5.0 cm, shorten intervals to every 6 months and refer to a specialist [^112tfT9f] [^112Z2r61].

---

## Imaging modalities and measurement techniques

Consistency in imaging modality and measurement technique is **essential** for accurate assessment of aortic growth. **Imaging modalities** include TTE, CT, or MRI, selected based on patient anatomy and clinical context [^112tfT9f]. **Measurement technique** entails measuring the aorta perpendicular to the axis of blood flow at reproducible anatomical landmarks, using the same modality and method for serial imaging [^113zHaAx] [^114NRvBc].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors influencing follow-up

Several patient-specific factors may necessitate **more frequent follow-up**:

- **Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)**: Lifelong surveillance imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta is recommended, with intervals based on diameter and growth rate [^116UwJua].
- **Connective tissue disorders**: Conditions such as Marfan syndrome or Loeys-Dietz syndrome require more frequent surveillance due to higher risk of rapid aortic growth and complications [^113RhLUw] [^114queV1].
- **Family history**: A family history of aortic aneurysm or dissection may warrant closer monitoring.

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or inadequate follow-up

Delayed or inadequate follow-up can lead to **significant clinical consequences**, including **increased risk of complications**, because delayed detection of rapid aortic growth or aneurysm formation raises the risk of aortic dissection, rupture, and mortality. It may also result in **missed intervention opportunities**, reducing the chance for timely surgical intervention.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended follow-up interval** | **Imaging modality** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of ascending aorta dilation (4.2 cm) | 6–12 months | - TTE <br/> - CT <br/> - Or MRI |
| Stable aorta (growth < 0.5 cm/year) | Every 1–2 years | Same modality as initial |
| Rapid growth (≥ 0.5 cm/year) or diameter ≥ 5.0 cm | Every 6 months | Same modality as initial |
| Bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disorder | - Lifelong surveillance <br/> - Interval based on diameter and growth rate | - TTE <br/> - CT <br/> - Or MRI |

---

For a 4.2 cm ascending aorta, **repeat imaging in 12 months** is recommended to assess stability and growth. If the aorta remains stable, continue surveillance **every 1–2 years**; if rapid growth occurs or the diameter increases, shorten intervals and refer to a specialist.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113X7dsv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA) is a common yet poorly understood disease with a significant population burden; approximately 3 to 23 million people in the United States alone meet guidelines for imaging surveillance. Thoracic aortic dilation is estimated to affect 3% of people aged over 50 years, with specific patient factors (e.g. bicuspid aortic valve [BAV], hereditary thoracic aortic disease [HTAD]) associated with even higher rates of dilation (> 50%). The prevalence of thoracic aortic dilation is increasing, likely due to the aging population, which drives increased incidence, and higher rates of incidental detection on computed tomography (CT) scans for other common indications (e.g. lung cancer screening, coronary calcium scoring). Although typically an asymptomatic and indolent disease, patients with aTAA remain at risk of developing rapid growth and type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Open surgical repair of the ascending aorta is the only effective treatment to prevent the future risk of TAAD, with the maximal diameter of the ascending aorta used as the primary metric to inform risk and surgical candidacy. The revised 2022 American Heart Association guidelines recommend surgical repair of sporadic aTAA once the maximal diameter reaches 50 to 55 mm, depending on patient‐specific risk factors and center expertise.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for thoracic aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to follow-up aortic imaging of unrepaired aneurysms, the 2022 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend considering follow-up imaging (TTE, CT, or MRI, as appropriate based on individual anatomy) in 6–12 months to determine the rate of aortic enlargement in patients with a dilated thoracic aorta. If stable, consider obtaining surveillance imaging every 6–24 months, depending on aortic diameter.

Patients with aortic enlargement are recommended to undergo serial imaging and clinical follow-up until they reach surgical thresholds. This study aimed to identify aortic diameter and care of patients with aortic imaging before aortic dissection (AD). In a retrospective cohort of AD patients, we evaluated previous imaging results in addition to ordering providers and indications. Imaging was stratified as > 1 or 1 year before AD (1,317 ± 1,017 days). The mean ascending aortic diameter was 4.2 ± 0.4 cm.

In conclusion, in a series of patients with aortic imaging before AD, the aortic size was far short of surgical thresholds in 94% of the group. In more than 50% of cases, imaging was last performed over a year before dissection.

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" was developed to provide recommendations guiding clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation, and family screening, as well as the medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets, including asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021. This search encompassed studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee when appropriate.

Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. New recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision-making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. There is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for bicuspid aortic valve, more specifically with respect to follow-up aortic imaging, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend lifelong surveillance imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta. This should be achieved by TTE, CT, or MRI at an interval dependent on the aortic diameter and rate of growth in patients with BAV and a diameter of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both, of ≥ 40 mm, including those who have undergone previous aortic valve repair or replacement.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection: Treatment planning and follow-up [^111e41D2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

As the incidence of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology (aneurysm and dissection) rises and the complexity of endovascular and surgical treatment options increases, imaging follow-up of patients remains crucial. Patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathology without intervention should be monitored carefully for changes in aortic size or morphology that could portend rupture or other complications.

Patients who are post endovascular or open surgical aortic repair should undergo follow-up imaging to evaluate for complications, endoleak, or pathology. Considering the quality of diagnostic data, CT angiography and MR angiography are the preferred imaging modalities for follow-up of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology for most patients. The extent of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology and its potential complications involve multiple regions of the body, requiring imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in most patients.

- **ACR Appropriateness Criteria**: The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Low rates of aortic surveillance imaging and clinical follow-up in patients with acute aortic dissection [^117MLdfr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Patients that survive acute aortic dissection (AD) remain at high risk of morbidity and mortality due to structural changes in the aorta. Effective aortic surveillance poses challenges, particularly in tertiary referral centers. This study aimed to identify follow-up imaging and appointment rates, as well as factors associated with incomplete surveillance in patients with acute AD.

This single-center, retrospective study examined acute AD patients at a tertiary care center from July 2012 to December 2022, all of whom survived at least one year post-dissection. Complete surveillance was defined as obtaining computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the chest and abdomen at 1 month (± 14 days), 6 months (± 1.5 months), 1 year (± 3 months), and yearly thereafter. Data were sourced from electronic health records. Predictors of absent imaging at the 1-year (± 3 months) timepoint were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

The study included 272 patients, of whom 63.2% were male and 39.3% were White, with an average age of 60.7 ± 14.7 years. Acute type A AD made up 47.1% of the cohort, with 91.4% undergoing open repair within one week of presentation. Among the acute type B AD patients (52.9% of the cohort), 41.7% received thoracic endovascular aortic repair during the initial admission. At the 1-year follow-up interval (± 3 months), 26.5% underwent confirmed aortic surveillance imaging, and 27.6% had an appointment with a cardiovascular specialist. Only 9.6% of the cohort fully adhered to the recommended surveillance imaging in the first year of follow-up.

### 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: A report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^114queV1]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend diagnostic imaging. Obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at the time of initial diagnosis to determine the diameters of the aortic root and ascending aorta, followed by another TTE 6 months later to assess the rate of aortic growth in patients with Marfan syndrome. If the aortic diameters are stable, conduct an annual surveillance TTE. Use CT or MRI of the thoracic aorta if the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both are not adequately visualized on TTE.

### Challenges in prompt identification and surgical correction of Marfan syndrome aortic disease in a middle-income country: a case series study [^116mNPj9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The guidelines emphasize monitoring the aortic root and ascending aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). According to the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations, elective repair is advised when the diameter reaches 5.0 cm (Class 1, Level C-LD). Nevertheless, key risk factors for aortic complications have been identified, which include a family history of aortic dissection, rapid aortic growth (≥ 0.3 cm/year), diffuse dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, and marked vertebral arterial tortuosity. The guidelines suggest elective aortic root surgery after reaching 4.5 cm when these risk factors are present (Class 2, Level B-NR).

Additionally, dilation of other anatomical locations of the aorta is more likely to occur after aortic root replacement or previous dissection. For aneurysms in other aortic segments (arch, descending, or abdominal), operative intervention is considered reasonable when the aortic diameter reaches ≥ 5.0 cm for patients at acceptable operative risk or with a long life expectancy (Level 2a, Class C-EO).

However, optimal surgical timing and outcomes are a concern. These guideline recommendations are based on observational studies and experts' opinions, with mainly short-term and mid-term results. Moreover, the literature on the adequate treatment of MFS aortic disease in Latin America is even scarcer and limited.

Therefore, we aim to describe population characteristics, long-term survival, and re-intervention patterns in patients who underwent aortic surgery with a previously confirmed clinical diagnosis of MFS.

### 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: A report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1164BKrv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining surveillance imaging of the thoracic aorta using MRI or CT. This is to evaluate for distal thoracic aortic disease. Initially, imaging should be conducted annually, and if the aorta remains normal in diameter and unchanged after two years, it should then be conducted every other year. This recommendation is specifically for patients with Marfan syndrome who have undergone aortic root replacement.

### Post-stenotic aortic dilatation [^116ZKjAm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Replacement of the ascending aorta at the time of aortic valve replacement (AVR) is controversial because the risk of progressive dilatation following AVR is uncertain. Andrus et al. aimed to determine the natural history of ascending aorta dilatation following AVR. They studied 185 patients undergoing AVR and measured the ascending aortic diameter 2 cm above the sinotubular ridge using transthoracic echocardiography before surgery and during the follow-up period. Progressive aortic dilatation was defined as an increase in diameter of more than 0.3 cm from the preoperative measurement. This was observed in only 15% of the study population. No patients with baseline aortic dilatation (3.5–5.3 cm) experienced dilation to more than 5.5 cm during the follow-up period (n = 107, mean 33.6 months). They found no clinical or valvular characteristics that predicted progressive aortic dilatation. Their conclusion was therefore against routine replacement of the ascending aorta at the time of AVR.

Another clinical study by Matsuyama et al. looked at the incidence of aortic complications in 35 patients following AVR with a preoperative dilated ascending aorta of 4.0 cm, assessed by computed tomography or operative findings. The baseline aortic diameter in the study population ranged from 4.0–5.5 cm. The mean follow-up period was 8.1 ± 3.5 years (range: 2.3–13 years). Aortic events occurred in 5 patients.

### Discrepancies in measurement of the thoracic aorta: JACC review topic of the week [^111ZeqXm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians often encounter discrepant measurements of the ascending aorta that impede, complicate, and impair appropriate clinical assessment, including key issues such as the presence or absence of aortic growth, rate of growth, and need for surgical intervention. These discrepancies may arise within a single modality (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiography) or between modalities. The authors explore the origins and significance of these discrepancies, revealing that some "truth" usually underlies all the discrepant measurements, which individually look at the ascending aorta with different perspectives and dimensional definitions. The authors conclude with a practical "question and answer" section that addresses common specific issues in interpretation and management of patients in the real-world setting.

### Screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysms: who needs it and when [^11783CRq]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms can potentially save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. However, screening programs have yet to be proven as an efficient means of achieving this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option.

Recently, two large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be monitored at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^116Rok1g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms account for almost 50,000 deaths annually in the United States. Death is due to rupture or dissection and is strongly linked to the size of the aneurysm. Recent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease represent the efforts of multiple professional societies (ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM) to develop evidence-based recommendations for the management of all aspects of thoracic aortic disease in order to improve patient outcomes. The guidelines were prepared after rigorous and careful review of the evidence by multiple experts in the field representing cardiologists, radiologists, vascular surgeons, and cardiothoracic/aortic surgeons.

Guidelines recommend surgical intervention for ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms when they are 5 cm in size for patients with genetic predisposition to rupture/dissection such as the connective tissue disorder Marfan's syndrome, or 5.5 cm in size for non-Marfan patients. Similarly, the recommendations are to surgically intervene when a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm is 5.5 cm for a Marfan or 6 cm for a non-Marfan patient. These guidelines are based on data showing increased mortality for these patients. Thus, the risk of rupture-related complication exceeds the risk of surgery-related complications for this high-risk patient subgroup, rendering an operation as the safer strategy. For moderate-size (defined as ≤ 4.9 cm) thoracic aortic aneurysms (MTAA), however, the committee concluded that the evidence is severely lacking to establish clear recommendations.

### Risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm after ectatic aorta detection from initial screening [^115FVKkA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of ectatic aorta, the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the risk of rupture, and the risk factor profile in patients with detected ectatic aortas as part of an AAA screening program.

A retrospective chart review analyzed all patients screened for AAA from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, within a regional healthcare system. The screening criteria focused on men aged 65 to 75 years who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An ectatic aorta was classified as having a maximum aortic diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm, while an AAA was defined as an aortic diameter of 3 cm or greater. Patients with ectatic aortas who underwent follow-up imaging of the aorta, with a minimum of one year of monitoring, were evaluated for related clinical and cardiovascular risk factors. Data collection was concluded by December 3, 2018.

Logistic regression was performed on statistically significant variables from univariate and χ² analyses to identify risks linked to the development of AAA in patients initially diagnosed with an ectatic aorta. A Cox proportional hazard model assessed survival data, with a P value of less than .05 considered statistically significant.

### Impact of nondiameter aortic indices on surgical eligibility: Results from the Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance (TITAN: SVS) randomized controlled trial [^116W2twG]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The traditional criterion for intervention on an asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysm has been a maximal aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or more. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association aortic guidelines adopted the cross-sectional aortic area/height ratio, aortic size index, and aortic height index as alternate parameters for surgical intervention. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of using these newer indices on patient eligibility for surgical intervention in a prospective, multicenter cohort with moderate-sized ascending aortic aneurysms between 5.0 and 5.4 cm.

Patients enrolled from 2018 to 2023 in the randomization or registry arms of the multicenter trial, Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance, were included in the study. Clinical data were captured prospectively in an online database, and imaging data were derived from a core computed laboratory.

Among the 329 included patients, 20% were female. The mean age was 65.0 ± 11.6 years, and the mean maximal aortic diameter was 50.8 ± 3.9 mm. In the one-third of all patients (n = 109) who met any one of the three criteria (i.e. aortic size index ≥ 3.08 cm/m², aortic height index ≥ 3.21 cm/m, or cross-sectional aortic area/height ≥ 10 cm²/m), their mean maximal aortic diameter was 52.5 ± 0.52 mm. Alternate criteria were most commonly met in women compared to men: 20% versus 2% for aortic size index (P < .001), 39% versus 5% for aortic height index (P < .001), and 39% versus 21% for cross-sectional aortic area/height (P = 0.002), respectively.

### Growth rate of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms in a non-referral-based population [^113t7ZqW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

We queried 21,325 CT scans performed at our institution between 2013 and 2016 on patients aged 50–85 for radiologic diagnosis of aortic aneurysm or dilatation. A total of 560 patients were identified to have aortic dilatation greater than 4 cm, of which 207 had follow-up scan intervals longer than 6 months. This comprised our non-referral-based study population.

The double oblique technique was used to measure the maximum transverse diameter of the ascending aorta from outer-to-outer edge (Visage 7, Visage Imaging, Inc, San Diego, CA). Final measurements were calculated as an average of three diameters measured 60 degrees apart from each other. The linearized annual growth rate was calculated by dividing the change in aortic size by the time interval between CT scans.
- **Double oblique measurement**: Measurement of the ascending thoracic aorta used the double oblique technique. The maximum transverse diameter was measured on multiplanar reconstruction images in planes perpendicular to the aortic wall, from outer-to-outer edge. Final measurements were calculated as an average of three diameters measured 60 degrees apart from each other.

Patient characteristics were compared between those with faster and slower growth rates using the Wilcoxon ranked sum test for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Faster growth rates were defined as those in the top 25th percentile of growth rates in our study cohort. Continuous variables were summarized with median and interquartile range (IQR), with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.

### Advances in imaging and surveillance of AAA: When, how, how often [^111ztJpU]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Despite rapid technological developments for imaging the aorta, ultrasonography remains the method of choice for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. Randomized trials conducted in the 20th century have provided convincing evidence in favor of screening men at age 65 years or older. However, in the 21st century, the prevalence of aneurysms in 65-year-old men has fallen by more than half, probably due to lower smoking prevalence and better cardiovascular risk prevention, indicating that screening or rescreening at an older age may be helpful.

A recent meta-analysis has provided good evidence for surveillance intervals, with the majority of patients with screen-detected aneurysms (up to 4.5 cm in diameter) being safely managed with 3-year surveillance intervals. Even for larger aneurysms, annual surveillance intervals are likely to be acceptable, which would reduce the number of surveillance visits by approximately half.

### The nonsyndromic ascending thoracic aorta in a population-based setting: A 5-year prospective cohort study [^113HFwB2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prospective data on the clinical course of the ascending thoracic aorta are lacking. This study sought to estimate growth rates of the ascending aorta and to evaluate occurrences of adverse aortic events (AAEs), which include thoracic aortic ruptures, type A aortic dissections, and thoracic aortic-related deaths.

In this prospective cohort study from the population-based, multicenter, randomized DANCAVAS (Danish Cardiovascular Screening trials) I and II, participants underwent cardiovascular risk assessments, including electrocardiogram-gated, noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scans. The clinical database was supplemented with outcome data from Danish health care registries. Exclusion criteria were connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valves, and survivors of a prior AAE. To estimate growth rates, participants with consecutive CT scans were followed from inclusion to the last scan. To evaluate AAEs, the entire cohort was followed from inclusion to AAE, elective ascending aortic surgery, death, or December 31, 2021.

In 2,026 individuals (77.3% men; mean age: 69.2 ± 3.1 years; median follow-up: 4.5 years [Q1-Q3: 3.4–4.7 years]), 4,897 CT scans were obtained. This encompassed 1,374 individuals with baseline ascending aortas of < 40.0 mm (68.3% men), 388 with baseline ascending aortas between 40.0 and 44.9 mm (94.5% men), 188 with baseline ascending aortas between 45.0 and 49.9 mm (98.4% men), and 76 men with baseline ascending aortas of ≥ 50 mm. The mean ascending aortic growth rates in men and women were 0.07 ± 0.5 mm/year and 0.13 ± 0.3 mm/year, respectively.

### Potential benefits and harms of offering ultrasound surveillance to men aged 65 years and older with a subaneurysmal (2.5–2.9 cm) infrarenal aorta [^113ePF9p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to perform a rapid evidence summary to determine the prevalence of subaneurysmal aortic aneurysms, growth rates, and risk factors that modulate growth in average-risk men aged 65 years and older. Secondary objectives were to evaluate benefits and harms of lifelong ultrasound (US) surveillance and treatment outcomes for any large aneurysms that develop in the screened population.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases (e.g. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, and the Cochrane Library) on February 16, 2016. Using a liberal accelerated method, two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and subsequently screened full-text studies. General study characteristics (e.g. country, study design, number of participants) and data (e.g. number of men with subaneurysmal aortas, quality of life [QoL], mortality) were extracted. One reviewer performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, and a second reviewer verified 100% of studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

- **Results**: The search identified 37 relevant studies ranging in size from 3 to 52,690 participants. Prevalence of subaneurysmal aortas ranged from 1.14% to 8.53%, and 55% to 88% of these men progressed to a 3.0-cm aneurysm by 5 years of follow-up. Risk factors for growth included the infrarenal aortic diameter at age 65 years, having a subaneurysmal aorta at age 65 years, and smoking. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey was the most commonly used tool to measure QoL, and QoL was typically lower in people with abdominal aortic aneurysm.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection-treatment planning and follow-up: 2024 update [^1129zuZi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta include two broad categories: aneurysmal dilation involving all three layers of the intact aortic wall and acute aortic syndromes, wherein at least one layer of the aortic wall is disrupted, such as in aortic dissection. These diseases carry a variable risk of subsequent aortic rupture, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Imaging is critical in the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of this constellation of diseases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodological principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Follow-up after the Ross procedure, how significant it is, case reports of three patients [^117FLSFE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The 2010 AHA/ACC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease suggested that the follow-up interval after aortic root and ascending aorta procedures should include a baseline transthoracic echocardiographic examination before discharge and then annually.

The 2014 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases recommended that for patients undergoing surgical thoracic aortic repair, the first follow-up should be performed 1 month after the treatment with surveillance repeated at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Computer tomography (CT) is the modality of choice; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography (TTE/TOE) may be used as alternative modalities.

Evangelista A suggested that imaging control via TTE/TOE should be performed before discharge and a TTE annually thereafter. In cases with an ascending aorta diameter greater than 45 mm, MRI or CT should be performed every 2–3 years.

In our group of patients, we could not isolate any factors to justify the diverse outcomes observed. It is a small registry, and we cannot draw definite conclusions. Moreover, all operations were performed using the same surgical technique, and all patients had the same demographic characteristics. The treatment with a beta-blocker in some patients with a hyperdynamic circulation did not influence the aneurysm growth rate. Recently, a review questioned the role of beta-blockers in the prevention of aortic aneurysms.

### Computed tomography follow-up after elective proximal aortic surgery: Less is more [^113Yi54b]. American Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The added value of computed tomography (CT) follow-up after elective proximal aortic surgery is unclear. We evaluated the benefit of CT follow-up by assessing the incidence of aorta-related complications and reinterventions detected during routine CT follow-up.

Data on 314 patients undergoing first-time elective proximal aortic surgery between 2000 and 2015 were collected. The primary study endpoints were aorta-related complications and reinterventions detected during routine CT follow-up. Secondary study endpoints included all aorta-related complications and reinterventions, irrespective of the mode of detection, and survival.

Median CT follow-up time was 6.8 years (IQR 4.1–9.8 years), during which a total of 1,303 routine follow-up CT scans (median 4, IQR 3–5) were performed. During CT follow-up, aorta-related complications were detected in 18 (5.7%) patients, of which 6 (1.6%) underwent reintervention. In total, 28 aorta-related complications were observed in 23 (7.3%) patients, 9 of which led to reintervention. In order to detect one aorta-related complication leading to reintervention, 218 routine follow-up CT scans were required. The unadjusted and EuroSCORE II adjusted hazard ratios of not undergoing CT follow-up on mortality were 1.260 (95% CI 0.705–2.251) and 0.830 (95% CI 0.430–1.605), respectively.

Following first-time elective proximal aortic surgery, aorta-related complications are uncommon, are not always detected during CT follow-up and, if detected, often do not result in reintervention. Therefore, a more conservative approach to CT follow-up may be warranted.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112mvbPp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Our study has some important limitations. First, as a major surgical referral center, there were few patients in our imaging surveillance cohort with a baseline ascending aortic diameter > 55 mm (n = 3, 1.2%) and none > 60 mm, as shown in Figure 3. Thus, this study cannot evaluate the diameter-growth rate relationship above surgical threshold sizes. Second, although our exclusion of patients with hereditary thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) limits our population to bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)-associated or sporadic ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA), these subgroups make up the vast majority of patients with aTAA under surveillance at most centers. Third, as a retrospective study, certain patient characteristics are challenging to accurately determine, such as a comprehensive family history and blood pressure control. However, we believe our detailed collection and analysis of blood pressure readings, with most patients having readings on the same day as their scans, serves as a suitable surrogate.

Additionally, the advantage of our retrospective study design is the availability of longer follow-up periods to more clearly define slow aortic growth, which is commonly observed in aTAA. Fourth, we analyzed the longest available computed tomography angiography (CTA) interval to maximize the magnitude of detectable growth, although this means that our measured growth rates represent growth over the entire available interval. Growth in aTAA may, in fact, be variable over time, a phenomenon that we did not assess in this study but will investigate in future studies. Fifth, the volumetric diameter measurement (VDM) technique can be sensitive to image distortions related to motion or streak artifact, although these issues also affect the reliability of the imaging results.

### Development and validation of a predictive model to identify patients with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm [^115zLAd1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The definition of ATAA was the outcome of interest and was defined as an ascending thoracic aorta with a diameter ≥ 4.0 cm, measured using the double oblique technique. In this technique, a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta is defined in 3-dimensional space, and the cross-sectional aorta is measured by taking the average of outer-to-outer wall diameters measured at 60° apart from each other. The threshold of 4.0 cm was chosen to increase the sensitivity of detecting an enlarged aorta in a screening context, acknowledging that studies have defined aneurysm variably.

The largest portion of the aorta between the sinotubular junction and the proximal take-off of the innominate artery was measured. Aortic diameter was not indexed by body size because the guideline recommendations for surgical intervention are based on diameter without indexing. Given that scans included both cardiac-gated and nongated scans, measurements focused on aneurysms in the ascending aorta since aortic root measurements are susceptible to motion artifacts along the cardiac cycle.

Measurements were performed using Visage imaging software (Visage Imaging, Richmond, Australia) by an author trained by a senior member of the radiology faculty who specialized in cardiac and thoracic imaging. The investigator's measurements were compared with those of the radiologist's, yielding a 0.3-mm mean difference.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112cNPD4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.
- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size-adjusted indexes were calculated.

Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was independent.

### Dilatation of the remaining aorta after aortic valve or aortic root replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve: a 5-year follow-up [^1141u3cW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The natural history and management of ascending aorta (AA) and arch dilatation in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) or aortic root replacement (ARR) remains controversial. Our aim is to identify dilatation of the remaining aorta after AVR or ARR in patients with BAV compared with patients with a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV).

- **Methods**: Three hundred ninety-five patients who underwent AVR or ARR between 2002 and 2009 were studied. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were performed in 192 patients with BAV, and the results were compared with those of 203 patients with TAV. An AA diameter of 4.5 cm or greater was regarded as aneurysmal. Postoperative echocardiograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance images were compared with subsequent imaging at a median follow-up of 4.6 years (2.2–9.8 years).

- **Results**: Median ages of patients with BAV and patients with TAV were 57 ± 14 and 65 ± 16 years, respectively (p < 0.05). The preoperative diameter of the AA in the BAV group with no aneurysm (3.5 cm; range, 3.0–4.0 cm; n = 143) was significantly higher than in the TAV group (3.3 cm; range, 3.1–3.8 cm; n = 129) (p < 0.001). In both BAV and TAV groups with nonaneurysmal aortas who underwent AVR, there was no significant expansion of the AA and arch at 5 years' follow-up. In patients with an aneurysmal aorta (BAV group, n = 49; TAV group, n = 74) who underwent ARR, there was also no significant difference in the growth of the remaining aorta at 3 and 5 years' follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: No significant dilatation of the remaining aorta was observed in patients with BAV or TAV after ARR or AVR over the 5-year follow-up period.

### Natural history of the proximal aorta in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease [^114pUPW9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This study investigated the growth and behavior of the ascending aorta in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease.

- **Methods**: We examined 200 patients with descending thoracic aortic disease, including acute type B dissection (n = 95), chronic type B dissection (n = 38), intramural hematoma (n = 23), and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (n = 44). Images from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated after three-dimensional reconstruction to examine the growth rate in those with more than one year of imaging follow-up (n = 108). Survival data were derived from all 200 patients in this study.

- **Results**: Average proximal aortic dimensions at the index image were relatively small, measuring 3.65 ± 0.51 cm in the root, 3.67 ± 0.48 cm in the ascending aorta, and 3.50 ± 0.44 cm in the proximal arch. Average growth rate was low for the aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal arch at 0.36 ± 0.64 mm/y, 0.26 ± 0.44 mm/y, and 0.25 ± 0.44 mm/y, respectively. There was no difference in baseline proximal aortic dimensions and growth rate between the four subgroups. An index aortic diameter ≥ 4.1 cm grew faster than those < 4.1 cm at the ascending aorta (P = 0.028) and proximal arch (P = 0.019). There was no difference in aortic growth rates at the aortic root (P = 0.887). After the index scan, five patients underwent six ascending aortic replacement procedures, leading to a 3% ascending aortic intervention rate. Overall median life expectancy was 86.15 years.

- **Conclusions**: Native ascending aortic growth in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease is likely to be consistent with these findings.

### Early impact of aortic wrapping on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with mild to moderate ascending aorta dilatation [^111DEftn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The management of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta, less than 5 cm, is controversial, particularly when concomitant surgical correction of the aortic valve is required. This study investigates the impact of a simple method of aorta reduction using Dacron graft wrapping during aortic valve replacement on the rest of the aorta.
- **Methods**: We studied 14 patients with ascending aorta dilatation of 4–5 cm before undergoing aortic wrapping during their aortic valve replacement. Their post-operative imaging within a month was compared to their pre-operative state.
- **Results**: The diameters of the ascending aorta wrapped with the Dacron graft were significantly reduced within 4 weeks after surgery from 44.7 ± 2.6 mm to 33.6 ± 3.9 mm (p < 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction in the diameter of the rest of the ascending aorta: coronary sinuses (from 37.9 ± 4.9 mm to 33.3 ± 6.1 mm; p < 0.001), sinotubular junction (from 33.2 ± 4.7 mm to 30.6 ± 4.4 mm, p = 0.02), and aortic arch (from 34.7 ± 4.3 mm to 32.6 ± 4.1 mm, p = 0.03).
- **Conclusions**: Reduction of ascending aortic dilatation by wrapping with a Dacron graft in this preliminary study is associated with favorable early reversed aortic remodelling. This supports the hypothesis that correction of mild-moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta with Dacron wrapping at the time of aortic valve surgery may prevent the progression of the dilatation. However, a long-term study on a larger population is needed to confirm its benefits.

### How should very severe aortic stenosis be defined in asymptomatic individuals [^115KLVpH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction are noted for their progression rates, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline of 0.3 m/s per year. This scenario aligns with a class IIa recommendation in European guidelines and a class IIb recommendation in US guidelines for aortic valve replacement (AVR). AVR is considered reasonable in asymptomatic patients with high V max presenting a low surgical risk (class IIa recommendation), although the V max cut-off currently used remains controversial (≥ 5 m/s in US guidelines and > 5.5 m/s in European guidelines). Finally, the latest European guidelines add markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and severe pulmonary hypertension at rest (systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 60 mm Hg) as incentives for AVR in severe asymptomatic AS with low surgical risk.

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (i.e. asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).
- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINHL Complete. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee where appropriate.
- **Structure**: Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. Additionally, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision-making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. There is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113KN3GZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To reduce late ruptures in the future, two policies are possible. The first would be to rescreen all men with a normal aortic diameter, for example after 10 years, but this would be costly. The second would be to include those with an aortic diameter ranging from 2.5 to 2.9 cm in the surveillance program. It would be sufficient to recall these men only after, for example, 5 years in the first instance, because the chance of developing an AAA larger than 5.5 cm or having an AAA rupture before that time is very small. Hence, the additional cost to the surveillance program would be modest.

Being based on a population-based sample of UK men, the results from MASS should, in principle, correspond with the expected benefit that will derive from the NHS AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP). However, the prevalence of AAA (diameter at least 3.0 cm) is about 1.7 percent in NAAASP, compared with 4.9 percent in MASS, and the number of ruptured AAAs is currently falling in the UK and elsewhere. The reasons for the lower prevalence are not fully understood but may partly be because NAAASP is targeting a younger age (men aged 65 years rather than 65–74 years as in MASS). In some NAAASP centers, the ethnic mix is different, and the uptake is lower than in MASS.

Additionally, there has been a reduction in smoking prevalence and a general reduction in cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases over the intervening 15 years, together with an increased use of some drugs (especially statins) and elective surgery for those aged over 75 years.

### Expansion rate of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms [^1162smup]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Surveillance is mandatory for all patients with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). The frequency of surveillance imaging, however, is not evidence-based, as few data exist regarding TAA growth rates. This study aimed to determine the rate of TAA expansion and to inform surveillance intervals based on TAA diameter.
- **Methods**: Patients with a TAA for whom morphological data were available from serial CT scans were studied. Annualized growth rates based on diameter at presentation and time taken to reach a theoretical intervention threshold of 55mm were calculated. The number of patients who would have achieved the threshold undetected was determined based on simulated imaging intervals of 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years.
- **Results**: A total of 2916 scans from 995 patients were analyzed. The mean aortic expansion rate was 2.76 mm per year for all patients, with an exponential increase observed at sizes above 45 mm. Only 3.9 percent of patients with a starting diameter of 30–39 mm and 5.3 percent of those with a diameter of 40–44 mm achieved threshold size within 2 years. Conversely, the probability of expansion to more than 55 mm was 74.5 percent in 2 years for patients with a starting diameter of 50–54 mm, rising to 85.7 percent at 3 years.
- **Conclusion**: Based on a threshold of 55 mm for intervention, most patients with a maximum aortic diameter below 40 mm could safely undergo surveillance at 2-yearly intervals. Above 45 mm, annual surveillance is recommended. Patients with a diameter greater than 50 mm could be optimized for possible repair, if this is clinically appropriate.

### Should the ascending aorta be replaced more frequently in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease [^111nkBzd]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The optimal diameter at which replacement of the ascending aorta should be performed in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease is not known.
- **Methods**: We reviewed all patients with bicuspid aortic valves undergoing aortic valve replacement at our institution from 1979 through 1993 (n = 201). Patients undergoing concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta were excluded.
- **Results**: Follow-up was obtained on 98% of patients and was 10.3 ± 3.8 (mean ± SD) years. The average patient age was 56 ± 15 years, and 76% were male. The ascending aorta was normal (5.0 cm) underwent replacement of the ascending aorta and were therefore excluded. Fifteen-year survival was 67%. During follow-up, 44 patients required reoperation, predominantly for aortic valve prosthesis failure. Twenty-two patients had long-term complications related to the ascending aorta: 18 required an operative procedure to replace the ascending aorta for an aortic aneurysm, 1 had aortic dissection, and 3 experienced sudden cardiac death. Fifteen-year freedom from ascending aorta-related complications was 86%, 81%, and 43% in patients with an aortic diameter of less than 4.0 cm, 4.0 to 4.4 cm, and 4.5 to 4.9 cm, respectively (P < .001).
- **Conclusions**: Patients undergoing operations for bicuspid aortic valve disease should be considered for concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta if the diameter is a concern.

### Patient selection for surgery vs surveillance in moderately dilated ascending aorta: Insights from Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance (TITAN:SVS), an international prospective trial [^112SJLzS]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Guidelines for treating ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAA) are largely based on single-center studies. To understand factors influencing patient selection for surgery vs surveillance, patient and aneurysm characteristics were compared for patients in the randomized and registry arms of a large prospective, multicenter, multinational trial.
- **Methods**: TITAN:SvS (Treatment in Thoracic Aortic aNeurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance) is a large prospective multicenter study of patients with ATAA between 5.0 and 5.4 cm, randomizing patients 1:1 to initial surgery vs surveillance. Nonrandomized patients are enrolled into a registry where results of operative or surveillance strategy can be monitored prospectively. Between 2018 and 2023, 615 patients were enrolled at 22 sites in the United States and Canada. Demographic and aneurysm characteristics were compared between randomized and registry arms.
- **Results**: Compared with randomized and operative registry groups, patients in the surveillance registry were older with more comorbidities. No significant differences were observed in maximal ascending aortic diameter (5.1 cm [interquartile range, 5.0–5.2 cm] vs 5.1 cm [interquartile range, 4.9–5.2 cm], P = 0.2) or other aneurysm characteristics. Despite similar numbers of enrolling centers in the United States (n = 11) and Canada (n = 12), Canadian patients were more likely to be randomized (58% vs 7%, P < .01) and less likely to be enrolled in the operative (9% vs 42%, P < .01) or surveillance registry (34% vs 51%).
