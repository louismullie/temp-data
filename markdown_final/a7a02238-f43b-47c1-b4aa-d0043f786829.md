## Question

Metoprolol pregnancy category

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pregnancy category of metoprolol and how to interpret its safety in pregnancy today. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical FDA pregnancy categories and when they changed. Then, I should verify what the current FDA Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR) says for metoprolol. Next, I will review human and animal safety data to contextualize risk. After that, I should check contemporary guideline positions to understand how metoprolol is used clinically in pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and clarify lactation considerations, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements along the way.

> Let me first confirm the historical framework. Metoprolol was historically assigned FDA Pregnancy Category C, which meant animal studies showed adverse effects and there were no adequate and well-controlled human studies; however, I need to ensure I don't overstate this because the FDA retired the A–X categories in 2015 and replaced them with the PLLR narrative format, so the old "Category C" designation is obsolete for new labeling even though it still appears in older documents [^112w5DXV] [^112tQRSW] [^112eB814] [^113x1UcK].

> Wait, let me verify the current FDA labeling language under PLLR. Multiple current FDA labels for metoprolol (tartrate and succinate) state that available observational human data have not demonstrated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with metoprolol use in pregnancy, while acknowledging inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with beta-blockers as a class; they also note animal data showing increased post-implantation loss and decreased neonatal survival at high multiples of human exposure, and emphasize that metoprolol crosses the placenta with potential neonatal effects such as bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression, warranting neonatal observation if used near delivery [^111tQTTE] [^115A4F2S] [^111tQTTE] [^116hiEPt] [^115rV5wv].

> Hold on, I should review the human data more closely. Large observational cohorts have not shown a signal for major congenital malformations with metoprolol, though some studies link beta-blocker exposure to small-for-gestational-age infants; importantly, many analyses are confounded by maternal hypertension itself, and a prospective cohort comparing second–third trimester metoprolol or bisoprolol exposure found higher rates of SGA and preterm birth versus methyldopa and nonhypertensive controls, suggesting a possible class effect on growth that may be modest and dose/duration related, with serious neonatal symptoms remaining uncommon [^111tQTTE] [^117Ki6jo] [^115VvSfM].

> I need to check guideline positions to reconcile any apparent contradictions. Contemporary hypertension guidelines generally prefer labetalol or extended-release nifedipine as first-line in pregnancy, while still allowing metoprolol as an acceptable alternative when clinically indicated; WHO includes beta-blockers among options for nonsevere hypertension, ESC guidance lists methyldopa, labetalol, and CCBs as preferred with metoprolol reasonable in selected contexts, and Canadian guidance explicitly includes metoprolol among initial monotherapy options for nonsevere hypertension, reflecting a risk–benefit balance that accepts metoprolol when first-line agents are unsuitable or unavailable [^112D6Tvk] [^113oxELQ] [^115hHiSK] [^116uZg84].

> Let me consider arrhythmia and heart failure contexts, because indications shift the calculus. For maternal tachyarrhythmias, expert consensus favors metoprolol or propranolol as first-line rate-control agents given their safety record, while avoiding atenolol due to stronger associations with fetal growth restriction; similarly, heart failure guidance allows beta-blockers, most commonly metoprolol, during pregnancy within multidisciplinary care, underscoring that maternal indications often justify continuation despite potential fetal growth effects [^111ZnXgH] [^112Kj33H] [^116iUXtJ].

> But wait, what about lactation and neonatal monitoring if metoprolol is used peripartum. I should confirm that metoprolol is present in breast milk at low relative infant doses (roughly 0.5–2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose) with no consistent reports of adverse infant effects, though slow maternal metabolizers warrant observation for neonatal bradycardia or hypoglycemia; labels also advise observing exposed neonates for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression if maternal therapy continued near delivery, aligning with clinical prudence [^117Q9ciV] [^1135DPPV] [^115rV5wv].

> I should double-check the practical prescribing stance. In pregnancy, metoprolol is not absolutely contraindicated; it is considered compatible when clinically indicated, with preference for the lowest effective dose, avoidance of abrupt withdrawal, and consideration of alternatives such as labetalol or nifedipine when feasible; if used, coordinate timing and dose adjustments with obstetrics and consider neonatal observation after birth, particularly if therapy was continued into late gestation [^112D6Tvk] [^116uZg84] [^115rV5wv].

> In summary, I need to ensure the historical versus current framing is precise. Historically, metoprolol carried a Category C designation, but under current PLLR labeling there is no letter category; instead, the label communicates that human data do not show increased major malformations, animal data show adverse reproductive effects at high exposures, and neonatal beta-blockade effects are possible, leading to a risk–benefit recommendation that supports use when clearly indicated, with monitoring and dose minimization, consistent with modern guideline positions [^112w5DXV] [^116rfRf2] [^112D6Tvk].

---

Metoprolol is **Category C** under the legacy FDA system [^112eB814], indicating that risk cannot be ruled out due to animal data showing fetal harm and limited human data [^112w5DXV]. Current FDA labeling uses the PLLR and states that observational data do not show major birth defects or miscarriage with metoprolol, but there are inconsistent reports of growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with beta-blockers; use only if clearly needed and monitor neonates for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression [^116MjPru] [^111tQTTE]. Metoprolol is not first-line in pregnancy; preferred agents are labetalol, methyldopa, or long-acting nifedipine, but metoprolol is acceptable when these are unsuitable or for arrhythmia control [^111FEZif] [^113oxELQ] [^112627ph].

---

## Historical FDA pregnancy category

Historically, metoprolol was classified as **Category C** [^112eB814], defined as: animal studies showing adverse fetal effects, with no adequate human studies; potential benefits may warrant use despite risks [^1149KpkG].

---

## Current FDA pregnancy labeling (PLLR)

In 2015, the FDA replaced letter categories with the **Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR)** [^112w5DXV], which provides narrative risk summaries and clinical considerations [^116MjPru]. Current metoprolol labeling states:

- **Human data**: Observational studies do not show increased major birth defects or miscarriage with metoprolol [^111tQTTE].

- **Animal data**: Rats showed increased post-implantation loss and decreased neonatal survival at 11–24× human doses; no teratogenicity observed [^116rfRf2] [^116hiEPt].

- **Clinical considerations**: Untreated hypertension/heart failure increases maternal/fetal risk; metoprolol crosses the placenta; neonates may have hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression — monitor accordingly [^116rfRf2] [^116MjPru].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines provide **practical recommendations** for metoprolol in pregnancy:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding metoprolol** |
|-|-|
| Hypertension Canada (2020) | - Metoprolol is an initial monotherapy option for nonsevere hypertension in pregnancy [^116uZg84] <br/> - Consider safer alternatives; use only if clearly needed [^11446Jt6] |
| ESC Guidelines (2018) | - Preferred agents: methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine <br/> - Beta-blockers, including metoprolol, are alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable [^notfound] |
| WHO Guidelines (2020) | - Beta-blockers, including metoprolol, are acceptable for nonsevere hypertension in pregnancy [^113oxELQ] |
| ACC/AHA/HRS SVT Guidelines (2016) | - Intravenous metoprolol is reasonable for acute SVT in pregnancy when adenosine is ineffective or contraindicated [^112627ph] |

---

## Clinical evidence and safety concerns

Evidence highlights the following **safety considerations**:

- **Fetal growth restriction**: Some observational data suggest increased risk of small-for-gestational-age infants with prolonged beta-blocker exposure, though confounding by maternal hypertension is possible [^117Ki6jo] [^115VvSfM].

- **Neonatal effects**: Neonates exposed in utero may have hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression; monitor for 24–48 hours after birth [^115rV5wv] [^116MjPru].

- **Teratogenicity**: No consistent evidence of major congenital malformations with metoprolol [^116rfRf2] [^111tQTTE].

---

## Comparison with other beta-blockers

Metoprolol is **preferred over atenolol**, which is associated with fetal growth restriction and lower birth weight; metoprolol has a more favorable safety profile in pregnancy [^111WkabW] [^117PMKXe].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Use labetalol, methyldopa, or long-acting nifedipine when possible [^116uZg84] [^112D6Tvk].

- **Second-line therapy**: Metoprolol is reasonable when first-line agents are unsuitable or for arrhythmia control [^116uZg84] [^112627ph].

- **Monitoring**: Observe neonates for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression if exposed in utero [^115rV5wv] [^116MjPru].

---

Metoprolol is **Category C** under the legacy FDA system and current PLLR labeling indicates no increased major birth defects or miscarriage, but inconsistent signals for growth restriction and perinatal mortality exist; use only if clearly needed, preferring alternatives when possible, and monitor neonates for adverse effects [^112eB814] [^115rV5wv] [^111tQTTE].

Pregnancy Category C

Upon confirming the diagnosis of pregnancy, women should immediately inform the doctor.

Metoprolol tartrate has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily human dose of 450 mg, when based on surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol tartrate is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to teratogenicity (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The amount of data on the use of metoprolol in pregnant women is limited. The risk to the fetus/mother is unknown. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Metoprolol tartrate is excreted in breast milk in a very small quantity. An infant consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than 1 mg of the drug.

Fertility

The effects of metoprolol tartrate on the fertility of human have not been studied.

Metoprolol tartrate showed effects on spermatogenesis in male rats at a therapeutic dose level, but had no effect on rates of conception at higher doses in animal fertility studies (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of metoprolol tartrate in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether patients over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to metoprolol tartrate. Other reported clinical experience in elderly hypertensive patients has not identified any difference in response from younger patients.

In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol tartrate in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol tartrate cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated an association of adverse developmental outcomes with maternal use of metoprolol during pregnancy (see Data). Untreated hypertension and myocardial infarction during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages of 500 mg/kg/day, approximately 11 times the daily dose of 450 mg in a 60­kg patient on a mg/m2basis.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical consideration

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^112B8Lbj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Untreated hypertension during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with metoprolol use during pregnancy. However, there are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with maternal use of beta blockers, including metoprolol, during pregnancy (see Data). There have been rare reports of jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances in infants exposed to thiazide medications during pregnancy.

In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages up to 24 times, on a mg/m2basis, the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient. The combination of metoprolol tartrate/hydrochlorothiazide administered to rats from mid-late gestation through lactation also produced increased post-implantation loss and decreased neonatal survival (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. There is a risk for preterm birth with pregnant women with chronic heart failure in 3rdtrimester of pregnancy.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Metoprolol crosses the placenta. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving metoprolol during pregnancy, may be at risk for hypotension, hypoglycemia, bradycardia, and respiratory depression. Observe neonates for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia and respiratory depression and manage accordingly.

Risk Summary

Untreated hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with metoprolol use during pregnancy. However, there are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with maternal use of beta-blockers, including metoprolol, during pregnancy (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages of 500 mg/kg/day, approximately 24 times the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient on a mg/m2basis.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical consideration

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^111ZnXgH]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

HRS 2023 — recommendation-specific supportive text for PACs and SVT medications in pregnancy: Occasionally, PACs are associated with intolerable symptoms during pregnancy and therapy is necessary; studies on treatment involve a beta-blocker, either metoprolol or propranolol, and atenolol is best avoided during pregnancy because it is associated with lower birth weight when compared with other agents. PACs are common during pregnancy and are very rarely associated with adverse events in the mother or the fetus and do not require treatment unless symptoms are intolerable for the mother; avoiding potential precipitating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, stimulants, and drugs with beta-agonist effects, can decrease the occurrence of PACs. Digoxin, metoprolol, propranolol, and verapamil are not teratogenic and have been used to prevent recurrent symptomatic SVT in pregnant patients; when necessary, the lowest-possible dose of beta-blockers should be used because they are associated with low birth weight, bradycardia, and neonatal hypoglycemia, and digoxin, metoprolol, and propranolol have a robust safety record during pregnancy and as such are favored as initial options prior to using calcium channel blockers.

Pregnancy and lactation — heart failure medication counseling notes that in 2015 the FDA adopted the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule retiring categories A through X and providing a descriptive risk summary; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are associated with multiple second- and third-trimester fetal harms and are, therefore, strictly contraindicated, and there are no specific data for ARNI or ivabradine. For mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, spironolactone has dose-dependent feminization findings in animal offspring with limited data for eplerenone. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) medications considered acceptable during pregnancy within multidisciplinary shared decision-making include furosemide, beta blockers (most commonly metoprolol), hydralazine, and nitrates. Regarding lactation, breastfeeding may be associated with LV recovery; postpartum women who breastfeed can start ACEi (enalapril or captopril preferred), metoprolol remains the preferred beta blocker, and a medication safety resource is available via LactMed.

Risk Summary

Untreated hypertension during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with metoprolol use during pregnancy. However, there are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with maternal use of beta blockers, including metoprolol, during pregnancy (see Data). There have been rare reports of jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances in infants exposed to thiazide medications during pregnancy.

In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages up to 24 times, on a mg/m2basis, the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient. The combination of metoprolol tartrate/hydrochlorothiazide administered to rats from mid-late gestation through lactation also produced increased post-implantation loss and decreased neonatal survival (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Pregnancy outcome after first trimester exposure to bisoprolol: an observational cohort study [^114keGaa]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta-blockers are frequently used during pregnancy, with labetalol and metoprolol being considered as drugs of choice. As there are no prospective pregnancy studies for bisoprolol yet, our aim was to analyze pregnancy outcomes after bisoprolol exposure.

Methods

Pregnancies exposed to bisoprolol during the first trimester were retrieved from the German Embryotox pharmacovigilance database. Pregnancy outcomes of prospectively ascertained pregnancies were compared with women neither exposed to beta-blockers nor other antihypertensives. In addition, retrospective reports on adverse drug reactions were screened for patterns of birth defects.

Results

Inclusion criteria for the prospective study were met by 339 bisoprolol-treated women and 678 patients in the comparison cohort. Neither the risk for spontaneous abortions [adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj.) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–1.70] nor for major congenital malformations [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj.) 0.77; 95% CI 0.34–1.75] was increased after first trimester bisoprolol treatment. However, higher rates of preterm births [ORadj. 1.90; 95% CI 1.17–3.11] and reduced birthweights in singleton pregnancies (adjusted standard deviation score difference -0.48; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.34) were noted. Continued treatment with beta-blockers until birth was found to be associated with a higher risk for growth restriction than first trimester exposure only. A sensitivity analysis did not suggest higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in hypertensive women on bisoprolol compared with nonhypertensive bisoprolol-exposed women.

Conclusion

Our study supports the hypothesis that first trimester bisoprolol treatment does not increase the risk for spontaneous abortions or major birth defects. However, an influence of prolonged bisoprolol exposure on fetal growth cannot be ruled out.

Lactation and beta-blocker selection — nadolol risk and preferred alternatives. During lactation, special consideration should be given to medications that may adversely affect the newborn, as some drugs safe in pregnancy have metabolism and concentrations in breast milk that are concerning. Nadolol has a high concentration in breast milk, and excretion of beta-blockers into breast milk is largely determined by protein binding; based on protein binding and renal excretion, nadolol presents a high risk for accumulation in infants. If clinically acceptable for the maternal cardiac indication, propranolol or metoprolol might be preferred over nadolol in breastfeeding. If there are no efficacious and safe alternatives, lactation may need to be avoided or monitored closely for potential side effects such as excess bradycardia, with decisions made through shared decision-making.

### Neonatal effects of intrauterine metoprolol / bisoprolol exposure during the second and third trimester: a cohort study with two comparison groups [^117Ki6jo]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of beta-blockers during the second and third trimester on fetal growth, length of gestation and postnatal symptoms in exposed infants.

Methods

The current prospective observational cohort study compares 294 neonates of hypertensive mothers on metoprolol or bisoprolol during the second and/or third trimester with 225 methyldopa-exposed infants and 588 infants of nonhypertensive mothers. The risks for reduced birth weight, prematurity, neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycaemia and respiratory disorders were analysed.

Results

The rate of small-for-gestational-age children was significantly higher in long-term beta-blocker exposed infants (24.1%) compared with the methyldopa cohort [10.2%, odds ratio (OR)adj 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.2] and the nonhypertensive cohort (9.9%, ORadj 4.3, 95% CI 2.6–7.1). The risk for preterm birth was significantly increased compared with nonhypertensive pregnancies (ORadj 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8) but not compared with the methyldopa cohort. Neonatal adverse outcomes occurred more frequently in the study cohort (11.5%) compared with the nonhypertensive comparison group (6.5%) and the methyldopa cohort (8.4%), but without statistical significance (ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.0 and ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.3, respectively).

Conclusion

Long-term intrauterine exposure to metoprolol or bisoprolol may increase the risk of being born small-for-gestational-age. It is still a matter of debate to which extent maternal hypertension contributes to the lower birth weight. Serious neonatal symptoms are rare. Altogether, metoprolol and bisoprolol are well tolerated treatment options, but a case-by-case decision on close neonatal monitoring is recommended.

### Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy: a critical review of adult guideline recommendations [^116T597X]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in pregnancy as presented by 25 national/international guidelines developed for the management of arterial hypertension in adults. There is a general consensus that oral α-methyldopa and parenteral labetalol are the drugs of choice for nonsevere and severe hypertension in pregnancy, respectively. Long-acting nifedipine is recommended by various guidelines as an alternative for first-line and second-line therapy in nonsevere and severe hypertension. The safety of β-blockers, atenolol in particular, in early and late stages of pregnancy is unresolved; their use is contraindicated according to several guidelines. Diuretic-associated harmful effects on maternal and fetal outcomes are controversial: their use is discouraged in pregnancy. It is important to develop specific guidelines for treating hypertension in special groups such as adult females of childbearing age and sexually active female adolescents to minimize the risk of adverse effects of drugs on the fetus. In several guidelines, the antihypertensive classes, recommended drug(s), intended drug formulation, and route of administration are not explicit. These omissions should be addressed in future guideline revisions in order to enhance the guidelines' utility and credibility in clinical practice.

Pregnancy — AF management recommendations (class/level): Class 1 (B-NR) — In pregnant patients with AF, DCCV is safe for the patient and fetus and should be performed in the same manner as in patients who are not pregnant. Class 2b (C-LD) — In pregnant individuals with structurally normal hearts and hemodynamically stable AF, pharmacological cardioversion with agents with history of safe use in pregnancy, such as intravenous procainamide, may be considered. Class 2a (C-LD) — In pregnant individuals with AF and without structural heart disease, antiarrhythmic agents with history of safe use in pregnancy (eg, flecainide and sotalol) are reasonable for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Class 2a (B-NR) — In pregnant individuals with persistent AF, rate-control agents with a record of safety in pregnancy, such as beta blockers (eg, propranolol or metoprolol) and digoxin, either alone or in combination with beta blockers, are reasonable as first-line agents. Class 2b (C-LD) — Pregnant individuals with AF and elevated risk of stroke may be considered for anticoagulation with the recognition that no anticoagulation strategy is completely safe for both the mother and fetus, and an SDM discussion should take place regarding risks to both mother and fetus (Table 28).

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111EY81o]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Safety of cardiac medications during pregnancy and lactation — selected agents are categorized and qualified as follows: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy is listed as Category D and not for use in nursing, with Benazepril, captopril, or enalapril may be considered during breastfeeding and Candesartan and losartan: risk during breastfeeding cannot be ruled out. Among β-blockers, metoprolol succinate is Category C with caution and may cause fetal bradycardia, growth retardation, hypoglycemia, while carvedilol is Category C and not for use in nursing with risk during breastfeeding cannot be ruled out. For aldosterone antagonist therapy, the table notes potential fetal androgenic effects; spironolactone is Category C and not for use in nursing though compatible with breastfeeding‡, and eplerenone is Category B with caution and risk during breastfeeding cannot be ruled out. Diuretic agents are Category C with caution and may cause reduced fetal blood flow, and furosemide risk during breastfeeding cannot be ruled out. Anticoagulation entries include warfarin as Category X with the note Category D during pregnancy if mechanic heart valve present, and intravenous heparin as Category C with caution and compatible with breastfeeding. Vasodilator and vasoactive examples include nitroprusside Category C, not for use in nursing, with risk of cyanide toxicity, and dopamine Category C with caution and may alter milk production/composition, while epinephrine is Category C with caution and risk during breastfeeding cannot be ruled out.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^115VvSfM]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Beta-blockers in pregnancy — fetal growth and continuation of therapy. Maternal therapy with beta-blockers during pregnancy has been associated with intrauterine fetal growth restriction, although many studies included patients with hypertensive disorders where growth could be affected by the underlying condition rather than the drug; a study of beta-blockers for maternal cardiac conditions showed a significant effect on fetal growth after adjusting for confounders. Atenolol had a former United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) risk category D rating for use during pregnancy, but a more recent study reported birth weight reduction associated with beta-blockers to be less than 200 grams and not of great clinical consequence in most instances. In potentially life-threatening scenarios, a maternal indication takes priority over potential fetal growth-restriction concerns, and beta-blocker therapy should be continued during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Arrhythmias in pregnancy [^111JKwoW]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Increasing maternal mortality and incidence of arrhythmias in pregnancy have been noted over the past 2 decades in the United States. Pregnancy is associated with a greater risk of arrhythmias, and patients with a history of arrhythmias are at significant risk of arrhythmia recurrence during pregnancy. The incidence of atrial fibrillation in pregnancy is rising. This review discusses the management of tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias in pregnancy, including management of cardiac arrest. Management of fetal arrhythmias are also reviewed. For patients without structural heart disease, β-blocker therapy, especially propranolol and metoprolol, and antiarrhythmic drugs, such as flecainide and sotalol, can be safely used to treat tachyarrhythmias. As a last resort, catheter ablation with minimal fluoroscopy can be performed. Device implantation can be safely performed with minimal fluoroscopy and under echocardiographic or ultrasound guidance in patients with clear indications for devices during pregnancy. Because of rising maternal mortality in the United States, which is partly driven by increasing maternal age and comorbidities, a multidisciplinary and/or integrative approach to arrhythmia management from the prepartum to the postpartum period is needed.

Alternative pharmacologic options when adenosine is contraindicated or ineffective: When additional intravenous nodal blocking agents are needed, intravenous metoprolol or propranolol have the most robust safety, and intravenous beta-blockers are an alternative treatment for acute SVT; experience with intravenous calcium channel blockers is less robust and, given the potential for hypotension, these agents are generally used in patients who are refractory or with contraindication to adenosine and beta-blockers; procainamide and digoxin also remain options in these cases.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy hypertension — common oral antihypertensive agents and dosing: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; it has potential bronchoconstrictive effects and should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine (extended release) is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally of an extended- release preparation and commonly initiated at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, though it may not be as effective as other medications — especially in control of severe hypertension — and use is limited by side effects (sedation, depression, dizziness). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily is considered a second- or third-line agent.

Antihypertensive selection in pregnancy — first-line therapy and safety — notes that when therapy is indicated in individuals planning pregnancy or who become pregnant, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are the preferred first-line agents; among them, no specific agent is preferred due to lack of comparative data. BB and CCB appear more effective than methyldopa for prevention of severe hypertension. Available data indicate amlodipine does not appear to be associated with a heightened risk of major congenital malformations, whereas atenolol has been associated with growth restriction and lower fetal weight and should be avoided in pregnancy.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: living with uncertainty [^113L17Mv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The practitioner is faced with the challenge of prescribing (or continuing) antihypertensive medications, which may be beneficial for the mother but are of unclear benefit for the fetus. The drugs most commonly used — methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine — are widely accepted as safe in pregnancy, based on many years of experience, observational data from large databases, and meta‐analyses of multiple small clinical trials. A recent comprehensive systematic review of published studies addressing adverse outcomes in children with in utero exposure to antihypertensive medications 6 found 47 studies eligible for inclusion, and only 5 were considered of excellent quality. Although several studies reported increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital malformations in treated patients compared with normotensive untreated reference groups, these adverse effects were not uniformly observed in different studies within the same class of medication. Similar adverse events were also observed in untreated hypertensive women. The conclusions of the authors were that although there is no compelling evidence for teratogenicity of most antihypertensive agents, the methodological weakness of the evidence prevents definitive answers about the safety of these drugs, even when including studies with hundreds of thousands of participants. 6

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111WkabW]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease (VHD) — medical therapy during pregnancy identifies that in pregnant women with VHD, beta-blocker medications are reasonable as required for heart rate control or treatment of arrhythmias (2a C-LD), and in pregnant women with VHD and HF symptoms (Stage D), diuretic medications are reasonable if needed for volume overload (2a C-LD); in contrast, in pregnant women with VHD, ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be given because of fetal risk (3: Harm B-NR). Maternal use of beta blockers has been associated with a newborn birth weight approximately 100 g lower than that of newborns whose mothers did not take beta blockers, the use of beta blockers with beta-1 selectivity avoids the beta-2 effects on uterine relaxation, and the incidence of fetal growth retardation is lower with metoprolol treatment than with atenolol treatment in pregnancy. For diuretics, reduction of volume overload must be balanced against the reduction in placental blood flow, and data from ROPAC suggested maternal diuretic use was associated with rates of low birth weight and fetal mortality that were higher than for women not taking any medications. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are strongly associated with fetal malformations when used by women during pregnancy.

### Mitral valve prolapse: arrhythmic risk during pregnancy and postpartum [^11564ZRT]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Female sex hormones, especially oestrogen, affect cardiac repolarization causing QT prolongation, which is an expected observation in normal pregnancy. Interestingly, patients with AMVP tend to have longer QT than unselected patients with MVP, suggesting a similar vulnerability to the changes in the hormonal levels, possibly influencing the risk of VA.

Pregnancy is also associated with altered pharmacokinetics of many medicationsin a progressive manner throughout pregnancy stages, which could explain the increased incidence of arrhythmic events seen in our study. Of interest, pregnancy is associated with increased activity of CYP2D6, which metabolizes many anti-arrhythmic drugs, including metoprolol, flecainide, and mexiletine. However, despite lower plasma concentrations of metoprolol during pregnancy, the chronotropic effect seems to be greater during pregnancy, suggesting altered sensitivity to metoprolol due to predominant sympathetic drive at rest during pregnancy.

Management implications

Thus far, guidance for the management of pregnant women with AMVP has been based on a limited number of case reports and expert opinions. Our findings have important implications that can inform the management of this complex clinical scenario and generate initial evidence to guide pre-conception counselling and arrhythmia surveillance during pregnancy. Women with AMVP who wish to become pregnant and their physicians should be aware of a potentially increased arrhythmic risk as observed in our study. In response, intensified arrhythmia surveillance approaches may be considered, aiming to capture precursors of malignant VAs such as high-risk PVCs and non-sustained VT. Finally, further studies should explore if a lower threshold for primary preventive ICD implantation should be considered in high-risk patients as part of pre-conception counselling. Furthermore, it is unknown whether surgical repair or replacement of severe mitral regurgitation decreases arrhythmic risk in AMVP patients. Whether prophylactic anti-arrhythmic drug therapy during pregnancy may be advisable in AMVP patients is yet to be explored. Both treating cardiologists and pregnant women may be reluctant towards anti-arrhythmic drugs due to possible risk to the foetus and mother. However, metoprolol, flecainide, and quinidine have long records of safety during pregnancy with minimal teratogenic effects and low foetal and maternal risk. These complex decisions are best made under the care of clinicians with expertise in AMVP in collaboration with maternal–foetal medicine in tertiary care centres. While the retrospective case series nature of our report does not allow management recommendations, these data may provide general guidance for nuanced shared decision-making between patients and clinicians.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol) [^117Q9ciV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited available data from published literature report that metoprolol is present in human milk. The estimated daily infant dose of metoprolol received from breastmilk range from 0.05 mg to less than 1 mg. The estimated relative infant dosage was 0.5% to 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage (see Data). No adverse reactions of metoprolol on the breastfed infant have been identified. There is no information regarding the effects of metoprolol on milk production.

Clinical consideration

Monitoring for adverse reactions

For a lactating woman who is a slow metabolizer of metoprolol, monitor the breastfed infant for bradycardia and other symptoms of beta blockade such as dry mouth, skin or eyes, diarrhea or constipation. In a report of 6 mothers taking metoprolol, none reported adverse effects in her breastfed infant.

Data

Limited published cases estimate the infant daily dose of metoprolol received from breast milk range from 0.05 mg to less than 1 mg.

In 2 women who were taking unspecified amount of metoprolol, milk samples were taken after one dose of metoprolol. The estimated amount of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in breast milk is reported to be less than 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

In a small study, breast milk was collected every 2 hours to 3 hours over one dosage interval, in three mothers (at least 3 months postpartum) who took metoprolol of unspecified amount. The average amount of metoprolol present in breast milk was 71.5 mcg/day (range 17.0 to 158.7). The average relative infant dosage was 0.5% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Risk Summary

Based on the published literature, beta blockers (including metoprolol) may cause erectile dysfunction and inhibit sperm motility. In animal fertility studies, metoprolol has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose level of 3.5 mg/kg in rats, which would correspond to a dose of 34 mg/day in humans in mg/m2equivalent, although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol on reproductive performance in male rats.

No evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol was observed in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Isoproterenol as an adjunct for treatment of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation storm in a pregnant woman [^115SJtzx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation is a rare entity seen in a very small subset of patients presenting to the emergency department. Management of ventricular arrhythmias in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women, but special consideration is given to avoid adverse fetal effects when selecting antiarrhythmic agents. Electrical defibrillation is the intervention of choice in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients with ventricular fibrillation of all etiologies. This was not associated with any significant adverse effects for mother or fetus. Although lidocaine and sotalol are Food and Drug Administration category B antiarrhythmics used in pregnancy, Food and Drug Administration category C antiarrhythmics such as β-blockers and category D drugs such as amiodarone can be used as pharmacologic adjuncts to facilitate termination of recurrent ventricular fibrillation where other agents have failed. Isoproterenol has been used to terminate recurrent ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome and torsades de pointes resistant to magnesium therapy. This case report describes a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman with recurrent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation that failed to respond to standard therapy including electrical defibrillation, intravenous lidocaine, metoprolol, and amiodarone but eventually terminated with isoproterenol infusion.

Levothyroxine therapy may be beneficial, at least transiently, for women with symptomatic hypothyroidism or those having TSH levels > 10 mU/L, and because propranolol and metoprolol are secreted into breast milk in only very low amounts, no special monitoring is needed for breastfed infants of mothers on these medications. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Hypertension and pregnancy — For individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are preferred agents (COR 1, LOE A). Individuals in this population should be counseled about the benefits of low-dose (81 mg/d) aspirin to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae (COR 1, LOE B-R). Pregnant individuals with SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg confirmed on repeat measurement within 15 minutes should receive antihypertensive medication to lower BP to < 160/ < 110 mm Hg within 30 to 60 minutes to prevent adverse events (COR 1, LOE B-R). Pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (COR 1, LOE B-R). Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart before 20 weeks' gestation. Individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant should not be treated with atenolol, ACEI, ARB, direct renin inhibitor, or MRA to avoid fetal harm (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD).

### Safety of β-blocker and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy: a mendelian randomization study [^111NSUtY]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the current absence of robust RCT data in pregnancy, large-scale observational data have been used to inform clinical practice. In confounder-adjusted analyses of almost 380,000 singleton pregnancies from an ethnically diverse American cohort, use of labetalol was associated with an increased likelihood of a small for gestational age birth. Our results are consistent with this finding, thus highlighting the importance of ongoing pharmacovigilance. Furthermore, recent individual participant meta-analysis data outside of pregnancy show that over 4.5 years, BB use increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes while CCB use does not. This propensity of BB use to increase diabetes liability was also supported in our current study. Given that genetically-proxied CCB use was not associated with either reduced birthweight category or an increased risk of gestational diabetes, our findings suggest that CCBs may be preferred to BBs in the management of hypertension in pregnancy.

A limitation of leveraging genetic variants to investigate drug effects in pregnancy is that they exert small lifelong effects, whereas pharmacological interventions typically exert effects of larger magnitude but over a discrete period of the life course. For this reason, MR analysis should only be used to identify potential clinical effects, but not to infer their magnitude. Furthermore, our analysis may have been limited by low statistical power, which can be gauged by the confidence intervals of our MR estimates. There is also the theoretical possibility that genetic variants used to proxy the exposures may also be exerting pleiotropic effects through the off-spring, thus biassing the MR results. In addition, as this study was performed using data from European ancestry populations, the results may not be generalizable to populations of other ancestral backgrounds. Our main SBP GWAS considered both male and female participants, whereas the outcome datasets are in females. To address this, we repeated our analysis using SBP GWAS in females only. Findings were similar when we restricted our exposure dataset to female participants. This female-only GWAS did not adjust for body mass index or correct for antihypertensive medication use (as our main SBP GWAS did), so these findings also demonstrate robustness against the choice of GWAS covariates. Finally, the considered outcome of birthweight was not adjusted by gestational age at birth. This means that the 'low birthweight' category may include both infants who are small for-gestational age or born preterm. Nevertheless, these are both important outcomes of interest as they are known foetal adverse effects of maternal hypertension in pregnancy.

### Oral antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension: systematic review, network meta-and trial sequential analyses [^112j87pt]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

It is unsurprising that antihypertensive therapy outperforms, by a large margin, placebo/no therapy in lowering BP. Many national and international guidelines now recommend that practitioners offer antihypertensive therapy to women to normalize BP in pregnancy. Notwithstanding neonatal concerns, it may be reasonable to recommend first-line therapy with labetalol, given the additional potential benefits of reduced proteinuria/preeclampsia and perinatal death. Other reasonable antihypertensive choices include β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, labetalol, methyldopa, or multi-drug therapy, choices that make more likely that a hypertensive pregnant woman, regardless of the care setting, would have access to an antihypertensive drug.

Our findings are consistent with traditional meta-analysis that has refuted an association between β-blockers and fetal growth restriction. Notwithstanding, concerns about atenolol remain; this drug was not analyzed separately from β-blockers in this NMA, but was in another that examined antihypertensives for treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy, showing an association with SGA. There are many other beta-blockers available for use worldwide. Importantly, the pattern of contrary effects of antihypertensives on SGA and preterm birth, with no overall effect on neonatal morbidity (as measured by neonatal care unit admission), mirrors findings from the Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study trial.

### Safety of β-blocker and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy: a mendelian randomization study [^113inPiu]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We leveraged genetic variants mimicking BB and CCB drug classes to investigate their respective effects on pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, gestational diabetes and birthweight. Our results support the assertion that BB antihypertensive drugs may lower birthweight, by providing consistent results in MR analysis and evidence of a shared causal variant in colocalization analysis. Caution and pharmacovigilance may therefore be warranted regarding use of BB antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy. Conversely, our genetic evidence supported that CCB reduced risk of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, but had no apparent impact on birthweight category or gestational diabetes. CCBs may therefore be the preferred first-line agent to treat hypertension in pregnancy, because of a potentially superior safety profile (Table 2).

Treatment of mild hypertension in pregnancy has been shown to lead to lower risk of adverse maternal outcomes in a recent RCT. In this study, the majority of patients were given labetalol or nifedipine as the first-line antihypertensive agent. These antihypertensive drugs, BB and CCB agents respectively, are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK as first- and second-line agents for hypertension in pregnancy. However, evidence regarding their comparative safety and efficacy is scarce. Historically, ethical concerns surrounding RCTs in pregnancy have precluded their implementation, especially in the setting of primary prevention. Where RCTs have been undertaken, they often lack sufficient enrolment to detect adverse effects. For the outcome of birthweight, a trial sequential analysis suggested that 7030 participants would be required to run an adequately powered trial comparing labetalol to nifedipine. Such recruitment has not previously been reached in RCTs in this field. Considering the increasing prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy and the severity of the related adverse outcomes, the lack of evidence represents a major obstacle towards optimising clinical practice.

### Review of cardiovascular drugs in pregnancy [^1169QB9X]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States. Increasing maternal mortality in the United States underscores the importance of proper cardiovascular management. Significant physiological changes during pregnancy affect the heart's ability to respond to pathological processes such as hypertension and heart failure. These physiological changes further affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cardiac medications. During pregnancy, these changes can significantly alter medication efficacy and metabolism. This article systematically reviews the literature on safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs used for hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy and lactation. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines recommend transitioning pregnant patients to methyldopa, nifedipine, or labetalol. Heart failure medications, including beta-blockers, furosemide, and digoxin, are relatively safe and can be used effectively. Medications that block the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system have been shown to be beneficial in the general population; however, they are teratogenic and, therefore, contraindicated in pregnancy. Cardiovascular medications can also enter breast milk and, therefore, care must be taken when selecting drugs during the lactation period. A summary of the safety of drugs during pregnancy and lactation from an online resource, LactMed by the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET database, is included. High-risk pregnant patients with cardiovascular disease require a multispecialty team of doctors, including health care providers from obstetrics and gynecology, maternal fetal medicine, internal medicine, cardiovascular disease specialists, and specialized pharmacology expertise.

### Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) [^1135DPPV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited available data from published literature report that metoprolol is present in human milk. The estimated daily infant dose of metoprolol received from breastmilk ranges from 0.05 mg to less than 1 mg. The estimated relative infant dosage was 0.5% to 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage (see Data). No adverse reactions of metoprolol on the breastfed infant have been identified. There is no information regarding the effects of metoprolol on milk production.

Clinical consideration

Monitoring for adverse reactions

For a lactating woman who is a slow metabolizer of metoprolol, monitor the breastfed infant for bradycardia and other symptoms of beta blockade such as dry mouth, skin or eyes, diarrhea or constipation. In a report of 6 mothers taking metoprolol, none reported adverse effects in her breastfed infant.

Data

Limited published cases estimate the infant daily dose of metoprolol received from breast milk range from 0.05 mg to less than 1 mg.

In 2 women who were taking unspecified amount of metoprolol, milk samples were taken after one dose of metoprolol. The estimated amount of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in breast milk is reported to be less than 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

In a small study, breast milk was collected every 2 to 3 hours over one dosage interval, in three mothers (at least 3 months postpartum) who took metoprolol of unspecified amount. The average amount of metoprolol present in breast milk was 71.5 mcg/day (range 17.0 mcg to 158.7 mcg). The average relative infant dosage was 0.5% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Risk Summary

Based on the published literature, beta blockers (including metoprolol) may cause erectile dysfunction and inhibit sperm motility. In animal fertility studies, metoprolol has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose level of 3.5 mg/kg in rats, which would correspond to a dose of 34 mg/day in humans in mg/m2equivalent, although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol on reproductive performance in male rats.

No evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol was observed in rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of LOPRESSOR have not been established in pediatric patients.

Hypertension and pregnancy — chronic hypertension management and target: COR 1 states that pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension (defined as prepregnancy hypertension or SBP 140–159 mm Hg and/or DBP 90–109 mm Hg prior to 20 weeks gestation) should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: living with uncertainty [^111ynjK2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Clinical management is challenging; strategies that are standard of care in nonpregnant individuals, such as lowering blood pressure (BP) to 120/80 mm Hg, may be beneficial for maternal health 1 but must be considered carefully in the context of possible teratogenicity of medications if taken in early pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the impact of drugs on blood flow and placental perfusion must be addressed. Even if medications are not teratogenic, less easily detected effects on placental and fetal growth and metabolism are important. That said, and regardless of etiology, severe hypertension — defined as 160/110 mm Hg — is associated with serious maternal morbidity and mortality, and treatment with antihypertensive drugs is almost always indicated. 2, 3 What remains unclear, although currently under investigation, is whether the treatment is worse than the disease in pregnancies complicated by "mild to moderate" hypertension (140–159/90–109 mm Hg). Lowering BP in women with less severe, so‐called mild to moderate hypertension is not routine practice in the United States, although it may be appropriate in some women with chronic hypertension, depending on maternal symptoms, acuity of the BP increase, comorbidities, and gestational age. 2 At present, some evidence suggests that antihypertensive treatment in women with mild to moderate chronic or gestational hypertension may prevent the development of severe hypertension, 4 and retrospective data suggest that lower BP is associated with better pregnancy outcomes. 5 The existing data have not demonstrated an association of treatment to lower BP targets with fetal benefit, although published trials were underpowered to detect changes in fetal death. Consequently, we are left with uncertainty regarding the impact of antihypertensive therapy on fetal growth and long‐term health. Guidelines for treatment of hypertension in pregnancy vary among geographic regions of the world except all agree that treatment of severe hypertension is indicated. 2, 3

8.2. Gestational diabetes

- Discontinue insulin therapy immediately after the birth in women who were diagnosed with GD; test their blood glucose to exclude persisting hyperglycemia before transfer to community care, and remind them of the symptoms of hyperglycemia.

- Offer lifestyle advice (on weight control, diet, and exercise) and an OGTT performed with 75 g glucose load six weeks after delivery, adopting WHO's criteria for diabetes out of pregnancy, that is a fasting glycemia = 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) and/or glycemia = 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) two hours after the glucose load. Patients who present a fasting glycemia between 100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/l) and 125 mg/dl (6.94 mmol/l) are classified as having an impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and those who present a glycemia between 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) and 199 mg/dl (11.06 mmol/l) two hours after glucose load, are considered as having an impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). If the test is normal consider performing at least a fasting plasma glucose measurement annually thereafter (B). Levels of HbA 1c higher than 6.5% should be considered as diagnostic of diabetes. Provide information about the risk of GD in future pregnancies, offer screening for diabetes when planning future pregnancies, and indicate early OGTT in future pregnancies and also self monitoring blood glucose.

8.3. Treatment of co-morbidities after delivery

- **Lipid Therapy**: Statins and fibrates should not be used during breastfeeding because they pass through breast milk and due to the potential for adverse effects to the infant (manufacturers' reports). When triglycerides levels are above 1000 mg/dl (55.55 mmol/l) in the presence of an appropriate diet, due to the high risk of pancreatitis, niacin, fish oil (free of mercury) or quitting breastfeeding should be considered.

- **Antihypertensive Therapy**: Use of ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, low dose thiazides and Methyldopa during breastfeeding, even being transferred to the milk in small amounts, are safe. Atenolol has been associated with bradycardia and hypotension in infants. Propranolol and metoprolol could be indicated but infants should be monitored for manifestations of beta-blockade (C).

### Teen pregnancy in the setting of familial dilated cardiomyopathy: a case report [^114skVbj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Known FDC does allow providers an advantage in that proper care can ideally be delivered from the preconception period onward. This was not applicable in our case due to late onset of prenatal care. Fortunately, despite sub-optimal prenatal care and follow up, our patient successfully delivered a healthy child with minimal intrapartum or postpartum complications. This circumstance provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of contraception counseling upon the onset of menses, more likely to be encountered by pediatric providers for these patients. The American Association of Pediatrics recommends that adolescent contraceptive needs be addressed in the primary care setting. However, the proportion of providers who discuss contraception with patients is varying.

For an adolescent to seek out preconception counseling is unlikely as in our case, but if applicable, FDC patients would benefit from this counseling. If pregnancy is found in the first or second trimester, appropriate care would involve a discussion with the patient of the risks and benefits of continuation of the pregnancy based on her clinical status and her management options. Regardless of decision, at initial diagnosis of pregnancy, medication reconciliation is necessary. In our case, the patient was not compliant with her regimen of enalapril, furosemide, aspirin, spironolactone, and metoprolol, a potential explanation for the lack of observed adverse effects. Of these medication classes, ACEI are contraindicated due to risks of teratogenicity, fetal renal failure, and neonatal death and spironolactone is not advised due to anti-androgen activity leading to feminization of males in limited animal studies. Diuretics and selective beta blockers such as metoprolol are noted to be relatively safe and can be considered after weighing maternal and neonatal risks and benefits. There are no specific imaging guidelines but a baseline echocardiogram and repeat scan each trimester is a reasonable approach to evaluate adaptation to pregnancy hemodynamics and to assist in delivery planning. Formation of a multi-disciplinary care delivery plan between the primary OB-GYN, maternal–fetal medicine, cardiology, anesthesia, and nursing is also beneficial in mitigating risk and optimizing outcomes.

Pregnancy-related aspects

Focusing on special requirements for women in pregnancy, the 2017 ACC/AHA report provided the following statements: (1) BP usually declines during the first trimester of pregnancy and then slowly rises, (2) the classification of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy included, (i) the newly pregnant mother with existing hypertension; (ii) incident hypertension; (iii) preeclampsia; and (iv) severe hypertension, (3) hypertension during pregnancy and preeclampsia are recognized as risk factors for future hypertension and cardiovascular disease, (4) the goal of antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy includes prevention of severe hypertension and prolonging gestation to allow the fetus more time to mature, (5) treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduces the risk of developing severe hypertension, but has not be shown to prevent adverse pregnancy outcome including preeclampsia, (6) beta blockers (mainly labetalol) and calcium channel blockers (mainly nifedipine) appear superior to methyldopa in preventing preeclampsia, (7) it is recommended to screen all pregnant women for preeclampsia by measuring BP at every prenatal visit, (8) women with hypertension who become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, should be transitioned to methyldopa, nifedipine, and/or labetalol, (9) women with hypertension who become pregnant should not be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors, (10) aspirin and magnesium should be used according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists task force report, while reference is made to another report detailing treatment of hypertensive emergencies during pregnancy and postpartum.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^114syEP6]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Arrhythmia management during pregnancy — drug therapy principles state that the approach to evaluation is similar to that in nonpregnant patients, with a primary goal to optimize treatment for the mother without compromising fetal safety, and that factors unique to pregnancy include physiological changes and medication effects on placental blood flow, breastfeeding, and the developing fetus. Very few drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy, many are compatible with breastfeeding, and periodic reevaluation for continued need, including monitoring of levels and evaluation of the mother and infant for potential side effects, is best practice. If drug therapy is initiated, it is important to use the minimal number of drugs at the lowest effective dose, limit choices to those with a history of "reasonable safety profile" during pregnancy, and note that a majority of antiarrhythmic medications fall into the former FDA risk category C for pregnancy; drugs with limited experience during pregnancy may be administered after weighing risk versus benefit. When administering drugs with proarrhythmic potential, FDA-mandated precautions are generally observed as in nonpregnant patients, including dose adjustments for physiological changes such as renal function, and the FDA has replaced the alphabetic risk categories with the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule.

### The effect of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus [^111G55ov]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

A critical review of the literature on the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus in pregnant women is presented. The survey covers the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, beta-blockers including topical eye medications, alpha-beta blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The lack of data on angiotensin II receptor blockers is noted although effects are considered to be similar to those reported with ACE inhibitors and therefore to be avoided. Analysis of the literature underscores that some antihypertensive drugs can be used safely at certain stages of pregnancy, while others are suspect and to be avoided at all costs. The lack of placebo-controlled studies on the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy due to ethical considerations is discussed against the background of the pressing need to treat these women despite the possible deleterious effects of antihypertensive drugs.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide (Lopressor HCT) [^112qeVfR]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of LOPRESSOR HCT in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, data are available on the individual components of LOPRESSOR HCT. Available data from published literature on metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide report that each drug is present in human milk (see Data). There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metoprolol or hydrochlorothiazide during lactation. Doses of hydrochlorothiazide associated with clinically significant diuresis have been associated with impaired milk production. There is no information regarding the effects of metoprolol on milk production. Monitor infants exposed to LOPRESSOR HCT though breastmilk for drowsiness or poor feeding (see Clinical Considerations).

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LOPRESSOR HCT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from LOPRESSOR HCT or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor the breastfed infant for bradycardia or somnolence.

Data

Metoprolol

Based on published case reports, the estimated daily infant dose of metoprolol received from breastmilk ranged from 0.05 mg to less than 1 mg. The estimated relative infant dosage was 0.5% to 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

In two women who were taking unspecified amount of metoprolol, milk samples were taken after one dose of metoprolol. The estimated amount of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in breast milk is reported to be less than 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

In a small study, breast milk was collected every 2 to 3 hours over one dosage interval, in three mothers (at least 3 months postpartum) who took metoprolol of unspecified amount. The average amount of metoprolol present in breast milk was 71.5 mcg/day (range 17.0 to 158.7). The average relative infant dosage was 0.5% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.

Hydrochlorothiazide

A single study involving one woman and her infant showed a peak concentration of 275 mcg/L at 3 hours following 50 mg dose. No drug was detected (< 20 mcg/L) in the infant's plasma at 2- and 11-hours following mother's dose.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^114eNqiz]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension in Pregnancy and Breast feeding

Hypertension complicates 5% to 7% of all pregnancies. A subset of preeclampsia, characterized by new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, and multisystem involvement, is responsible for substantial maternal and fetal morbidity and is a marker for future cardiac and metabolic disease.

Drugs preferred during the pregnancy are

Ist line - Methyl dopa, Beta blocker (propranolol) and Labetalol

IInd line - Metoprolol, atenolol and Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine)

IIIrd line agents-clonidine, diuretics

Three short acting antihypertensive agents-hydralazine, labetalol, and short acting (sublingual or orally administered) nifedipine-are commonly used to control acute, very high blood pressure in women with severe hypertension in pregnancy.

Maternal antihypertensive drugs usually compatible with breastfeeding are Captopril, diltiazem, Enalapril, Hydralazine, Hydrochlorothiazide, Labetalol, Methyldopa, Minoxidil, beta blockers like Propranolol and timolol, spironolactone and verapamil. Individual side effects of drugs have to be looked for, while prescribing these drugs in lactation.

Combination of more than 2 drugs

Few patients may require a third or fourth drug to adequately manage BP. Preference should be given to the selection of an agent from a different class than the initial 2 drugs in the combination therapy. Addition of the third drug may be in the form of spironolactone (requires the assessment of renal functions and potassium), minoxidil, hydralazine, carvedilol and rest of the drugs depending on the specific conditions being treated. Centrally acting drugs should be the last option due to potential side effects.

Contraindications and conditions requiring special care

ACEIs- Pregnancy, angioneurotic edema, hyperkalemia, renal artery stenosis

Diuretics- Gout, Hypokalemia, Pregnancy, Impaired glucose tolerance.

Beta blockers- Asthma, marked bradycardia, abnormal glucose tolerance, obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral artery disease

ARB- Pregnancy, hyperkalemia, renal artery stenosis

Ca channel blockers- Heart failure, bradyarrythmias

### Β-blocker exposure in pregnancy and risk of fetal cardiac anomalies… [^117841bW]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

β-Blockers cross the placenta and potentially can cause physiological changes in the fetus. 2 β-Blocker exposure has been shown to cause bradycardia and hypoglycemia in the neonate. 3 A recent meta-analysis4 reported an association between β-blocker exposure and fetal congenital cardiovascular defects, raising a concern regarding potential teratogenic effects of this class of medication. This study examines the risk of fetal cardiac malformations in association with maternal β-blocker exposure. This is a retrospective population-based cohort study that included births in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Region between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014. Only singleton pregnancies were included. Pregnant women exposed to β-blockers during pregnancy were identified using pharmacy dispensing records. Maternal comorbidities and fetal congenital anomalies were identified by searching electronic medical records using ICD-9-CM codes.

In a cohort of 379 238 pregnancies, 4847 were exposed to β-blockers. Among this group, 2628 were exposed to β-blockers during the first trimester of pregnancy. The 4 most commonly prescribed β-blockers were labetalol, atenolol, propranolol, and metoprolol. Table 1 shows the baseline maternal characteristics of the study population. Women exposed to β-blockers were older, and had higher body mass indices. Diagnoses of hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, heart failure, and a history of arrhythmia were more common among patients exposed to β-blockers. Gestational age at delivery was lower in the β-blocker–exposed group.

While these findings do not definitively rule out the possibility of fetal congenital defects in association with β-blocker use, these results do provide reassurance regarding the use of this class of medication for the treatment of cardiac conditions in pregnant women.
