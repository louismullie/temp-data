## Question

Constrictive pericarditis findings in echocardiogram

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which echocardiographic findings identify constrictive pericarditis and which parameters and thresholds are most reliable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology that drives the echocardiographic signs. Then, I should verify the key 2D structural and motion clues. Next, I will review Doppler respiratory variation findings and hepatic venous flow. After that, I need to check tissue Doppler e' velocities and the concept of annulus paradoxus. Then, I will integrate the Mayo Clinic diagnostic criteria and consider rhythm-specific caveats like atrial fibrillation. Finally, I will outline pitfalls, when to use MRI/CT/catheterization, and a practical diagnostic algorithm with thresholds and combinations that maximize accuracy [^113L5T9M] [^111f1UTq] [^116nQrWd].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis: constrictive pericarditis (CP) creates dissociation between intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures and amplifies ventricular interdependence, which explains the respiratory septal shift and exaggerated respiratory variation in transvalvular flows; the pericardium limits late diastolic filling so early rapid filling is preserved but abruptly truncated, producing elevated venous pressures and restrictive hemodynamics, and this is precisely why CP can mimic restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) yet diverges in its respiratory dynamics [^113L5T9M] [^111VPde1] [^1113NYhp].

> Next, I should review 2D structural and motion cues methodically; wait, let me verify that absence of pericardial thickening does not exclude CP, because up to roughly 18% of surgically proven CP have normal pericardial thickness, so I must not over-rely on thickness alone and should prioritize dynamic features such as a respiration-related septal bounce, small to normal ventricular cavities with preserved LVEF, biatrial enlargement, and a plethoric non-collapsing IVC suggesting high right atrial pressure; if there is effusion, I need to consider effusive-constrictive pericarditis as a possibility rather than a competing diagnosis [^111BjkKE] [^111f1UTq] [^112GGicP] [^11515kVC] [^115eniVF].

> I will now examine Doppler flow patterns for respiratory variation; the mitral inflow E velocity typically shows at least 10% respiratory variation in CP with an increase during expiration and decrease with inspiration, and E-wave deceleration time is often shortened with an elevated E/A ratio reflecting restrictive physiology, but hold on, I should verify rhythm because this mitral inflow criterion is unreliable in atrial fibrillation or flutter; pulmonary venous diastolic forward flow often varies by at least 18% in a reciprocal pattern to mitral inflow; critically, hepatic venous Doppler shows prominent expiratory diastolic flow reversal, and a hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio of at least 0.79 strongly supports CP and helps distinguish it from tamponade, in which diastolic reversal is typically more pronounced during inspiration rather than expiration [^113A9TWr] [^111f1UTq] [^114mQHxv] [^1114eNnt].

> Now, I need to check tissue Doppler imaging to look for annulus paradoxus; in CP, medial (septal) e' is preserved or even augmented because myocardial relaxation is intact while the rigid pericardium accentuates longitudinal recoil, so medial e' is usually at least 9 cm/s by contemporary criteria, although earlier work used 8 cm/s, and wait, I should double-check lateral e' which is often relatively reduced such that medial e' exceeds lateral e' (annulus reversus), giving a medial-to-lateral e' ratio of at least 0.91, which is opposite to the pattern in RCM where both medial and lateral e' are globally depressed; this constellation sharply improves differentiation from RCM [^111f1UTq] [^112tuGS6] [^113A9TWr] [^114mQHxv].

> Let me integrate the Mayo Clinic echocardiographic criteria without jumping to conclusions prematurely; the three most robust variables are respiration-related ventricular septal shift, medial mitral annular e' of at least 9 cm/s, and hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio of at least 0.79, and I should confirm that combining septal shift with either a high medial e' or the hepatic vein ratio yields the best diagnostic performance, including in atrial fibrillation where mitral inflow variation loses reliability; notably, septal shift tends to be the most sensitive and medial e' the most specific component, and the overall accuracy is highest when these are paired [^111f1UTq] [^114mQHxv].

> But wait, what if the echocardiogram is equivocal; I need to consider common pitfalls and clinical contexts that alter test performance: in atrial fibrillation, I should lean more on TDI and hepatic venous flow rather than mitral inflow variation; severe tricuspid regurgitation can mimic elements of CP hemodynamics, so simultaneous respiratory pressure changes and LV-RV diastolic pressure differences help differentiate; after radiation or in mixed CP/RCM, the classic CP signatures can be blunted; pediatric patients frequently require MRI or catheterization because adult diastolic parameters do not translate reliably; and I should remember again that normal pericardial thickness does not exclude constrictive physiology [^111f1UTq] [^111ZiwCH] [^1118FqYv] [^111BjkKE].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to multimodality imaging or invasive hemodynamics; cardiac MRI can assess pericardial thickness, inflammation with late gadolinium enhancement, and ventricular coupling, and hold on, I should verify that quantitative pericardial delayed hyperenhancement identifies an inflammatory phenotype likely to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy in transient or subacute constriction, while CT better detects calcification, and right heart catheterization confirms equalization of diastolic pressures with discordant LV-RV systolic pressure changes during respiration; the ESC guidelines endorse catheterization when the diagnosis remains uncertain or when alternative hemodynamic causes are possible [^113uv6Kb] [^113PC6Aj] [^112GGicP] [^1113NYhp] [^114YfjbU].

> I will now outline a pragmatic diagnostic pathway; initial screening with 2D echo and color Doppler to look for septal bounce, plethoric IVC, and any thickening should be followed, if suspicious, by focused Doppler with respiratory monitoring and TDI to quantify mitral inflow variation (if in sinus rhythm), hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio, and medial versus lateral e' velocities; definite CP is strongly supported by the combination of septal shift plus either medial e' of at least 9 cm/s or hepatic vein ratio of at least 0.79, probable CP may be inferred with two or more supportive findings pending corroboration, and if discordant or borderline, I should escalate to MRI and, if still inconclusive, to simultaneous LV-RV catheterization, with consideration of a monitored trial of anti-inflammatory therapy when MRI suggests active pericarditis and a transient course is plausible [^111f1UTq] [^113uv6Kb] [^113PC6Aj] [^116nQrWd].

> Hold on, I should verify a few threshold details and potential self-corrections so I do not misapply cutoffs; although a mitral E velocity respiratory variation threshold of at least 10% is commonly used, I must remember it is rhythm-dependent and loses value in atrial fibrillation, and while I initially thought 8 cm/s was the standard for medial e' in all settings, more contemporary and specific criteria favor 9 cm/s, with the earlier 8 cm/s cut-off still informative in historical datasets; hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal is a linchpin, but I need to ensure the ratio threshold of at least 0.79 is measured during expiration and that sampling is optimized to avoid pseudoreversal artifacts [^113A9TWr] [^112tuGS6] [^111f1UTq] [^114mQHxv].

> To synthesize key practice points, the most sensitive single sign is a respiration-related ventricular septal shift, the most specific is a medial mitral annular e' of at least 9 cm/s, and a hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio of at least 0.79 is a highly specific venous signature; let me reconsider one pitfall once more: normal pericardial thickness does not exclude CP, so I should not anchor on anatomy without physiology, and the best diagnostic combination remains septal shift plus high medial e', with supportive findings including plethoric IVC and reciprocal respiratory variation across mitral and tricuspid inflows, while remembering the effusive-constrictive phenotype when significant effusion coexists with constrictive physiology [^111f1UTq] [^113A9TWr] [^111BjkKE] [^11515kVC].

---

The key echocardiographic findings in constrictive pericarditis are **septal bounce with respiratory septal shift** [^111f1UTq], **marked respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid inflow (> 25%/ ≥ 40%)**, and **preserved or elevated medial mitral annular e' velocity (≥ 8–9 cm/s)** [^112tuGS6], often with annulus reversus/paradoxus [^114mQHxv]. Additional supportive features include a **dilated IVC with reduced collapse** [^116nQrWd], expiratory diastolic flow reversal in hepatic veins [^111f1UTq] [^114mQHxv], and pericardial thickening or calcification [^112GGicP]; these findings help distinguish constriction from restrictive cardiomyopathy and guide management [^1178nFeT].

---

## Structural echocardiographic findings

### Pericardial thickening and calcification

**Pericardial thickening** may be seen on echocardiography [^112nxU4w], although normal thickness does not exclude constriction [^111BjkKE]. **Pericardial calcification** is common and supports chronic constriction; CT is more sensitive for detecting calcification [^112GGicP].

---

### Septal bounce and ventricular interdependence

**Septal bounce** is a hallmark M-mode/2D sign reflecting enhanced ventricular interdependence [^113L5T9M] due to a noncompliant pericardium [^111f1UTq]. **Respiratory septal shift** [^111f1UTq] — inspiratory leftward septal shift with expiratory normalization — is highly sensitive for constriction [^112AHZzH].

---

### Atrial enlargement

**Biatrial enlargement** often results from chronically elevated filling pressures [^1178nFeT].

---

## Doppler echocardiographic findings

### Respiratory variation in ventricular inflow velocities

**Mitral inflow variation** > 25% is a key Doppler marker of constriction [^111f1UTq], and **tricuspid inflow variation** ≥ 40% further supports the diagnosis.

---

### Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) findings

On tissue Doppler imaging, **medial mitral annular e' velocity** is preserved or elevated (≥ 8–9 cm/s) [^112tuGS6], reflecting intact longitudinal relaxation despite constriction [^111f1UTq]. **Annulus reversus/paradoxus** — medial e' ≥ lateral e' (annulus reversus) [^114mQHxv] and a high medial e' despite elevated filling pressures (annulus paradoxus) — is characteristic [^111f1UTq].

---

### Hepatic vein flow patterns

**Expiratory diastolic flow reversal** with a reversal/forward ratio ≥ 0.79 [^114mQHxv] indicates elevated right atrial pressure and impaired filling [^111f1UTq].

---

### Inferior vena cava (IVC) findings

For inferior vena cava findings, a **dilated IVC with reduced collapse** — a plethoric IVC with minimal respiratory variation — reflects elevated right atrial pressure [^116nQrWd].

---

## Differentiation from restrictive cardiomyopathy

Echocardiography helps **distinguish constriction from restriction** by integrating ventricular interdependence, respiratory inflow variation, and tissue Doppler findings [^111f1UTq] [^1178nFeT]:

| **Echocardiographic parameter** | **Constrictive pericarditis** | **Restrictive cardiomyopathy** |
|-|-|-|
| Ventricular interdependence | Present (septal bounce, respiratory septal shift) | Absent |
| Respiratory variation in mitral inflow | > 25% | < 15% |
| Medial mitral annular e' velocity | Preserved or elevated (≥ 8–9 cm/s) | Reduced (< 8 cm/s) |
| Hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal | Prominent (≥ 0.79) | Less prominent |
| Pericardial thickening/calcification | Common | Absent |

---

## Limitations of echocardiography

- **Normal pericardial thickness**: Constriction can occur with normal-thickness pericardium, limiting reliance on thickness alone [^111BjkKE].

- **Operator dependence**: Interpretation requires expertise and may be limited by patient factors (e.g. obesity, lung disease) [^113uv6Kb].

- **Need for multimodality imaging**: CMR/CT [^113uv6Kb] and invasive hemodynamics are often required when echo is inconclusive or to confirm diagnosis [^114YfjbU].

---

Echocardiography in constrictive pericarditis shows septal bounce [^111f1UTq], respiratory septal shift [^112AHZzH], marked respiratory inflow variation [^113A9TWr], preserved or elevated medial e' [^112tuGS6], annulus reversus/paradoxus [^114mQHxv], a dilated IVC with reduced collapse [^116nQrWd], and expiratory hepatic vein diastolic reversal [^111f1UTq]; these features, especially when combined, **support the diagnosis** and help distinguish constriction from restriction [^111VPde1].

### Differentiating constriction from restriction (from the Mayo Clinic echocardiographic criteria) [^114mQHxv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a curable and reversible form of severe diastolic heart failure. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of published echocardiographic Mayo Clinic Criteria in differentiating 107 patients with surgically proven CP from 30 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy due to cardiac amyloidosis. Five principal echocardiographic and Doppler variables were remeasured on preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram:

- **Respiration-related ventricular septal shift**
- **Respiratory variation in mitral inflow E pulsed Doppler velocity**
- **Tissue Doppler medial mitral annular e' velocity**
- **Ratio of medial mitral annular e' to lateral mitral annular e' velocity**
- **Hepatic vein (HV) pulsed Doppler diastolic flow reversal ratio**

The etiology of CP included viral/idiopathic or autoimmune (75%), postcardiac surgery (13%), and postradiation (7%). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that:

- **Respiration-related ventricular septal shift**
- **Percentage change in mitral E velocity**
- **Medial e' velocity ≥ 9 cm/sec**
- **Medial e'/lateral e' ratio ≥ 0.91**
- **HV diastolic reversal ratio ≥ 0.79**

were associated with the diagnosis of CP. Multivariable logistic regression analyses further demonstrated that medial e' velocity ≥ 9 cm/s was independently associated with the diagnosis of CP. Respiration-related ventricular septal shift had the highest sensitivity, whereas medial e' velocity ≥ 9 cm/s had the highest specificity to diagnose CP (areas under curves 0.99, p 0.001). Combining respiration-related ventricular septal shift with medial e' velocity ≥ 9 cm/s improved accuracy.

### Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy using mitral annular velocity by tissue Doppler echocardiography [^112tuGS6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the diagnostic role of early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E') by tissue Doppler echocardiography for differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy, including primary restrictive cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis. The study group consisted of 75 patients (53 men, 22 women; mean age 62 years, range 27 to 87). Of these, 23 patients had surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis, 38 had biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis with typical echocardiographic features of cardiac involvement, and 14 had primary restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Standard mitral inflow characteristics were measured, and tissue Doppler echocardiography was used to measure E' at the septal annulus. E' was significantly higher in patients with constrictive pericarditis than in those with primary restrictive cardiomyopathy or cardiac amyloidosis (12.3 vs. 5.1 cm/second, p ≤ 0.001). An E' of ≥ 8 cm/second resulted in 95% sensitivity and 96% specificity for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. There was no overlap of E' between patients who had constrictive pericarditis and those who had cardiac amyloidosis.

In a subgroup analysis of restrictive cardiomyopathy, E' of patients who had cardiac amyloidosis was significantly lower than patients who had primary restrictive cardiomyopathy (4.6 vs. 6.3 cm/second, p < 0.001). Thus, E' velocity can distinguish between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy with a specific cut-off value in patients with clinical and echocardiographic evidence of diastolic heart failure.

### Echocardiographic diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis: Mayo Clinic criteria [^111f1UTq]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). High credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is a potentially reversible cause of heart failure that may be difficult to differentiate from restrictive myocardial disease and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Echocardiography provides an important opportunity to evaluate for constrictive pericarditis, and definite diagnostic criteria are needed.

- **Methods and results**: Patients with surgically confirmed constrictive pericarditis (n = 130) at Mayo Clinic (2008–2010) were compared with patients (n = 36) diagnosed with restrictive myocardial disease or severe tricuspid regurgitation after constrictive pericarditis was considered but ruled out. Comprehensive echocardiograms were reviewed in a blinded fashion. Five principal echocardiographic variables were selected based on prior studies and their potential for clinical use: (1) respiration-related ventricular septal shift, (2) variation in mitral inflow E velocity, (3) medial mitral annular e' velocity, (4) ratio of medial mitral annular e' to lateral e', and (5) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio.

All five principal variables differed significantly between the groups. In patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter (n = 29), all but the mitral inflow velocity remained significantly different. Three variables were independently associated with constrictive pericarditis: (1) ventricular septal shift, (2) medial mitral e', and (3) hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio. The presence of ventricular septal shift in combination with either medial e' ≥ 9 cm/s or hepatic vein expiratory diastolic reversal ratio ≥ 0.79 corresponded to a desirable diagnostic outcome.

### Early constrictive epicarditis after coronary artery bypass surgery [^1125v87s]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A patient with constrictive pericarditis early after coronary bypass surgery is presented. At reoperation, a dense inflammatory process was encountered on the epicardial surface of the heart with minimal pericardial thickening. Crosshatching of the epicardial scar tissue produced an immediate and durable clinical response.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder with multiple causes, presenting in various primary care and secondary care settings. New diagnostic techniques have enhanced the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid, allowing comprehensive characterization of its cause. Despite these advances, pericarditis is often idiopathic, though radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become significant causes.

Pericarditis frequently resolves on its own, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. The integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains clinically challenging but is aided by tissue Doppler and color M-mode echocardiography.

Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^11736UAa]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Pericardial and pleural effusion is rarely seen in mild forms of liver cirrhosis, and the patient did not show evidence of failure of liver protein synthesis. Furthermore, the absence of proteinuria ruled out nephrotic syndrome. An emergency echocardiogram showed an advanced stage of effusive-constrictive pericarditis; this was further confirmed by a CMR scan and cardiac catheterisation. The patient did not have any previous cardiac surgery or radiation to the mediastinal region, hence, the constrictive pericarditis (CP) was by definition primary.

The patient repeatedly underwent drainage of pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusion with cytological investigation, and no malignant cells in the pericardial fluid were found. Histological examination of a pericardial biopsy did not reveal the aetiology and importantly did not find evidence of malignancy. Similarly, extensive evaluation for various infectious causes including cardiotropic viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi did not provide conclusive results. Having worked in several tropical countries and lived in tuberculosis-endemic settings in South-East Asia over time, tuberculous pericarditis was suspected. In such a setting, constrictive, calcified pericarditis is highly suspicious for tuberculous aetiology. The finding of borderline enlarged mediastinal and abdominal glands was also compatible with tuberculosis. Although a comprehensive workup did not provide aetiological proof of tuberculosis, we concluded with a diagnosis of presumptive tuberculous pericarditis based on the history of likely exposure.

### A girl with right heart failure related to effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^116gAfkp]. Pediatric Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterized by constriction of the visceral pericardium with a coexisting tense pericardial effusion. We report a 10-year-old girl with right heart failure due to effusive-constrictive pericarditis. She did not present typical features, such as cardiac tamponade or thickening of the visceral and parietal pericardium, but constrictive physiology was observed by echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography. These noninvasive imaging modalities provided clinical clues to make a precise diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical drainage of pericardial fluid and visceral pericardiectomy, which resulted in improved hemodynamics and symptoms.

### Localized pericardial constriction resulting in a "dumbbell" heart [^115TyPVL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

We describe an unusual case of a young man presenting with calcific constrictive pericarditis. The patient had a history of restrictive cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion during infancy and received antituberculous treatment. Investigations revealed the presence of a thickened pericardium and a thickened calcific constrictive band around the atrioventricular groove posteriorly and over the infundibulum anteriorly. Intraoperatively, the band caused the heart to have a "dumbbell" appearance. A pericardiectomy was performed along with the excision of the constricting band. The patient had an uneventful recovery.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^112euXRh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man presented to the Department of Medicine of our hospital due to exertional dyspnoea, ascites, and peripheral oedema. He was later transferred to the Department of Heart Disease as his echocardiography indicated constrictive pericarditis, confirmed by cardiac MRI and cardiac catheterisation. After a thorough investigation, his constrictive pericarditis was assumed to be caused by tuberculosis. He was treated with antituberculosis therapy followed by a successful surgical subtotal pericardiectomy, leading to immediate improvement of haemodynamics, regression of symptoms, and recovery of cardiac function. The patient remained stable at a 5-year echocardiographic follow-up with no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: Restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^1118FqYv]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

In this case, the presence of heart failure (HF) secondary to restrictive cardiomyopathy and/or constrictive pericarditis was notable despite subtle findings of atrial enlargement on previous echocardiograms. This underscores the limitations of echocardiography in diagnosing diastolic dysfunction in pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy, as highlighted by Dragulescu et al. Typical markers of diastolic function in adults lack transferability to the pediatric population, suggesting that cardiac catheterization or MRI is necessary to properly diagnose restrictive cardiomyopathy. While biatrial enlargement, a very subtle finding which likely predisposed to the development of ectopic atrial tachycardia, can suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy, additional testing is necessary. Specific to this case, providers may have overlooked such subtle biatrial enlargement as they were primed to focus on systolic function, especially given his partial dystrophin deletion, which may have been thought to predict dilated cardiomyopathy. This illustrates the critical role of medical genetics in management and diagnosis.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^117LA4me]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Her condition deteriorated progressively, with worsening dyspnea and signs of congestion. On day 6, a repeated transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial thickening with large fibrinous strands traversing the pericardial space and signs of constrictive pericarditis (video 1). The cardiac chamber dimensions were normal, with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and normal heart valves. Mitral inflow velocities demonstrated significant respiratory variation, increased E/A ratio, and rapid E deceleration time. A dilated, non-collapsing inferior vena cava (25 mm diameter) was noted, but there were no features of right atrial or right ventricular collapse. Estimated right atrial pressure was elevated (> 20 mm Hg), with abnormal movement of the interventricular septum (septal bounce). Consequently, a diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis was made, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for increasing supplemental oxygen requirements. The doses of corticosteroids were increased, and small doses of diuretics were started.

A repeated CT scan suggested worsening of pneumonia with bilateral lung involvement and pericardial thickening. Troponin was negative and NT-proBNP was 2200 pg/mL. Diagnostic thoracentesis revealed a transudate, with normal adenosine deaminase levels. Pleural fluid and blood cultures were negative. Testing for HIV antibodies and hepatic viruses was negative.

The chest CT scan shows pericardial thickening with pericardial effusion (white arrows) and bilateral patchy ground-glass (yellow arrows).

### Intraoperative assessment of hepatic vein tracings in constrictive pericarditis during surgical pericardiectomy [^113eZ3Ff]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by progressive inflammation and fibrosis of the pericardium, manifesting with symptoms of heart failure. The only effective treatment is surgical pericardiectomy. The assessment and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis with echocardiography are well described with spontaneous ventilation; however, there are limited data on constrictive pericarditis assessment with transesophageal echocardiography using positive pressure ventilation. Intraoperative hepatic venous Doppler flow is primarily used to assess the severity of tricuspid regurgitation by focusing on flow reversal during systole.

In this e-challenge, the authors focus on hepatic vein Doppler tracing as a means to demonstrate improvement in diastolic function during positive pressure ventilation in a patient undergoing pericardiectomy. This case demonstrates a severely blunted diastolic flow pattern in the hepatic vein that is reversed after successful pericardiectomy. It also shows blunted flow during systole compared to diastole post-pericardiectomy, indicating high right atrial pressure.

### Asymmetric focal pericardial thickening causing physiologically significant constrictive pericarditis [^113SDEpX]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

A 34-year-old woman presented with refractory ascites and edema. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function with a restrictive diastolic filling pattern. Tissue Doppler velocities of the mitral annulus were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a focal region of pericardial thickening anterior to the right ventricle and normal thickness pericardium in the other segments. However, abnormal delayed enhancement MRI, consistent with inflammation, was present in both the thickened and the normal pericardial segments. Invasive hemodynamics confirmed constrictive physiology, and the patient underwent successful pericardiectomy. This case highlights the utility of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis and the underappreciated fact that the pericardium need not be globally thickened to cause hemodynamically significant constrictive physiology.

### Tuberculous constrictive pericarditis: Challenges and surgical management [^114vEC1U]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which inflammation of the pericardium results in the loss of pericardial elasticity, leading to restricted ventricular filling. This case reports a male in his 50s who presented with symptoms of bilateral pedal oedema and dyspnoea. Examination revealed a raised jugular venous pulse, abdominal dullness, and crepitations in both lungs. Echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography revealed the characteristic features of chronic constrictive pericarditis, including septal involvement, calcific deposits, and right-sided heart failure. The patient was also diagnosed with chronic liver cirrhosis.

The patient underwent a surgical pericardiectomy. Histopathological examination of the pericardial tissue confirmed a tuberculous aetiology. The patient was postoperatively managed for heart failure and given antitubercular medication and was subsequently discharged. The patient was readmitted with symptoms of right-sided heart failure and eventually died. This case highlights that constrictive pericarditis with myocardial involvement has poor outcomes after intervention, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis.

### Transient constrictive pericarditis: Causes and natural history [^115we99i]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was designed to elucidate the causes and natural history of transient constrictive pericarditis (CP).

In some patients with acute CP, symptoms and constrictive physiologic features resolve with medical therapy alone, a phenomenon labeled "transient constrictive pericarditis". No large studies have examined the causes or natural history of transient CP.

A review of the Mayo Clinic echocardiogram database identified 212 patients who had echocardiographic findings of CP from 1988 through 1999. Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic findings were identified in all patients. In 36 of these patients, follow-up echocardiograms showed resolution of the constrictive hemodynamics without pericardiectomy.

The average age of the patients was 49 ± 21 years, and 72% were men. The causes for the CP were diverse, with the most common being prior cardiovascular surgery (25%). In a subset of 22 patients who were followed serially during the course of their illness, resolution of the constrictive physiologic features occurred at an average of 8.3 weeks after diagnosis.

A subset of patients with CP experience resolution of the disorder without requiring pericardiectomy.

### Transitory effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^111Ln676]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion of various sizes is a common clinical finding, while its progression to effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs in about 1.4–14% of cases. Although available evidence on the prevalence and prognosis of this rare pericardial syndrome is limited, a considerable proportion of conservatively managed patients experience spontaneous resolution after several weeks.

A 61-year-old female presented to our emergency department reporting fatigue, effort dyspnea, and abdominal swelling. Echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion with initial hemodynamic impact, prompting a pericardiocentesis. This procedure resulted in the drainage of 800–850 cm³ of exudative fluid, on which diagnostic investigations were conducted. Possible viral and bacterial infections, medical conditions, iatrogenic causes, and neoplastic and connective tissue diseases were all excluded.

Despite empirical therapy with NSAIDs and colchicine, she experienced a recurrence of pericardial effusion and progressive development of constriction after about one week. Echocardiography performed following a few weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy showed a resolution of constriction and pericardial effusion, with clinical improvement.

If the progression of pericardial syndromes to a constrictive form is rarely described in the literature, cases of a transitory effusive-constrictive phase are even more uncommon, primarily reported during the evolution of pericardial effusion. According to the available data, the risk of progression to a constrictive form is very low in cases of idiopathic pericardial effusion. We report a case of large idiopathic subacute pericardial effusion that resolved without long-term complications.

### Heart in the 'jaws' of a constrictor, unusual cause of subacute right heart failure [^115GhMGt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a potentially curable cause of diastolic heart failure. Known and common etiologies include previous heart surgery, chest radiation, trauma, and infections such as tuberculosis. Conversely, a proportion of cases may not have well-identifiable causes and are thus deemed idiopathic. Early identification is crucial, as timely pericardiectomy is associated with lower operative complications. Clinically, timely diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the absence of radiological signs. With a high index of suspicion, careful evaluation of jugular venous pressure and its waveforms aids diagnosis. Additionally, modern echocardiography machines, in experienced hands, permit confirmation of clinically suspected cases in the majority of instances.

### Quantitative assessment of pericardial delayed hyperenhancement predicts clinical improvement in patients with constrictive pericarditis treated with anti-inflammatory therapy [^113PC6Aj]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). High credibility.

Delayed hyperenhancement (DHE) of the pericardium typically indicates ongoing inflammation and can identify patients with constrictive pericarditis who may benefit from anti-inflammatory therapy. However, a quantitative assessment of pericardial DHE has not been conducted, and the hierarchical relationship among clinical factors, inflammatory markers, and pericardial DHE remains unknown.

- **Methods and results**: We identified 41 consecutive patients with constrictive pericarditis who underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study with DHE prior to the initiation of anti-inflammatory medications. Pericardial inflammation was quantified on short-axis DHE sequences by contouring the pericardium, selecting normal septal myocardium as a reference region, and then quantifying the pericardial signal that was > 6 standard deviations above the reference. Our primary outcome was clinical improvement with anti-inflammatory therapy. The mean age of our patients was 58 years, most were male (83%) and had New York Heart Association Class II or III (59%) heart failure, with a median follow-up of 1 year. Chest pain, lower New York Heart Association class, higher Westergren sedimentation rates, and increased pericardial DHE were all significantly associated with clinical improvement (P < 0.01 for all). When quantitative pericardial DHE was added to a model that included age, chest pain, New York Heart Association class, and Westergren sedimentation rates, the global χ² improved significantly (P = 0.04 for DHE), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96.

### Differentiation of tricuspid regurgitation from constrictive pericarditis: Novel criteria for diagnosis in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory [^111ZiwCH]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Severe tricuspid regurgitation, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy can all present with signs and symptoms of right heart failure and similar hemodynamic findings of elevation and equalization of diastolic pressures at catheterization. Although catheterization findings of enhancement of ventricular interaction are a reliable parameter to distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy, this may also be present in severe tricuspid regurgitation.

- **Objective**: To identify unique hemodynamic parameters that differentiate severe tricuspid regurgitation from constrictive pericarditis.

- **Methods**: Hemodynamic findings from simultaneous right and left heart catheterization of 14 patients (age 59 years; men 71%) with documented severe tricuspid regurgitation (group I) were compared with those of 14 patients with surgically proven constrictive pericarditis (group II).

- **Results**: Findings of elevated right atrial pressure, early rapid ventricular filling, and expiratory equalization of ventricular diastolic pressures were similar in both groups. Ventricular interdependence, assessed by interaction of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic pressures, was also present in both groups. Relative changes in LV and RV diastolic pressures during respiration reliably distinguished group I from group II. During inspiration, the difference between the LV and RV diastolic pressures widened in group I but narrowed in group II. The height and slope of the early rapid filling wave in the RV pressure trace were accentuated during inspiration.

### Analysis of risk factors of multiorgan failure after pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis [^113SYhVc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis arises as a result of the fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to chronic inflammatory changes from various injuries. Increased pulmonary and systemic venous pressures manifest clinical features of left and right heart failure. Right-sided heart failure symptoms predominate over left-sided heart failure symptoms due to the equalization of pressures.

- **Causes of multiorgan failure following pericardiectomy**: In our study, the causes of operative deaths were multiorgan failure, including cardiogenic shock + AKI + ventricular fibrillation (13/66), cardiogenic shock + AKI (35/66), cardiogenic shock + AKI + hepatic failure + septicemia (8/66), and cardiogenic shock + AKI + respiratory failure (10/66).

- **Incomplete pericardial dissection is associated with multiorgan failure following pericardiectomy**: The causes of low cardiac output syndrome are related to the incomplete resection of thickened pericardium, unsatisfactory relief of left ventricular compression, excessive ventricular dilatation after pericardial dissection, myocardial weakness, and heart failure. In our study, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that postoperative LVEDD (P < 0.001) is associated with multiorgan failure, indicating that the incomplete resection of thickened pericardium and unsatisfactory relief of left ventricular compression are associated with multiorgan failure following pericardiectomy.

We removed the pericardium from phrenic nerve to phrenic nerve without CPB as the procedure of choice. However, this often results in insufficient removal.

### What echocardiographic findings suggest a pericardial effusion is causing tamponade [^1114eNnt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pericardial tamponade is neither a clinical nor an echocardiographic diagnosis alone. The echocardiogram carries diagnostic value and should be performed when there is suspicion for tamponade based on the history and physical exam. A pericardial effusion uncovered on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be mistaken for tamponade and thereby lead to inappropriate and invasive management with pericardiocentesis.

This narrative review summarizes the echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that support the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade. It provides a succinct description of the core findings for which emergency physicians should evaluate at the bedside, along with potential pearls and pitfalls in this evaluation. Labeled images and video clips are included.

- **Core echocardiographic findings**: The main findings of pericardial tamponade consist of a pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse (indicative of high specificity), systolic right atrial collapse (often the earliest sign), a plethoric inferior vena cava with minimal respiratory variation (suggestive of high sensitivity), and exaggerated respiratory cycle changes in mitral and tricuspid valve inflow velocities as a surrogate for pulsus paradoxus.

The emergency physician must recognize and understand the core echocardiographic findings and associated pathophysiology that suggest pericardial tamponade. Together with the history and clinical exam, these findings can help make the overall diagnosis and determine management.

### Effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^11515kVC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon pericardial syndrome characterized by concomitant tamponade, caused by tense pericardial effusion, and constriction, caused by the visceral pericardium. We conducted a prospective study of its clinical evolution and management.

- **Methods**: From 1986 through 2001, all patients with effusive-constrictive pericarditis were prospectively evaluated. Combined pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization were performed in all patients, and pericardiectomy was performed in those with persistent constriction. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 15 years (median, 7 years).

- **Results**: A total of 1184 patients with pericarditis were evaluated, 218 of whom had tamponade. Of these 218, 190 underwent combined pericardiocentesis and catheterization. Fifteen of these patients had effusive-constrictive pericarditis and were included in the study. All patients presented with clinical tamponade; however, concomitant constriction was recognized in only seven patients. At catheterization, all patients had elevated intrapericardial pressure (median, 12 mm Hg; interquartile range, 7 to 18) and elevated right atrial and end-diastolic right and left ventricular pressures. After pericardiocentesis, the intrapericardial pressure decreased (median value, -5 mm Hg; interquartile range, -5 to 0), whereas right atrial and end-diastolic right and left ventricular pressures, although slightly reduced, remained elevated, with a dip-plateau morphology. The causes were diverse, and death was mainly related to the underlying disease.

### Constrictive pericarditis: Diagnosis, management and clinical outcomes [^116nQrWd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a form of diastolic heart failure that arises because an inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling. This disorder must be considered in the differential diagnosis for unexplained heart failure, particularly when the left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved. Risk factors for the development of CP include prior cardiac surgery and radiation therapy, but most cases are still deemed to be idiopathic.

Making the diagnosis may be challenging and requires meticulous echocardiographic assessment, often supplemented by cross-sectional cardiac imaging and haemodynamic catheterisation. The key pathophysiological concepts, which serve as the basis for many of the diagnostic criteria, remain: (1) dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures and (2) enhanced ventricular interaction.

Complete surgical pericardiectomy is the only effective treatment for chronic CP. A subset of patients with subacute inflammatory CP, often identified by cardiac MRI, may respond to anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^115fTVN9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Initially considered a respiratory illness, it became evident, with the increase in cases, that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects multiple organs, including the heart. The cardiovascular changes range from asymptomatic increase in myocardial injury markers to contractility disorders, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, vascular insufficiency, and sudden cardiac arrest. We report the case of a rapidly installed constrictive pericarditis in the setting of COVID-19.

### The clinical value of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 in evaluating pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis [^111Mp7QU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Methods

From January 2018 to October 2022, after excluding three individuals who did not meet the inclusion criteria, a total of 92 subjects were included in the final study. Of these, 63 were males (68.47%) and 29 were females (31.52%). Diagnoses were confirmed as tuberculous constrictive pericarditis based on the tuberculin test, T.pot-TB test, CT and echocardiography, and microbiological evaluation. Microbiological confirmation primarily involved smear and culture confirmation of pericardial effusion.

Patients meeting all of the following criteria were included in this study: (1) chronic systemic congestion and low cardiac output, (2) X-ray and CT examinations showing obvious pericardial thickening or calcification, (3) end diastolic difference between left and right ventricles of 5 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), (4) central venous pressure greater than 12 cmH2O, and (5) pathological diagnosis of granulomatous inflammation and caseous necrosis. Patients with rheumatic pericarditis, suppurative pericarditis, nonspecific pericarditis, coronary heart disease, pulmonary heart disease, and pericardial tamponade were excluded.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients were recorded, including sex, age, comorbidities, and complications. Echocardiography was performed using a Philips iU 33 Doppler ultrasound instrument (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA, USA). A Philips 16-slice spiral CT was used to obtain chest CT data.

### The clinical value of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 in evaluating pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis [^116svNH3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study reports that the absolute value of Ptfv1 in ECG can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic index to evaluate pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. This study empirically verified that abnormal Ptfv1 is closely associated with tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. Abnormal Ptfv1 by electrocardiogram can make up for the limitations of X-ray, CT, and echocardiography in the diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. Abnormal Ptfv1 has important diagnostic value in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis.

### Anti-inflammatory properties of amniotic membrane patch following pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis [^111vqpnJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis results in a thickened and less-elastic pericardium, which can lead to incomplete diastolic filling and myocardial ischemia. Since it is rare and the presenting symptoms are similar to those of several other disorders, the diagnosis can often be challenging. The diagnosis is usually made using cardiac catheterization or echocardiography as part of the patient's initial clinical evaluation. Although there are multiple etiologies of constrictive pericarditis, in most cases, the pathophysiology is idiopathic or may occur following cardiac surgical procedures, including orthotopic heart transplant. Constrictive pericarditis is commonly treated with pericardiectomy; however, even following surgical intervention, long-term survival decreases over time and further diminishes when the patient history includes multiple cardiac re-operations.

It has recently been demonstrated that amniotic stem cell therapy, consisting of either stem cells with extracellular matrix or extracellular matrix alone, can decrease fibrosis and postoperative inflammation in humans. Specifically, extracellular matrix in the form of human amniotic membrane allograft has been shown to significantly reduce post-ischemic cardiac dysfunction, improve ischemic heart repair, and increase blood flow recovery in rat and mouse models. This immunoprivileged tissue does not need to be donor-recipient matched to produce positive outcomes, further supporting its convenience of use and value. In the context of these anti-inflammatory properties and since inflammatory processes are central to…

### Constrictive pericarditis: A practical clinical approach [^11756sP2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) represents a form of severe diastolic heart failure (HF), secondary to a noncompliant pericardium. The true prevalence of CP is unknown, but it is observed in 0.2–0.4% of patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or have had pericardial trauma or inflammation due to a variety of etiologies. Despite its poor prognosis if untreated, CP is a potentially curable disease, and surgical pericardiectomy can now be performed with low perioperative mortality at tertiary centers with expertise in pericardial diseases. Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for CP in patients presenting with predominant right-sided heart failure, particularly when there is a history of cardiac surgery, pericarditis, or pericardial effusion.

Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is usually the first diagnostic tool in the evaluation of HF and can reliably identify CP in most patients by characteristic real-time motion of the heart and hemodynamic features. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide incremental data for the diagnosis and management of CP, especially when clinical or echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization has been the gold standard for diagnosing CP but may not be necessary if non-invasive tests demonstrate diagnostic features of CP; it should then be reserved for selected cases or for the assessment of concomitant coronary disease. Although most patients with CP require pericardiectomy, anti-inflammatory therapy may be curative in patients presenting with.

### Development of rapid evaluation scale for pericardiectomy of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis by 12-lead electrocardiogram [^115CKa8A]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Tuberculous constrictive pericarditis is a chronic inflammatory process involving the pericardial wall and visceral layer, leading to pericardial thickening, which limits diastolic activity and reduces heart function. It is characterized by thickening and calcification of pericardial fibers, impairing diastolic filling, reducing cardiac output, and ultimately leading to heart failure. Pericardiectomy is an effective way to correct hemodynamic abnormalities and improve cardiac function in constrictive pericarditis. The earlier the surgery following a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, the better the prognosis.

- **Surgical indications**: Clinical symptoms, chest X-ray, CT, echocardiography, and other auxiliary examinations, as well as routine placement of venous pressure monitoring tubes, are often used. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

- **Diagnosis process**: Diagnosis is made according to clinical symptoms. Constriction of the pericardium restricts the diastolic expansion of the ventricles, thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output causes the kidneys to retain water and sodium, resulting in increased blood volume. Constriction of the pericardium makes it difficult for venous blood to return to the heart, leading to clinical manifestations of elevated venous pressure, such as jugular vein irritation, liver enlargement, ascites, abdominal fluid, lower limb edema, and other signs. The compression of the left heart by the scar may cause pulmonary circulation congestion and dyspnea.

### Hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy [^1113NYhp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) are indolent, disabling diseases of diastolic function. The two conditions share common pathophysiologic features, resulting in similar and overlapping clinical presentations, echocardiographic findings, and hemodynamic characteristics. However, their clinical course differs, as CP is surgically curable whereas RCM is a chronic condition managed medically. Separating these two entities is based on the delineation of anatomic and physiologic derangements employing multimodality hemodynamic interrogation through advanced imaging techniques (Echo-Doppler, CT, and especially MRI) combined with sophisticated invasive hemodynamics.

### An unusual cause of severe dyspnea: Diastolic dysfunction due to calcific constrictive pericarditis [^116c57Qh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is a rare cause of dyspnea and shares many signs and symptoms with other causes of cardiac failure, as well as gastrointestinal and renal diseases, making it difficult to diagnose.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 73-year-old woman who arrived at our Emergency Department (ED) in respiratory failure following a recent history of worsening dyspnea. Constrictive pericarditis was strongly suspected based on bedside ultrasonography. A computed tomography scan revealed extensive pericardial calcifications and large pleural effusions, supporting the diagnosis. The patient was admitted for the treatment and evaluation of constrictive pericarditis but unfortunately died of complications during cardiac catheterization.

- **Conclusions**: The etiology and physiology of constrictive pericarditis are reviewed, and an ultrasound-centered approach to undifferentiated dyspnea in the ED is discussed.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: Restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^111EGnxs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

With the subtle findings on echocardiogram, a high degree of suspicion for a variable combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis was at the top of the differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, the complex and multisystem findings of MN required systematic consideration and rule-out of alternative causes for anasarca. After cardiac catheterization, some variable combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis was suspected, complicated by pulmonary hypertension due to the restrictive cardiomyopathy and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. It was felt that the restrictive cardiomyopathy was primary due to minimal respiratory variation in pressures during cardiac catheterization. Some contribution to his anasarca was felt to arise from a left-to-right shunting mechanism from his liver haemangiomas.

### Effusive-constrictive pericarditis in the spectrum of pericardial compressive syndromes [^115eniVF]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

When pericardial fluid accumulates and exceeds the reserve volume of the pericardium, or when the pericardium becomes scarred and inelastic, one of three pericardial compressive syndromes may ensue, namely cardiac tamponade (CT), characterized by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure; constrictive pericarditis (CP), which results from scarring and loss of the normal elasticity of the pericardial sac; and effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP), characterized by the concurrence of a tense pericardial effusion and constriction of the heart by the visceral pericardium.

Although relatively uncommon, prevalence estimates of ECP vary widely and depend on the nature of the cohorts studied, the methods used to diagnose ECP, and the manner in which ECP is defined. Most cases of ECP are idiopathic, reflecting the frequency of idiopathic pericardial disease in general. Other causes include radiation, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, and postsurgical/iatrogenic pericardial disease.

The diagnosis of ECP often becomes apparent when pericardiocentesis fails to decrease the right atrial pressure by 50% or to a level below 10 mm Hg. Important non-invasive diagnostic modalities include echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and, to a lesser extent, cardiac CT. In cases with clear evidence of pericardial inflammation, a trial of an anti-inflammatory regimen is warranted. A complete pericardiectomy should be reserved for refractory symptoms or clinical evidence of chronic CP.

### Pathophysiology of the pericardium [^113L5T9M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Pericardial heart disease includes pericarditis (an acute, subacute, or chronic fibrinous, noneffusive, or exudative process) and its complications: constriction (an acute, subacute, or chronic adhesive or fibrocalcific response), and cardiac tamponade. The pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis readily explains their respective findings on clinical examination, Doppler echocardiography, and at cardiac catheterization. The primary abnormality of cardiac tamponade is pan-cyclic compression of the cardiac chambers by increased pericardial fluid, requiring that cardiac chambers compete for a fixed intrapericardial volume. Features responsible for the pathophysiology include transmission of thoracic pressure through the pericardium and heightened ventricular interdependence.

Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium limits diastolic filling, causing dissociation of intracardiac and intrathoracic pressures, along with heightened ventricular interdependence. Both conditions result in diastolic dysfunction, elevated and equal venous and ventricular diastolic pressure, respiratory variation in ventricular filling, and ultimately, reduced cardiac output.

### Constrictive pericarditis caused by primary pericardial mesothelioma: A case series [^1131oWL9]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

A few weeks later, a 75-year-old man (case 2) without significant clinical history presented with fever, chest pain, impaired exercise tolerance, and peripheral edema. Echocardiography revealed severe pericardial effusion with inflow obstruction, for which pericardiocentesis was performed. The pericardial effusion was considered to be secondary to pericarditis of unknown cause. He was treated with ibuprofen and colchicine but showed no symptomatic improvement. Repeat echocardiography showed signs of constrictive physiology with extensive pericardial adhesions leading to severe right ventricular dysfunction (Figure 1).

Pericardial calcifications were absent on CT. CMR demonstrated a thickened pericardium with pronounced late gadolinium enhancement, multiple adhesions, and a leftward interventricular septum shift on inspiration, compatible with constrictive pericarditis. Furthermore, subtle pericardial nodules were visible. PET/CT showed intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the pericardium with an SUV max of 8.74, which was suspect of either very active inflammation or malignancy. However, no pathological extra-cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was visible, and pericardial and pleural fluid analysis did not show malignant cells or mycobacteria.

Treatment was intensified with prednisone without any effect. Shortly after, the patient developed signs of cardiogenic shock caused by the constrictive physiology and right ventricular failure. A subtotal pericardiectomy was performed. Histological examination showed a high-grade malignancy.

### Covid-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: A case report [^115MnNNj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

As the world community has experienced years of disease, the lingering effects of COVID-19 — the so-called 'long COVID-19' — have begun to appear. Persistent symptoms remained in subsets of patients; some were minimally debilitating, while others were crippling. Some of the acute cardiovascular consequences of the infection are chronic problems, such as COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this report is to describe another cardiac pathology associated with COVID-19: constrictive pericarditis. This additional chronic entity, constrictive pericarditis, can now be added to the growing list of cardiac COVID-19 cases. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of this condition, along with the findings and treatment with pericardiectomy, are described in this case report. We believe that this is the first report of this condition — COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy.

### The clinical value of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 in evaluating pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis [^116D9AFN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world and a leading cause of infection-related death, particularly in developing countries. It is the most common cause of constrictive pericarditis in low- and middle-income areas, with a reported incidence of 23–91%. Tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, also known as "heart with shell", is secondary to exudative pericarditis and is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is characterized by pericardial thickening, adhesion, fibrosis, and calcification, which can impair diastolic function and lead to poor circulation. Tuberculous pericarditis has a high morbidity and mortality rate.

Surgical intervention is the most appropriate treatment for tuberculous constrictive pericarditis if the patient shows continuous clinical evidence after antituberculous therapy. Pericardiectomy is the standard treatment. Currently, chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), and echocardiography are the main diagnostic methods. However, some patients without pericardial thickening and calcification also exhibit severe physiopathologic changes of constrictive pericarditis, suggesting that the diagnosis cannot be made solely on the basis of these imaging techniques. Therefore, supplementary examinations and diagnostic indicators are of great significance for the diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis to aid doctors.

### Diagnostic concordance of echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance-based tissue tracking for differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy [^112AHZzH]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Variations in longitudinal deformation of the left ventricle have been suggested to be useful for differentiating chronic constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). We assessed left ventricular mechanics derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine-based and 2-dimensional echocardiography-based tissue tracking to determine intermodality consistency of diagnostic information for differentiating CP from RCM.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified 92 patients who underwent both CMR and 2-dimensional echocardiography and who had a final diagnosis of CP (n = 28), RCM (n = 30), or no structural heart disease (n = 34). Global longitudinal strain from long-axis views and circumferential strain from short-axis views were measured on 2-dimensional echocardiographic and CMR cine images using the same offline software. Logistic regression models with receiver operating characteristic curves, continuous net reclassification improvement, and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used for assessing the incremental predictive performance. Global longitudinal strain was higher in patients with CP than in those with RCM (P < 0.001), and both techniques were found to have similar diagnostic value (area under the curve: 0.84 versus 0.88 for CMR and echocardiography, respectively). For echocardiography, the addition of global longitudinal strain to respiratory septal shift and early diastolic mitral annular velocity resulted in improved continuous net reclassification improvement (P < 0.001 for both) and integrated discrimination improvement.

### The clinical value of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 in evaluating pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis [^116TtNQb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

These results all indicate that Ptfv1 has clinical diagnostic value in some diseases. However, few studies have been conducted on the diagnostic value of Ptfv1 in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. This study found that Ptfv1 has a certain auxiliary diagnostic value for tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, which may be due to pericardial thickening, adhesion, fibrosis, and calcification of patients leading to poor blood circulation, thus increasing the left and right atrial load, and eventually leading to abnormal Ptfv1. Abnormal Ptfv1 is closely associated with tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. Abnormal Ptfv1 by electrocardiogram can be used as an important auxiliary diagnostic indicator in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis and can make up for the limitations of X-ray, CT, and echocardiography in the diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis. Abnormal Ptfv1 has important diagnostic value in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis.

In summary, our findings suggest that abnormal Ptfv1 is associated with tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and Ptfv1 is a potential auxiliary diagnostic indicator for the diagnosis of tuberculous constrictive pericarditis.

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112GGicP]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Pericardial calcification is a significant cause of pericardial constriction. However, pericardial constrictions may also occur without calcification and even without accompanying pericardial thickening. Pericardial calcification can be seen following various conditions including chronic pericarditis, tuberculosis, uremia, hemopericardium, radiation, idiopathic pericarditis, and surgery. It does not always result in constrictive pericarditis and low cardiac output. CT is superior to MRI in the evaluation of pericardial calcifications; however, the imaging appearances and pattern of involvement may vary among patients. The calcification commonly occurs over the anterior and diaphragmatic aspects of the heart. The atrioventricular grooves (more common in the right) and right atrium are also frequently involved.

Higher myocardial contractility and increased pressure on the left side of the heart could be the reason for the decreased rate of pericardial calcification in these areas. The presence of pericardial calcification adjacent to the left ventricle may indicate a severe form of involvement. Surgical removal is preferred in the case of increased systemic venous pressures and low cardiac output. However, the compressive effect of residual lesions on heart chambers may persist even after surgery. In the setting of diffuse pericardial calcification, pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area and consequently may result in pericardial diverti.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^114yEn2o]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

At present, limited data have been published on pericarditis and pericardial effusion in COVID-19, and only one case of constrictive pericarditis has been reported.

Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by inflammation and fibrotic thickening of the parietal and visceral pericardium, causing a restriction in cardiac filling and leading to hypodiastolic heart failure. The most common causes of constrictive pericarditis include cardiac surgery, radiotherapy, and tuberculous and purulent pericarditis. Idiopathic and viral pericarditis have a low incidence of constrictive complications.

Constrictive pericarditis is usually a late complication of chronic pericarditis. In rare cases, like the one presented here, it could have a more rapid, subacute evolution. Baker described in 2004 a similar case of a 30-year-old man with acute pericarditis that developed effusive-constrictive physiology in less than 2 weeks. The patient was treated initially with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine, but pericardiectomy was needed. The pericardial cavity was filled with fibrinous gelatinous exudates with adhesions to the epicardial surface. Pathological examination noted non-specific findings, including fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and granulation tissue. The cause of the pericarditis was thought to be idiopathic, presumed viral.

The concept of effusive-constrictive pericarditis was established in 1971 by Hancock. Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterized by pericardial effusion, often with cardiac tamponade, and restrictive cardiac filling physiology. Although the condition is relatively rare, it presents significant challenges in clinical management.

### Squamous cell carcinoma of thymus presenting as constrictive pericarditis diagnosed with 18F-FDG PET/CT [^112cptqE]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis refers to focal or global thickening of the pericardium causing impedance to diastolic filling and increased systemic venous pressure. We discuss a case of thymic carcinoma presenting as constrictive pericarditis. A 70-year-old man experiencing shortness of breath underwent Doppler echocardiography for further evaluation. Echocardiography was suggestive of a thickened nodular pericardium with minimal pericardial effusion, and Doppler features were indicative of constrictive pericarditis. An 18F-FDG PET/CT done to exclude malignancy revealed locally advanced thymic carcinoma spreading along the pericardial sheath with metabolically active rib metastases.

### Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis obscured by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Back to basics [^1171nw5g]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

In this report, we describe the case of a 41-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presenting with right-sided congestive heart failure symptoms. Noninvasive testing was suggestive but non-diagnostic for constrictive pericarditis (CP), necessitating invasive hemodynamic catheterization. The unique presence of both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and constriction in this case led to the absence of "modern" echocardiographic and invasive criteria for CP, as based upon findings of enhanced ventricular dependence. However, classic hemodynamic criteria, such as early rapid filling with elevation and end-equalization of diastolic pressures, were present. The patient ultimately received a pericardiectomy, which resulted in dramatic clinical improvement.

### Jugular venous pulse in constrictive pericarditis [^114HtHgQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Right atrial pressure tracing of the patient (top strip) demonstrates sharp and deep x and y descents, known as the 'W' sign, compared with a schematic representation of normal findings (bottom strip).

Under normal conditions, decreased intrathoracic pressure during inspiration augments venous return to the right side of the heart, which is easily accommodated by a compliant right ventricle, leading to a decrease in jugular venous pressure (JVP). The paradoxical rise in JVP with inspiration, known as Kussmaul's sign, occurs in the setting of impaired right ventricular filling from any cause, including constrictive pericarditis.

The components of the jugular venous waveform that are clinically observable at the bedside include the a wave, x descent, v wave, and y descent. Under normal conditions, the x descent is more prominent than the y descent. In constrictive pericarditis, the unyielding pericardium causes elevated atrial pressure and limits ventricular filling to the early diastolic period. The resultant brisk and enhanced early diastolic filling produces a sharp and deep y descent, known as Friedreich's sign. In the absence of atrial fibrillation, the prominent y descent often occurs in combination with a prominent x descent, creating two steep troughs known as the 'W' sign. This finding may be helpful in distinguishing constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which the x descent is typically diminished.

### Complicated pericarditis: Understanding risk factors and pathophysiology to inform imaging and treatment [^11529vFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients with acute pericarditis have a benign course and a good prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complicated pericarditis. The care of these patients is the focus of this review, specifically addressing risk factors, multimodality imaging, pathophysiology, and novel treatments.

- **Risk factors**: The authors conclude that early high-dose corticosteroids, a lack of colchicine, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are associated with the development of complicated pericarditis.

- **Multimodality imaging**: In select cases, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may aid in the assessment of pericardial inflammation and constriction.

- **Pathophysiology**: Given phenotypic similarities between idiopathic pericarditis and periodic fever syndromes, disorders of the inflammasome may contribute to relapsing attacks.

- **Novel treatments**: Therapies targeting the inflammasome may lead to more durable remission and resolution.

Finally, regarding future investigations, the authors discuss the potential of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to inform treatment duration. There is also a need to compare steroid-sparing treatments to pericardiectomy.

### Comparison of new Doppler echocardiographic methods to differentiate constrictive pericardial heart disease and restrictive cardiomyopathy [^113A9TWr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

This study assesses how the newer modalities of tissue Doppler echocardiography and color M-mode flow propagation compare with respiratory variation of Doppler flow in distinguishing between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. We studied 30 patients referred for further evaluation of diastolic function who had a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy, established by diagnostic tests including clinical assessment, magnetic resonance imaging, cardiac catheterization, endomyocardial biopsy, and surgical findings.

Nineteen patients had constrictive pericarditis and 11 had restrictive cardiomyopathy. We performed 2-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography combined with pulsed-wave Doppler of the pulmonary veins and mitral inflow with respiratory monitoring, tissue Doppler echocardiography of the lateral mitral annulus, and color M-mode flow propagation of left ventricular filling.

- **Respiratory variation results**: Respiratory variation of the mitral inflow peak early (peak E) velocity of ≥ 10% predicted constrictive pericarditis with 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Additionally, variation in the pulmonary venous peak diastolic (peak D) flow velocity of ≥ 18% distinguished constriction with 79% sensitivity and 91% specificity.

- **Tissue Doppler echocardiography results**: Using tissue Doppler echocardiography, a peak early velocity of longitudinal expansion (peak Ea) of ≥ 8.0 cm/s differentiated patients with constriction from restriction with 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

A slope of ≥ 100 cm/s for the first aliasing contour in color M-mode flow propagation predicted patients with constriction.

### Constrictive pericarditis — a curable diastolic heart failure [^111VPde1]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis can result from a stiff pericardium that prevents satisfactory diastolic filling. The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and other causes of heart failure, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, is important because pericardiectomy can cure constrictive pericarditis. Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is based on characteristic haemodynamic and anatomical features determined using echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, cardiac MRI, and CT. The Mayo Clinic echocardiography and cardiac catheterization haemodynamic diagnostic criteria for constrictive pericarditis are based on the unique features of ventricular interdependence and dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures seen when the pericardium is constricted. A complete pericardiectomy can restore satisfactory diastolic filling by removing the constrictive pericardium in patients with constrictive pericarditis.

However, if inflammation of the pericardium is the predominant constrictive mechanism, anti-inflammatory therapy might alleviate this transient condition without a need for surgery. Early diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is, therefore, of paramount clinical importance. An improved understanding of how constrictive pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this diastolic heart failure.

In this review, we discuss the aetiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, with a specific emphasis on how to differentiate this disease from conditions with similar clinical presentations.

### Constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive cardiomyopathy [^1178nFeT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with congestive heart failure exhibit preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). While the etiology of HFpEF often relates to long-standing hypertension and atherosclerosis, a substantial number of suspected HFpEF patients suffer from restrictive cardiomyopathy or chronic pericardial disease. Identifying these syndromes is crucial, as early diagnosis can initiate specific therapies that may prolong survival, enhance quality of life, and address any underlying systemic disorder. Current advancements in diagnostic imaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing facilitate the pinpointing of specific etiologies in most cases. Furthermore, novel pharmacological, immunologic, and surgical therapies are contributing to improved quality of life and survival.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^114M5ZDs]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A middle-aged man presented to the Department of Medicine of our hospital due to exertional dyspnoea, ascites, and peripheral oedema. He was later transferred to the Department of Heart Disease as his echocardiography indicated constrictive pericarditis, confirmed by cardiac MRI and cardiac catheterisation. After a thorough investigation, his constrictive pericarditis was attributed to tuberculosis. He was treated with antituberculosis therapy followed by successful surgical subtotal pericardiectomy, leading to immediate improvement of haemodynamics, regression of symptoms, and recovery of cardiac function. At the 5-year echocardiographic follow-up, the patient remained stable with no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^113wXUpm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

His chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion and an increased cardiac shadow suggestive of pericardial effusion (Figure 1C, D).

Echocardiogram revealed thickened pericardial layers with increased reflectiveness and pericardial effusion (Figure 1E), mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a normal systolic left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, but mildly reduced right ventricular (RV) long-axis function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 1.5 cm). There was a clear septal bounce or inspiratory shift towards the LV (Figure 1F, Video 1). The inferior vena cava was dilated with little respiratory diameter variation (Figure 2A). The echocardiographic findings were strongly suggestive of CP (Figure 1E–L).

### Covid-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: A case report [^115tPyRc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic was primarily considered a respiratory malady in the early phases of the outbreak. However, as more patients suffer from this illness, a myriad of symptoms emerge in organ systems separate from the lungs. Among those patients with cardiac involvement, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia were among the most common manifestations. Pericarditis with pericardial effusion requiring medical or interventional treatments has been previously reported in the acute setting. Notably, chronic pericarditis with pericardial thickening resulting in constriction requiring sternotomy and pericardiectomy has not been published at the time of writing.

- **Case presentation**: A patient with COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis three years after viral infection requiring pericardiectomy was reported. The COVID-19 infection originally manifested as anosmia and ageusia. Subsequently, the patient developed dyspnea, fatigue, right-sided chest pressure, bilateral leg edema, and abdominal fullness. Following right pleural effusions and a negative autoimmune work-up, the patient was referred for cardiothoracic surgery for pericardiectomy when radiographic imaging and hemodynamic assessment were consistent with constrictive pericarditis. Upon median sternotomy, the patient's pericardium was measured to be 8 mm thick. Descriptions of the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic features are provided. Within the first week after the operation, the patient's dyspnea resolved; one month later, leg edema and abdominal bloating were relieved.

### Cardiac magnetic resonance radiofrequency tissue tagging for diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis: A proof of concept study [^113RM11f]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive cardiac catheterization is the venerable "gold standard" for diagnosing constrictive pericarditis; however, its sensitivity and specificity vary dramatically from center to center. Given the ability to unequivocally define segments of the pericardium with the heart via radiofrequency tissue tagging, we hypothesize that cardiac magnetic resonance has the capability to be the new gold standard.

All patients who were referred for cardiac magnetic resonance evaluation of constrictive pericarditis underwent cardiac magnetic resonance radiofrequency tissue tagging to define visceral-parietal pericardial adherence to determine constriction. This was then compared with intraoperative surgical findings. Likewise, all preoperative cardiac catheterization testing was reviewed in a blinded manner.

A total of 120 patients were referred for clinical suspicion of constrictive pericarditis. Thirty-nine patients were defined as constrictive pericarditis positive solely via radiofrequency tissue-tagging cardiac magnetic resonance, of whom 21 were positive, 4 were negative, and 1 was equivocal for constrictive pericarditis, as defined by cardiac catheterization. Of these patients, 16 underwent pericardiectomy and were surgically confirmed. There was 100% agreement between cardiac magnetic resonance-defined constrictive pericarditis positivity and postsurgical findings. No patients were misclassified by cardiac magnetic resonance. In regard to the remaining constrictive pericarditis-positive patients defined by cardiac magnetic resonance, 10 were treated.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^113rfwTp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a severe cardiac disorder that often manifests as a long-term sequela following acute or chronic pericarditis due to infections. Numerous cardiotropic viruses, as well as bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, can cause CP. While rare in Western countries, tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericarditis in regions endemic to tuberculosis and HIV. Other important causes of CP include malignancy, rheumatological diseases, uraemia, radiotherapy, and cardiac surgery. In some cases, the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Chronic effusive pericarditis and inflammation from any of these conditions may lead to the formation of granulomatous tissue, fibrosis, calcification, and thickening of the pericardium with adhesion to the heart.

Typically, CP results in impaired cardiac function, most often associated with diastolic heart failure, and symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue, increased jugular venous pressure, ascites, pleural effusion, and peripheral oedema. Although standard transthoracic echocardiography is the cornerstone of diagnosis, a multimodal imaging-based approach is often required to timely diagnose the condition and guide further therapeutic options.

### Long-term outcomes of pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis [^114Z7oAp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on constrictive pericarditis:

- **Definition**: Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic disease characterized by symptoms of fluid overload, progressive reduction in cardiac output, and congestive heart failure.

- **Pathophysiology**: Constrictive pericarditis is caused by fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to idiopathic reasons, prior cardiac surgery, post-radiotherapy, post-infection (tuberculosis and non-tuberculous bacterial infection), connective tissue disease, malignancy, uremia, and sarcoidosis.

- **Disease course**: Chronic fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to various infectious and non-infectious causes results in constrictive pericarditis, which causes clinical manifestations such as dyspnea, peripheral edema, chest pain, palpitation, abdominal distension, fever, fatigue, weight loss, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, Kussmaul's sign, and pericardial shock.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In-hospital mortality associated with constrictive pericarditis is 2.1%.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^113TUkHd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We report the case of a previously healthy young woman who developed a severe form of COVID-19 with massive pneumonia and acute pericarditis, in whom constrictive physiology developed rapidly. To our knowledge, this represents the second reported case of SARS-CoV-2 constrictive pericarditis, a rare but severe cardiac complication.

### Constrictive pericarditis caused by primary pericardial mesothelioma: A case series [^114jHsEc]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman (case 1) without significant clinical history presented to the outpatient clinic with fever and chest pain. Echocardiography showed substantial pericardial effusion with imminent tamponade; hence, pericardiocentesis was performed. Viral pericarditis was suspected, and the patient was treated with an NSAID, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and colchicine.

After initial clinical improvement, she developed shortness of breath and ascites. Follow-up echocardiography showed an inspiratory leftward shift of the interventricular septum and a dilated inferior vena cava, suggestive of constrictive physiology (Figure 1). Computed tomography (CT) showed no pericardial calcifications. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) displayed a thickened pericardium up to 8 mm with late gadolinium enhancement and prolonged native T1 and T2 relaxation times, indicating increased vascularization of the pericardium and edema, a suspect of active inflammation. Left ventricular function was normal, and right ventricular function was moderately impaired. Using myocardial tagging, multiple adhesions were detected.

During real-time cine imaging within a respiratory cycle, a leftward interventricular septum shift on inspiration was confirmed, compatible with ventricular interdependency and a constrictive physiology. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed diffuse fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the pericardium with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 6.28. No extra-pericardial pathological fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was observed, particularly not in the pleurae.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated constrictive pericarditis [^1152DmXD]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This report documents a rare case of COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis (CP) in the context of a recent COVID-19 infection. A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gout presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. His hospital course was complicated by a large pericardial effusion; an emergent bedside transthoracic echocardiography indicated potential cardiac tamponade, prompting a pericardiocentesis.

Further investigations with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed changes consistent with a diagnosis of CP. Viral and idiopathic etiologies are the most common causes of CP in the developed world, with COVID-19 now suggested as a predisposing viral illness. The virus induces systemic inflammation and pericardial changes that can lead to CP physiology. Imaging modalities, including echocardiograms and cardiac magnetic resonance, play an integral role in confirming the diagnosis.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^113ScEGS]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The higher observed incidence of treatment failure or recurrence of pericarditis in patients with idiopathic forms may rely on differences in underlying pathogenesis or the time to anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy. A shorter time to treatment is expected for postcardiac injury syndromes, possibly due to scheduled follow-ups that allow for early identification and, subsequently, early modulation of the inflammatory burden. In contrast, patients with idiopathic pericarditis develop symptoms in the outpatient setting without ready access to clinicians, leading to an extended time-to-diagnosis and treatment. Although both idiopathic and postcardiac injury pericarditis can share a similar inflammatory response, the molecular mechanisms initiating this response may differ, highlighting the need for investigations of tailored therapies.

Patients with elevated troponin I levels were found to have a lower risk for the development of recurrences and an adverse composite outcome. The detection of increased troponin I levels in patients with pericarditis indicates the concomitant involvement of the subepicardial myocardium in the inflammatory process, as well as ECG abnormalities. In contrast to coronary artery disease, elevated troponin levels in the serum are not a negative prognostic marker in patients with pericarditis. Imazio and colleagues had previously described that recurrences were more frequent in cases of "isolated" pericarditis with normal troponin I levels.

### Constrictive pericarditis in 26 patients with histologically normal pericardial thickness [^111BjkKE]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Traditionally, increased pericardial thickness has been considered an essential diagnostic feature of constrictive pericarditis. Although constriction with normal-thickness pericardium has been demonstrated clinically by noninvasive imaging, the details of clinicopathological correlates have not been described.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 143 patients with proven constriction underwent pericardiectomy at Mayo Clinic between 1993 and 1999. Their baseline characteristics, operative data, and pathological specimens were reviewed retrospectively. The pericardium was of normal thickness (2 mm) in 117 (82%; group 2). The most common causes of constriction in group 1 included previous cardiac surgery, chest irradiation, previous infarction, and idiopathic disease. There was little difference in symptoms and findings on physical examination between the two groups. Microscopically, no patient had an entirely normal pericardium. Histopathological abnormalities in group 1 were mild and focal, including fibrosis, inflammation, calcification, fibrin deposition, and focal noncaseating granulomas. Pericardiectomy was equally effective in relieving symptoms regardless of the presence or absence of increased thickness.

- **Conclusions**: Pericardial thickness was not increased in 18% of patients with surgically proven constrictive pericarditis, although the histopathological appearance was focally abnormal in all cases. When clinical, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic features indicate constriction in patients, pericardiectomy can be considered an effective treatment regardless of the presence of increased pericardial thickness.

### Noninvasive multimodality imaging for the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis [^113uv6Kb]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

There is a need to review the multimodality imaging techniques, as well as the emerging role of the newer noninvasive imaging modalities in the field of constrictive pericarditis (CP). Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the available techniques that are useful for the diagnosis and differentiation of CP from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Also, we provide illustrative images and videos of typical CP noninvasive imaging findings, as well as a diagnostic and management algorithm. CP is a challenging diagnosis; therefore, cardiologists need adequate knowledge about the application of multimodality noninvasive imaging in a systematic and guideline-oriented fashion whenever CP is suspected.
