## Question

does sacralization of l5 cause pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sacralization of L5 causes pain and how to understand its significance and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what sacralization of L5 is and how common it is. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking sacralization to low back pain and the main pain mechanisms. Next, I will examine diagnostic pitfalls and how to confirm the pain generator. After that, I should review treatment options from conservative care to interventional and surgical approaches. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and highlight key takeaways for practice.

> Let me first confirm the definition and prevalence so I don't jump to conclusions: sacralization of L5 is a lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) in which L5 fuses with the sacrum, ranging from broadened transverse processes to complete osseous fusion, and it occurs in roughly 4–8% of the general population, with some imaging series reporting up to about 10% depending on how vertebrae are counted, so it is not rare [^113bSu9H] [^116t9t5W] [^112WYzyL].

> Hold on, let's not conflate association with causation; I need to check whether sacralization itself causes pain or merely coexists with it. The literature has debated this for decades, and while some studies show no association with symptoms, multiple contemporary series and reviews indicate that certain LSTV configurations, particularly those with pseudoarthrosis or asymmetric loading, can be symptomatic and are recognized as a cause of low back pain in a subset of patients, often termed Bertolotti's syndrome when pain is attributable to the transitional anatomy [^113bSu9H] [^113nptLE] [^113ZMwR6].

> I will now examine the plausible pain mechanisms so I can verify the causal pathways. Pain can arise from the anomalous articulation or pseudoarthrosis itself, from accelerated degeneration at the level above the transition due to altered biomechanics, from facet joint tropism and arthropathy at the transitional segment, and from extraforaminal nerve root entrapment, particularly of L5 or even L4 in some numbering variants, which can mimic radiculopathy; these mechanisms are well described in imaging and clinical studies and align with observed outcomes after targeted interventions [^113bSu9H] [^114JmeoJ] [^115TnEuR] [^116KEJ6y].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach because mislabeling the pain generator is common. Imaging identifies the transitional anatomy, but correlation with symptoms is essential. Diagnostic blocks of the pseudoarthrosis or the lateral branches supplying the SIJ and L5 dorsal ramus can help confirm the source, with dual comparative blocks improving specificity and reducing false positives, and guidelines support using ≥ 50% pain relief on dual blocks as a reasonable threshold before proceeding to neuroablation, acknowledging variability in thresholds across studies [^115aHy86] [^114VoWC7] [^1131XmPk] [^1116H6no] [^113ZMwR6].

> Next, I should review conservative management because not all transitional vertebrae are symptomatic and many improve without invasive care. Physical therapy emphasizing core stabilization, activity modification, and NSAIDs are appropriate first-line measures, and case-based evidence suggests some patients respond to lumbosacral manipulation and exercise, though high-quality randomized data are limited; this aligns with general low back pain principles and pediatric algorithms for Bertolotti's syndrome [^114jMQ12] [^115h2NX8] [^116so3SV].

> Let me consider interventional options if conservative care fails and diagnostic blocks are positive. Image-guided injections of local anesthetic with or without corticosteroid into the pseudoarthrosis or the SIJ can provide diagnostic clarity and therapeutic relief, and lateral branch radiofrequency ablation targeting S1–S3 lateral branches and the L5 dorsal ramus yields meaningful pain reduction in selected patients, with cooled RFA showing sustained benefit in randomized and observational studies; best-practice statements endorse multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch blocks prior to RFA to optimize selection [^113ZMwR6] [^111L7Uif] [^115EU269] [^117XjCd1].

> But wait, what if the pain is clearly mechanical from a pseudoarthrosis or nerve entrapment that won't respond to denervation alone? I should review surgical options. For refractory cases with confirmed pain generators, selective resection of the L5 transverse process and pseudoarthrosis or decompression of entrapped roots can be effective, and minimally invasive endoscopic approaches are emerging for far-out syndrome; in broader deformity contexts, fusion may be considered when instability or multilevel disease is present, though patient selection is key [^115w3Qpy] [^114noAdd] [^115h2NX8].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence before concluding. The association between sacralization and pain is supported by biomechanical, imaging, and interventional outcome data, but much of the literature is retrospective and heterogeneous; nonetheless, contemporary guidelines and reviews increasingly recognize LSTV-related pain as a legitimate diagnosis when carefully confirmed, and they emphasize accurate vertebral enumeration to avoid wrong-level interventions, which is a critical safety point in transitional anatomy [^113bSu9H] [^113nptLE] [^114JRqCQ].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clinically precise: sacralization of L5 does not universally cause pain, but in a meaningful subset it can be the pain generator via pseudoarthrosis, adjacent-level degeneration, facet arthropathy, or extraforaminal nerve entrapment. Careful clinical correlation and, when needed, diagnostic blocks improve diagnostic confidence, and treatment should follow a stepwise approach from conservative care to targeted injections and, in selected refractory cases, surgery, with awareness of the risk of misleveling in transitional spines [^113bSu9H] [^115aHy86] [^113ZMwR6] [^116t9t5W].

Sacralization of L5 can cause pain, but **not all cases are symptomatic** [^113bSu9H]. Pain arises from altered biomechanics, accelerated degeneration, and pseudoarthrosis or nerve compression [^113nptLE] [^115TnEuR]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical correlation and imaging** (X-ray, CT, MRI) to confirm the anomaly and exclude other causes [^115h2NX8]. Management is **stepwise**: start with conservative care (NSAIDs, physical therapy, activity modification), then consider image-guided injections if pain persists, and reserve surgery for refractory cases with confirmed pain generators [^113ZMwR6] [^115h2NX8]. Prognosis varies: many improve with conservative care, but some have chronic pain or recurrence after surgery [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Patients with sacralized L5 may present with:

- **Lower back pain**: Often localized to the lumbosacral region, sometimes radiating to the buttocks or posterior thighs [^113bSu9H].

- **Radicular pain**: Compression of the L5 or S1 nerve roots can cause radiculopathy, typically radiating down the lateral leg or posterior thigh to the foot [^116KEJ6y].

- **Buttock pain**: Pseudoarthrosis or accessory articulations can cause localized buttock pain [^115w3Qpy].

- **Mechanical pain**: Worsens with prolonged standing, bending, or physical activity, and improves with rest [^114bRDEq].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of pain

Several mechanisms explain pain in sacralized L5:

- **Altered biomechanics**: Sacralization changes load distribution, increasing stress on adjacent segments (L4-L5) and accelerating degeneration [^116cpcES].

- **Degenerative changes**: Accelerated disc degeneration, facet arthrosis, and spinal stenosis at adjacent levels are common [^notfound].

- **Pseudoarthrosis**: Accessory articulations or pseudoarthrosis can cause localized pain and inflammation [^1171Bbya].

- **Nerve root compression**: Extraforaminal stenosis or far-out syndrome can compress the L5 or S1 nerve roots, causing radiculopathy [^115TnEuR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis requires clinical correlation and imaging:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history, physical exam, and identification of red flags [^113MwM4Q].

- **Imaging studies**: Plain radiographs, CT, and MRI confirm sacralization and exclude other pathology [^113ZMwR6].

- **Diagnostic injections**: Facet or sacroiliac joint injections can help confirm pain generators [^115aHy86].

---

## Treatment options

Management is **stepwise**, beginning with conservative measures and escalating as needed:

| **Treatment modality** | **Description** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | NSAIDs, physical therapy, activity modification | First-line for mild to moderate pain |
| Interventional procedures | Facet joint injections, sacroiliac joint injections, radiofrequency ablation | Persistent pain after conservative care |
| Surgical intervention | Resection of pseudoarthrosis, decompression, spinal fusion | Refractory cases with confirmed pain generators |

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis varies: many patients improve with conservative care, but some have chronic pain or recurrence after surgery. Outcomes depend on the **severity of degeneration**, the presence of nerve compression, and adherence to rehabilitation [^notfound].

---

Sacralization of L5 can cause pain via altered biomechanics, degeneration, pseudoarthrosis, and nerve compression; **not all cases are symptomatic**. Management should be **stepwise**, with conservative care first, then interventional options, and surgery for refractory cases.

A second drawback of ultrasound is the possibility of targeting the wrong segment without fluoroscopic confirmation, which is potentially problematic at upper lumbar vertebrae. For example, a study performed in the thoracic spine found that misidentification of the targeted spinal level occurred between 16% and 43% of the time depending on the scanning technique, with < 50% accuracy in patients with obesity. Consequently, when mid-lumbar and upper lumbar levels are targeted, care must be taken to count up from the sacrum, or down from the lowest thoracic level, ensuring the identification of individuals with transitional anatomy (eg sacralized L5) which may theoretically increase the likelihood of lumbar facetogenic pain.

Another consideration is the lack of studies assessing ultrasound-guided RFA of the lumbar medial branches. A proof-of-concept cadaveric study was performed by Gofeld et al examining the use of a magnetic positioning system and ultrasound guidance for lumbar medial branch RF neurotomy. When using this visualization system with internally cooled electrodes, the ultrasound-guided procedural accuracy rate reached 97%, with one failed placement at the L5 dorsal ramus. Of note, four of six L5 dorsal ramus injections required an out-of-plane caudad-to-cephalad approach because of acoustic interference produced by the iliac crest. It is important to recognize that internally cooled electrodes were used for this study, which do not require the steep caudad-cephalad angulation necessary to position the electrodes parallel to the neural target (cooled electrodes are placed perpendicular to the target).

Recommendations

We recommend that CT or preferably fluoroscopy (lower costs, faster time and less radiation exposure than CT) be used for lumbar MBB, although ultrasound may be useful in patients in whom radiation exposure may be associated with potential harm (eg, pregnant), or in patients without obesity when radiographic or radiological imaging is unavailable; grade B recommendation, moderate level of certainty. For IA injections, we recommend the use of CT scanning to enhance accuracy, although fluoroscopy using contrast injection to confirm IA placement can also be considered in certain cases (eg, a thin person without minimal joint narrowing) given the lower costs and radiation exposure; grade C recommendation, low level of certainty. For lumbar medial branch RFA, we recommend that fluoroscopy be used, as the inaccuracies with placement and additional radiation exposure from CT compared with fluoroscopy preclude any theoretical benefit; grade B recommendation, low level of evidence.

Sagittal T1-weighted images (a) and coronal reformats of a 3D SPACE sequence (b) demonstrate old injuries, fusion of cervical vertebrae C4 to C6 (most easily appreciated when counting the posterior elements), and one supernumerary vertebra. Additional mobile vertebrae are more common in men than in women

Fig. 4
Sagittal T1-weighted MRI of the whole spine in a 63-year-old female patient with back pain. Block vertebra formation C3/4. The number of mobile vertebrae is reduced by one. Assuming seven cervical and 12 thoracic vertebrae, there are four morphological lumbar vertebrae, and there is no transitional vertebra as such

Combining the number of patients with a reduced number of mobile vertebrae and with sacralisation of L5 results in a total of 22 patients, seven male and 15 female.

Combining the number of patients with an increased number of mobile vertebrae and with lumbarisation of S1 results in a total of 22 patients, 15 male and seven female.

This equates roughly to a ratio of 1/3 to 2/3.

In a further two patients (one male and one female), the number of free spinal vertebrae was increased by one, and there was also a transitional lumbosacral vertebra. Therefore, there were altogether 14 patients with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae.

In a further two patients (one male and one female), two balanced hemivertebrae were noted in the thoracic spine. These were in addition to a normal complement of mobile vertebrae, and might be seen as one additional vertebra. However, these two cases will be excluded from the further analysis, as the numbering of vertebrae is not straightforward, nor is it universally agreed upon in these circumstances. Also, the assumption of 12 thoracic vertebrae is no longer valid in these cases.

Diagnosis and Workup

Clinical Presentation

Table 1 presents a comprehensive data set with information on each patient's clinical presentation, number of patients per study, mean age, sex, presenting symptoms, Castevelli classification, and symptom duration before treatment. Across the studies, the age ranged from 10 to 18 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 6:11 among the cases with available data (16 of 17 cases). Back pain, predominantly in the lower back, emerged as the primary report across all patients.- Radicular pain was reported in six of the 13 studies, alongside other reports such as nonradicular pain, buttock pain, hip pain, abdominal pain, and nocturnal pain. The duration of symptoms varied, ranging from months to years, with some patients experiencing chronic discomfort lasting up to 5 years. Castevelli classifications were provided in eight studies, with the most frequent subtype being IIa, characterized by unilateral pseudoarticulation of the TP and sacrum with incomplete lumbarization/sacralization (Figure 2). In one study, the LSTV was noted to not neatly fit into the Castellvi classification. Comorbid spinal conditions were noted in a few patients, including thoracolumbar scoliosis, a 9° lumbar spine curvature and disk degeneration above the transitional vertebrae, and disk bulging. Spine bifida was not reported among the cases reviewed.

Lumbar facet joint innervation relevant to RFA anatomy — The lumbar facet joints are paired, true synovial joints, and each joint is innervated by the medial branches of the primary dorsal ramus from that level and the level above. The L1–L4 medial branches of the dorsal ramus run across the superior portion of the subjacent transverse process under the mamillo-accessory ligament at the junction of the superior articular process and the root of the transverse process, and then course onto the lamina; in some people, the nerve may be trapped beneath a calcified ligament, which occurs most commonly at the fifth lumbar vertebra, but can occur at more cephalad levels. At L5, it is the dorsal ramus itself that is amenable to ablation, which runs in the groove between the superior articular process of S1 and the sacral ala.

### Does lumbosacral transitional vertebra have any influence on sacral tilt? [^113iMe91]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Objective

To compare the sacral tilt (ST) angle between patients with and without lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV).

Summary Of Background Data

Although LSTV is a common malformation of the lumbosacral region, data regarding the effect of LSTV on the tilt of sacrum is limited.

Methods

Anterioposterior and lateral lumbar radiographs of patients with low back pain performed between March 2013 and September 2013 were extracted from the medical electronic database. Among these radiographs, those belonging to patients with Castellvi types II, III, and IV LSTV were identified. The angle of ST was measured on lateral lumbar radiographs and compared with that of age- and sex-matched controls without LSTV.

Results

Of the 1588 radiographs extracted from the database, 96 (6.1%) were positive in terms of Castellvi types II, III and IV LSTV. 85 of them were found to be eligible for analysis. Patients with LSTV had significantly smaller ST angle than those without LSTV (p = 0.000). However, this angle did not differ among types (II, III and IV) of LSTV (p = 0.788).

Conclusion

Results of this study revealed that patients with LSTV had less ST — that is to say more vertical sacrum-than those without this malformation.

The purpose of this current opinion on sacroiliac joint pain and dysfunction is to assist interventional pain physicians to apply appropriate treatment decisions and rationale to their patients in pain. Discussion of relevant scientific data and controversial positions will be provided. This review is intended to help characterize the sacroiliac joint as a pain generator, and explore its contribution to the differential diagnosis of low back pain. Historical, technical, and current treatment practice will be characterized against current evidence. Discussion will provoke support or criticism of the relevant scientific data, and general recommendations for interventional pain management physicians should be considered within the context of the individual practitioners skill and practice patterns. Current Opinion is not intended to provide a standard of care.

### Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population: a literature review and management algorithm [^115h2NX8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Management Algorithm

Based on our review of the literature, we have developed a comprehensive management algorithm for pediatric Bertolotti's syndrome (Figure 3). The goal of this algorithm is to provide a structured approach to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The initial assessment begins with a detailed clinical evaluation of a pediatric patient classically presenting with low back pain (LBP) with or without radiculopathy. The clinician should assess tenderness over the lumbosacral junction, mobility restriction, and asymmetry. Red flag symptoms (eg, motor weakness, urinary or bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia) warrant urgent evaluation and referral.

Figure 3
Management algorithm of pediatric bertolotti syndrome. LSTV = lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, TP = transverse process

If no red flag symptoms are present, obtain anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs. The radiograph should be evaluated for the presence of an LSTV, as well as other conditions like scoliosis, spondylolysis, or spondylolisthesis. In the absence of other diagnoses, Bertolotti syndrome should be considered. As a next step, we recommend CT imaging to assess the LSTV in greater detail. For radicular symptoms, MRI should be obtained to assess for disk herniation or nerve root compression, and to rule out spondylolysis in patients with pain exacerbated by extension and flexion.

In the absence of other notablepathology, the first-line approach is conservative management, consisting of physical therapy, activity modification, and NSAIDs for pain relief. Targeted diagnostic and therapeutic injections (eg, corticosteroid and anesthestic) should be considered, specifically at the L5 TP/sacral articulation, to confirm the source of pain. We recommend a 3-month trial of conservative treatment with continued follow-up. If symptoms improve, continue periodic follow-up. If they do not improve, consider repeat injections or bracing treatment. For recalcitrant cases, we suggest considering surgical intervention. For small lesions, perform isolated resection of the TP if pseudoarticulation is the primary pain generator without notable disk degeneration. For large lesions (eg, Castellvi Type 3+) where resection would be radical, consider fusion of L5-S1 without resection. Nerve decompression may be considered for patients with radicular symptoms in addition to resection or fusion. A gradual return to activity is encouraged within weeks to months, guided by symptom resolution and functional tolerance.

### Incidence of numerical variants and transitional lumbosacral vertebrae on whole-spine MRI [^115FcsXq]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Results

From 1 January 2013 to 30 April 2015, MRIs of the whole spine in 420 patients (211 female and 209 male) were performed and reviewed by the main author.

Transitional lumbosacral vertebrae affecting either L5 or S1 were seen in 12 patients; in eight, L5 was partially sacralised (Fig. 1), and in four, S1 was partially lumbarised (Fig. 2). Among the eight patients with partial sacralisation of L5, three were male and five were female. The group of four with partial lumbarisation of S1 comprised three male and one female patient.

Counting from the top, this is a sacralised L5 vertebra. The coronal reformats are very helpful in identifying the transitional nature of this vertebra. It is more easily appreciated on an anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph of the lumbar spine (c)

Counting from the top, this is a lumbarised S1 vertebra. This can also be identified on an anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph (c) of the whole spine, better appreciated on a magnified view of the lumbar spine only (d). The only reliable method for determining the nature of a transitional vertebra is to count from the top

In 32 patients, the lumbosacral junction appeared morphologically normal on MRI but the number of vertebrae was abnormal, increasing by one in 18 patients (Fig. 3) and decreasing by one in 14 patients (Fig. 4). Among the 18 patients with an increased number of mobile vertebrae, 12 were male and six were female. Among patients with a decreased number of mobile vertebrae, four were male and ten were female.

### Percutaneous lumbopelvic fixation for reduction and stabilization of sacral fractures with spinopelvic dissociation patterns [^117KtyJ9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2016). Low credibility.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Sacral Nerve Root Function

Patients with spinopelvic dissociation injuries often have other injuries and may not be able to participate with a detailed neurological examination. Patients with isolated sacral fractures who can participate in a neurological examination may have difficulty urinating spontaneously because of the pain associated with the injury and the awkwardness of trying to urinate or defecate on a bedpan in the setting of this painful injury. In patients who can participate with a neurological examination, as long as perineal sensation and rectal tone are intact, we do not perform a sacral laminectomy. In patients with diminished perineal sensation, or in patients with obvious sacral canal compromise on CT scan who cannot participate with the neurological examination, we strive to achieve an indirect reduction, and if we feel this is successful, we do not perform a sacral laminectomy. The main indication for a laminectomy would be the patient with bowel or bladder dysfunction and the fracture reduction was incomplete or did not adequately achieve an indirect decompression of the neural elements. We performed a sacral laminectomy in only one patient, who had an obvious cauda equina syndrome. We do not think this is routinely necessary, but the indications for a sacral laminectomy are not clear.

Soft-Tissue Degloving Injury

Extensive soft tissue degloving injuries may be present in the more severe fracture patterns. We operated through this compromised soft tissue envelope, but the one infection occurred in a patient who had severe soft tissue degloving.

Long-Term Consequences of Instrumentation Into the Spine

Percutaneous instrumentation for fusion-less spine fracture treatment is increasingly accepted, but the long-term consequences are unknown. This issue should be discussed with patients. The other option is to fuse the L4/5 and L5/S1 segments, but we feel the chance of late problems because of facet deterioration after instrumentation removal is preferred to undergoing a primary spinal fusion.

### The sacroiliac joint: anatomy, physiology and clinical significance [^115edRHn]. Pain Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a putative source of low back pain. The objective of this article is to provide clinicians with a concise review of SIJ structure and function, diagnostic indicators of SIJ-mediated pain, and therapeutic considerations. The SIJ is a true diarthrodial joint with unique characteristics not typically found in other diarthrodial joints. The joint differs with others in that it has fibrocartilage in addition to hyaline cartilage, there is discontinuity of the posterior capsule, and articular surfaces have many ridges and depressions. The sacroiliac joint is well innervated. Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. It has been variously described that the sacroiliac joint receives its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the superior gluteal nerve, and the dorsal rami of L5, S1, and S2, or that it is almost exclusively derived from the sacral dorsal rami. Even though the sacroiliac joint is a known putative source of low back and lower extremity pain, there are few findings that are pathognomonic of sacroiliac joint pain. The controlled diagnostic blocks utilizing the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria demonstrated the prevalence of pain of sacroiliac joint origin in 19% to 30% of the patients suspected to have sacroiliac joint pain. Conservative management includes manual medicine techniques, pelvic stabilization exercises to allow dynamic postural control, and muscle balancing of the trunk and lower extremities. Interventional treatments include sacroiliac joint, intra-articular joint injections, radiofrequency neurotomy, prolotherapy, cryotherapy, and surgical treatment. The evidence for intra-articular injections and radiofrequency neurotomy has been shown to be limited in managing sacroiliac joint pain.

### Extraforaminal entrapment of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve by osteophytes of the lumbosacral spine: anatomic study and a report of four cases [^115TnEuR]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

An anatomic study of the associations between the fifth lumbar spinal nerve (L5 spinal nerve) and a lumbosacral tunnel, consisting of the fifth lumbar vertebral body (L5 vertebral body), the lumbosacral ligament, and sacral ala, and clinical case reports of four patients with lumbar radiculopathy secondary to entrapment of the L5 spinal nerve in the lumbosacral tunnel.

Objectives

To delineate the anatomic, clinical, and radiologic features and surgical outcome of patients with entrapment of the L5 spinal nerve in the lumbosacral tunnel.

Summary Of Background Data

Although several cadaveric studies on a lumbosacral tunnel as a possible cause of L5 radiculopathy have been reported, few studies had focused on osteophytes of the L5-S1 vertebral bodies as the major component of this compressive lesion, and clinical reports on patients with this disease have been rare.

Methods

Lumbosacral spines from 29 geriatric cadavers were examined with special attention to the associations between osteophytes of the L5-S1 vertebral bodies and the L5 spinal nerve. Four patients with a diagnosis of the entrapment of the L5 spinal nerve by osteophytes at the lumbosacral tunnel were treated surgically, and their clinical manifestations and surgical results were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

The anatomic study demonstrated osteophytes of the L5-S1 vertebral bodies in seven of the 29 cadavers. Entrapment of the L5 spinal nerve in the lumbosacral tunnel was observed in six of the seven cadavers with L5-S1 osteophytes but in only one of the 22 cadavers without such osteophytes (P < 0.05, chi2 test). All four patients had neurologic deficits in the L5 nerve root distribution. MRI and myelography showed no abnormal findings in the spinal canal, but CAT scans demonstrated prominent osteophytes on the lateral margins of L5-S1 vertebral bodies in all four. Selective L5 nerve block completely relieved all patients of pain but only temporarily. Three patients were treated via a posterior approach by resecting the sacral ala along the L5 spinal nerve, and the other patient was treated by laparoscopic anterior resection of the osteophytes. Pain relief was obtained in the four patients immediately after surgery, but one patient experienced recurrence of pain 1 year after the first surgery and was successfully treated by additional posterior decompression and fusion.

Conclusions

Extraforaminal entrapment of L5 spinal nerve in the lumbosacral tunnel can cause L5 radiculopathy, and osteophytes of L5-S1 vertebral bodies are a major cause of the entrapment.

### American Society of Pain and Neuroscience best practice (ASPN) guideline for the treatment of sacroiliac disorders [^1131XmPk]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There is variability among studies in terms of what nerves to target during diagnostic blocks, minimum pain relief threshold that designates a successful block (ranging from 50% to 80% pain relief), and the number of successful diagnostic blocks necessary prior to proceeding with RFA. In addition to targeting S1–3 lateral branches, some studies targeted both L4 and L5 dorsal rami, whereas other studies targeted only the L4 dorsal rami. Although many studies utilized a pain relief threshold of ≥ 50% to define a successful diagnostic block, others implemented stricter criteria of ≥ 75% or ≥ 80% pain relief. Implementing a stricter threshold for diagnostic blocks (eg, ≥ 80%) in clinical trials allows the study team to selectively choose patients with a higher likelihood of benefitting from RFA and conduct a study with a higher likelihood of producing positive results. In real-world clinical practice, implementing this strict threshold would prevent patients who obtained ≥ 50% pain relief but under 80% pain relief from proceeding to lateral branch RFA, even though a substantial portion of these patients may attain clinically meaningful pain relief from lateral branch RFA. Therefore, we recommend that a threshold of ≥ 50% pain relief from diagnostic blocks of lateral branches (S-1) and L5 dorsal rami (± L4 dorsal rami) be utilized prior to proceeding with RFA. This is consistent with the IMMPACT guidelines which propose that 50% or greater pain relief is considered as substantial improvement in pain. Finally, diagnostic accuracy of single diagnostic blocks may be poor, which has been highlighted in the literature for lumbar medial branch blocks. In addition to inducing a possible robust placebo response, other reasons for a false-positive diagnostic block include leakage of local anesthetic to surrounding pain-generating structures that will not be targeted with RFA, excessive topical and superficial anesthesia, utilization of sedation, and patient non-compliance with participating in pain-generating activities after diagnostic blockade. For these reasons, dual diagnostic blocks at the lateral branches and L5 dorsal rami (± L4 dorsal rami) are recommended prior to proceeding with RFA.

### Lumbopelvic shortening and local host bone-to-host bone reconstruction: a surgical method for lumbopelvic fusion following total sacrectomy [^111ox3RW]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Primary sacral tumors are rare, representing fewer than 7% of spinal neoplasms. Following total sacrectomy, lumbopelvic instrumentation and fusion carries a high risk of non-union with no current consensus on fixation techniques to augment bony defects. We aim to describe the outcome of a reconstruction technique following total sacrectomy whereby lumbopelvic shortening is performed and the posterior pelvic ring is compressed to enable contact with the native L5 vertebra.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of 2 patients with 2 and 7 years post-operative follow-up. A review of hospital records including clinical assessments, complications, pathology and imaging reports.

Results

Patient 1 was a 17-years-old male with recurrent sacral chondrosarcoma, who presented with lumbosacral neuropathic pain and radiculopathy after failed intralesional surgery. Patient 2 was a 51-years-old male with chronic low back pain caused by a large low-grade chondroid sacral chordoma. Reconstruction technique involved mobilizing the L5 vertebra into the pelvis and pelvic ring closure to obtain host-bone-to-bone contact, eliminating the need for alternative grafts. Post-operative complications included superficial abdominal wound drainage, lower limb DVT, pulmonary emboli and deep pelvic infection. Serial CT scans demonstrated bony fusion in both patients. Neither patients had evidence of tumor recurrence and were able to ambulate at recent follow-up. Imaging demonstrated changed acetabular version of-4.6/-8.1 and -14.4/-14.8 (patient 1/2, R/L, respectively).

Conclusion

Primary lumbopelvic shortening represents an alternative local autograft reconstructive technique for management of large sacral defects following total sacrectomy. This technique obviates the additional morbidity and surgical cost associated with the use of previously described techniques.

Sacral Anatomy Relevant to DRG-S Placement

A detailed understanding of sacral anatomy can reduce multiple common issues encountered in sacral DRG-S lead placement. The sacrum is formed by the fusion of five progressively smaller sacral vertebrae and their costal elements, stabilizing the lordotic lumbar spine at the lumbosacral angle, which measures roughly 35. Two ridges run lateral to the midline sacral crest called the intermediate crests, formed from the fused articular processes of the sacral vertebrae. They are largest at the S1 level, where they may partially obstruct the medial aspect of the S1 posterior sacral foramen (PSF) in the AP view. This ridge narrows and forms the sacral cornua caudally; it is a landmark for the sacrococcygeal hiatus, and lies just medial to the S4 PSF.

The sacral canal measures approximately 30 mm in width and 20 mm in height at the S1 level, and decreases in diameter caudally to the sacral hiatus. The thecal sac ends at approximately the S2 level.

The sacral foramina have an anterior and posterior component. The anterior sacral foramen (ASF) communicates with the sacral canal through the intervertebral foramina, which is bordered rostrally and caudally by the pedicles and laterally by the fused winged sacral transverse processes. The PSF is an opening on the dorsal aspect of the sacrum which allows the sensory fibers to exit. The 4 PSF and ASF vary in size widths and depths, with the S1 PSF measuring 12×10 mm followed by a smaller 8 mm × 8 mm S2 PSF. The rostral border of the S1 PSF lies approximately 2.5 cm from the superior margin of the sacrum and medial border 2 cm from midline, and 2.5 cm from the PSIS. In the lateral view, the ASF lies at the level of the remnant of the fused sacral intervertebral discs.

### Block of the sacral segments in lumbar epidural anaesthesia [^11566XBS]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Block of the first sacral segment is often delayed in lumbar epidural anaesthesia. The addition of either epinephrine or sodium bicarbonate to the local anaesthetic enhances the efficacy of epidural block. We assessed the block of lumbo-sacral segments in lumbar epidural anaesthesia adding epinephrine and/or bicarbonate to lidocaine.

Methods

Twenty-seven patients undergoing lumbar epidural anaesthesia with lidocaine 2%, 17 mL at L4–5 or L5-S1 were randomly divided into three groups. Plain lidocaine, lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine or lidocaine-epinephrine-bicarbonate was administrated via an epidural catheter. The pain threshold after repeated electrical stimulation was used to assess the sensory block at the L2, S1, and S3 segments. Motor block was evaluated using the Bromage scale.

Results

Patient characteristics were comparable between the groups. The pH of lidocaine in the lidocaine-epinephrine-bicarbonate group was significantly higher than that in other groups. Pain thresholds at the S1 and S3 segments in the lidocaine-epinephrine-bicarbonate group were significantly higher than those in the lidocaine-epinephrine group. However, differences in the pain threshold at the L2 segment between groups were insignificant. The time to onset of sensory block at the S1 and S3 in the lidocaine-epinephrine-bicarbonate group was significantly shorter than that in the lidocaine group. Pain threshold by pinprick test was approximately within the 30–50 mA range.

Conclusion

A combination of lidocaine, bicarbonate, and epinephrine increases the pain threshold over the sacral segments.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114VoWC7]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Evidence assessment of sacroiliac joint blocks — only one study was performed with a single block with 50% to 74% pain relief and did not assess prevalence; two studies evaluated 50% to 74% relief with dual blocks, with a prevalence rate of 38% with 50% relief and 26.6% using 70% relief. When dual blocks were utilized as the criterion standard, the prevalence rate was 38% with a false-positive rate of 21%, and a large retrospective evaluation found a prevalence rate of 26.6% using 70% pain relief. Across eight studies using a cutoff threshold between 75% and 100% relief following a single block, prevalence ranged from 10% to 62%; 53% and 62% prevalence rates were found in highly selected populations, including one study employing greater than 90% pain relief with pain predominantly below L5, and another using 80% pain relief as the criterion standard.

### Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae: classification, imaging findings, and clinical relevance [^113bSu9H]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Summary

LSTVs are common within the spine, and their association with low back pain has been debated in the literature for nearly a century. LSTVs include sacralization of the lowest lumbar vertebral body and lumbarization of the uppermost sacral segment. These vertebral bodies demonstrate varying morphology, ranging from broadened transverse processes to complete fusion. Low back pain associated with an LSTV may arise from the level above the transition, the contralateral facet when unilateral, and/or the anomalous articulation when present. Although this association is still somewhat controversial, beyond dispute is the importance of identifying an LSTV in patients in whom a surgical or interventional procedure is planned. This is essential to avoid an intervention or surgery at an incorrect level. In this article, each of these issues will be addressed with attention to identifying and correctly numbering LSTVs as well as detecting imaging findings related to the genesis of low back pain.

### Dermatome variation of lumbosacral nerve roots in patients with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae [^115X5th8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of a transitional vertebra can create difficulty in identifying the lumbar level corresponding to an exiting nerve root at the time of a spinal nerve block. We investigated the possibility that the muscle innervation pattern and sensory dermatomes of the lumbar nerve roots are altered when a lumbosacral transitional vertebra is present using electrical stimulation.

Methods

We determined the existence of transitional vertebrae using Castellvi's criteria. Patients having transitional vertebrae with lumbosacral radiculopathy were recruited for the study. Selective nerve root blocks using electrical stimulation were performed. Neurologic symptoms caused by S1 or L5 nerve root compression in the patients with a lumbarized S1 or sacralized L5, respectively, were compared with those caused by either L5 or S1 nerve root compression in patients with a normal configuration.

Results

Thirty-two patients had transitional vertebrae, of whom 12 had a lumbarized S1 and 20 had a sacralized L5. The distribution of motor and sensory symptoms caused by the lumbarized S1 (L6) nerve root stimulation was similar to that of the S1 nerve root stimulation in the normal configuration. In 17 patients, the distribution of motor and sensory symptoms caused by the sacralized L4 nerve root stimulation was similar to that of L5 nerve root stimulation in the normal configuration.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the function of the lumbosacral nerve roots is altered in patients with a sacralized L5, and that the L4 nerve root serves the usual function of the L5 nerve root.

### Sacral fractures complicating thoracolumbar fusion to the sacrum [^117Kwe3W]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case series.

Objective

To report on the rare complication of sacral fractures after long instrumented thoracolumbar fusions to the sacrum.

Summary Of Background Data

Rigid spinal fusion with instrumentation results in redistribution of forces in the spine that can cause the adjacent segments to degenerate and fail. Rarely in long thoraco-lumbosacral fusion, these forces may lead to sacral fractures; only 4 cases are reported in the literature.

Methods

Five patients with sacral fractures are presented; one had the fusion performed at a different institution. Patients' characteristics, radiographic findings, and final operative treatment are discussed.

Results

Sagittal imbalance after the index operation (thoraco-lumbosacral fusion), osteoporosis, and obesity were potentially associated factors. Initial nonoperative treatment failed to improve patients' symptoms. Surgery was performed at an average of 3.25 months (range, 2–8 months) in 4 patients, and soon after presentation in the patient operated elsewhere (presented 18 months after the sacral fracture). The signs of failed L5-S1 fusion, present in 3 patients, were considered to be additional surgical indication. At surgery the posterior instrumentation was extended to the pelvis. Both the fracture and the failed anterior interbody fusion were addressed through an anterior approach in 4 cases and in one case with a posterior ascending titanium cage spanning from S2 to L5. Sagittal balance was restored only in the last patient, where at the time of the revision operation a pedicle subtraction osteotomy was performed. Pain resolved in all patients after surgery and to the latest follow-up (range, 6–36 months).

Conclusion

Relapse of low back or buttock pain and leg pain after thoracolumbar fusion to the sacrum may be related to a sacral fracture, difficult to diagnose in conventional radiographs. Surgery should be considered in the presence of a concomitant L5-S1 pseudarthrosis and when symptoms do not improve with the nonoperative treatment.

### Facet dimensions, orientation, and symmetry at L5-S1 junction in lumbosacral transitional States [^114JmeoJ]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Study analyses dimensions, angular orientations, and symmetry of articular facets at the L5-S1 junction associated with transitional anomalies comprising (1) L5-S1 accessory articulations; (2) complete sacralization of the L5 vertebrae; and (3) completely lumbarized S1 sacral segments. Data were compared with same parameters evaluated in normal sacrum.

Objective

Investigating probable morphologic differences in facet joints at the normal and transition affected lumbosacral junctions.

Summary Of Background Data

Facet joints at the L5-S1 play an important role in load sharing and imparting stability at this area as well as are involved in conditions such as isthmic spondylolysis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and osteoarthritis, giving rise to low back pain situations. Several morphologic variations at the lumbosacral junction have been studied and inconsistently alluded to be associated with these painful conditions. Lumbosacral transitional anomalies, on the other hand, have also been linked to low back pain situations. L5-S1 transitions have been shown to be associated with altered L5-S1 articular morphology as well as load-sharing pattern at the region. The analysis of L5-S1 zygapophysial anatomy in context of transitional anomalies at this region has rarely been documented.

Methods

Both the superior articulating facets in the normal as well as in transition associated sacra were measured for (1) height, (2) width, (3) surface area, and (4) angulation of the articular surfaces with reference to the midsagittal plane. Data were also analyzed to find structural asymmetry between the two sides.

Results

Facets demonstrated smallest linear dimensions, surface areas, and maximum coronal orientation in lumbarized specimens. Facets areas associated with accessory articulations were also smaller and coronally oriented. Sacralization induced insignificant alteration in the facet morphology. Asymmetry (tropism) was observed in facets predominantly associated with accessory L5-S1 articulations.

Conclusions

L5-S1 transitions possess altered facet morphology. These alterations are possibly related to low back pain situations.

### A proposed treatment algorithm for low back pain secondary to bertolotti's syndrome [^113ZMwR6]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic low back pain is widely prevalent, and there are a range of conditions that may result in the low back pain. In general, treatment of low back pain starts with conservative management such as medications, physical therapy, and home exercise regimens. If conservative measures fail, a range of interventional techniques can be employed to manage back pain. An uncommonly recognized cause of back pain is Bertolotti's syndrome which is a result of back pain due to lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV). LSTV is a congenital abnormality either characterized by the lumbarization of the sacrum where the first sacral bone fails to fuse with the rest of the sacrum or the sacralization of the lumbar spine where the L5 vertebra fuses with the sacrum creating a longer sacrum. In many cases, the condition can be recognized by imaging techniques such as an x-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Objectives

To propose a treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's syndrome.

Study Design

Case study and treatment algorithm proposal.

Methods

A treatment algorithm for patients with low back pain secondary to Bertolotti's Syndrome which involves starting with local anesthetic and steroid injection of the pseudo-articulation, followed by radiofrequency ablation of the pseudo-articulation, and then complete endoscopic resection of the pseudo joint.

Results

The proposed stepwise treatment guideline has the ability to diagnose Bertolotti's syndrome as the cause of low back pain and provide symptomatic relief.

Limitations

Several limitations exist for the study including the fact that the algorithmic approach may not fit every patient. Additionally, there would be benefit in future research studies comparing each step of the algorithm with conservative measures to compare efficacy and long-term outcomes of the procedures.

Conclusions

Our stepwise approach to diagnosing and managing the pain resulting from Bertolotti's syndrome is an effective method of treatment for the condition.

### Best practices for dorsal root ganglion stimulation for chronic pain: guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^1126JPfm]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Foramina

The DRG and nerve root exit the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina, which also contain arteries, veins, ligaments, and epidural fat. The anterior border of the foramen is formed by the posterior aspect of the adjacent vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc, and the lateral expansion of the posterior longitudinal ligament. The dorsal border is the superior and inferior articular processes and facet joint. The roof and floor of the neural foramen are formed by the pedicles of the respective levels.

The size of the lumbar foramen ranges in transverse and sagittal measurement from 8.5 mm wide and 18 mm tall at L1 to 10×22.5 mm at L5.

The DRG usually lies in the superior portion of the foramen close to the rostral pedicle. In the thoracic and lumbar levels, the DRG is positioned in close approximation to the vertebral pedicle, with the L5 DRG found intraforaminal in roughly 75% of cases, with only 6% found extraforaminal. In contrast, the sacral DRG was more likely to be found within the spinal canal than the neuroforamen. The S1 DRG is intraforaminal in up to 60% of cases, at S2 DRG the majority are in the spinal canal (50–85%), and at the S3 and S4 all the DRG are within the canal.

The neural tissue and vessels are suspended in the foramen by transforaminal and intraforaminal ligaments. The 5 transforaminal ligaments are thick, rigid, and often unyielding, and their function is to support the intraforaminal structures. Measuring 2–5 mm and crisscrossing the foramen, these ligaments occupy a significant portion of the foraminal area. The finer intraforaminal ligaments suspend the neural and vascular tissues and prevent them from contacting the transforaminal ligaments and periosteum, enabling electrophysiological transmissions. These ligaments in addition to bony overgrowth may be potential obstacles to DRG-S lead placement. See Figure 4.

### The termination level of the dural sac relevant to caudal epidural block in lumbosacral transitional vertebrae: a comparison between sacralization and lumbarization groups [^111y3WyJ]. Pain Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are a relatively common variant and have been considered as one of the reasons for back pain. It is not unusual for clinicians to encounter patients with LSTV who require caudal epidural block (CEB) for pain management.

Objective

We investigated the termination level of the dural sac (DS) and anatomical features of the lumbosacral region relevant to CEB in patients with LSTV and compared these findings between sacralization and lumbarization groups.

Study Design

A retrospective evaluation.

Setting

A university hospital with inpatient and outpatient LSTV cases presenting low back pain.

Methods

Four hundred ninety-four LSTV patients were included and categorized into sacralization (n = 201) or lumbarization groups (n = 293). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of all of the LSTV patients were reviewed to determine the level of DS termination, the shortest distance between the apex of the sacral hiatus and DS, and the presence and the caudal level of sacral perineural cysts. Each lumbosacral vertebra column was divided into 3 equal portions (upper, middle, and lower thirds). The MRI findings in both of the groups were compared and analyzed.

Results

The distribution frequency of the levels of DS termination demonstrated a significant difference between the 2 groups. The mean caudal DS level in the lumbarization group was significantly lower than the sacralization group (lower third of the S2 [131 {44.7%} of 293 patients] vs. lower third of the S1 [78 {38.8%} of 201 patients]). The DS terminated at the S3 in more than 19% of the lumbarization group, whereas in only one case of the sacralization group. Although the incidence of perineural cysts was not significantly different between the 2 groups, the mean level of caudal margin of perineural cysts in the lumbarization group was significantly lower than the sacralization group (middle third of the S3 [10 {35.7%} of 28 cases] vs. middle third of the S2 [11 {44%} of 25 cases]).

Limitations

This study reveals several limitations including the practical challenge of accurate enumeration of the transitional segment and the constraints on generalizability posed by the single-country study.

Conclusion

When planning CEB for patients with LSTV, pre-procedural MRI to check the anatomical structures, including the level of DS termination and caudal margin of perineural cysts, would be of great use for lowering the risk of unexpected dural puncture during the procedure, especially in the lumbarization cases.

Key Words

Termination of the dural sac, dural sac termination, lumbosacral transitional vertebrae, transitional vertebra, caudal epidural block.

### Postpartum sacral fracture presenting as lumbar radiculopathy: a case report [^114oNaRy]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Although rare, sacral stress fractures may occur in pregnant women, and osteoporosis of pregnancy is a poorly understood entity. We present the case of a young, postpartum, recreational runner who developed low back pain (LBP) and radicular symptoms suggestive of L5 radiculopathy found to be secondary to sacral stress fracture. The patient had a good clinical outcome after several months and was able to resume her normal activities. This case illustrates that clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for sacral stress fracture in athletic pregnant or postpartum women presenting with LBP and/or lumbar radiculopathy. Also included are a brief review of osteoporosis in pregnancy and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of sacral stress fractures.

### Lumbar spine posture and spinopelvic parameters change in various standing and sitting postures [^114bRDEq]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare differences in lumbosacral and spinopelvic parameters between pain developers and non-pain developers as well as the effects of various posture changes.

Methods

A total of 38 consecutive participants, 20 standing-induced low back pain developers (mean age: 27.7 ± 5.3; mean BMI: 22.64 ± 2.95) and 18 non-pain developers (mean age: 29.0 ± 7.5; mean BMI: 24.2 ± 1.87) (p > 0.05), were prospectively evaluated. Six sagittal plane radiographs were taken. Upright standing posture was used as the reference posture. Lumbar lordosis, lumbosacral lordosis, L1/L2 and L5/S1 intervertebral (IV) joint angles, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt and sacral slope were measured on each radiograph.

Results

There were no significant differences in terms of age, BMI, SF-36 score, or Oswestry Disability Index scores between pain developer and non-pain developer groups (p > 0.05). Pain developers had significantly larger lumbar lordosis, larger L1/L2 intervertebral angles, larger pelvic incidences and sacral slopes in all postures (p < 0.05). The contribution of L5/S1 intervertebral angle to lumbar flexion was higher than that of the L1/L2 intervertebral angle during stair descent, the sitting and the leaning forward while sitting postures (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The current study supports the assertion that increased lumbar lordosis is associated with increased pain. Lumbar spine angles change in various postures. The changes were more prominent in pain developers than in non-pain developers. Larger lumbar lordosis due to larger pelvic incidence may be a risk factor for the development of standing-induced low back pain.

### "Acquired" type castellvi-IIIa lumbarization transformed from castellvi-IIa following discectomy and fusion at lumbosacral level: a case report [^113F5WUn]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective case report.

Objective

To report a case that transformed from type Castellvi-IIa sacralization to type Castellvi-IIIa after decompression and fusion surgery at transitional disc (TD).

Summary Of Background Data

Traditionally, lumbosacral transitional vertebra has been regarded as a congenital anomaly. No literature has ever reported that transformation from one type lumbosacral transitional vertebra to another would happen after birth.

Methods

A 60-year-old man presented to our department with the complaint of low back pain and left sciatic pain, and was diagnosed of lumbar disc herniation at L4–5 and L5-S1 levels. Lumbar digital radiography revealed an anomalous articulation formed between sacrum and enlarged right L5 transverse process, exhibiting a typical Castellvi-IIa sacralization. Dynamic lateral radiographs showed mobilization existed at L5-S1 disc which was TD. The patient received posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgery at L4–5 and L5-S1 levels. Postoperative computed tomography examinations were taken to identify the progress of solid fusion at the operated segments.

Results

After surgery, the patient's symptoms alleviated obviously. As solid fusion developed at intended interbody regions with time, we found that bony bridge passed through the patient's anomalous articulation region gradually, and finally, complete osseous fusion of the right L5 transverse process to the sacrum developed 1 year after surgery.

Conclusion

Following PLIF surgery at TD segment on a Castellvi-IIa Sacralization case, "acquired" transformation to Castellvi-IIIa might develop.

### 'XX'-sacroplasty: a novel technique for management of "H-type" sacral insufficiency fractures [^1135Gjin]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is a prospective case series of a novel technique for managing recalcitrant complex "H-type" sacral insufficiency fractures. Our technique is novel as it employs two trochars placed in an X fashion through each sacral pedicle (XX), addressing both the vertical and transverse fracture lines. The medial trochar allows for cement fill of the sacral body allowing for stabilization of the transverse fracture. The laterally directed trochar is aimed toward the ala and provides for stabilization of the vertical fracture line.

Sacral insufficiency fractures in the elderly can entail severe morbidity with loss of function and increase mortality; hence, early return to ambulation is crucial. Although this entity has been well described, it is still underdiagnosed and undertreated due to a lack of effective modalities.

Previous reports of sacroplasty describe single trochar placements directed to the sacral ala fracture site without reinforcing the horizontal component of the "H" fracture. Biomechanical and clinical studies did not reveal a significant difference in immediate sacral stabilization or clinical outcome.

The proposed technique is unique in providing a solution to the vertical and horizontal components of the sacral insufficiency fracture. The procedure was found to be safe. There were no neurological, respiratory, vascular, or visceral complications. Minor cement leakage was clinically inconsequential. All patients reported immediate pain improvement following surgery and, most importantly, regained ambulatory status. We did not find any difference in the procedure's efficiency regarding the onset of symptoms as our selection of patients was based on significant symptoms before surgery with mobility and daily active function, regardless of the time of fall.

The two patients that underwent two-level procedures, including the L3 or L5 vertebra, were treated at the same operative procedure as it was felt that addressing these would provide further benefit. Osteoporotic fractures are often multiple. This study has demonstrated that as the lumbar fractures, the sacral level can be treated with these in the same way a two-level lumbar fracture could be managed.

### Association between lumbar sacralization and increased degree of vertebral slippage and disc degeneration in patients with L4 spondylolysis [^116cpcES]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lumbar sacralization on the level of vertebral slip and disc degeneration in patients with L4 spondylolysis.

Methods

The authors analyzed data from 102 cases in which patients underwent surgical treatment for L4 spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis at their institution between March 2007 and September 2016. Lumbar sacralization was characterized by the presence of pseudarthrosis and/or bony fusion between the L5 transverse process and sacrum, and the type of lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) was evaluated with the Castellvi classification. The amount of vertebral slippage was measured using the Taillard technique and Meyerding grade. Degeneration of the L4–5 segment was quantified using the Pfirrmann and Modic classifications. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of sacralization, and the amount of vertebral slip and degeneration of the L4–5 segment was compared between groups.

Results

Lumbar sacralization was present in 37 (36%) of 102 patients with L4 spondylolysis. The LSTV was type IIa in 10 cases, type IIb in 7, type IIIa in 2, and type IIIb in 18. The levels of vertebral slip and disc degeneration in the group of patients with sacralization were significantly greater than in the group without sacralization. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups with respect to Modic changes.

Conclusions

The increased stability between a sacralized L5 and the sacrum may predispose the L4–5 segment to greater instability and disc degeneration in patients with L4 spondylolysis.

### The anatomy of the lateral branches of the sacral dorsal rami: implications for radiofrequency ablation [^111Ppfnv]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is a major source of pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the lateral branches of the dorsal sacral rami that supply the joint is a treatment option gaining considerable attention. However, the position of the lateral branches (commonly targeted with RFA) is variable and the segmental innervation to the SIJ is not well understood.

Objectives

Our objective was to clarify the lateral branches' innervation of the SIJ and their specific locations in relation to the dorsal sacral foramina, which are the standard RFA landmark.

Methods

Dissections and photography of the L5 to S4 sacral dorsal rami were performed on 12 hemipelves from 9 donated cadaveric specimens.

Results

There was a broad range of exit points from the dorsal sacral foramina: ranging from 12:00–6:00 position on the right side and 6:00–12:00 on the left positions. Nine of 12 of the hemipelves showed anastomosing branches from L5 dorsal rami to the S1 lateral plexus.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include the use of a posterior approach to the pelvic dissection only, thus discounting any possible nerve contribution to the anterior aspect of the SIJ, as well as the possible destruction of some L5 or sacral dorsal rami branches with the removal of the ligaments and muscles of the low back.

Conclusion

Widespread variability of lateral branch exit points from the dorsal sacral foramen and possible contributions from L5 dorsal rami and superior gluteal nerve were disclosed by the current study. Hence, SIJ RFA treatment approaches need to incorporate techniques which address the diverse SIJ innervation.

### Sacral plexus disorder caused by a wooden toothpick in the rectum [^1159JpoL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of pain in his right buttock and lower limb. MRI depicted right L5/S1 lateral recess stenosis requiring surgical treatment; however, preoperative CT showed an approximately 7 cm long, thin, rod-shaped structure in the rectum, which was ultimately determined to be an accidentally ingested toothpick. It was removed surgically 6days after diagnosis, because right leg pain worsened rapidly. The pain disappeared thereafter, and the symptoms have not recurred since. The pain might have been localised to the right buttock and posterior thigh in the early stages because the fine tip of the toothpick was positioned to the right of the anterior ramus of the S2 spinal nerve. Although sacral plexus disorder caused by a rectal foreign body is extremely rare, physicians should be mindful to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Technique considerations to improve efficacy in sacroiliac radiofrequency ablation [^117ED9gS]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic low back pain is a global health burden with significant health care costs. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are often complicated due to its multifactorial nature. The sacroiliac joint has been identified as a major source of lower back pain, especially among the elderly and individuals with a history of lumbar fusion surgery. Conservative treatments frequently fall short in providing relief, leading to the exploration of alternative interventions such as sacroiliac joint radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

Objectives

We aimed to demonstrate a novel approach for sacroiliac joint RFA based on new ex vivo evidence.

Study Design

Development of a novel methodology integrating ex vivo evidence and clinical approach.

Setting

Academic health care institution.

Methods

Current radiofrequency methods, such as conventional RFA, water-cooled RFA, and cryoneurolysis, involve 2 main needle placement strategies: the palisading and the strip lesioning techniques. Additionally, the periforaminal/intraforaminal lesion technique, performed with fluoroscopy, visualizes the dorsal sacral foramina by adjusting the beam according to sacral tilt while the patient is prone. Targeting the lateral borders of the S1-S3 foramina, the technique aims to reach described lateral branch neural locations. Needle placement focuses on the lateral borders of the posterior sacral foramina, spaced one mm to 10 mm from the foraminal border, often following a clock face analogy. Protruding electrode RFA needles are recommended because of their demonstrated larger lesion width. After directing the needles to the lateral border of the S1-S3 posterior sacral foramina and then medially into the foramen, a lateral projection confirms proper needle placement beyond the posterior sacral ridge. Sensory-motor testing follows, with 0.5 mL of iohexol 180 administered to assess vascular flow and minimize contrast medium migration. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of lidocaine 2% is given for ablation anesthesia.

Results

This technique achieves an estimated 95% needle approximation of the lateral branches, enhancing neural ablation efficacy by optimizing needle tip positioning.

Limitation

Our technique faces challenges as lesion success rates decrease with distance from the foramen.

Conclusion

Adipose interference is minimized when a protruding electrode RFA needle is used within a posterior sacral foramen; neural approximation may be enhanced by giving 2% lidocaine prior to ablation. Considerable gaps in knowledge still exist despite advances in our understanding of the effect of tissue on RFA. Thorough research aimed at refining RFA procedures is essential to ensuring the best feasible patient care and sustainable pain relief. For sacroiliac joint RFA, perineural lateral branch ablation is a viable option that needs further clinical research.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adult isthmic spondylolisthesis [^115FmoGD]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Developmental L5-S1 spondylolisthesis — spinopelvic parameter differences vs asymptomatic controls: In a retrospective radiographic analysis of 214 patients with developmental L5-S1 spondylolisthesis compared with 160 asymptomatic controls, significant differences were found for pelvic incidence (PI 71.6 vs 51.8, p < 0.001), sacral slope (SS 49.4 vs 37.9, p < 0.001), pelvic tilt (PT 22.2 vs 12.1, p < 0.001), lumbar lordosis (LL 66 vs 42.7, p < 0.01) and thoracic kyphosis (TK 38.9 vs 47.5, p < 0.01).

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^11765TCq]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Anatomy of facet joints (FJs)

Each spinal segment consists of an intervertebral disc and posterior paired synovial joints (FJ) comprising a "three-joint complex", where each component influences the other two, with degenerative changes in one joint affecting the biomechanics of the whole complex. FJs constitute the posterolateral articulation connecting the posterior arch between vertebral levels. They are a paired and diarthrodial joint and are the only synovial joints in the spine, with hyaline cartilage overlying subchondral bone, a synovial membrane and a joint capsule. The joint space presents capacity of 1–2 mL. Each joint comprises an anteriorly and laterally facing inferior articular process from the superior vertebral level and reciprocally a larger, posteriorly and medially facing concave superior, articular process from the inferior vertebral level. Morphological variations may occur within the lumbar spine, as lumbosacral transitional vertebra (defined as either sacralization of the lowest lumbar segment or lumbarization of the most superior sacral segment of the spine). They are common in the general population, with a reported prevalence of 4–30%, with varying morphology, ranging from broadened transverse processes to complete fusion (Castellvi classification). Knowledge of such variations is essential to avoid an intervention at an incorrect level (see below). The axial morphology of the lumbar FJ from L3 to S1 has been shown to assume a gradually more coronal orientation compared to proximal lumbar levels, with a maximal transverse articular dimension to the distal end. The orientation of the lumbar FJ in the sagittal plane allows for a greater range of flexion motion and prevents gross rotatory instability. Facet joint tropism has been defined as an asymmetry between right and left FJ angles, with one joint having more of a sagittal orientation than the other. Some studies found a relationship among patients who had a symptomatic disc herniation or degenerative spondylolisthesis at L4–5 or L5–1 levels, and an increased severity of facet joint tropism. FJs play an important role in load transmission, providing a posterior load bearing helper, stabilizing the motion segment in flexion and extension. They are also involved in the mechanism of rotational kinematics by restricting the axial rotation. This is achieved through a collagenous tissue of the fibrous capsule layed in a transverse plane providing resistance to flexion motions. Because of their high level of mobility and the important forces influencing in the lumbar area, they can develop significant degenerative changes and be a potential source of pain. The capsule of the FJs, subchondral bone and synovium are richly innervated with nociceptive and autonomic nerve fibres. Substance P nerve fibres have been identified in subchondral bone in degenerative lumbar FJ. Inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and cytokines (IL6, TNFα) have been found in cases of degenerative disorders. This partly explains the origin of LBP in case of FJ degeneration. Bogduk et al. were the first to describe three ramifications of the dorsal branch (medial, intermediate and lateral branch) of the spinal nerve, which spread within the dorsal muscles (Fig. 1). From L1 to L4 segments, each lumbar FJ is innervated by the medial branch of the dorsal rami (MBDR). It emerges from the inter-transversal ligament. This branch crosses the superior margin of the medial termination of the transverse process, passing through the caudal root of the superior articulate process (SAP) one level below (i.e. the MBDR of L4 level passes around the SAP of L5). At this level the nerve runs downwards, and is fixed by the mamillo-accessory ligament (MAL). It then enters the multifidus muscle. Intermediate and lateral branches emerge from the dorsal ramus, they run caudally and laterally and enter respectively the longissimus and iliocostalis muscles. Each joint is innervated by a dual supply from the medial branch at the same level and the level above with ascending and descending branches. The L5 segment has a different distribution of the branches, which should be considered in FJ denervation. First of all, the dorsal ramus is longer; it emerges dorsally and in the inferior region on top of the sacrum wing, along the groove formed between the ala of the sacrum at the root of the S1 SAP, and runs near the inferior portion of the articular process. The nerve then ramifies in an intermediate and a medial branch. There is no lateral branch; the MBDR lies caudally to the process, running into a fibrous tissue equivalent to the MAL, with communicating branches with the S1 dorsal ramus. Four factors were described for an anatomical structure to be deemed a cause of back pain: a nerve supply to the structure, the ability of the structure to cause pain similar to that seen clinically in normal volunteers, the structure's susceptibility to painful diseases or injuries and demonstration that the structure can be a source of pain in patients using diagnostic techniques of known reliability and validity. Owing to this definition, lumbar FJ may be implicated in generating low back pain due to their nerve supply, especially in cases of capsular stretching. The fact that pain can originate in the FJ is widely accepted in the literature and is supported by investigations employing articular joint blocks. Meanwhile, some patients may have variations or aberrant innervation of FJ, which may explain false-negative medial branch blocks. Despite technical success, those considerations should be taken into account in patient selection and in FJ denervation procedures. (See below).

### Lumbosacral transitional vertebra diagnosed on 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate SPECT / CT [^114QR71e]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) is a congenital anomaly of the lumbosacral junction. The association between back pain and LSTV is controversial; however, in our patient the symptoms localized to a hemisacralized left transverse process of L5. LSTV should be included in the differential diagnosis in young patients with lower back pain, and scintigraphic imaging should be considered for diagnostic purposes.

### Anatomical and surgical study of volume determination of the anterolateral epidural space nerve root L5 / S1 under the aspect of epidural perineural injection in minimal invasive treatment of lumbar nerve root compression [^112axRQo]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Twelve human cadaver spines were dissected cranial at level Th12 and caudal at the level of the cranial third of the sacral spine. Both the segments L5/S1 were marked with a needle. The correct needle position was controlled radiologically in three planes. A radiograph of the complete dissected spine was performed to proof regular anatomical spine structure. Cadavers with obvious diseases, scoliosis, M. Bechterew and fracture deformity were excluded from the study. The topographic anatomy of the nerve roots L5/S1 is shown in Fig. 1 in depth. The preparation of the L5/S1 area was done by dorsal approach. The soft tissue was removed until the Ligamentum flavum was reached. The epidural fat pad was dissected meticulously. The vertebral arches were preserved. As the result of the preparation a cavity was formed. The cavity borders are cranial the nerve root L5, caudal the sacral bone, lateral the complex of the facet and medial the dural sheath and the S1 root.

Fig. 1
Lumbar spine specimen in a left laterodorsal sight after removal of the laminae and the facet joints. The roots L5/S1 and the upper part of the sacral bone form a triangle with the disc in the lower part. Between the pedicles L5 and the sacral bone the nerve root L5 exits the vertebral foramen L5/S1. The S1 root traverses the disc L5/S1 in its dorsolateral part. The nerve root L5 is situated at the disc level only in the lateral part of the vertebral foramen. The triangle nerve root L5, nerve root S1 and upper part of the sacral bone forms the anterolateral space L5/S1. This space is prone to the radicular pain symptoms of the L5 and S1 roots. The root L5 is compromised in top part of the triangle by disc protrusions and herniations at the level of the disc L5/S1 and below. Even slipped hernias from above could irritate the root L5. The disc traversing root S1 could be affected the complete distance. The injection of a local anaesthetic or an antiphlogistic in this space achieves the roots L5 and S1

### Is lumbosacral transitional vertebra associated with lumbar disc herniation in patients with low back pain? [^115v6cUG]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) frequency in patients with low back pain and lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and to analyze correlations between LSTV presence and intervertebral disc degeneration.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients with low back pain applying between January 2021 and August 2021. Inclusion criteria were age of 18–65, presence of a standing lumbosacral Xray and a lumbar MRI taken within 2 weeks of the indexed symptoms. Patients with a history of spondylolisthesis, spondylodiscitis, scoliosis and vertebral neoplasia were excluded. A total of 1821 patients met the inclusion criteria. Radiographs and MRIs were evaluated by 2 radiologists.

Results

Of all patients, 61.4% were female and the mean age was 43.2 ± 12.2. LDH was detected in 57.7% of patients while a LSTV was present in 43.3%. Sacralization and LSTV were significantly different between the patients with and without an LDH. Patients with LSTV had a higher incidence of a LDH affecting 3 or more intervertebral disc levels (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in-between LSTV and non-LSTV groups regarding the M1 and M2 intervertebral disc degeneration levels.

Conclusion

A LDH is more common in the presence of a LSTV. Female sex is highly correlated with herniation. Three or more intervertebral disc levels are affected in the presence of an LSTV. Significantly higher degeneration incurs at the M1 and M2 intervertebral levels. Sacralization is a risk factors for a lumbar disc herniation.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^115ZHv1P]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Imaging

Although helpful, but not definitive for the diagnosis of a pain generator, it is important to obtain imaging of the SIJ to rule out red flags such as fracture, malignancy, or infection. Initial imaging should include lumbar and pelvis X-ray with anterior/posterior, oblique, and lateral views. These images can help rule out other sources of LBP which may masquerade as SIJ pain, including hip osteoarthritis, lumbosacral spondylosis, and spondylolisthesis. The timing of imaging varies greatly on patient presentation and the presence of any "red flag" symptoms. Typically, pain that has been present for less than 6 weeks does not need to be imaged. If pain is present for longer than six weeks, imaging should be considered. In addition, if interventional therapy is planned, plain films should be obtained prior to injection. MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out neural compression, especially of the L5 nerve root may be helpful. The SIJ can be difficult to profile on radiographs, and clear evidence of structural lesions involving the joint may or may not be identifiable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often recommended for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis related to HLA-B27 seronegative spondyloarthropathies (Psoriasis arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Inflammatory bowel disease with associated arthritis, and Reactive arthritis) due to its high sensitivity and ability to visualize bone marrow and SIJ edema (Figure 7).SIJ pain due to non-inflammatory arthropathy typically has little findings on advanced imaging, but can show joint space narrowing, osteophytes and sclerosis (Figure 8).

### Latest evidence-based application for radiofrequency neurotomy (LEARN): best practice guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^116WcaYH]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Early studies brought attention to the sacroiliac joint as a pain generator through reproduction of symptoms by way of provocative maneuvers and diagnostic/therapeutic injections into the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Laslett et al found provocative maneuvers to be helpful but lacked sensitivity. There is no evidence to support any provocative SIJ maneuver as pathognomonic for SIJ pain; hence, the use of diagnostic SIJ blocks utilizing local anesthetics with or without steroids has evolved as the current standard. Although, initially, such injections were done blindly, image-guidance has substantially improved the accuracy of this procedure. However, therapeutic intra-articular injections only provide temporary relief for most patients. Recalcitrant cases led to the advent of other treatment options for SIJ dysfunction. RFN emerged as the most viable choice given its known evidence and effectiveness in treating facet-mediated pain.

Histological analysis of the sacroiliac joint has verified the presence of nerve fibers within the joint capsule and adjoining ligaments. The sacroiliac joint is thought to receive its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the dorsal rami of L5, S1, S2, and S3, as well as the superior gluteal nerve. There is an additional ventral innervation of the sacroiliac joint that is inaccessible for denervation.

Sacral lateral branch neurotomy addresses the posterior sacroiliac structures, which includes both the posterior joint and ligaments. Therefore, the response to intra-articular sacroiliac joint injections, per se, does not necessarily correlate to radiofrequency success. However, blocking the innervation lateral to the foramen at different depths has been shown to be more effective. However, there are no placebo-controlled trials for lateral sacral nerve blocks to confirm this thought process. This is a treatment gap in appropriately selecting patients for sacral lateral branch neurotomy.

Current Available Evidence of Lateral Sacral Branch Radiofrequency Neurotomy

Two controlled and two pragmatic RFN studies of the lateral sacral branch are described in Table 6 with the remaining lateral sacral branch radiofrequency neurotomy studies being observational.

### Long-term functional outcome after traumatic lumbosacral dissociation. A retrospective case series of 13 patients [^1133Jek3]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Introduction

Traumatic lumbosacral dissociation (TLSD) is a rare subgroup of sacral fractures caused by high-energy trauma in healthy adults. There are no accepted treatment algorithms for these injuries. Neurologic deficits and pain are commonly associated with these injuries, however, little is known about the long-term functional outcome in patients with TLSD. The objective of this study was to assess long-term functional outcome in patients with traumatic lumbosacral dissociation (TLSD) injuries.

Materials and Methods

Thirteen patients with TLSD were retrospectively identified and followed with clinical and radiological examination mean 7.7 (3–12) years after the injury. Five were treated operatively, and eight non-operatively. Sensorimotor impairments in the lower extremities were classified according to ASIA. Urinary function was assessed with uroflowmetry, and bowel- and sexual functions were assessed using a structured interview. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient-reported health with SF-36. CT images were scrutinized for non-union and kyphotic angulation across the fracture.

Results

Eleven patients had neurologic deficits corresponding to L5 and sacral roots. Urinary dysfunction was observed in nine, and bowel dysfunction in three patients. Eight patients reported problems associated with sexual activities, with pain during intercourse and erectile dysfunction being the most common problems. Twelve patients reported pain in the lumbosacral area, in combination with radiating pain in the majority. The overall patient-reported health (SF-36) was significantly lower than the normal population. All sacral fractures were united as seen on CT. Sacral kyphotic angulation was present in 11, which had increased in three patients comparing with the initial radiographs.

Conclusion

In this long-term follow-up, functional impairments, pain, and poor patient-reported health were common findings among patients with TLSD. High rates of neurologic, urinary and sexual dysfunctions were reported. Extended follow-up several years after the injury with a special focus on urogenital dysfunctions and pain management may be beneficial to these patients.

### Bertolotti syndrome demonstrated on 18F-NaF PET / CT [^116x8FQY]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Bertolotti syndrome is a form of low-back pain associated with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae. We report a case of a 34-year-old woman with breast cancer presented with severe low-back pain. F-NaF PET/CT demonstrates increased radiotracer uptake at the transverse-sacral articulation corresponding to hemisacralized left transverse process of L5 vertebra. Increased tracer uptake in patients with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae seems to correlate with lower-back pain symptoms. F-NaF PET/CT can be useful in evaluation of some uncommon causes of low-back pain. Bertolotti syndrome should always be included in the differential diagnosis of lower-back pain in young patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^113MwM4Q]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic approach — For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection) (Strong for). For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present (Strong for). For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or performing invasive diagnostic tests (Strong against). For patients with low back pain, we suggest assessing psychosocial factors and using predictive screening instruments (e.g. STarT Back and The Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire) to inform treatment planning (Weak for). For patients with low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific physical examination maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo-sacral radiculopathy (Neither for nor against).

### Imaging of posterior element axial pain generators: facet joints, pedicles, spinous processes, sacroiliac joints, and transitional segments [^112H53tk]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The role of the posterior elements in generating axial back and neck pain is well established; the imaging detection of posterior element pain generators remains problematic. Morphologic imaging findings have proved to be nonspecific and are frequently present in asymptomatic patients. Edema, inflammation, and hypervascularity are more specific for sites of pain generation, but are often overlooked by imagers if physiologic imaging techniques such as fat-suppressed T2 or contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide bone scanning with single-photon emission computed tomography (CT), or (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with CT are not used.

### The prevalence of morphological changes in the thoracolumbar spine on whole-spine computed tomographic images [^112DJuF2]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are congenital spinal anomalies. LSTV associated with the fifth lumbar vertebra may show assimilation to the sacrum (sacralisation), and those affecting the first sacral vertebra may show transition to a lumbar configuration (lumbarisation), causing misinterpretation as four or six lumbar vertebrae, respectively. LSTV are common in the general population, with a reported prevalence of 4–35.9%. Inaccurate identification of an LSTV may lead to surgical and procedural errors and poor correlation with clinical symptoms.

Identification of LSTV and accurate numeric identification of vertebral segments on conventional lumbar radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to ensure that interventional procedures or surgery are performed at the intended level. However, establishing whether an LSTV is a lumbarised S1 or a sacralised L5 on MRI alone can be problematic. Conventional spine radiographs are often unavailable at the time of imaging, and cervicothoracic localisers may not be routinely obtained. Konin et al. reported that radiographs of the entire spine allowed the radiologist not only to count from C2 inferiorly but also to differentiate hypoplastic ribs from lumbar transverse processes. This approach allows accurate counting of thoracic segments, correct identification of the L1 vertebral body and correct numeric assignment of the LSTV. They also reported that patients undergoing lumbar spinal MRI commonly had radiographs of the lumbar spine alone, rather than of the entire spine. Correct enumeration was often achieved in these cases, but there remained cases in which the presence of thoracolumbar transitions as well as segmentation anomalies complicated evaluation.

### Early sacral stress fracture after reduction of spondylolisthesis and lumbosacral fixation: case report [^1129Yucj]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Early sacral fracture is an extremely rare complication of instrumented lumbosacral fusion seen in older, osteopenic women. Previous reports have attributed the problem to the use of multisegmental (three or more levels) fixation, with the transfer of stress forces from rigid spinal implants to the sacrum. We report the only case, to the best of our knowledge, of early sacral fracture after a two-level lumbosacral fusion and the only case of early sacral fracture after reduction of spondylolisthesis.

Clinical Presentation

A patient presented with a sudden recurrence of low back and buttock pain a few days after lumbosacral decompression, reduction of L5-S1 Grade II spondylolisthesis, and instrumented L5-S1 fusion, including posterior lumbar interbody fusion. A transverse sacral fracture was found on plain x-rays 4 weeks later.

Intervention

Symptoms improved with brace therapy and medical treatment for osteoporosis.

Conclusion

Early sacral fracture is a rare cause of pain after instrumented lumbosacral fusion. Although the transfer of loads from rigid spinal implants to adjacent segments is particularly problematic for multisegmental fusions, patients with short-segment constructs may also be affected. Active reduction of spondylolisthesis may provide additional adjacent segment stress contributing to this complication.

### Lumbar and sacral radiofrequency neurotomy [^116SnGMH]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy is an interventional procedure used to alleviate certain types of low back pain. RF energy is used to thermally coagulate the specific nerves that transmit pain signals. Recent evidence has shown that this procedure demonstrates significant efficacy in relieving low back pain in lumbar zygapophysial joints, and research is ongoing to determine if pain relief for the sacroiliac joint is also possible. This article provides an evidence-based background for performing RF neurotomy, discusses the relevant anatomy, and highlights the indications and technique for lumbar and sacral RF neurotomy.

### Full endoscopic decompression surgery for far-out syndrome via pseudoarthrosis formed by L5 transverse process and sacral ala: a preliminary outcome [^114noAdd]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Far-out syndrome (FOS) refers to the compression of the L5 nerve root in the extraforaminal region by a pseudoarthrosis formed between the L5 transverse process and the sacral ala. If conservative treatment for this condition fails, surgical intervention should be considered.

Objectives

This study aims to introduce a minimally invasive endoscopic technique for treating FOS via the pseudoarthrosis approach.

Study Design

A technical note and preliminary outcome.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the medical history, physical examination, auxiliary examinations, and imaging data as well as the visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Macnab scores of 5 FOS patients treated with minimally invasive endoscopic surgery at our hospital from April 2024 to July 2024. The implementation process of this surgical technique is illustrated through typical cases.

Results

We performed decompression surgery via the L5 transverse process-sacral ala pseudoarthrosis approach using full endoscopy, which successfully relieved the clinical symptoms in the 5 patients. The patients' postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower than the preoperative scores (P = 0.041). Similarly, the postoperative ODI scores were markedly decreased (P = 0.043), and the last follow-up showed a 100% excellent rate (Macnab score). Imaging examination indicated a sufficiently expanded extraforaminal outlet, and the nerve roots were adequately decompressed.

Limitations

The study involved a relatively small number of samples and a short follow-up period.

Conclusions

The full endoscopic decompression surgery via the L5 transverse process-sacral ala pseudoarthrosis approach can address the extraforaminal compression in FOS. This procedure is a feasible endoscopic surgical option that serves as a valuable supplement to the minimally invasive treatment for FOS.

### Clinical outcomes of 3T magnetic resonance imaging-guided lumbar and sacral foraminal injections [^114jMQ12]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a multifactorial disease, and different treatment options are continuously discussed in the medical community. The choice of the best therapeutic approach for a patient heavily relies on the accurate identification of etiologic factors and symptoms. This applies in particular to the distinction between localized low back pain (lumbago) versus radicular pain. The latter typically follows the supply territory of a distinct nerve into the groin, the buttocks, or a lower limb. In the case of L4 to S3 nerve roots, the term sciatica is used for related symptoms of pain or paresthesia (numbness, burning, tingling sensation). Radicular pain is believed to be caused by nerve inflammation, sometimes induced by direct mechanical nerve compression, the most common cause being a bulging lumbar disc and/or spondylolisthesis. Lower limb radiculopathy is a considerable worldwide health problem, without gender predominance. It has a lifetime incidence of 10 to 40% that affects patients' quality of life, causes economic losses, and increases healthcare costs.

Lower back pain treatment follows a stepwise approach. The first step is to determine whether a motor deficit is present. Should this be the case, prompt surgical evaluation is indicated to precisely define its extent. In the absence of significant motor deficit, the second step usually involves patient education and adapted oral medication, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Other complementary second-line treatments include massages, physiotherapy, and acupuncture. Unlike lumbago care, the third step for radicular pain, if it lasts longer than 6–8 weeks, consists of lumbar or sacral nerve root infiltrations. These infiltrations provide pain relief and may also have a diagnostic purpose — the confirmation of a single affected nerve root — if surgery is required for the patient during the course of the disease. For inoperable patients, repeated infiltrations might even represent a final treatment option.

### Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae are associated with lumbar degeneration: retrospective evaluation of 3855 consecutive abdominal CT scans [^113nptLE]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is reasonable that changes in L5/S1 level will affect the general structure and mobility of the lumbar spine. Vertebrae in LSTV are shown to be smaller and to have an altered facet morphology, too. Additionally, iliolumbar ligaments are weaker and thinner above the LSTV level. As iliolumbar ligaments are important for torsional stability and in flexion-extension and lateral flexion movements, it is plausible to state that those play at least a small role in association of LSTV with degenerative changes. Considering the L5/S1 level, osseous fusion or pseudoarticulation restricts movement and protects the L5/S1 level from degeneration.

Whether LSTV has any clinical relevance is under debate. The association of LSTV with low back pain has been described already in 1917 by Bertolotti. There are multiple studies that show no association with any clinical symptoms and, on the contrary, numerous studies that show the association of low back pain with specific Castellvi types. The etiology of low back pain in cases with LSTV could originate from superjacent disk pathology, facet joint arthrosis, extraforaminal stenosis, or degeneration of the abnormal articulation of LSTV and sacrum. When considering low back pain and imaging findings of the lumbar spine, DD has been found significantly more prevalent among subjects with back pain compared with asymptomatic subjects in a meta-analysis. In this study, we evaluated disc degeneration of the whole lumbar spine and found that subjects with LSTV had greater lumbar spine degeneration. These novel findings help us to consider the clinical relevance of LSTV more thoroughly.

Lumbar region

The transducer is first placed in the midline between the two posterior superior iliac spines for scanning the short axis view of the lumbar spine. The dorsal surface of the sacrum appears as a dual-sloped roof, the ridge of which is the medial sacral crest (Figure 6A). The transducer is relocated more cranially until a gap is seen in the middle of the roof, indicating the appearance of the L5/S1 interlaminar space. The lateral border of the L5/S1 interlaminar space comprises bilateral L5 inferior articular processes and S1 superior articular processes. The ala of the sacrum is visualized as a hyperechoic bony plane extending from the base of the S1 superior articular process, and the medial branch of L5 spinal nerve courses around the corner formed by both bony elements (Figure 6B).

Sacroiliac joint pain — prevalence by controlled diagnostic blocks is organized by % pain relief thresholds and block strategy, with examples across categories. Under 50%-74% RELIEF WITH A DUAL BLOCK, Irwin et al, 2007 reported a prevalence estimate of 26.6% with 70% relief used, methodological criteria score 8/11, and 158 subjects, while van der Wurff et al, 2006 reported 38% prevalence and a 21% false-positive rate with 50% relief used, 9/11, and 60 subjects. For 75%-100% RELIEF WITH A SINGLE BLOCK, Dreyfuss et al, 1996 reported 53% prevalence (90% relief used; 8/11; n = 85) and Schwarzer et al, 1995 reported 30% (75%; 9/11; n = 43). For 75%-100% RELIEF WITH DUAL BLOCKS, DePalma et al, 2012, 2011 reported 18.2% prevalence (75%; 8/11; n = 156), Manchikanti et al, 2001 reported 10% prevalence with a 22% false-positive rate (80%; 9/11; n = 20), and Liliang et al, 2011 reported 40.4% prevalence with a 26% false-positive rate (75%; 8/11; n = 52).

The PSIS line intersected vertebral levels ranging from L5 to S3 vertebral body (Fig. 3 a). The PSIS line intersected L5 vertebral body, L5-S1 interspinous space, S1 vertebral body, S2 vertebral body, and S3 vertebral body in 11 (11%, 95%CI: 5.6%-18.8%), 10 (10%, 95%CI: 4.9%-17.6%), 62 (62%, 95%CI: 51.8%-71.5%), 15 (15%, 95%CI: 8.7%-23.5%), and 2 (2%, 95%CI: 0.2%-7.0%) cases, respectively. The vertebral level, as determined by the PSIS-line-based vertex, ranged from L2 to L4 vertebral body (Fig. 3 b). The PSIS-line-based vertex intersected L2 vertebral body, L2–3 interspinous space, L3 vertebral body, L3–4 interspinous space, and L4 vertebral body in 4(4%, 95%CI:1.1%-9.9%), 7(7%, 95%CI:2.9%-13.9%), 53(53%, 95%CI:42.8%-63.1%), 20(20%, 95%CI: 12.7%-19.2%), and 16(16%, 95%CI:9.4%-24.7%) cases, respectively. Of 100 participants, there are 34 participants with gestational age ≥ 32 weeks. The intersected spinal levels of the PSIS line ranged from L5 to S3 vertebral body, with the proportions of patients at L5 vertebral body, L5-S1 interspinous space, S1 vertebral body, S2 vertebral body, and S3 vertebral body being 23.5%(95%CI:10.8%-41.2%), 8.8%(95%CI:1.89%-23.7%), 50%(95%CI:32.4%-67.6%), 14.7%(95%CI:5.0%-31.1%), and 3%(95%CI: 0.1%-15.3%) respectively (Fig. 3 a).

### Ganglion blocks as a treatment of pain: current perspectives [^1134fQgm]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Superior hypogastric block (SHB)

The superior hypogastric plexus is situated in the retroperitoneum, bilaterally extending from the lower third of the fifth lumbar vertebral body to the upper third of the first sacral vertebral body. It is an extension of the aortic plexus below the aortic bifurcation and contains sympathetic fibers and visceral afferents. Afferent pain fibers innervating pelvic organs travel with sympathetic nerves that originate from superior hypogastric plexus. Therefore, the sympathetic chain can be interrupted at this level to treat pelvic cancer pain. This can be applied in treatment of chronic pain that occurs due to diseases like endometriosis, chronic benign pelvic pain, and proctalgia fugax, but the literature about these conditions are mainly on a case report level.

Superior hypogastric plexus can be blocked by the traditional two-needle method, or newer single-needle approaches can also be implemented. Single-needle method can even be performed transdiscally. All these approaches aim to reach the anterior-lateral aspect of the L5 vertebra. In traditional approaches, patients lie prone with a pillow underneath their abdomen to decrease the lumbar lordosis, therefore making L4–L5 interdiscal space parallel. A 15-G needle is then inserted anteromedially, at angles differing from 30 to 45° to avoid transverse processes of L5 vertebra. This process can be done under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. The injectate usually contains pure alcohol to achieve a successful nerve block.

### Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population: a literature review and management algorithm [^112WYzyL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Bertolotti syndrome is defined as a combination of low back pain with the presence of a radiographic sign of congenital variant of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) in which the transverse process (TP) of the L5 vertebra is enlarged or dysplastic and may make contact with or be fused to the sacrum or ilium on the left, right, or bilaterally. This structural irregularity can result in changes to body mechanics as well as pain and discomfort. The Castellvi classification system is commonly used to categorize these LSTV variations, which range from unilateral or bilateral enlargement of the TP to complete fusion with the sacrum or ilium. Although the etiology of Bertolotti syndrome is multifactorial and poorly understood, it is acknowledged as an important cause of back pain in adults, with a prevalence of 4% to 8% in the general population. However, its presence and impact on the pediatric population are not as extensively studied.

In children and adolescents, Bertolotti syndrome typically presents as lower back discomfort that might be mistakenly linked to more typical pediatric conditions like growth-related pains or muscle strain. Pain can be localized or radicular, and occasionally, patients can present with additional spine conditions including disk degeneration and bulging as well as scoliosis because of asymmetric loading of the spine. These symptoms can markedly disrupt a child's activities and quality of life.

Current understanding of Bertolotti syndrome primarily derives from studies in adult populations, highlighting the prevalence, symptoms, and treatment approaches for this condition. Treatment options can be wide-ranging. They include conservative methods like physical therapy (PT), anti-inflammatory medications, and lifestyle adjustments, as well as more aggressive options such as corticosteroid injections and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In severe cases, surgical procedures like transitional vertebra resection or spinal fusion may be indicated. Despite these options, there is no consensus on a treatment algorithm for adult patients with Bertolotti syndrome.

### Use of lumbosacral region manipulation and therapeutic exercises for a patient with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra and low back pain [^116so3SV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Background

A lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LTV) is a congenital anomaly that occurs in 3% to 21% of people with and without low back pain (LBP). There is lack of agreement in the literature as to whether or not the presence of a LTV may cause LBP. The objective of this case report is to present the use of lumbosacral region manipulation and therapeutic exercises on a patient with a known LTV and LBP.

Case Description

In this case report, an active-duty US Army soldier was referred to physical therapy with right-sided LBP and a lumbar radiograph showing a hemisacralized transitional L5 vertebra on the same side as his pain. The patient was treated with lumbosacral region manipulation and flexion exercises aimed at regaining total spinal motion and reducing pain. The patient responded favorably to spinal manipulation and exercise and was discharged from physical therapy after 4 visits. A modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and inclinometer were used to measure outcome after physical therapy intervention.

Outcomes

After a 2-week period of treatment in physical therapy, the patient improved from an initial Oswestry score of 32% to a score of 4%. Forward bending and left side bending improved from 74 degrees to 140 degrees and from 21 degrees to 45 degrees, respectively.

Discussion

Lumbosacral region manipulation along with therapeutic exercises appears to have been an effective treatment approach for this patient with LBP associated with a type IIA LTV.

### "Successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion in patients presenting with concomitant sacroiliac joint dysfunction and joint auto fusion" [^113yFKNh]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a common cause of lower back pain, especially in patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery. While spontaneous bony fusion, i.e. auto-fusion, of the sacroiliac joint may provide mechanical stability, the underlying pathophysiology of this disease remains incompletely understood. Here, we present two patients with pre-operative auto-fused joints presenting with sacroiliac joint dysfunction who underwent successful minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion.

Case Presentations

Two patients presented with pre-existing radiologic auto-fusion of their sacroiliac joints with intra-articular injection-proven sacroiliac joint dysfunction refractory to conservative management. Both patients underwent minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion and reported complete and sustained pain relief persisting at one year post-operatively. Radiologic findings confirmed the appropriate placement of fixation hardware without complications.

Discussion

These cases challenge the conventional understanding that bony fusion resolves sacroiliac joint dysfunction by highlighting the potential role of non-mechanical factors, including neural contributions, in driving persistent pain. Neural innervation of the sacroiliac joint, including lateral branches of the L5-S3 dorsal rami, may be implicated, as supported by recent evidence of effective neural-based interventions.

Conclusions

This report highlights that sacroiliac joint dysfunction may be present in patients with pre-existing auto-fusion. The presence of bony fusion of the sacroiliac joint(s) may not preclude a diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and patients may benefit from minimally invasive fusion surgery. The underlying mechanism of sacroiliac joint dysfunction is complex and incompletely understood.

Cooled radiofrequency ablation for sacral lateral branch nerves — Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the sacral lateral branch nerves and dorsal rami of L5 may be considered in patients with sacroiliac joint pain diagnosed with dual diagnostic blocks (Grade of Recommendation: C). The work group narrative notes that there are other studies showing clinical benefits from cooled lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomies for sacroiliac joint pain, but these were omitted because they either did not fulfill the initial definition or inclusion criteria, or were published after the literature search closed. In one retrospective review, patients with chronic LBP (n = 27) who had > 50% pain relief after 2 diagnostic sacroiliac joint (SI) joint blocks and underwent cooled radiofrequency were included.

### An unusual natural history of a L5-S1 spondylolisthesis presenting with a sacral insufficiency fracture [^113CEUTD]. European Spine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Sacral insufficiency fractures have been described in association with conditions leading to osteoporosis. No association with spondylolisthesis has been described to date. A 60-year-old patient with known lumbosacral isthmic spondylolisthesis presented with exacerbation of symptoms initially thought to be linked to her known spinal pathology. Plain radiography, computer tomography, MRI and bone scan confirmed the presence of a recent sacral insufficiency fracture with anterior angulation. Conservative treatment resulted in improvement of symptoms after 6 months. Care should be taken when considering older patients for more aggressive treatment if they present with exacerbation of back pain and sciatica in the presence of a pre-existing spondylolisthesis. A suspicion of insufficiency fracture should be raised if risk factors exist and further investigations ordered in particular if plain radiography is normal. Lumbosacral fusion might be inappropriate in this setting.

### The use of anterior lumbosacral interbody fusion in spinopelvic stabilization after high partial sacrectomy [^112DBBwV]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

Traditionally, when a patient presents with a midline chordoma with extension to the mid-S1 body where neither S1 nerve roots can be spared, the recommendation would be to perform a total sacrectomy for en bloc resection. This procedure, however, results in a large bony defect that makes it difficult to achieve fusion across the lumbosacral and sacroiliac junction (SIJ). To help prevent this challenge in the situation described above, we propose performing a high sacrectomy for en bloc resection with placement of an anterior L5-S1 graft instead in specific situations where the tumor extends to the mid-S1 body leaving the superior aspect of S1 unaffected.

Clinical Presentation

A 56-yr-old female presented to our clinic with back pain, leg pain, urinary incontinence, and perineal numbness. She was found to have a chordoma that extended to the mid-S1 body superiorly. Her S1 nerve roots were involved extraforaminally. We performed the operation described above with no signs of hardware malfunction or tumor recurrence at 5 mo.

Conclusion

In patients where the sacral tumor that involves the S1 nerve roots but does not involve the superior portion of the S1 body, there continues to be unaffected SIJ to allow for arthrodesis, and an anterior approach is necessary for other indications, we recommend performing a high partial sacrectomy with placement of an anterior L5-S1 graft rather than a total sacrectomy as long as the bony resection offers ability to obtain tumor margins.

### Sacral colpopexy followed by refractory Candida albicans osteomyelitis and discitis requiring extensive spinal surgery [^1152bS3D]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Sacral colpopexy is an effective approach to treat vaginal vault prolapse. We report a case of serious Candida albicans infection at the site of sacral mesh attachment.

Case

A 63-year-old woman developed back pain 4 months after sacral colpopexy. Imaging revealed L5 and S1 osteomyelitis and discitis. This was refractory to medical management and surgical debridement with mesh removal and tissue excision in the surgical plane. Cultures demonstrated C albicans. This ultimately required extensive spinal surgery, including two discectomies, L5 corpectomy, partial corpectomies, canal decompression, strut fusion, and posterior screw and rod stabilization and fusion.

Conclusion

C albicans lumbosacral osteomyelitis and discitis is a rare but serious complication after sacral colpopexy that can result in significant morbidity.

### High prevalence of small-fiber neuropathy in patients with tarlov cysts: toward a more comprehensive clinical understanding [^115AL1NC]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms Associated with Tarlov Cysts

Table 1 provides details on the symptoms associated with TCs. Owing to the primary location of TCs on sacral nerve roots, symptomatic TCs commonly cause symptoms such as lower back, leg, pelvic, perineal, and genital pain, as well as bladder, bowel, sphincter, and sexual dysfunctions.

No relevant significant differences in symptom reporting were observed between patients with TCs < 15 mm and those with TCs ≥ 15 mm, which is consistent with other studies. Baker et alreported no significant associations between TC size and bowel, sexual, or lumbosacral symptoms, or lower extremity weakness or numbness. The authors reported a significant association only between urinary symptoms and cyst size. Similarly, Hentzen et alreported that neurophysiology findings did not correlate with the number, size or location of the cysts. In another study in PTCs, neurophysiological abnormalities were found even in myotomes of non-dilated nerve roots. These results suggest that the size of the TC is not a criterion for experiencing symptoms. Instead, the pressure inside the TC is likely more important.

Among neurophysiological studies, the most common abnormalities were observed in sensory evoked potential (SEP) studiesand anal reflex studies, suggesting that the sensory pathways are more susceptible to injury.

In our study, low back pain was reported in 89% of PTCs. It was not specified whether the pain was sacral or lumbar, as patients are often unable to differentiate. Most TCs are found in the sacrum given the relatively high hydrostatic CSFP in this area. Leg pain occurred in 77% of patients and may be caused by the involvement of sacral nerves S1 and S2 and, less frequently, due to the involvement of lumbar nerves. In a previous needle-electrode electromyography study, the L5 myotome was the most commonly affected lumbar nerve root in TC patients, even when a TC was not visible at that level.

### Numeric and morphological verification of lumbosacral segments in 8280 consecutive patients [^116t9t5W]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

An analysis of imaging data.

Objective

To investigate concurrent numeric and morphological variations of presacral vertebrae and to propose a modified designation for the lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV).

Summary Of Background Data

During the assessment of the lumbosacral vertebra, variations from typical anatomy (numeric, morphological, or both) may confuse the practitioner, potentially leading to significant clinical errors. Common practice, which involves counting cephalad from the presumed fifth lumbar vertebra, may result in inaccurate localization of lumbosacral levels.

Methods

The study group was composed of 8280 consecutive patients who underwent both lumbar magnetic resonance imaging with cervicothoracic scanning and lumbar radiographical examinations. The presacral vertebral number was verified by counting caudally from C2, with cross-referencing of cervicothoracic and lumbar sagittal scans on a picture archiving and communication system workstation. After correlating the numbering on the magnetic resonance images with those on the radiographs, the lumbosacral junction was classified according to the Castellvi's method.

Results

Of the 8280 consecutive patients, 214 (2.6%) had 4 lumbar vertebrae (L4), 7384 (89.2%) had 5 lumbar vertebrae (L5), and 682 (8.2%) had 6 lumbar vertebrae (L6). Overall, 877 (10.6%) patients had LSTV of types II, III, or IV, including 439 (5.3%) with sacralized L5 vertebra and 438 (5.3%) with lumbarized S1 vertebra. The most common LSTV was L5-type vertebra with a unilateral type II transition, designated as L5IIa, in 222 (2.7%) patients. The second most common LSTV was L6-type vertebra with a bilateral type III transition in 174 (2.1%) patients that was designated as L6IIIb. Only 6945 (83.9%) of the population were modal type, with 5 lumbar vertebrae without transitional vertebra. All the 214 (2.6%) L4-type and 244 (2.9%) of the 682 L6-type patients presented with no transitional vertebra, looking like a modal L5-type patient.

Conclusion

Spine physicians and radiologists should consider the possibility of both numeric and morphological variations when evaluating lumbosacral spine images.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^1116H6no]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic Blockade for Radiofrequency Neurotomy

The construct of dual comparative anesthetic blocks with two separate local anesthetics as a prelude to radiofrequency neurotomy has been established for cervical and lumbar facet denervation, although the extension of this paradigm to sacroiliac denervation has important limitations. First, sacroiliac innervation is inconsistent, second, the sacroiliac lateral branches are not always in the same tissue planes, and third, our understanding of the sources of innervation of the sacroiliac complex has been evolving. With respect to innervation, it was believed that the joint received innervation from the L4 medial branch, L5 dorsal ramus and the lateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branches, leading Cohen et al in 2008to include these nerves in their randomized prospective controlled trial. Subsequently, the L4 medial branch was believed not to contribute to the sacroiliac complex, leading Patel et al in 2012 to exclude the L4 medial branch from their RCT. In both studies, the prognostic block technique differed. In the Cohen trial, the patients were randomized to sham procedure or radiofrequency neurotomy if they reported > 75% relief with one intra-articular corticosteroid and anesthetic injection 6 hours post-injection. In the Patel et al RCT, patients were eligible for study enrollment if they received > 75% relief of their index pain with two sets of single-site, single-depth, anesthetic blocks of the L5 dorsal ramus and S1-S3 sacral lateral branches.

Indications and Contraindications

Axial non-radicular pain is the most common clinical presentation in the contemporary pain clinic. Amongst this group of patients, mixed and nociceptive pain syndromes predominate with pain arising from the anterior and posterior elements, including facet joints, annular tears in the discs, and sacroiliac joints. Lower back and buttock pain without distal radicular and neuropathic features must be carefully evaluated to precisely define the primary source of pain. The presence of pain should be corroborated with at least three positive clinical signs, subsequent to which prognostic dual comparative multi-site multi-depth anesthetic blocks with > 75% relief with each block of the lateral S1, S2, S3 branches are the best indication for the sacral radiofrequency denervation procedure.

The procedure is contraindicated in anyone with localized infection, refusal and/or inability to provide informed consent, and pregnancy when fluoroscopy is indicated. Relative contraindications are poorly visualized anatomy and cases in which limited visualization of the sacral foraminal precludes adequate placement of the radiofrequency cannulas.

### The implications of sacralized transitional vertebra on spinal alignment [^116C969T]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study of a multicentric prospective database.

Objective

This study aimed to determine, in a cohort of healthy volunteers, the impact of sacralized lumbo-sacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) on spinal alignment according to its grade, particularly regarding lumbar lordosis magnitude and distribution, and the implications for spinopelvic parameters measurement.

Summary Of Background Data

There is little data regarding spinopelvic alignment assessment in LSTV patients.

Methods

This study included healthy volunteers with full-body stereoradiographs in free-standing position aged over 18. Castellvi grade, pelvic parameters (measured on S1 and L5), L1-S1 lumbar lordosis (LL) and segmental lordosis for each disc and vertebral body, thoracic kyphosis, cervical lordosis, lower limb, and global alignment parameters were assessed. Castellvi I and II were considered as Low-grade and Castellvi III and IV as High-grade LSTV. Alignment parameters between No-LSTV, Low- and High-grade LSTV were compared. Propensity score matching was used to match PI in No-LSTV and Low-grades. Spinopelvic parameters measured on S1 in No-LSTV group and on L5 in High-grade were compared.

Results

713 subjects were included, of whom 23 Low-grades and 27 High-grades. Mean pelvic incidence was 51.0 ± 11.0° and mean age was 37.5 ± 16.2 years. LL distribution was different between groups, with an apex and inflexion point significantly higher in High-grade (P < 0.001). Kyphosis in the LSTV segment was compensated for by a steeper increase of LL above L5 in the High-grades. Low-grades and PI-matched No-LSTV presented similar alignment parameters. There were minor differences in parameters measured on S1 in No-LSTV and no L5 in High-grades.

Conclusion

Subjects with low-grade LSTV present similar alignment as PI-matched No-LSTV subjects, and S1 should be taken as reference to measure spinopelvic parameters. High-grade LSTV subjects have kyphotic L5-S1 segment with more cranial lumbar apex and thoracolumbar inflexion point. In these subjects, spinopelvic parameters should be measured on L5.

### A comparative roentgenographic analysis of the lumbar spine in male army recruits with and without lower back pain [^113BnM9e]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether there is an association between lumbar spine radiographic findings and reported current and/or past lower back pain (LBP).

Materials and Methods

Four hundred and sixty-four age-matched (mean age 18 years ± 2 months) consecutive male army recruits were examined. Half of them had a history of episodes of LBP. An orthopaedic evaluation (including radiographs of the lumbar spine) is part of the routine medical examination for all military recruits. Two senior orthopaedic surgeons and one radiologist who performed the morphological measurements assessed the radiographs.

Results

We found an increased frequency of right-sided scoliosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral lumbarization, wedge vertebra, bilateral spondylolysis of L5 and/or a sagittal diameter of less than 12 mm among the recruits with LBP. No such association was found with spina bifida, left-sided scoliosis, hemi-lumbarization, sacralization and hemi-sacralization, Schmorl's nodules or mild degenerative changes.

Conclusion

Given that radiographic screening shows that LBP is more common in those with spinal deformity it may be a reasonable means of predicting which individuals are more likely to develop LBP.

### Comparison of quadrapolar ™ radiofrequency lesions produced by standard versus modified technique: an experimental model [^116QU7Cp]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lower back pain (LBP) is defined as any back pain from the ribs to proximal thigh.LBP is a global public health issue and is associated with substantial financial costs and loss of quality of life.–In different age groups, the pathology of different structures are responsible for LBP. In adults, aged < 45 years, LBP is the most common cause of activity limitations and LBP, after arthritis, is the second most common cause of activity limitations in individuals aged 45–65 years old. One well-known cause of LBP is sacroiliac (SI) joint pain.SI joint pain is responsible for LBP in 18%–30% of individuals.

The SI joint plays an important role in load transfer between the spine and lower extremities. The innervation of the SI joint is not well understood. It has been reported that the joint receives innervation from the L4, L5 (L5DR), and the S1-to-S3 dorsal rami along with contributions from S4.–Others have reported that the SI joint receives innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, the dorsal rami of L5, S1, and S2. Variability exists between individuals in the path of the sacral lateral branches leaving the posterior foramina. These sacral lateral branches may travel along the surface of the sacrum or run distally into the posterior ligaments. Findings from immunohistological studies indicate that nociceptors are present throughout the joint capsule and ligaments. Nociceptors are also present throughout the subchondral bone; however, to a lesser extent.SI joint pain is often caused by ligament laxity or asymmetric laxity.

### Expression profiling of L5-S2 spinal cord dorsal horn in a rat model of chronic pelvic pain syndrome uncovers potential mechanism of electroacupuncture mediated inflammation and pain responses [^1142VLCp]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a complex clinical entity. Among patients with chronic pelvic pain who visit a male genitourinary specialist, 90–95% may be diagnosed with category III of prostatitis syndromes, which based on the 1999 version the prostatitis classification by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).CPPS is often associated with various symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual dysfunction, as well as with emotional consequences. These symptoms usually lasted for at least 3 months in the past 6 months. Pain is one of the most typical symptom of CPPS. In particular, the pain including chronic pelvic pain, testicular pain, and pain or discomfort during voiding or ejaculation, which seriously affect the quality of patients' life. Surgeons are more likely to recommend antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, α-blockers and neuromodulators as treatment options for CPPS patients. However, the compliance of patients is poor due to the slow onset of drugs. With the development of modern medicine, it had been proved that sacral nerve stimulation therapy is effective in the treatment of some patients with chronic pelvic pain. Sacral nerve stimulation is mainly through the special electrical stimulation device implanted into the patient's body, so as to implement continuous low-frequency electrical stimulation to the sacral nerve, mainly stimulate the nerves innervating the anal sphincter and pelvic floor muscles, and to guide the reconstruction of the patient's pelvic floor function, which had been proved to be effective in chronic pelvic floor pain syndrome, lower urinary tract dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and spastic pelvic floor syndrome. However, as a minimally invasive treatment, the safety and high cost of sacral nerve stimulation therapy are the main contradictions considered by patients, and the treatment will be accompanied by complications such as pain, dislocation of electrode, intestinal dysfunction and infection. Therefore, based on the treatment principle of sacral nerve stimulation, many clinicians try to replace sacral nerve stimulation with continuous EA stimulation. And to explore a treatment with integrated Chinese and Western medicine, less complications, low cost and high curative effect. Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological treatment option for chronic pain. Currently, there is some clinical evidence supporting the use of acupuncture in alleviating pain and urinary symptoms in patients with CPPS, and the research results were published in the "Annals of internal medicine", which provided a strong evidence for the acupuncture treatment of CPPS. However, the question of why acupuncture could be efficacious for CPPS patients remains unanswered.

### Tarlov cyst causing sacral insufficiency fracture [^112MovcT]. Operative Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Tarlov cysts, also known as perineural cysts, have been described as meningeal dilations of the spinal nerve root sheath between the peri- and endoneurium at the dorsal root ganglion. Most often they are found in the sacrum involving the nerve roots. Normally asymptomatic, they have been reported to present with radiculopathy, paresthesias, and even urinary or bowel dysfunction. Sacral insufficiency has not been a well-documented presentation.

Clinical Presentation

The patient is a 38-year-old female who started to develop left low back pain and buttock pain that rapidly progressed into severe pain with some radiation down the posterior aspect of her left leg. There was no recent history of spine or pelvic trauma. These symptoms prompted her initial emergency department evaluation, and imaging demonstrated a large Tarlov cyst with an associated sacral insufficiency fracture. She was noted to have a normal neurological examination notable only for an antalgic gait. She was taken to surgery via a posterior approach and the cyst was identified eccentric to the left. The cyst was fenestrated and the nerve roots identified. Given her large area of bone erosion and insufficiency fractures, fixation of the sacroiliac joints was deemed necessary. Fusion was extended to the L5 vertebral body to buttress the fixation. She tolerated the procedure well and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3.

Conclusion

Tarlov cysts of the sacrum can lead to significant bone erosion and subsequent insufficiency fractures, requiring fenestration and in some cases, complex sacropelvic fixation.

### Best practices for dorsal root ganglion stimulation for chronic pain: guidelines from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113NU1Eg]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The ASF fan out inferolaterally, with the DRG and nerve root exiting the sacral canal at approximately 30° degrees ventrally and 15 caudad to the transverse plane, and are accompanied by foraminal vessels. Intraforaminal instrumentation should be minimized as the DRG is sensitive to both physical and chemical stimuli. This avoids the potential for neuritis, paresthesia, or weakness, all of which are commonly self-limited.

Accessing the sacral foramen can be challenging, as the PSF is smaller than the ASF and its view is often obscured under fluoroscopy. Ipsilateral oblique techniques have been used to improve foraminal visualization, but it places the DRG directly in the trajectory of the Tuohy needle and introducer sheath. A recently described technique using measurements for sacral lead placement was designed to avoid these issues. See Figure 10.

Sacral DRG-S Technique

A 35° cephalad tilt with the fluoroscopic unit is required to compensate for the lumbosacral junction and convex sacrum, as the distances are measured horizontal to the surface of the sacrum. Draw lines over the aligned sacral promontory and the midline with a skin marker. The foramen falls approximately under the L5/S1 facet joint. Our initial target for the S1 foramen is the medial aspect of the PSF, measuring 2.0 cm from midline and 3.0 cm from the squared sacral promontory. See Figure 11.

### Normative spino-pelvic parameters in patients with the lumbarization of S1 compared to a normal asymptomatic population [^112UwDMq]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Normal spino-pelvic values for patients with lumbarization of S1 have not been described in the literature. Presented are the normal values for this population group, the prevalence of S1 lumbarization, and the correlation between pelvic incidence (PI) and lumbar lordosis (LL) in this group.

Methods

Two databases of asymptomatic patients were combined to identify 11 patients with the lumbarization of S1. The whole spine images were used to measure the true prevalence rate. Lumbar 3D EOS models were built to measure spino-pelvic parameters for the lumbarization group compared to the asymptomatic population. Seven patients appeared at first to have six lumbar vertebrae, but counting caudally from C2 showed this was not the case.

Results

11/268 patients demonstrated the lumbarization of S1 to give a true prevalence rate of 4.1%. The lumbarization group demonstrated a statistically significant difference with regard to PI, PT, and SS, and total lordosis measured from superior endplate of L1 to the superior endplate of the first fixed sacral segment. L6I was not significantly correlated to lordosis; however, PI did have a significant correlation with lordosis. Lordosis could be estimated in this group by the equation: [Formula: see text].

Conclusion

Incomplete imaging of the spine may lead to false estimation of the prevalence of lumbarization. Patients with lumbarization have higher lordosis values and lordosis can now be estimated during pre-operative planning for this group.

### Bertolotti syndrome in the pediatric population: a literature review and management algorithm [^1171Bbya]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Workup

The diagnosis and workup of Bertolotti syndrome in pediatric patients can be challenging because of the variable presentation of this condition and the limited specificity of existing diagnostic criteria. In our review, the clinical presentation of Bertolotti syndrome in children primarily involved lower back pain, which was the predominant report across all cases reviewed, with radicular pain reported in several studies. Other symptoms included nonradicular pain, buttock pain, hip pain, abdominal pain, and nocturnal pain that interfered with walking. The duration of symptoms before treatment varied significantly, ranging from months to years, with some patients experiencing chronic discomfort lasting up to five years.

The Castellvi classification system is a widely used criteria to categorize LSTVs based on their morphological features. This classification was used in eight studies, with the most frequent subtype being IIa. This subtype is characterized by a unilateral pseudoarticulation of the TP and sacrum with incomplete lumbarization/sacralization. However, it is important to recognize that the Castellvi classification may be limited. For instance, one study noted that relying solely on dysplastic TP height, as outlined in the Castellvi classification, may not effectively identify LSTV anatomy or serve as a sensitive diagnostic tool for Bertolotti's syndrome. This suggests that more research is needed to refine classification systems for better diagnostic accuracy. Of note, Jenkins et alhave proposed a newer classification system incorporating radiographic anatomy and clinical relevance of LSTV variants, which may offer improved sensitivity and clinical applicability in pediatric patients.

Radiographic evaluation remains the cornerstone of the initial diagnostic workup. radiograph are typically the first-line imaging modality. This tool can also be used for children presenting with red flag symptoms such as constant pain, night pain, pain lasting more than four weeks, or neurological signs.radiograph frequently identify anomalies such as anomalous TP at the L5-S1 level and pseudoarticulation with the sacrum. CT scans are often used to confirm radiograph findings, providing detailed views of the bony anatomy and confirming the presence of anomalous TP and pseudoarticulation at the lumbosacral junction. In the presence of neurologic symptoms, MRI is recommended. Special MRI sequences such as Short Tau Inversion Recovery or fat-suppressed T2 can help detect bone marrow edema near the pseudoarticulation, suggesting an active pain source. Contrast-enhanced MRI may show soft tissue inflammation, and bone scintigraphy or SPECT-CT can localize metabolically active pseudoarticulations. Intraoperative imaging is imperative to confirm adequate resection.

### The prevalence of morphological changes in the thoracolumbar spine on whole-spine computed tomographic images [^113rg17g]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Vertebrae numbering

The vertebral levels were counted craniocaudally, starting from C1, based on the assumption of seven cervical, 12 thoracic, and five lumbar vertebrae. The 20th and 25th vertebrae were defined as L1 and S1, respectively.

Lumbar ribs were defined as ribs articulating with L1 (Fig. 3). Lumbarisation was defined as non-fusion of S1 and S2 (26th vertebra), meaning that there was one additional articulated vertebra (Fig. 4). Sacralisation was defined as anomalous fusion of L5 (24th vertebra) and S1 (Fig. 5).

Hughes et al. reported another technique to correctly number an LSTV by locating the iliolumbar ligaments. Sacralisation was determined by the lack of an iliolumbar ligament at the level above the sacrum. When an iliolumbar ligament was identified above the LSTV, the vertebra with the iliolumbar ligament was considered L5 and the LSTV was termed lumbarisation. However, this technique assumes that there are always seven cervical, 12 thoracic and five lumbar vertebrae. Identification of the iliolumbar ligament in cases with various segmentation anomalies might not accurately identify the L5 vertebral body.

LSTV is a common benign anatomical variation of the lumbosacral spine. However, the clinical significance of the condition is still unknown and its relationship with low back pain is controversial. The presence of LSTV and rib anomalies can lead to inaccurate identification of vertebral levels. Caution in numbering the lumbosacral vertebrae in patients with LSTV is of the utmost importance in spinal surgery. Our report suggests that evaluating AP radiographs alone could result in miscounting of the lower spinal levels. There is no foolproof method for accurately numbering a transitional segment without high-quality imaging of the entire spine; therefore, communication between radiologists and referring clinicians, and correlation of intraoperative and preoperative imaging, are very important.

### Study details | NCT06526156 | Hypobaric L5-S1 study… [^115dQqzb]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypobaric L5-S1 StudyClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Patients going through total hip or knee replacement have to be put under spinal anesthesia to prevent them from feeling any pain during surgery. Spinal anesthesia means having a small needle inserted between the bones of the lower lumbar spine. The choice of space used is decided by the anesthesiologist in charge of patient care. The space between these bones is often narrowed by arthritis or other age-related degenerative spine disease in patients having total hip or knee replacement surgery. The lowest L5-S1 space is the largest one and often least affected by arthritis, which makes it the easiest option.

Despite this, it is not currently the most common space used for spinal anesthesia, because it is hard to find by palpation, and because there is concern that local anesthetic will not always spread up high enough from this lowest space, which is needed for a successful spinal anesthesia. How far it spreads depends on the amount and density of local anesthetic given. It has been observed that all of these dilemma can be solved by:

- Using ultrasound imaging to find and mark the space, and
- Injecting hypobaric local anesthetic. The goal of this observational study is to determine the success rate of spinal anesthesia with a lower dose of hypobaric bupivacaine injected into the L5-S1 space, when done on total hip or knee arthroplasty patients at Toronto Western Hospital.

One strategy is to administer the spinal anesthesia at the L5-S1 space: it is least affected by arthritic and degenerative changes, and as it is the largest intervertebral space, it has the lowest chance of causing spinal cord trauma. Notably, two subjects in the cohort of 60 patients received spinal anesthesia at the L5-S1 level. Both patients had adequate sensory block height and duration for commencement and completion of surgery without need for anesthetic supplementation. The investigator have performed spinal anesthesia at the L5-S1 level in many other patients over the last 3 years with the same dose of hypobaric bupivacaine and have not encountered failure to date.

Radiofrequency Ablation

Prior to performing radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a diagnostic block of the lateral sacral branches (S1–3) and L5 dorsal rami is recommended, even if the patient has previously received intra-articular SIJ injections. Although many older studies have utilized intra-articular SIJ injection as the standard for selecting candidates for lateral branch RFA, this strategy does not account for extra-articular sources of pain such as the posterior sacral ligaments as well as posterior joint complex that are targeted by lateral branch RFA. A cutoff of 50% pain relief or higher from lateral branch diagnostic block may be implemented prior to offering RFA. Furthermore, a multi-site, multi-depth lateral branch block approach is recommended as an important tool that may prognosticate if lateral branch RFA may assist with extra-articular SIJ pain. Contraindications to offering neuroablative modalities for SIJ pain include sacral fracture, malignancy, infection, and coagulation.

Best Practice Statement on Diagnostic Blockade Prior to Neuroablative Procedures of the SIJ

Dual diagnostic blockade of the L5 primary dorsal ramus and sacral lateral branches (S1–3) with 50% improvement in pain and function is the preferred strategy prior to neuroablative procedures of the SIJ.

Historically, a leapfrogging RFA technique (see Figure 2) has been utilized sequentially within the SIJ, but only 36% of patients experienced over 50% pain relief at six months Figure 2. This was attributed to only partial denervation of the SIJ. Currently, the lateral sacral branches (S1–3) and L5 dorsal rami are the preferred targets for RFA to treat SIJ joint, with sustained relief for at least six months reported in over 60% of participants.

### Decompressive L5 transverse processectomy for bertolotti's syndrome: a preliminary study [^115w3Qpy]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bertolotti's syndrome is a spinal disorder characterized by abnormal enlargement of the transverse process of the most caudal lumbar vertebra. The L5 transverse process may be enlarged either unilaterally or bilaterally and may articulate or fuse with the sacrum or ilium. Pseudoarticulation between the transverse process of the L5 and the alar of the sacrum can cause buttock pain and leg pain. In addition, the L4 exiting nerve root could be compressed by an enlarged L5 transverse process. The authors could have obtained satisfactory results from the selected cases of Bertolotti's syndrome by applying a selective transverse processectomy of the L5.

Objective

The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of L5 transverse processectomy for symptomatic Bertolotti's syndrome.

Study Design

A retrospective study.

Methods

A total of 256 patients with Bertolotti's syndrome who had severe buttock pain and unilateral or bilateral radiating leg pain were selected. The correct diagnosis was made based on imaging studies which included computed tomography (CT), plain x-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The final diagnosis was made by confirming pain relief from anesthetic block. A total of 87 patients were classified into 2 groups: group A included 50 patients whose pain was relieved by block into the pseudoarticulation and group B included 37 patients whose pain was relieved by block into the L4 exiting nerve root. A total of 61 cases (group A: 39 cases, group B: 22 cases) were selected as pure L5 transverse processectomy.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measures were reduction in pain scores and improvement in quality of life.

Results

Among 61 patients, there were 19 men and 42 women. The mean age of the patients was 53.2 ± 12 years (group A: 57.8 ± 14 years [16–86 years], group B: 53.4 ± 14 years [27–77 years]). The mean follow-up period was 6.5 months. The patients' mean visual analog scale (VAS) prior to surgery was 7.54 ± 0.81 (group A: 7.59 ± 0.93, group B: 7.50 ± 0.86), and the mean postoperative VAS was 2.86 ± 1.67 (group A: 3.82 ± 1.59, group B: 2.05 ± 1.00). According to Macnab's criteria, 12 patients showed excellent results (group A: 3, group B: 9), 41 patients showed good results (group A: 11, group B: 30), 6 patients showed fair results (group A: 5, group B: 1), and 2 patients showed poor results (group A: 2, group B: 0). Thus, satisfactory results were achieved in 86.89% of the cases.

Conclusion

In patients with Bertolotti's syndrome, pseudoarticulation as well as L4 nerve root compression can be the source of buttock pain and lower extremity pain. Bisectional cutting of the L5 transverse process and decompression of the L4 nerve root could be an optimal treatment for Bertolotti's syndrome, and it may be easily approached by the paraspinal approach.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study and only offers one-year follow-up data for patients with Bertolotti's syndrome who have undergone L5 transverse process resection. Key words: Bertolotti's syndrome, pseudoarticulation, L5 transverse processectomy, paraspinal approach.

### Cooled radiofrequency ablation versus standard medical management for chronic sacroiliac joint pain: a multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness study [^115Gsgqv]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic LBBs

Prognostic sacral LBBs were performed using a periforaminal technique with bupivacaine or ropivacaine 0.5% using a total volume < 2 mL under fluoroscopic guidance in multiple views, according to standard protocols. Anesthetic was placed at one to three locations (eg, 2:00 and 4:00 on the face of a clock for right-sided procedures) within 1 cm of the posterior S1–S3 foramina and at the L5 dorsal ramus between the sacral ala and articular process. When S4 was located at or above the inferior margin of the SIJ, lateral branches coalescing at this level were targeted. Subjects with bilateral pain had bilateral blocks performed on the same day. Participants who experienced ≥ 50% pain relief lasting at least as long as the expected duration of anesthetic proceeded to treatment allocation.

CRFA procedure

CRFA procedures were performed according to standard protocol using fluoroscopic guidance in multiple views. Nine lesions for each lateral segment were created at locations specified in relation to the S1–S3 sacral foramina and L5 dorsal ramus, with S4 targeted at provider discretion in patients where the foraminal opening was situated at or above the inferior aspect of the SIJ (figure 1). At each level, introducers were inserted until the stylet tip contacted bone at approximately 1:30, 3:30 and 5:30 on the face of a clock for right-sided lesions at S1 and S2, and 1:00 and 3:00 at S3, with mirror image locations used for left-sided lesions. L5 was targeted in the groove lateral to the sacral articular process. After correct positioning was confirmed, stylets were removed and replaced with 17-gauge CRFA probes, ensuring the probe tip was offset 2 mm from bone. The probe was energized for 150 s at a power level regulated to maintain a 60°C temperature on the active tip at each of the nine locations, translating to a tissue temperature > 80°C. Subjects with bilateral pain received CRFA treatment on both sides on the same day.

Figure 1
Nine target regions for lateral branch blocks and cooled radiofrequency ablation (CRFA) procedures. The nine target regions (orange circles) were situated around the sacral foramina at the S1–S3 levels and in the groove between the sacral ala and articular process, targeting the dorsal ramus of L5. These targets were used for both the lateral branch block and CRFA procedures (ie, the periforaminal technique).

Another approach to RFA is performed by using a multilesion probe (Simplicity III, NeuroTherm ®, Wilmington, MA). The multilesion probe contains a radiofrequency electrode with three active regions, which create two bipolar and three monopolar lesions across the lateral branches of S1-S4 with a single percutaneous entry point (see Figure 4). Additional advantages with the multilesion probe include no requirement for introducer needles and the creation of a continuous strip lesion. Schmidt et al reported that 71.4% of patients with refractory SIJ pain experienced > 50% pain relief six weeks and 54.5% of patients experienced > 50% pain relief at six months after lateral branch ablation using the multilesion probe.

Figure 4
RFA with multilesion probe. This technique utilizes a singular probe which is tunneled through the tissue via a single site to generate a true strip lesion at the SIJ. The probe contains three electrodes creating a combination of monopolar and bipolar lesions. Original medical illustration by Kamil Sochacki, DO.

Outcomes and Challenges with Radiofrequency Ablation

Dilemmas in RFA for SIJ pain can stem from whether targeting lateral sacral branches (S1–3) and L5 dorsal rami are sufficient to treat pain of SIJ etiology, and which RFA modalities adequately ablate these targets. Evidence from histological, anatomical, and in vivo studies demonstrates that the posterior aspect of the SIJ, or extra-articular component, receives innervation from the lateral branches of the posterior rami of S1–3 and varying innervation from L5 and S4. This is consistent with a randomized, double-blind study demonstrating that multisite, multi-depth sacral lateral branch blocks mainly relieve pain from the extra-articular component of the SIJ, and not from the intra-articular component of the SIJ. The intra-articular component of the SIJ may predominantly receive innervation from the ventral rami of L5-S2 nerve roots (lumbosacral trunk) and the obturator and superior gluteal nerves. Thus, in addition to course variability of lateral branch nerves, lateral sacral RFA may not provide benefit in all painful manifestations of SIJ pain because it predominantly targets the posterior nerve supply to the SIJ and may not address pain originating from the ventral aspect of the joint.

### Lumbosacral transitional vertebra and S1 radiculopathy: the value of coronal MR imaging [^116KEJ6y]. Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The association of a lumbosacral transitional vertebra with accelerated degeneration of the disc above has been described. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae have also been reported as a cause of extraforaminal entrapment of the L5 nerve root between the transverse segment of the transitional vertebra and the sacral ala optimally demonstrated by coronal MRI. The association of the lumbosacral transitional vertebra pseudoarthroses and S1 nerve root entrapment due to degenerative stenosis of the nerve root canal has never been described.

Methods

We present 12 patients with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae that were referred for symptoms and signs of S1 nerve root radiculopathy in which the sagittal and axial MRI sequences failed to identify a plausible cause for the patients' S1 nerve root symptoms. A coronal T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) MRI sequence was consequently added to the investigation.

Results

The coronal T1WI MRI sequence demonstrated hypertrophic degenerative stenosis of the S1 nerve root canal at the level of the lumbosacral transitional vertebra pseudoarthrosis, with entrapment of the respective S1 nerve root in all patients.

Conclusion

We emphasize the value of coronal T1WI MRI of the lumbosacral junction and sacrum if the cause for S1 radicular symptoms was not identified on conventional sagittal and axial MRI sequences in patients with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae.

### A rapid method to identify lumbarization on lumbar spine radiography and computed tomography [^117K3WAp]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background Context

Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are very common congenital spinal anomalies that consist of sacralization of the lowest lumbar vertebra or lumbarization of the uppermost sacral vertebra. They are a main cause of wrong-level surgery.

Purspose

This study aimed to explore morphological characteristics which can help to rapidly identify LSTV on lumbar spine radiography and computed tomography.

Study Design

Retrospective, case-control study.

Outcome Measures

(1) Anterior superior angle (ASA) of the last presacral vertebra (PSV)-the angle between the anterior edge and superior endplate of the last PSV on a mid-sagittal lumbar CT view; (2) Posterior angle (PA) of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra-the angle between the posterior edge of the last PSV and the posterior edge of the uppermost sacral-type segment on a mid-sagittal lumbar CT view; (3) Location of the iliac crest line (ICL) on AP whole-spine image-it was defined based on its location with respect to the transverse processes of the vertebra above the last PSV. An ICL higher than the inferior edges of the transverse process of the vertebra above the last PSV was defined as high ICL.

Patient Sample

Data of all patients, who underwent lumbar computed tomography (CT) and whole-spine radiography for lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar disc herniation, at a single institution from 2017 to 2023, were analyzed from the local database.

Methods

Data of 909 patients were grouped according to lumbosacral anatomy as follows: lumbarization of the first sacral vertebra (LZ), sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra (SZ), and normal spine (control). The anterior superior angle (ASA) of the last PSV, posterior angle (PA) of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra, and location of the iliac crest line (ICL) on AP whole-spine imaging were measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of the measurements (ASA; PA; ICL; ASA and PA; ASA, PA, and ICL). Inter- and intra-observer reliabilities of each measurement were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

LSTV were present in 105 patients (11.6%): LZ in 76 (8.4%) and SZ in 29 (3.2%). ASA of the last PSV (85.7° ± 4.1° vs. 90.6° ± 2.9°; P < 0.001) and PA of the last PSV and the first sacral vertebra (19.7° ± 14.2° vs. 36.9° ± 9.1°; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the LZ group than the control group. The prevalence of a high ICL was significantly higher in the LZ group than the control group (36.8% vs. 0.9%; P < 0.001). Mean ASA and PA and prevalence of high ICL were 90.1° ± 2.6°, 32.6° ± 11.4°, and 6.9%, respectively, in the SZ group; corresponding values in the control group were 90.6° ± 2.9°, 36.9° ± 9.1°, and 0.9%, respectively. The differences were not significant. Among the 37 patients with a high ICL, 30 (81.1%) also had an LZ. Twenty-three of the 24 patients (95.8%) with both a high ICL and PA < 20° had an LZ. ASA, PA, and ICL combined demonstrated excellent or good performance in differentiating patients in the LZ group from those in the control group (area under the ROC curve = 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96) and from those in the SZ group (area under the ROC curve = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.92).

Conclusions

Lumbarization can be identified on lumbar spine imaging using a rapid method. When the ICL is high and both the ASA and PA are small on lumbar imaging, whole-spine radiography is recommended to definitively identify if lumbarization is present.

### L5-S3 compared to L5-S2 full-endoscopic rhizotomy and ablation under a navigation system for sacroiliac joint pain: a comparative study [^116RASZC]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) with sacroiliac joint (SIJ) involvement is a prevalent issue in health care. Surgical intervention, employing an endoscopic technique with a navigation system, targets and ablates nociceptive nerve fibers associated with SIJ pain, although the clinical effect of omitting rhizotomy of the lateral sacral branch of S3 remains uncertain.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of 2 full-endoscopic rhizotomy and ablation (FERA) techniques for SIJ pain and to determine the effect of omitting rhizotomy of the lateral sacral branch of S3 on patient outcomes.

Study Design

This study adopted a retrospective cohort study design.

Setting

This study was conducted at a single medical institution by a neurosurgeon.

Methods

From January 2018 through March 2021, the records of 73 patients undergoing L5-S3 or L5-S2 FERA for SIJ pain associated with CLBP were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for functional disability, and MacNab criteria for satisfaction. The procedures were guided by 3-D robotic C-arm navigation. The L5-S3 FERA group underwent rhizotomy and ablation of the L5-S3 lateral branches, whereas the L5-S2 FERA group did not undergo rhizotomy of the S3 lateral sacral branch.

Results

Both groups showed significant improvements at one year in VAS and ODI scores with similar trends. The L5-S2 FERA group had a shorter operative time, particularly bilaterally, without complications. Although the L5-S3 FERA group initially presented a slightly higher recurrence rate at 6 months, their recurrence rate was equal with that of the L5-S2 FERA group at one year. Furthermore, the MacNab criteria showed comparable satisfaction rates in both groups.

Limitation

This was a small retrospective study.

Conclusion

L5-S2 FERA demonstrated clinical outcomes similar to those of L5-S3 FERA for pain relief, functional improvement, and satisfaction. Omitting S3 lateral branch rhizotomy did not adversely affect the outcomes. Surgeons may consider omitting S3 lateral branch rhizotomy for SIJ pain treatment, thereby reducing operative time while maintaining patient benefits.

### Determining the best vertebra for measuring pelvic incidence and spinopelvic parameters in adult spinal deformity patients with transitional anatomy [^116V9ZFZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine if spinal deformity patients with L5 sacralization should have pelvic incidence (PI) and other spinopelvic parameters measured from the L5 or S1 endplate.

Methods

This study was a multicenter retrospective comparative cohort study comprising a large database of adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients and a database of asymptomatic individuals. Linear regression modeling was used to determine normative T1 pelvic angle (TPA) and PI - lumbar lordosis (LL) mismatch (PI-LL) based on PI and age in a database of asymptomatic subjects. In an ASD database, patients with radiographic evidence of L5 sacralization had the PI, LL, and TPA measured from the superior endplate of S1 and then also from L5. The differences in TPA and PI-LL from normative were calculated in the sacralization cohort relative to L5 and S1 and correlated to the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patients were grouped based on the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-Schwab PI-LL modifier (0, +, or ++) using the L5 PI-LL and S1 PI-LL. Baseline ODI and SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores were compared across and within groups.

Results

Among 1179 ASD patients, 276 (23.4%) had transitional anatomy, 176 with sacralized L5 (14.9%) and 100 (8.48%) with lumbarization of S1. The 176 patients with sacralized L5 were analyzed. When measured using the L5 superior endplate, pelvic parameters were significantly smaller than those measured relative to S1 (PI: 24.5° ± 11.0° vs 55.7° ± 12.0°, p = 0.001; TPA: 11.2° ± 12.0° vs 20.3° ± 12.5°, p = 0.001; and PI-LL: 0.67° ± 21.1° vs 11.4° ± 20.8°, p = 0.001). When measured from S1, 76 (43%), 45 (25.6%), and 55 (31.3%) patients had SRS-Schwab PI-LL modifiers of 0, +, and ++, respectively, compared with 124 (70.5%), 22 (12.5%), and 30 (17.0%), respectively, when measured from L5. There were significant differences in ODI and PCS scores as the SRS-Schwab grade increased regardless of L5 or S1 measurement. The L5 group had lower PCS functional scores for SRS-Schwab modifiers 0 and ++ relative to same grades in the S1 group. Offset from normative TPA (0.5° ± 11.1° vs 9.6° ± 10.8°, p = 0.001) and PI-LL (4.5° ± 20.4° vs 15.2° ± 19.3°, p = 0.001) were smaller when measuring from L5. Moreover, S1 measurements were more correlated with health status by ODI (TPA offset from normative: S1, R = 0.326 vs L5, R = 0.285; PI-LL offset from normative: S1, R = 0.318 vs L5, R = 0.274).

Conclusions

Measuring the PI and spinopelvic parameters at L5 in sacralized anatomy results in underestimating spinal deformity and is less correlated with health-related quality of life. Surgeons may consider measuring PI and spinopelvic parameters relative to S1 rather than at L5 in patients with a sacralized L5.
