## Question

What is the normal HBA1C level

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a normal HbA1c level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, current guidelines to anchor the definition. Then, I should verify how different organizations phrase "normal" versus "prediabetes" thresholds. Next, I will check for any nuances or exceptions that could shift interpretation, such as age, pregnancy, or assay limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with the exact cut points and caveats supported by the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the primary source. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 is the most current, high-credibility guideline for diagnosis and screening, and it explicitly adopts HbA1c thresholds for prediabetes and diabetes, which indirectly defines "normal" by exclusion, so I should anchor to that framework [^927c9798] [^c85d6568].

> Wait, let me verify the exact cut points. According to ADA 2025, prediabetes is defined as HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%, and diabetes is defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, so by inference, "normal" HbA1c is less than 5.7% (less than 39 mmol/mol), and this aligns with longstanding ADA diagnostic conventions and the USPSTF screening statement that uses the same thresholds [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461].

> Hold on, I should double-check whether any major organization uses a stricter "normal" definition. AACE 2022 defines normal A1c as less than 5.5%, which is more stringent than ADA's less than 5.7%, so if a clinician is applying AACE criteria, "normal" would be under 5.5% rather than under 5.7% [^747e1b73].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing assay or population caveats. ADA emphasizes using NGSP-certified, DCCT-aligned laboratory methods for diagnosis, and cautions that HbA1c may be unreliable in conditions altering red cell lifespan or with certain hemoglobinopathies; in such cases, plasma glucose criteria should be used instead, which can affect interpretation of what looks "normal" on A1c in those populations [^927c9798] [^5849f447].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, particularly the second and third trimesters, HbA1c is less reliable for diagnosis and monitoring due to altered red cell kinetics, so "normal" pregnancy A1c ranges differ and glucose-based testing is preferred for diagnosis and surveillance, meaning the standard less than 5.7% definition does not directly translate in gestational physiology [^5849f447] [^47d28a5b].

> But wait, what if someone cites a clinical trial that lists "normal" as 4.0% to 5.6%? I should confirm that such ranges reflect study-specific categorizations rather than guideline-endorsed diagnostic thresholds; indeed, some trials and reviews describe 4.0% to 5.6% as "normal", yet contemporary guidelines consistently use less than 5.7% as the non-diabetic range, so I should prioritize ADA and AACE cut points over study-specific labels [^08b8c01a] [^927c9798] [^747e1b73].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly and then qualify it. Normal HbA1c is less than 5.7% (less than 39 mmol/mol) per ADA 2025, with prediabetes defined as 5.7% to 6.4% and diabetes at 6.5% or higher; AACE 2022 uses a stricter "normal" threshold of less than 5.5%, and interpretation should always consider assay quality and conditions that affect red cell turnover or hemoglobin variants [^927c9798] [^747e1b73] [^5849f447].

---

The normal HbA1c level is **less than 5.7%** (39 mmol/mol) [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461]. Values of 5.7–6.4% indicate prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461]. These thresholds are based on ADA and USPSTF guidance and apply to nonpregnant adults; in pregnancy, HbA1c is less reliable and glucose-based criteria are preferred [^5849f447] [^47d28a5b]. Individual targets may vary with age, comorbidities, and treatment goals [^1f07c0e5] [^e02b8423].

## Definition of normal HbA1c

According to the ADA and USPSTF, **normal HbA1c is less than 5.7%** (39 mmol/mol) [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461]. This level reflects average blood glucose over approximately 2–3 months and is associated with the lowest risk of developing diabetes and its complications [^c85d6568].

---

## HbA1c ranges and clinical interpretation

| **Hba1c level** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|
| < 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) | Normal |
| 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol) | Prediabetes |
| ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) | Diabetes |

---

These ranges are used for diagnosis and risk stratification in nonpregnant adults [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461].

---

## Factors influencing HbA1c levels

Several factors can affect HbA1c accuracy and interpretation:

- **Age**: HbA1c tends to rise with age, even with similar glucose levels [^93a691dc].
- **Ethnicity**: Some populations (e.g. African Americans) may have slightly higher HbA1c at a given glucose level [^7bb5d3f0].
- **Hematologic conditions**: Anemia, hemoglobinopathies, and altered red cell turnover can distort HbA1c [^5849f447] [^a6dc500b].
- **Renal disease**: Reduced red cell lifespan can lower HbA1c, masking true glycemia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of normal HbA1c

Maintaining HbA1c below 5.7% is associated with:

- **Lower diabetes risk**: Strong inverse association with incident type 2 diabetes [^c2a188c1].
- **Reduced microvascular risk**: Lower long-term risk of retinopathy and nephropathy [^44392c42].
- **Cardiometabolic health**: Linked to better lipid profiles and blood pressure [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of HbA1c measurement

While HbA1c is convenient and standardized, it has limitations:

- **Discordance**: May not align with glucose-based diagnoses in some individuals [^808e61f3].
- **Assay interference**: Certain hemoglobin variants can affect results [^5849f447].
- **Acute changes**: Slow to reflect rapid glycemic shifts, limiting utility in acute settings [^93a691dc].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: HbA1c is less reliable; glucose-based tests are preferred for diagnosis and monitoring [^5849f447] [^47d28a5b].
- **Older adults**: Individualized targets may allow slightly higher HbA1c to avoid hypoglycemia [^eb0dbdd7].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Use alternative markers (e.g. fructosamine) if HbA1c is unreliable [^861e7eb0].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

- **ADA 2025**: Normal HbA1c < 5.7%; prediabetes 5.7–6.4%; diabetes ≥ 6.5% [^927c9798].
- **USPSTF 2021**: Same thresholds for screening and diagnosis in nonpregnant adults [^5ec8d461].
- **AACE 2022**: Defines normal as < 5.5%, with prediabetes 5.5–6.4% [^747e1b73].

---

The normal HbA1c level is **less than 5.7%** (39 mmol/mol) [^927c9798] [^5ec8d461]. Values at or above this threshold indicate increased diabetes risk and warrant monitoring or intervention [^50523009].

## References

### Is there a relationship between mean blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin? [^ad3378b5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the gold standard for monitoring chronic glycemia of diabetes patients. Hemoglobin A1c indicates an average of blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. Its close association with the risk for the development of long-term complications is well established. However, HbA1c does not inform patients about blood glucose values on a daily basis; therefore, frequent measurements of blood glucose levels are necessary for the day-to-day management of diabetes. Clinicians understand what HbA1c means and how it relates to glucose, but this is not the case with patients. Therefore, the translation of the HbA1c results into something more familiar to patients seemed a necessity. The scope of this article is to review the literature to search for enough scientific evidence to support the idea of a close relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose (MBG), and to justify the translation of HbA1c into something that reflects the MBG. Most studies confirm a close relationship between HbA1c and MBG, although different studies result in different linear equations. Factors affecting this relationship may limit the usefulness and applicability of a unique mathematical equation to all diabetes populations.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^d58decca]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^71eb38c5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Almost 10% of the world's adult population (nearly 500 million individuals) live with diabetes, with the prevalence expected to increase to 700 million by 2045. Moreover, although the prevalence of diabetes is high, nearly half of the individuals living with diabetes are unaware of their disease status. If left untreated, diabetes is associated with devastating short- and long-term complications. As early interventions might delay or even prevent full-blown diabetes, it is important to identify individuals at high risk of diabetes. Accordingly, ongoing studies are assessing the utility of novel and less studied biomarkers of diabetes.

Hemoglobin (Hb), a protein only found in red blood cells, becomes glycated or coated with glucose from the bloodstream. As the extent of Hb glycation is influenced by the amount of blood glucose, increased blood glucose levels are reflected on the surface of the Hb protein. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the product of a non-enzymatic chemical reaction between Hb and glucose. The HbA1c level reflects the average level of blood glucose over the past 90 days. As a measure of blood glucose, HbA1c has several advantages over fasting plasma glucose generally used in practice: greater convenience as no fasting is required; greater pre-analytical stability; and less day-to-day variability due to stress, diet, or illness. However, previous studies that focused on the relationship between Hb and HbA1c in patients with anemia yielded inconsistent findings. Moreover, the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels remains to be clarified. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults using cross-sectional data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

### High-normal HbA1c is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes in the general population [^1180bd75]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It is well known that HbA 1c captures chronic hyperglycemia in the prior 2–3 months, is well correlated to chronic diabetes complications, and has less preanalytical problems and biological variability than plasma glucose, with a noninferior standardization. For such reasons, HbA 1c was recommended for diabetes diagnosis and risk stratification.

The findings of the current study confirm a progressively increased risk of type 2 diabetes across categories of HbA 1c and clearly document that subjects with high-normal HbA 1c have a strong risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for several putative risk factors (e.g. BMI) and potentially confounding variables (e.g. anemia). Remarkably, diabetes risk in subjects with high-normal HbA 1c is higher than in subjects with IFG.

Noteworthy, our study population was entirely Caucasian, and subjects were aged > 40 years. Therefore, our findings cannot be necessarily extrapolated to other ethnicities and/or to younger subjects.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine how baseline HbA 1c predicts HbA 1c -diagnosed diabetes. Our findings, which are consistent with those of studies based on self-reported diagnosis of diabetes, more strongly support the ADA recommendations of using HbA 1c for diabetes risk stratification and including subjects with high-normal levels in an effective prevention strategy. These subjects, indeed, have a high rate of progression to diabetes and deserve particular attention in order to prevent or delay the disease. Specific intervention trials, however, are needed to confirm such a conclusion because those conducted so far, based on lifestyle changes and/or drug use, recruited subjects at risk according to their plasma glucose levels and not HbA 1c.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^747e1b73]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1c in clinical medicine: an American perspective [^35293398]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Therefore, particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly decided based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c. In this commentary, however, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell life span has been developed, we present evidence that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

### High-normal HbA1c is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes in the general population [^e74d5f95]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) was proposed as a reliable tool for diagnosing diabetes and identifying subjects at increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) pointed out that prevention strategies should be particularly intensive in subjects with high-normal HbA 1c because they have the greatest risk, but this recommendation was based more on common sense than literature data. In fact, only few studies showed an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in subjects with high-normal HbA 1c. Moreover, in these studies type 2 diabetes was self-reported during telephone interviews. To support ADA recommendations, we evaluated diabetes risk in the 6.00–6.49% category of HbA 1c, with a more robust approach based on laboratory measurement of glycemic parameters.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^ed042eb7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Importantly, the relation of A1C to average glucose levels, while good, is not perfect. On the other hand, it is conceivable that this "glycation gap" may actually offer an advantage in that it might better predict the risk of complications in individuals more susceptible to nonenzymatic glycation of a variety of proteins, including those fundamentally important to vascular biology. Nevertheless, we expect a significant amount of controversy in this regard.

Cost and lack of standardization of the A1C test in some countries are likely to be additional contentious issues following the recommendations of the committee. The experts do, however, recognize the difficulty and therefore envision a reasonably balanced approach: for those unable to obtain a standardized A1C test (or an affordable one), to continue to use the well-established methods of glucose testing — fasting and postchallenge glucose — the older diagnostic criteria of which will remain in place. A similar approach should apply to individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other disorders of red cell life span, particularly common in certain ethnic groups, because A1C measurement here may be unreliable.

There is likely to be some initial debate concerning the cut point — A1C of 6.5% — chosen to define diabetes. This is, of course, a problem whenever one coerces a diagnosis, which by definition must be dichotomous, from a continuous variable. Yet, one might argue that even the fasting glucose threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l), while not entirely arbitrary, represents a point along a continuum of metabolic derangement. Concern will be compounded by the fact that the upper limit of normal for A1C is 6.0%, leaving something of a gray zone between this value and the 6.5% cut point for diabetes. Values herein are not quite normal and yet not high enough to qualify as diabetes. This will predictably create the same confusion that may have arisen in individuals in the categories of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance using the current guidelines. Moreover, the sensitivity of the A1C test in this specific range may be less than optimal. (In this context, it is also very important to recognize that point-of-care testing is not recommended; the standardized assay, which makes the new recommendations feasible, is only available through a clinical laboratory.)

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^28dd9d5b]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

### HbA1c in pregnancy [^47d28a5b]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, the glucose levels vary according to the hormonal changes and the metabolic needs necessary to maintain fetal nutrition but strict glycemic control is essential to minimize the maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality of pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Although considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis, measurement of glucose in the blood is subject to several limitations, many of which are not widely appreciated. Measurement of A1c for diagnosis is appealing as with one number, a total, integrated view of glycemia over time is derived though it has some inherent limitations. Thus, supplementation with HbA1c, as is common outside pregnancy, seems appropriate. Before pregnancy, the target for metabolic control in women with diabetes is HbA1c values near the normal range. However, the upper normal range of HbA1c during normal pregnancy is only sparsely investigated with different methods though recently a number of papers have been published regarding the determination of reference ranges for HbA1c in pregnancy. These changes may have clinical implications for the assessment and management of glycemic control in diabetic pregnancy and calls for establishment of separate reference limits of HbA1c levels in different trimesters as compared to general population.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^4d37edea]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the product of a non-enzymatic chemical reaction between hemoglobin (Hb) and glucose. However, the association between Hb and HbA1c remains to be fully elucidated in view of the controversial findings reported to date. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults using cross-sectional data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 2009.

Methods

Our analysis was based on the data of 1659 non-diabete adults 20–49 years of age. Multivariable linear models were applied to examine the association between Hb and HbA1c levels. Subgroup analyses stratified by age and sex were also performed.

Results

The association between Hb and HbA1c levels was positive in the unadjusted model (β = 0.020, 95% CI: 0.008, 0.032). However, this association did not remain significant when the regression model was minimally adjusted for age and sex (β = 0.006, 95% CI: − 0.014, 0.024); this association became negative when the model was further adjusted for covariates whose effect estimates of HbA1c levels more than 10% (β = − 0.042, 95% CI: − 0.064, − 0.020). The association remained negative on subgroup analyses stratified by age (20–34 years: β = − 0.052, 95% CI: − 0.091, − 0.013; 35–49 years: β = − 0.041, 95% CI: − 0.068, − 0.014) and sex (men: β = − 0.042, 95% CI: − 0.074, − 0.010; women: β = − 0.042, 95% CI: − 0.073, − 0.012) when controlling for covariates.

Conclusions

Our findings revealed that Hb levels within the normal range were negatively associated with HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults. Confounding factors, such as red blood cell counts can affect the association between Hb and HbA1c levels.

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^54619b18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^176aeb82]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^1388b133]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Prediabetes [^5c5df066]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^b3ffdded]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### The trials and tribulations of determining hbAtargets for diabetes mellitus [^39441d2a]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5–10 years. The value of HbA 1c in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA 1c targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA 1c targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA 1c targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA 1c target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA 1c targets, we examine the limitations of HbA 1c, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA 1c target of < 7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^f0fddb2a]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission definitions — consensus statements state that remission is broadly defined as the disappearance of related signs and symptoms for a specified minimum time without excluding recurrence, and that remission requires achieving, for a specified minimum time, normal glycemic measures defined as normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and normal fasting blood glucose with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose; additional statements specify normal glycemic measures for at least 6 months without such interventions and that remission of T2D should be defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy, with consensus that remission of T2D should include a specific threshold or cut point for HbA1c and that remission of T2D requires HbA1c < 6.5%, and that remission is the optimal outcome for adults with T2D and is a realistic and achievable goal for some adults with T2D.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^808e61f3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: when results may be misleading [^8e2725e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

Recommendations of others — American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE): The American Diabetes Association recommends universal screening for prediabetes and diabetes, using a fasting plasma glucose level, 2-hour plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c level, for all adults 45 years or older, regardless of risk factors, and screening adults who have overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 or ≥ 23 in Asian American persons) with 1 or more risk factors, regardless of age; if the results are normal, it recommends repeating screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommends universal screening for prediabetes and diabetes for all adults 45 years or older, regardless of risk factors, and screening persons with risk factors for diabetes (regardless of age); testing for prediabetes and diabetes can be done using a fasting plasma glucose level, 2-hour plasma glucose level during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c level; it recommends repeat screening every 3 years.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^6f6f72c9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In 2003, the ADA lowered the threshold for "normal" FPG from < 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) to < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). This change has been contentious and has not been accepted by all organizations. The rationale is based on data that individuals with FPG values between 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and 6.05 mmol/L (109 mg/dL) are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. More-recent evidence indicates that FPG concentrations even lower than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) are associated with a graded risk for type 2 diabetes. Data were obtained from 13,163 men between 26 and 45 years of age who had FPG values < 5.55 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and were followed for a mean of 5.7 years. Men with FPG values of 4.83–5.05 mmol/L (87–91 mg/dL) have a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, compared with men with FPG values < 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL). Although the prevalence of diabetes is low at these glucose concentrations, the data support the concept of a continuum between FPG and the risk of diabetes.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5ec8d461]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia [^38f5bfa0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) is characterised by one or more measurements of elevated blood glucose concentrations, such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These levels are higher than normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reduced threshold of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for defining IFG, introduced by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003, substantially increased the prevalence of IFG. Likewise, the lowering of the HbA1c threshold from 6.0% to 5.7% by the ADA in 2010 could potentially have significant medical, public health and socioeconomic impacts.

Objectives

To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM, regression from IH to normoglycaemia and the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ClincialTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal up to December 2016 and updated the MEDLINE search in February 2018. We used several complementary search methods in addition to a Boolean search based on analytical text mining.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective cohort studies investigating the development of T2DM in people with IH. We used standard definitions of IH as described by the ADA or World Health Organization (WHO). We excluded intervention trials and studies on cohorts with additional comorbidities at baseline, studies with missing data on the transition from IH to T2DM, and studies where T2DM incidence was evaluated by documents or self-report only.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted study characteristics, and a second author checked the extracted data. We used a tailored version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing risk of bias. We pooled incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) using a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity. To meta-analyse incidence data, we used a method for pooling proportions. For hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) of IH versus normoglycaemia, reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), we obtained standard errors from these CIs and performed random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse-variance method. We used multivariable HRs and the model with the greatest number of covariates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included 103 prospective cohort studies. The studies mainly defined IH by IFG 5.6 (FPG mmol/L 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IFG 6.1 (FPG 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L or 110 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IGT (plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L to 11.1 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g glucose load on the oral glucose tolerance test, combined IFG and IGT (IFG/IGT), and elevated HbA1c (HbA1c 5.7: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% or 39 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol; HbA1c 6.0: HbA1c 6.0% to 6.4% or 42 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 years. Ninety-three studies evaluated the overall prognosis of people with IH measured by cumulative T2DM incidence, and 52 studies evaluated glycaemic status as a prognostic factor for T2DM by comparing a cohort with IH to a cohort with normoglycaemia. Participants were of Australian, European or North American origin in 41 studies; Latin American in 7; Asian or Middle Eastern in 50; and Islanders or American Indians in 5. Six studies included children and/or adolescents. Cumulative incidence of T2DM associated with IFG 5.6, IFG 6.1, IGT and the combination of IFG/IGT increased with length of follow-up. Cumulative incidence was highest with IFG/IGT, followed by IGT, IFG 6.1 and IFG 5.6. Limited data showed a higher T2DM incidence associated with HbA1c 6.0 compared to HbA1c 5.7. We rated the evidence for overall prognosis as of moderate certainty because of imprecision (wide CIs in most studies). In the 47 studies reporting restitution of normoglycaemia, regression ranged from 33% to 59% within one to five years follow-up, and from 17% to 42% for 6 to 11 years of follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies evaluating the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia reported different effect measures (HRs, IRRs and ORs). Overall, the effect measures all indicated an elevated risk of T2DM at 1 to 24 years of follow-up. Taking into account the long-term follow-up of cohort studies, estimation of HRs for time-dependent events like T2DM incidence appeared most reliable. The pooled HR and the number of studies and participants for different IH definitions as compared to normoglycaemia were: IFG 5.6: HR 4.32 (95% CI 2.61 to 7.12), 8 studies, 9017 participants; IFG 6.1: HR 5.47 (95% CI 3.50 to 8.54), 9 studies, 2818 participants; IGT: HR 3.61 (95% CI 2.31 to 5.64), 5 studies, 4010 participants; IFG and IGT: HR 6.90 (95% CI 4.15 to 11.45), 5 studies, 1038 participants; HbA1c 5.7: HR 5.55 (95% CI 2.77 to 11.12), 4 studies, 5223 participants; HbA1c 6.0: HR 10.10 (95% CI 3.59 to 28.43), 6 studies, 4532 participants. In subgroup analyses, there was no clear pattern of differences between geographic regions. We downgraded the evidence for the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia to low-certainty evidence due to study limitations because many studies did not adequately adjust for confounders. Imprecision and inconsistency required further downgrading due to wide 95% CIs and wide 95% prediction intervals (sometimes ranging from negative to positive prognostic factor to outcome associations), respectively. This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall prognosis of people with IH worsened over time. T2DM cumulative incidence generally increased over the course of follow-up but varied with IH definition. Regression from IH to normoglycaemia decreased over time but was observed even after 11 years of follow-up. The risk of developing T2DM when comparing IH with normoglycaemia at baseline varied by IH definition. Taking into consideration the uncertainty of the available evidence, as well as the fluctuating stages of normoglycaemia, IH and T2DM, which may transition from one stage to another in both directions even after years of follow-up, practitioners should be careful about the potential implications of any active intervention for people 'diagnosed' with IH.

### Monitoring glycemic control: the importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^567e7cb7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions. Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control. However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

### Assessing glycemia in diabetes using self-monitoring blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^44392c42]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, successful management of blood glucose control is increasingly important. Current approaches to assessing glycemia include the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Objectives

To assess the evidence underlying the use of these 2 modalities, to evaluate confounders and sources of error in each test, to describe upcoming developments, and to reach evidence-based conclusions on their optimal use.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Reports identified from MEDLINE searches (1976–2005) using relevant terms were selected for quality and relevance to the stated questions. Particular attention was paid to larger cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and established recommendations.

Data Synthesis

If used properly SMBG gives an acceptably accurate reflection of immediate plasma glucose levels. Study results vary, but in general, the evidence supports a positive effect of regular SMBG for improving glycemia, particularly in individuals treated with insulin. The best timing of SMBG and its frequency are controversial issues, but the clinical recommendation is for regular monitoring with frequency depending on the treatment and the instability of glycemia. In the relatively near term, SMBG could gradually be replaced by continuous glucose monitoring. HbA1c measures long-term glycemic control, reflecting a time-weighted mean over the previous 3 to 4 months. There are a number of physiologic and methodologic confounders that can affect HbA1c, but standardization of assays has been well established. The main value of HbA1c is its use as a predictor of diabetic complications and the proven effect of improved control of HbA1c on complication risk. A reasonable target value for HbA1c is less than 7%. A new method for measuring HbA1c may cause significant changes in the recommended levels, the numbers reported, and even the name of the test.

Conclusion

Assessing glycemia in diabetes can be a challenge, but approaches are available that promote successful management of blood glucose and may thereby lead to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality related to diabetes.

### Translating the A1c assay [^eb6d0d91]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In the clinical management of diabetes, the A1C assay has become indispensable. Used worldwide to monitor chronic glycemia, the assay is an essential tool to determine whether a patient has achieved the core goal of therapy for diabetes: a marked and sustained reduction in plasma glucose to achieve as close to a normal level as can be safely attained. With the publication of the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study in this issue of Diabetes Care, the evolution of the A1C assay continues and an important milestone has been reached. To better appreciate this recent report, a brief and admittedly incomplete historical perspective may be useful.

It was 60 years ago that Allen et al. showed that hemoglobin A (which makes up about 97% of total hemoglobin) contains three minor components, designated HbA 1a, HbA 1b, and HbA 1c (A1C). In the decades that followed, we learned that a hexose molecule is attached to these components and that hemoglobin A actually has two more minor glycated derivatives. The five altogether comprise ∼5–7% of the HbA molecule.

In the early course of the biochemical dissection of hemoglobin, Huisman and Dozy noted, virtually in passing, that the level of glycated hemoglobin components was increased in a few individuals they studied who happened to have diabetes. It took 4 more years, however, for Rahbar and colleagues to document that diabetes is clearly associated with an elevation in glycated hemoglobin. The Rahbar reports stimulated other investigators to confirm these initial findings and to seek an explanation for how glucose binds to hemoglobin. It was not for another few years, in 1972, that Bunn et al. elegantly showed that the cause of the increased glycated hemoglobin in diabetes, which was predominantly the A1C component, was a result of excess nonenzymatic glycation that occurred throughout the lifespan of red cells and in an essentially irreversible process.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^874181da]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is rapidly increasing. It is also one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Complications from diabetes have been correlated to the control of the disease. Despite newer targets that reflect diabetes control, like the time in range, glycated hemoglobin (i.e. hemoglobin A1C) remains the main measure of disease control. The hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test is used to measure an individual's glycemic index in the last 3 months. Many specialists apply this test to evaluate blood glucose levels. Normal HbA1c is < 5.7%, levels between 5.7–6.4% are considered prediabetes, and a level of > 6.5% is diagnostic for diabetes. Since HbA1c measures the sugar that is linked to a form of hemoglobin, abnormalities in hemoglobin can theoretically falsely affect the HbA1c level. Hemoglobinopathies involve all genetic hemoglobin conditions, and they are divided into two categories, abnormal hemoglobin and thalassemia disorder. All of them happen because of deletions and/or mutations in the α- or β-globin genes.

Anemia is a major public health issue in many regions of the world, affecting over 30% of the world's population. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a condition in which iron is gradually depleted due to inadequate dietary intake, hemorrhage, or insufficient intestinal iron absorption. As a result, the production of iron-containing proteins such as hemoglobin (Hb) is hampered. More than 2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from IDA, and it is still the leading cause of anemia. A previous study discovered a link between IDA and HbA1c levels and attempted to explain the change in HbA1c levels in IDA using both hemoglobin structure modifications and HbA1c levels in old and new red blood cells. The literature is divided on the effect of IDA on HbA1c levels, with some studies showing an increase in HbA1c and others showing that HbA1c was significantly lower in IDA patients compared to control groups.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^9d0ce4ef]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

Conclusion

Prevention of the long-term complications of type 2 diabetes is enhanced by optimum glycemic control, especially in the early years post diagnosis. A maximum of three oral treatments may be required due to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes. As more treatment options become available, it is essential that the correct treatments are used for each individual. By obtaining a thorough family, medical, and social history of the individual with diabetes and treating the most likely primary pathophysiology, in addition to having a clear HbA1c target and assessing the impact of all treatments commenced, good glycemic control is possible in most individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c85d6568]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C clinical characteristics note that "A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness", yet there is "lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with an FPG of 126 mg/dL". A1C reflects erythrocyte life span "(~120 days)" yielding a weighted average, and "clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in < 120 days".

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to glycemic targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider achieving lower HbA1c levels than the goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) as an acceptable option, even beneficial if it can be achieved safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment, based on healthcare professional judgment and the preference of the patient with diabetes.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^924700aa]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the current management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms-arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus nonfasting-we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement. Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients, but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c. The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating current concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding, but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes, we recommend fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c screening to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Technical remark: The measurement of HbA1c may be inaccurate in some people in this age group because of comorbidities that can affect the lifespan of red blood cells in the circulation. Although the optimal screening frequency for patients whose initial screening test is normal remains unclear, the writing committee advocates repeat screening every 2 years thereafter, and such screening may not be appropriate for an older patient with end-stage cancer or organ system failure.

### Prediabetes in youth-mechanisms and biomarkers [^b302c3eb]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2017). Medium credibility.

HbA1c in healthy blood donors is within the prediabetes range in up to 10% of adolescents. (26) Importantly, the presence of prediabetes is highly dependent on the tools used for its detection, the population studied and the pubertal status of subjects and thus cannot be viewed as a single entity. To this end, few years ago the American Diabetes Association (ADA) published revised recommendations to use HbA1c to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. The decision was based on numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showing the correlation between A1C and diabetes at baseline or long-term association between A1C and risk of diabetes and diabetes-related comorbidities. – The use of HbA1c as diagnostic tool for diabetes has been proven not to overlap completely with the evaluation of diabetes done by an OGTT.

Even though, HbA1c combined with 2-h glucose, represents the strongest predictor for development of prediabetes or diabetes in at-risk young subjectsand an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk in non-diabetic adults.

These findings prevent the utilization of absolute levels of HbA1c as specific single biomarker for the detection of "prediabetes" in youth, yet the combination of several such biomarkers do shed light on the pathogenesis of altered glucose metabolism and its complications in this age group and provide potential targets for intervention.

Pathophysiology of altered glucose metabolism in obese children and adolescents

Glucose levels are normally restricted within a narrow range between fasting and post-prandial conditions. Maintenance of glucose within this narrow range depends upon the delicate interplay of coordinated hormonal (insulin and glucagon), neural and metabolic activity in all organs and tissues involved in glucose metabolism. Insulin and glucagon, secreted from beta and alpha cells respectively govern glucose metabolism. The timely secretion of insulin and its target organ action leads to clearance of glucose from the circulation thus preventing it from reaching hyperglycemic levels and providing mostly muscle but also adipose tissue and the liver with a source of energy for immediate utilization or for storage. Normal glucose metabolism depends on the physiological interplay of insulin secretion and insulin action and in order to develop T2DM – defects in both are usually present.

### Prediabetes: a high-risk state for diabetes development [^50523009]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia) is a high-risk state for diabetes that is defined by glycaemic variables that are higher than normal, but lower than diabetes thresholds. 5–10% of people per year with prediabetes will progress to diabetes, with the same proportion converting back to normoglycaemia. Prevalence of prediabetes is increasing worldwide and experts have projected that more than 470 million people will have prediabetes by 2030. Prediabetes is associated with the simultaneous presence of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction-abnormalities that start before glucose changes are detectable. Observational evidence shows associations between prediabetes and early forms of nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, small fibre neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and increased risk of macrovascular disease. Multifactorial risk scores using non-invasive measures and blood-based metabolic traits, in addition to glycaemic values, could optimise estimation of diabetes risk. For prediabetic individuals, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of a 40–70% relative-risk reduction. Accumulating data also show potential benefits from pharmacotherapy.

### The burden of type 2 diabetes and the value of achieving near normoglycemia from the patient perspective [^e1db22f6]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Achieving glycemic control is a crucial step to diabetes management and may reduce the risk of future complications. Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend that people with T2D achieve a goal of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Treatment in combination with lifestyle modifications is often recommended to achieve this goal, and advancements in the last 10 years have led to new approaches to therapy and made this glycemic goal easier to achieve. More recently, research has shown that movement from above target HbA1c to normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%), a blood glucose level similar to people without diabetes, may also be achieved therapeutically. To date, achieving near normoglycemia has rarely been a focus, or even considered, by people with T2D or their treatment providers.

Little is known about what achieving normoglycemia would mean to people with T2D. Given the distinct possibility that this may now be achievable for at least some individuals with T2D, this study examined the perceived value of achieving near normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%) among people with T2D. In the current study, participants with T2D were asked to imagine the future and anticipate how their lives could be different should they achieve near normoglycemia. Through this approach, it was hoped that people with T2D could more easily prioritize and communicate the diabetes-related outcomes that are most meaningful to them.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^c2a188c1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies found that A1C is particularly predictive of future diabetes after prior stratification of fasting plasma glucose. This is consistent with prior observations that elevated fasting and 2-h glucose in combination indicates greater risk than either fasting plasma glucose or A1C alone. This improved predictability may be a function of reducing error variance; in other words, conducting a follow-up test clarifies the group with more stable hyperglycemia, and is the main reason that a second test is recommended for a full clinical diagnosis.

Our most important limitation was the lack of original data to model the continuous association between A1C values and incidence. This lack of original data required us to use a modeling approach with which many readers are unfamiliar. Nevertheless, our modeling of average studies resulted in an average incidence value of roughly 1% per year for persons with normal A1C values, an incidence estimate that is consistent with numerous other estimates of the general population. The lack of access to raw data also prevented us from conducting formal ROC analyses of A1C cut-off points to distinguish between eventual cases/noncases or to quantitatively assess the impact of variation in population characteristics on the relationship between A1C and incidence. Our findings could also be influenced by the choice of outcome definition. A1C is more apt to predict diabetes if the outcome is also A1C-based. We did not detect major differences in the A1C/diabetes incidence association according to the choice of glycemic test. Since identifying A1C to predict diabetes defined by glycemic indicators is ultimately circular, future studies should examine the relationship of glycemic markers and later diabetes risk by using several glycemic markers to define incident diabetes, as well as to consider morbidity outcomes.

The growth of diabetes as a national and worldwide public health problem, combined with strong evidence for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with structured lifestyle intervention and metformin, have placed a new importance on the efficient determination of diabetes risk. The selection of specific thresholds, however, will ultimately depend on the interventions likely to be employed and the tradeoffs between sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. These findings support A1C as a suitably efficient tool to identify people at risk and should help to advance efforts to identify people at risk for type 2 diabetes for referral to appropriate preventive interventions.

### Comparing different definitions of prediabetes with subsequent risk of diabetes: an individual participant data meta-analysis involving 76 513 individuals and 8208 cases of incident diabetes [^6ad47651]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

In addition to comparing the relationship between current prediabetes definitions and incident diabetes, we identified mathematically optimal definitions of prediabetes for FPG and HbA1c. As reported in a Dutch study, non-linear relationships were observed for FPG and HbA1c and incident diabetes. Our results showed the slope was steeper from approximately 5.0 mmol/L for FPG and from approximately 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) for HbA1c. Similarly, an Israeli study found men with higher FPG within the normal range had progressively increased risk of diabetes compared with men with FPG < 4.5 mmol/L. Furthermore, our results from single knot spline analysis suggested that the optimal cut-points for FPG or HbA1c associated with incident diabetes fell within the normoglycemic range while cut-points identified through ROC analysis were in line with the ADA definitions possibly because similar approach was used (ie, sensitivity and specificity had to be ≥ 50%). Other studies have also reported optimal cut-points that are below the lower limit of current prediabetes definitions. Whether a lower cut-point is considered appropriate or not will depend on the goal (eg, risk stratification and prediction or targeting intervention strategies and prevention). Lowering the current prediabetes cut-points to the level suggested here would identify substantially more participants with prediabetes at baseline but the rate of progression from prediabetes to diabetes would be lower. As there is limited evidence of benefit of intervention in individuals with IFG, let alone normoglycemia, it seems inappropriate to recommend lowering of cut-points for prediabetes for the purpose of initiating treatment such as pharmacotherapy. Moreover, reclassifying otherwise healthy individuals as having prediabetes may confer psychological distress or economic harm. On the other hand, lowering the cut-points may offer more opportunity to prevent progression to diabetes through lifestyle interventions at a population level.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^1f678e11]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^3f46e504]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially.

Approach

An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

### The clinical use of hemoglobin A1c [^65f309d6]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been accepted as an index of glycemic control since the mid-1970s and is the best marker for diabetic microvascular complications. Clinically, it is now used to assess glycemic control in people with diabetes. Assays are most reliable when certified by the National Hemoglobin Standardization Program but are subject to confounders and effect modifiers, particularly in the setting of hematologic abnormalities. Other measures of chronic glycemic control-fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol-are far less widely used. The relationship of HbA1c to average blood glucose was intensively studied recently, and it has been proposed that this conversion can be used to report an "estimated average glucose, eAG" in milligrams/deciliter or millimolar units rather than as per cent glycated hemoglobin. Finally, HbA1c has been proposed as a useful method of screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

### Associations of glycemic measures in the normal range with all-cause mortality in the absence of traditional risk factors [^056e404b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

The investigation of the association between blood glucose within normal range and all-cause mortality among individuals without traditional risk factors is limited.

Objective

To determine the associations of 3 glycemic measures (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], and 2-hour glucose) in the normal range with all-cause mortality among individuals without traditional risk factors.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988–1994 and 1999–2018. Nonpregnant adults who had a measurement of 2-hour glucose, FPG, and HbA1c, and absence of traditional risk factors were included. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to examine the associations of normal FPG (n = 5793), normal HbA1c (n = 8179), and normal 2-hour glucose (n = 3404) with all-cause mortality.

Results

A significant association was found between 2-hour glucose within the normal range and all-cause mortality among those without traditional risk factors. Compared with participants with 2-hour glucose < 80mg/dL, participants with a higher normal 2-hour glucose level had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (110-139mg/dL; HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.03–3.15). In the subgroup analysis, significant associations were also found among people aged ≥ 60 years and men. No significant associations were found between normal FPG and HbA1c levels and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Among US adults without traditional risk factors, high normal 2-hour glucose level was positively associated with all-cause mortality. This result highlights the potential importance of maintaining a lower normal level of 2-hour glucose for preventing mortality in individuals who are conventionally considered to be cardiovascular healthy.

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: caveats and considerations for optimal use [^0fc63125]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen. In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories. We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

### Use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in the UK. the implementation of World Health Organization guidance 2011 [^716eef32]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The WHO was very clear that an HbA(1c) of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) and above is diagnostic of diabetes. They were less clear regarding results that fell below 48 mmol/mol. The WHO recognize that individuals with HbA(1c) values below the cut-off point may still have diabetes, but give no guidance on how to investigate further. It is important that these individuals, who may be at increased risk of developing diabetes, are monitored correctly; a recommended scheme is given in Fig. 2; following these recommendations will ensure at-risk people are not overlooked and will be monitored closely. Even although it is not recommended to combine HbA(1c) with glucose measurement for diagnosis, the WHO did not discount the value of a fasting glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose diabetes in selected individuals; it is the responsibility of the investigating doctor to choose how best to diagnose on an individual basis. This new method of diagnosing diabetes will identify a different cohort as having diabetes than is currently being diagnosed; but the process of investigation that does not require a fasting sample makes investigation easier, allowing more people to be investigated.

### HbA1c: a review of non-glycaemic variables [^a6dc500b]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Identification of the correlation between HbA1c and diabetic complications has yielded one of the most clinically useful biomarkers. HbA1c has revolutionised the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus. However, with widespread adoption of HbA1c has come increasing recognition that non-glycaemic variables can also affect HbA1c, with varying clinical significance. Furthermore, the identification of a discrepancy between predicted and measured HbA1c in some individuals, the so-called 'glycation gap', may be clinically significant. We aimed to review the current body of evidence relating to non-glycaemic variables to quantify any significance and provide subsequent suggestions. A PubMed-based literature search was performed, using a variety of search terms, to retrieve articles detailing the non-glycaemic variables suggested to affect HbA1c. Articles were reviewed to assess the relevance of any findings in clinical practice and where possible guidance is given. A range of non-glycaemic variables have statistically significant effects on HbA1c. While the clinical implications are generally irrelevant, a small number of non-glycaemic variables do have clinically significant effects and alternative biomarkers should be considered instead of, or in addition to, HbA1c. There are a small number of non-glycaemic variables which have a clinically significant effect on HbA1c, However, the vast majority of non-glycaemic variables have no clinical relevance. While clinicians should have an awareness of those non-glycaemic variables with clinical significance, in the vast majority of clinical scenarios HbA1c should continue to be used with confidence.

### The glucose management indicator: time to change course? [^6ab1c614]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has, for decades, been the standard approach to monitoring glucose control in people with diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a revolutionary technology that can also aid in the monitoring of glucose control. However, there is uncertainty in how best to use CGM technology and its resulting data to improve control of glucose and prevent complications of diabetes. The glucose management indicator, or GMI, is an equation used to estimate HbA1c based on CGM mean glucose. GMI was originally proposed to simplify and aid in the interpretation of CGM data and is now provided on all standard summary reports (i.e., average glucose profiles) produced by different CGM manufacturers. This Perspective demonstrates that GMI performs poorly as an estimate of HbA1c and suggests that GMI is a concept that has outlived its usefulness, and it argues that it is preferable to use CGM mean glucose rather than converting glucose to GMI or an estimate of HbA1c. Leaving mean glucose in its raw form is simple and reinforces that glucose and HbA1c are distinct. To reduce patient and provider confusion and optimize glycemic management, mean CGM glucose, not GMI, should be used as a complement to laboratory HbA1c testing in patients using CGM systems.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^156664bc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

### Association between maternal normal range HbA1c values and adverse birth outcomes [^d37234da]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Higher blood glucose level during gestational periods has been consistently associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. Evidence regarding the association between higher glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) within the normal range and adverse birth outcomes is limited.

Objective

We aimed to examine the association between HbA1c within the normal range and the risk of adverse birth outcomes.

Design and Setting

The data were abstracted from the Information System of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital, China, from September 2014 to March 2018.

Patients

A total of 5658 pregnant women with normal gestational HbA1c were included in this analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

The adverse birth outcomes include preterm birth, macrosomia, and large for gestational age (LGA).

Results

Among 5658 subjects, the rates of preterm birth, macrosomia, and LGA were 4.6% (261/5658), 3.5% (200/5658), and 5.7% (325/5658), respectively. The results of multivariate logistic regression model showed that each 1% increase in maternal HbA1c was positively associated with increased risks of preterm birth (OR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.08–2.31), macrosomia (OR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.10–2.64), and LGA (OR 1.38; 95% CI, 0.98–1.96). The association between gestational HbA1c and preterm birth was more evident among women with prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≤ 24 kg/m2.

Conclusions

Gestational higher HbA1c level within the normal range is an independent risk factor for preterm birth, macrosomia, and LGA. Intervention for reducing HbAc1 may help to prevent adverse birth outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain blood glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes in conditions associated with an altered relationship between HbA1c and glycemia, such as hemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), G6PD deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy.

### Individualizing glycemic targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications of recent clinical trials [^eb0dbdd7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

One of the first steps in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is setting glycemic goals. Professional organizations advise setting specific hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets for patients, and individualization of these goals has more recently been emphasized. However, the operational meaning of glycemic goals, and specific methods for individualizing them, have not been well-described. Choosing a specific HbA(1c) target range for a given patient requires taking several factors into consideration, including an assessment of the patient's risk for hyperglycemia-related complications versus the risks of therapy, all in the context of the overall clinical setting. Comorbid conditions, psychological status, capacity for self-care, economic considerations, and family and social support systems also play a key role in the intensity of therapy. The individualization of HbA(1c) targets has gained more traction after recent clinical trials in older patients with established type 2 diabetes mellitus failed to show a benefit from intensive glucose-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The limited available evidence suggests that near-normal glycemic targets should be the standard for younger patients with relatively recent onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and little or no micro- or macrovascular complications, with the aim of preventing complications over the many years of life. However, somewhat higher targets should be considered for older patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and evidence of CVD (or multiple CVD risk factors). This review explores these issues further and proposes a framework for considering an appropriate and safe HbA(1c) target range for each patient.

### Executive summary: guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^7ecf5e36]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in patients with diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments in the full version of the guideline). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association.

Content

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the patients measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring devices and also by laboratory analysis of HbA1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring; genetic testing; and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

Summary

The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus. Several analytes are found to have minimal clinical value at the present time, and measurement of them is not recommended.

In this review we will discuss the limitations of HbA1c measurements and the emergence of GV as a significant and clinically meaningful glycaemic metric (Table 1). Increasing access to CGM in the context of T1DM care has facilitated the ability of clinicians to visualize directly both within‐ and between‐day GV in routine clinical practice as a measure of glycaemic control, and to determine the impact of current and emerging therapeutic agents on the level of GV.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^93a691dc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

Discussion

Overarching strategy

Patients with diabetes are at risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease. Strikingly, the risk factors for these complications are similar. However, factors associated with macrovascular disease tend to be most strongly associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, that is, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension while hyperglycemia is the dominant factor associated with microvascular disease. It follows that the management of diabetes resolves around the management of multiple risk factors, notably when treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Therapeutic plans for managing non-insulin requiring diabetes are: anecdotal and historical (often), evidence-based (infrequently) or outcome based (rarely). Such plans usually offer a broad guide for the generality of patients, but recently encompass a more 'personalised' approach which is targeted to specific qualities of each individual. Since there are multiple risk factors to consider for each individual and we are focusing here on hyperglycemia alone, it follows that the strategy to be employed is complex. Two decisions must be made initially: the appropriate target of therapy and the appropriate therapeutic strategy.

Appropriate therapeutic targets

Hyperglycemia is usually determined using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), an index of average blood glucose levels over two to three months, determined by the percentage of haemoglobin with an adduct of glucose. Therapeutic targets should vary from patient to patient. For optimum diabetes control an HbA1c value of less than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) is widely proposed. However, for patients who are older, of longer disease duration or with complications, such strict targets are not validated and there is a move towards a more flexible approach for a given individual – so-called personalized medicine. The target HbA1c will then determine the nature of the therapy and that target can be modified according to both diabetes duration and co-morbidities.

### Analysis: investigating the quality of POCT devices for HbA1c, what are our next steps? [^6c3617c8]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a growing number of publications evaluating the performance of HbA1c point-of-care testing (POCT) devices when compared to routine laboratory instruments, but is this what we need from future studies? Here we describe the current understanding of the performance of POCT for HbA1c, which areas need further studies, and the key requirements for future publications based on performance evaluations of these devices. These include studies in clinical settings, performance measured against internationally standardized reference methods, and the need to evaluate new to the market devices that do not currently have a detailed performance history. In addition we highlight the need for external quality assessment schemes that are designed to support POCT in a wide range of clinical settings.

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^a727dc12]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent diabetes management guidelines specify that treatment goals should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and duration of disease, with an American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) goal of ≤ 6.5% (≤ 48 mmol/mol) in otherwise healthy patients. Although HbA 1c is the target, it is measured once every 3 months, and day-to-day self-management of diabetes to achieve and maintain the individualized target HbA 1c is facilitated by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values, especially in patients treated with insulin. To achieve the recommended HbA 1c goals, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the AACE, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have recommend SMBG targets (Table 1), the origins of which are obscure but appear to be based predominantly on expert opinion. As a result, there is wide variation in the recommended SMBG targets to achieve a HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) and little to guide clinicians and patients on how to achieve other, individualized, targets.

Summary of current SMBG targets

We sought to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime glucose values, based on empirical data, to achieve and maintain target HbA 1c levels in the outpatient setting.

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^ccce3482]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

American Diabetes Association adult criteria are used to screen youth for diabetes, but little is known about normal glycemia in youth. In the HEALTHY Study (total n = 8814), hemoglobin A1c was ≥ 5.7% in 2% of normal weight youth. This suggests need for cautious interpretation of prediabetes hemoglobin A1s in youth.

### Contributions of basal and postprandial hyperglycemia over a wide range of A1c levels before and after treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes [^955f01ea]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The importance of controlling hyperglycemia as measured by glycated hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) levels to reduce the risk of long-term, diabetes-related complications is well understood. That A1C reflects contributions from both basal (fasting) and postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is also well established. How treatment of basal hyperglycemia (BHG) versus PPHG should be prioritized in the management of type 2 diabetes is less clear.

In 2003, Monnier et al. published a landmark study describing the relative contributions of BHG and PPHG to overall hyperglycemic exposure at different levels of A1C. This analysis was based on 1-day, four-point daytime glucose profiles from 290 patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with diet therapy with or without oral antihyperglycemic drug (OAD) therapy and without insulin. The findings suggested that PPHG accounted for ∼70% of overall glycemic exposure above normal levels in patients in the lowest range of A1C (< 7.3%), with the contribution from BHG increasing with higher A1C. In the highest A1C range (A1C > 10.2%), the contributions were reversed; PPHG contributed ∼30% and BHG ∼70%. This pattern has been proposed to reflect a fundamental biologic property of type 2 diabetes: a tendency of PPHG to appear early in the natural history of the disorder, with BHG appearing later after further decline of β-cell capacity. A potential clinical implication of this view is that when A1C is only moderately elevated therapeutic intervention should target PPHG. Other studies support the importance of PPHG at lower A1C levels and BHG at higher levels, but features of their designs may influence estimates of the relative contributions of BHG and PPHG. Specifically, the timing of glucose measurements, the level of basal glucose considered above normal, inclusion or exclusion of individuals not receiving antihyperglycemic therapy, and the effects of treatments that affect mainly BHG or PPHG all might influence these relationships.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^6cbb8771]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2-h post-load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost-effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g., 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre-diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre-diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross-sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross-sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre-diabetes. A 10-item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta-analysed across eligible studies with the random-effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta-analyses were conducted for pre-diabetes.

Results

Thirty-two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289094) and 15 on pre-diabetes (n = 221988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty-four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre-diabetes (n = 133621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre-diabetes.

Glycemic management — HbA1c targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are described as uncertain regarding which patient characteristics would yield greater benefits than harms with lower target ranges, though there are valid reasons to speculate greater net benefit in younger, newly diagnosed patients with minimal or no T2DM complications, longer life expectancy, or low hypoglycemia risk medications. Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^927c9798]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria, using either the fasting plasma glucose value, 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria:

- HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay

- fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) with no caloric intake for at least 8 hours

- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT, performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water

- a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, obtained at any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c targets for… [^6e77c902]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events.
- The medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients with an A1C level less than 6. 5%, because there is no evidence of clinical benefit in patients at this level. From the AFP Editors More than 9% of persons in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased blood glucose levels in these patients can lead to polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and dehydration. Although lowering blood glucose levels can decrease the risk of these symptoms and the associated complications, there are still disadvantages to doing so, including adverse effects, increased treatment burden, and expense.

In a review of these guidelines, the authors found no studies indicating that A1C targets less than 6. 5% improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, using medication to achieve this level had associated harms. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs. approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients. However, variability in A1C measurements should still be considered when making treatment decisions. Taking into account patient preference, a stricter A1C target can be considered in persons who are expected to live at least 15 more years. A lower target can be considered in patients who can achieve it with diet and lifestyle changes.

Because there is no evidence that an A1C level lower than 6. 5% has clinical benefit, and evidence has shown associated harms, the medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients who achieve an A1C level lower than
6. 5%.

### Approach to the patient with prediabetes [^726300e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Prediabetes consists of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, microvascular, and macrovascular disease. The values used to define prediabetes are arbitrary, because prediabetes represents an intermediary category along the continuum from normal glucose levels and tolerance to overt hyperglycemia. The progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes occurs over many years, strong evidence to support intervention to delay the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Large, randomized prospective studies with lifestyle intervention and/or various modes of pharmacotherapy have demonstrated successful delay of diabetes. Several issues in the management of prediabetes remain controversial, such as the role of pharmacotherapy and when to escalate treatment. This article will review some of the issues surrounding the identification and treatment of prediabetes, with an interpretation of the available data to help guide management.

### Association between pre-diabetes and microvascular and macrovascular disease in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^1dc6f7be]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Accordingly, individuals with glycemic values within the normal range might include a subgroup of individuals with a more rapid progression to type 2 diabetes or could represent people with a similar glycemic trajectory leading to diabetes but with a diagnosis earlier in the natural history of the disease or most likely a combination of these mechanisms. It is also important to note that while more than 80% of this group had recorded measures of FPG in the 3 years before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, only less than a quarter (23.7%) had recorded measures of more than one type of glycemic test, which might suggest that this group was less frequently and accurately tested. Considering the predominant use of FPG, more prone to intra-person variability as compared with HbA1c, and the intermittent nature of glycemic values during the pre-diabetes status and in general in the 3 years before progression to type 2 diabetes, a proportion of this group might have been misclassified with glycemic values within the normal range but this reflects detection patterns in real-world settings.

Importantly, 59% of individuals did not have a recorded glycemic measurement in the 3 years before type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Individuals without glycemic measurements had a notably higher mean HbA1c following type 2 diabetes diagnosis compared with those with glycemic testing (with or without pre-diabetes), potentially indicating late diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and leading to delayed treatment. The clinical characteristics of these people are compatible with at least two explanations: First, these people may be less health conscious and have a worse adherence with preventive procedures reflected by their higher prevalence of smoking and a lower number of primary care visits. Second, individuals without previous glycemic testing before their diagnosis of type 2 diabetes might have had lower vascular risk, as reflected by lower unadjusted prevalence of macrovascular disease at time of diabetes diagnosis, and lower number of other comorbid conditions. This may have resulted in fewer contacts with primary care and missed opportunities for screening. The considerably higher mean HbA1c at the time of diagnosis in this group may reflect a diagnosis at a later stage compared with the other groups and explain the higher prevalence of retinopathy. This is also in line with previous findings showing that glycemic testing and clinical management might potentially delay the diagnosis of diabetes and potentially its complications.

### Diagnostic criteria for diabetes revisited: making use of combined criteria [^c73ccfc1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Existing cut-offs for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-load glucose (2hPG) criteria are not equivalent in the diagnosis of diabetes and glucose intolerance. Adjusting cut-offs of single measurements have not helped so we undertook this project to see if they could be complementary. METHODS: We performed oral glucose tolerance tests and mean levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements on 43 patients referred to a diabetes clinic for possible diabetes. Results of single and combined use of the FPG and 2hPG criteria were evaluated against the levels of HbA1c and results re-interpreted in the light of existing reports in the literature. RESULTS: Our results confirm that the FPG and the 2hPG, being specific and sensitive respectively for the presence of glucose intolerance or diabetes, are not equivalent. They are shown to be indeed complementary and a re-definition of diagnostic criteria based on their combined use is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that altering single measurement cut-offs for the diagnosis of diabetes and altered glucose tolerance will not result in better outcomes. We present the case for a combined criteria in the diagnosis and definition of diabetes with a FPG ≥ 7 mmol/L AND 2-hour glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/L being used to define diabetes while a FPG < 7 mmol/L AND 2-hour glucose < 7.8 mmol/L being used to define normality. Discordant values will define impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This proposal requires prospective evaluation in a large cohort.

and/or appropriate continuous glucose monitoring metrics, such as time in range, time above range, and time below range. Consider obtaining fructosamine or continuous glucose monitoring for glycemic monitoring when an alternative to HbA1c is required.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^dcf9cd36]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

2 CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING WEIGHT AND GLYCAEMIC TARGETS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH T2D

2.1 Difficulty of reaching glycaemic targets

Getting T2D under control by reaching the glycaemic targets proves challenging for many patients. Typically, 40%–60% of people with T2D across several geographic regions and in both low‐ and higher‐income countries have suboptimal glycaemic control. Despite the accelerated rate of introduction of new medicine classes since the mid‐1990s, the percentage of people reaching the HbA1c targets of < 7% has not substantially increased. Furthermore, reliance on pharmacotherapies only often fails to optimize glycaemic control. Despite the availability of insulin‐based therapies, roughly up to three quarters of patients failed to reach glycaemic targets. Long‐term maintenance of initial HbA1c level reduction proved an additional challenge when addressing glycaemic targets likely due to the progressive nature of beta‐cell dysfunction over time. Over a 10‐year period, a very modest improvement of 0.2 percentage points in HbA1c was demonstrated in T2D patients.

Diabetes screening and HbA1c monitoring in people with HIV — 'Prior to starting ART, random or fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) should be obtained'. After ART initiation, 'HbA1c is insensitive and may significantly underestimate the risk of diabetes', but 'an HbA1c that is ≥ 6.5% remains a reliable criterion for diagnosis of diabetes in people with HIV'. If 'HbA1c is < 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose is the best screening test for people with HIV receiving ART'. For diagnosed diabetes, 'Those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should have their HbA1c level monitored at least every 6 months, with an HbA1c goal of < 7% in accordance with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines'.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^fb41208a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2‐h post‐load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost‐effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g. 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre‐diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross‐sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross‐sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre‐diabetes. A 10‐item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta‐analysed across eligible studies with the random‐effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta‐analyses were conducted for pre‐diabetes.

Results

Thirty‐two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289 094) and 15 on pre‐diabetes (n = 221 988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68 years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty‐four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre‐diabetes (n = 133 621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre‐diabetes.
