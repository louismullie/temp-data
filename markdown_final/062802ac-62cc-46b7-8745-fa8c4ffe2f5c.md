## Question

What are the common adverse effects associated with Farxiga?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common adverse effects associated with Farxiga (dapagliflozin) and how to contextualize them by mechanism, frequency, and clinical management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources to anchor the adverse event profile. Then, I should categorize adverse effects by frequency and mechanism to make the profile clinically actionable. Next, I will quantify key events where possible and flag serious but rare risks. Finally, I will integrate practical counseling and monitoring points, including special populations and drug interactions, and close with a concise summary that aligns with FDA labeling and major trials.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources I will rely on so I don't overstate anything. The FDA prescribing information for dapagliflozin provides pooled trial data and labeling warnings that define "common" versus "uncommon" adverse reactions and key safety topics like volume depletion and ketoacidosis, which I should prioritize [^112cUcSq] [^1154qFJo]. I will also draw on DECLARE-TIMI 58 for large-scale safety signals and DAPA-HF/DELIVER/DAPA-CKD for outcomes populations where the safety profile is well characterized, and I will cross-check with guideline summaries for practical cautions and monitoring advice [^1156zjKg] [^111zm3uH] [^114orNkL] [^112duaZa].

> Now, I need to categorize the adverse effects by frequency and mechanism so clinicians can anticipate what is expected versus what is serious but rare. Mechanistically, dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion, which drives osmotic diuresis and predisposes to volume depletion and genitourinary infections; it also raises hematocrit via intravascular volume contraction and can precipitate euglycemic ketoacidosis in susceptible settings, so I should keep those buckets in mind as I proceed [^1154qFJo] [^113wcbpx].

> Let me consider the most common adverse effects first, and I should double-check the frequencies from pooled trials. Genital mycotic infections are consistently increased, around 4–6% in pooled glycemic trials, with higher rates in women and in those with prior history, and most are mild to moderate and respond to standard therapy, though serious cases are rare and discontinuation is uncommon [^1154qFJo]. Urinary tract infections occur in roughly 3–5% and are generally uncomplicated, though I need to remember that SGLT2 inhibitors as a class have postmarketing signals for urosepsis and pyelonephritis, so persistent or systemic symptoms warrant evaluation [^1154qFJo] [^112LHpBf]. Volume depletion–related events, including dehydration, hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms, are more likely in older adults, patients on loop diuretics, or those with impaired renal function, and the risk is dose-related to the osmotic diuresis, so I should confirm volume status and diuretic regimens before and after initiation [^1154qFJo] [^117Kaa6s].

> Wait, let me verify the hematologic and metabolic laboratory changes because clinicians often ask about them. Dapagliflozin increases hematocrit by about 4–6% on average due to hemoconcentration, which is expected and typically benign, though I should consider it in the context of polycythemia or thrombotic risk discussions; dyslipidemia with small increases in LDL and HDL has been observed, and a modest, early rise in serum creatinine reflecting intrarenal hemodynamics is expected and usually reversible with continued therapy, so I should avoid reflexively discontinuing for a small creatinine bump if the patient is otherwise stable [^1166npxe].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms that patients frequently report. Nausea, constipation, and dysuria occur in the 1–3% range in pooled analyses, and nasopharyngitis and influenza-like symptoms are also reported, generally at low frequency and similar to placebo in many pools; I should confirm that these are not signals of volume depletion or infection before attributing them to the drug itself [^112cUcSq] [^1154qFJo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ketoacidosis. I need to separate frequency from severity and context. In DECLARE-TIMI 58, adjudicated DKA occurred in 0.3% with dapagliflozin versus 0.1% with placebo, and importantly, many cases were euglycemic, so glucose may be normal despite acidosis. Risk is higher with insulin deficiency or dose reductions, acute illness, surgery, reduced caloric intake, alcohol, or ketogenic diets, and the FDA explicitly warns against use for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes due to markedly increased DKA risk, so I should counsel on sick-day rules, perioperative holds, and ketone monitoring in high-risk scenarios [^1166npxe] [^112yTeQF] [^113vJezQ].

> Next, I should review serious but uncommon events so I don't miss red flags. Acute kidney injury has been reported postmarketing and in some trials, though large outcome studies generally show neutral or favorable renal safety; nonetheless, I should monitor renal function before and after initiation, hold in acute illness or hypovolemia, and be cautious with nephrotoxins or aggressive diuresis; rare events like Fournier's gangrene and urosepsis have been described, so new perineal pain, erythema, or systemic infection signs require urgent evaluation and drug interruption [^112LHpBf] [^114orNkL] [^112duaZa].

> But wait, what about fractures and amputations? I should be precise here. Unlike canagliflozin, dapagliflozin has not shown a consistent increase in fracture or amputation risk in major trials, though isolated imbalances have been reported in earlier datasets; given mechanistic and class concerns, I should screen for peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and foot ulcers, and individualize risk, but I should not over-attribute these risks to dapagliflozin specifically [^113wcbpx] [^112duaZa].

> I need to ensure I address hypoglycemia correctly because it is often misunderstood. Monotherapy with dapagliflozin does not cause hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia becomes more frequent; in DECLARE, severe hypoglycemia was infrequent and numerically lower with dapagliflozin than placebo, yet prudent dose reductions of insulin or secretagogues at initiation can mitigate risk, especially in older adults or those with prior hypoglycemia [^1154qFJo] [^1156zjKg] [^112duaZa].

> Let me consider special populations and drug–drug interactions so I don't overlook practical pitfalls. Older adults and those with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² have higher risks of volume depletion and renal adverse events, so I should start low, go slow, and reassess volume and renal function early; concomitant loop diuretics amplify volume depletion risk, and RAAS blockade can accentuate creatinine rises, so coordination with cardiology/nephrology on diuretic and RAAS dosing is sensible; in heart failure populations, benefits are consistent across frailty and multimorbidity strata, though absolute event rates are higher, which should inform shared decision-making [^117Kaa6s] [^115USVgG] [^117Ryrpw].

> I should double-check perioperative and acute illness guidance because this is a frequent real-world question. The FDA advises holding dapagliflozin at least three days before scheduled surgery and during prolonged fasting, acute illness, or dehydration to reduce DKA risk, and to monitor ketones if symptoms occur even when glucose is normal; this is especially critical in patients with type 1 diabetes or insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes [^112yTeQF] [^112duaZa].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary so nothing critical is lost. Common adverse effects of dapagliflozin include genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, volume depletion–related symptoms, a modest rise in hematocrit, small early creatinine increases, and gastrointestinal or constitutional symptoms. Serious but uncommon risks include euglycemic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, and rare necrotizing soft tissue infections such as Fournier's gangrene. Overall, the safety profile is favorable and consistent across large cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials, with benefits that generally outweigh risks when patients are appropriately selected and counseled [^112cUcSq] [^114orNkL] [^111zm3uH].

## Long-term safety considerations

Long-term safety is supported by cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials (**DECLARE-TIMI 58**, **DAPA-HF**, **DAPA-CKD**), showing consistent safety across diverse populations, including older adults and those with CKD or heart failure [^114orNkL] [^111zm3uH] [^1156zjKg]. No significant increase in malignancy or fracture risk has been observed with dapagliflozin [^1156zjKg].

---

## Patient counseling and monitoring

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake to reduce volume depletion risk [^112uT7gL].

- **Infection awareness**: Report genital or urinary symptoms promptly [^notfound].

- **DKA education**: Recognize symptoms and use sick-day rules during illness or before surgery [^112yTeQF].

- **Renal monitoring**: Check renal function periodically, especially in elderly or CKD patients [^113bqX1X].

---

Farxiga is generally well tolerated, with **genital and urinary infections** and **volume depletion** as the most common effects; serious adverse events are rare and manageable with patient education and monitoring [^112cUcSq] [^1154qFJo].

Approaches in Routine Clinical Practice

When using dapagliflozin in routine clinical practise there are a number of issues to consider to mitigate the risks associated with this treatment.

Education regarding the risks of minor adverse events such as mycotic genital infections and UTIs should be provided to people with T1DM when initiating dapagliflozin treatment. This may encourage people to self-monitor treatment efficacy and adverse effects and help them manage these infections. People should also be made aware of the risk of Fournier's gangrene, a rare but serious and potentially life-threatening infection, which has been associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, and they should be informed of additional risk factors that may increase their risk of this infection, including for example poor personal hygiene, alcohol abuse and obesity. People should be advised to seek urgent medical attention if they experience severe pain, tenderness, erythaema or swelling in the genital or perineal area, accompanied by fever or malaise. If Fournier's gangrene is suspected, clinicians are advised to stop dapagliflozin and urgently start appropriate treatment, including the administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and surgical removal of extensive areas of necrosis.

An increased risk of DKA has been associated with the use of dapagliflozin, with inadequate insulin dose being reported as the most common risk factor. Therefore, individuals who are relatively insulin deficient, have sudden reductions in insulin dose or have an increased requirement for insulin (due to illness, surgery or alcohol abuse) should be closely monitored. Education of both people with T1DM and healthcare professionals will play a crucial role in reducing the risk of DKA associated with dapagliflozin use. This should include the provision of relevant information in both oral and written forms. A person-centred information leaflet covering the key messages should be provided for the person to take away and refer to when needed. It is important for those with T1DM as well as healthcare professionals to be aware that DKA associated with the use of dapagliflozin may not present typically and that glucose levels may be relatively normal, a condition referred to as normoglycemic DKA or euglycemic DKA. Thus, we recommend testing for raised blood ketone levels when DKA symptoms are present, or during bouts of minor illness, even if blood glucose levels are within the normal range.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. For all other patients, inform them that DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to have adequate fluid intake.

### Dapagliflozin reduces uric acid concentration, an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in DAPA-HF [^116xaXSp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uric acid (UA) is the final product of purine metabolism and blood levels reflect dietary intake of purines, synthesis of UA by xanthine oxidase and excretion of UA, mainly by the kidneys. Consequently, UA may be elevated in heart failure because elimination is reduced due to impaired kidney function and because diuretics impair uric acid excretion. UA may also be increased because of increased production due to greater xanthine oxidase activity in patients with heart failure. As a result, hyperuricaemia is common in heart failure and higher UA is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The association between higher UA and worse outcomes persists after adjustment for renal function, diuretic use and dose, and natriuretic peptide levels. Whether this is due to unmeasured confounding, or a directly injurious effect of UA is unknown. However, UA increases cytokine and chemokine production, promotes inflammation, impairs endothelial function and activates the renin–angiotensin system. In addition, UA may be a marker of oxidative stress as xanthine oxidase generates superoxide along with UA. Hyperuricaemia can also lead to gout which is common in patients with heart failure, is difficult to manage and may lead to and prolong hospitalization. Therefore, drugs are frequently used, prophylactically, to reduce UA in patients with heart failure, with approximately 15%–20% of patients treated in this way.

For these reasons, the effect of therapies for heart failure on UA is of interest and agents that lower UA have even been investigated as a potential treatment for heart failure. The angiotensin receptor blocker losartan inhibition has been shown to reduce UA in patients without heart failure and neprilysin inhibition also reduces UA in patients with both heart failure with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction. Recently, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce hospitalization and death in patients with HFrEF. These drugs also reduce UA in patients with diabetes, although the exact mechanism of this effect is not understood and whether SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce UA in patients without diabetes is unknown.,

Therefore, we assessed the effect of dapagliflozin on UA in patients with HFrEF, with and without type 2 diabetes, enrolled in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse‐outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA‐HF). We also examined whether UA remains an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients receiving optimum contemporary treatment for HFrEF.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in diabetes mellitus [^116e1qwn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2015). Low credibility.

In older patients (≥ 65 years), the incidence and nature of AEs was similar to that observed in the overall population and in patients younger than 65 years.

Although there was a higher incidence of fractures reported among dapagliflozin compared with placebo recipients in a study of T2DM patients with moderate renal impairment, there was no evidence for an imbalance in fracture rate of patients in the dapagliflozin and all control groups in the pooled safety data. Furthermore, dapagliflozin did not affect markers of bone formation and resorption, or bone mineral density, at week 50 of a placebo-controlled study in 182 female and male patients with T2DM.

The generally favorable and predictable tolerability profile of dapagliflozin reported in this section is supported by the various meta-analyses and comprehensive reviews published to date.

### Cardiac effects of dapagliflozin in people with chronic kidney disease [^116NbCex]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adverse cardiac remodeling is common in people with chronic kidney disease and contributes to increased cardiovascular risk. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown cardioprotective effects in patients with chronic kidney disease, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood. This trial evaluated the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac structure and function in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Effects of Dapagliflozin on EChOcardiographic Measures of CarDiac StructurE and Function in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DECODE-CKD) was a 6-month, single-center, randomized, double-blind trial comparing dapagliflozin with placebo in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 59 or greater than or equal to 60 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 with a urine albumin-creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 200 mg/g. Participants underwent serial echocardiography and biomarker assessment. The primary end point was the change in left ventricular mass index. Secondary end points included changes in systolic and diastolic function, high-sensitivity troponin I, pro-B-type natriuretic peptides, hemoglobin, the urine albumin-creatinine ratio, and creatinine.

Results

Of 268 screened individuals, 222 were randomly assigned. The mean age was 67.5 years; 29.3% were women. Cardiovascular disease was present at enrollment in 34.2%, heart failure in 5.9%, hypertension in 75.7%, and diabetes in 8.6%. The most common causes of chronic kidney disease were hypertensive nephropathy (25.7%) and polycystic kidney disease (16.7%). The estimated mean difference in left ventricular mass index between the dapagliflozin group compared with placebo was -8.44 g/m 2 (95% confidence interval, -11.83 to -5.06; P < 0.001). Effects were consistent across key subgroups, including by demographics, cardiovascular history, biomarkers, and chronic kidney disease etiology. The rate of serious adverse events was similar between the groups.

Conclusions

In a heterogeneous population of patients with chronic kidney disease, dapagliflozin significantly reduced left ventricular mass index compared with placebo. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the early treatment benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors seen previously in chronic kidney disease. Further research is needed to replicate and further define these early treatment benefits.

### Dapagliflozin and cardiovascular mortality and disease outcomes in a population with type 2 diabetes similar to that of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial: a nationwide observational study [^115hq1DD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths of the present study include its population‐based, nationwide and real‐world design, which provides high external validity and a large enough population to allow propensity‐score‐matched analyses. The results were consistent with DECLARE‐TIMI 58 as well as several observational studies and subgroup analyses. 5, 9, 10 In addition, national registers with full coverage for hospitalizations, filled drug prescriptions and cause of death were used in the setting of an established and complete public healthcare system. Because diagnostic accuracy, such as identification of HHF in registries, can be challenging, it is reassuring that CV diagnoses in Sweden have high validity. 38 Anticipated neutral associations with atrial fibrillation and severe hypoglycaemia confirm the balanced baseline risk profile for the dapagliflozin group and other‐GLD group.

The study is limited by confounding factors, for example, selection bias or lack of data, impacting the CV risk at baseline, which is a common concern in observational studies; however, in the present study, strikingly similar results were obtained with regard to a broad number of outcomes compared to the CVOTs, which is unlikely to be explained solely by random or confounding effects. In the other‐GLD group, a significant proportion of patients had an index date for new initiation of insulin, which in observational studies has been shown to be associated with increased CV and mortality risks and to drive adverse effects when used as a comparator 28, 39, 40, 41; however, in the present DECLARE‐like cohort, 45% of the patients were already on insulin at baseline, which may have diluted the potential effects of new insulin treatment initiation. Moreover, the greater event rate decrease with dapagliflozin compared with stable event rates in other GLD, comparing the ITT with the OT approach, suggest a CV effect with dapagliflozin rather than adverse effects in the other GLD group, see Figure 4. In the recently published CVD‐REAL Nordic study by Persson et al, 9 comparing dapagliflozin with DPP‐4 inhibitors, nearly identical results were found using the same methods and including data from several countries, support the notion of beneficial effects of dapagliflozin rather than adverse effects of other GLDs. In another CVD‐REAL Nordic study by Birkeland et al, 10 comparing SGLT2 inhibitor use (94% dapagliflozin) with use of other GLDs, subgroup analyses with respect to treatment with insulin did not detect any interactions; thus, these large observational studies with similar outcomes and results showed no interactions with insulin treatment at baseline 10 or during follow‐up. 9 The results of the present study design, based on propensity‐score matching on a large number of clinically relevant variables (> 90 variables), have been shown to be robust, and the differences in mortality risks are probably explained by different levels of population frailty, as also discussed by Wiviott et al. 5

### Dapagliflozin (forxiga) for type 2 diabetes? [^114n1rt1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

In the UK, diabetes mellitus affects around 3 million people, of whom over 90% have type 2 diabetes. Aims of treatment include minimising long-term complications (e.g. cardiovascular disease, blindness, chronic kidney disease, premature mortality) and avoiding unwanted effects of treatment (e.g. severe hypoglycaemia, weight gain). Management of diabetes includes patient support and education; addressing symptoms; lifestyle modification; targeting associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease; and surveillance for, and management of, complications including treatment-related hypoglycaemia. Dapagliflozin (Forxiga) belongs to a new class of oral glucose-lowering drugs that inhibit renal glucose reabsorption and promote glycosuria. It is licensed in the UK in adults with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and who are unable to tolerate metformin; or, as add-on therapy, with other glucose-lowering agents including insulin, when these, with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. The company's advertising materials claim that dapagliflozin provides a "novel method of controlling excess glucose" with "secondary benefit of weight loss". Here, we review the evidence for the use of dapagliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors comprise an emerging, novel class of antihyperglycemic drugs that inhibit glucose reabsorption in the kidney and increase excretion of glucose in the urine. This new, orally administered treatment strategy directly lowers plasma glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner with a low risk of hypoglycemia. A common adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is an increased incidence of urinary tract and genital infections. Thus, special caution is warranted in elderly patients at higher risk of such infections, e.g. those with urinary incontinence.

The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin was recently approved in the United States by the FDA for the treatment of T2DM. Another SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, has been approved in the European Union but not in the United States. Additional SGLT2 inhibitors are currently under review by the FDA.

A 102-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study evaluated dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo added to metformin in 546 patients with T2DM. The mean change from baseline in HbA1c level was +0.02% for placebo compared with −0.48% (P = 0.0008), −0.58% (P < 0.0001), and −0.78% (P < 0.0001) for dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg, respectively. All dapagliflozin groups had sustained reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and bodyweight. Recorded hypoglycemic events were infrequent and not severe in nature. An increase in reported urinary tract infections and genital infections was observed for all dapagliflozin groups compared with placebo.

### Benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-I) versus SGLT2-is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1112pBgi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2‐Is) (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin) are the latest therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They increase excretion of glucose in the urine by inhibiting glucose reabsorption. Their use is associated with reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria and weight loss. There is substantial evidence that SGLT2‐Is reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in those at high risk, the need for heart failure hospitalization and the progression of kidney impairment.SGLT2‐Is alone do not cause hypoglycaemia and exert beneficial effects without having significant adverse effects. Their main common side effect is genital mycotic infections.SLGT2‐Is are less effective for glucose control in patients with moderate‐to‐severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate, GFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2)and are not recommended in many guidelines for glycaemic control in people with estimated GFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For several decades, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS‐Is) (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐Is), angiotensin‐II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and more recently direct renin inhibitors (DRIs)) have been employed to reduce the rate of progression of diabetes nephropathy in people with type 2 diabetes. Substantial evidence also suggests that RAAS‐Is reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors each independently reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney complications associated with type 2 diabetes and they appear to have synergistic effects when used as combination therapy. Hence, it will be clinically relevant to know the effectiveness of combining SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors versus SGLT2‐Is alone. Though a number of landmark trials comparing SGLT2‐Is with placebo have reported outcomes among subgroups of patients with or without RAAS inhibition, no previous systematic review has synthesized the existing evidence. In this context, using a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to evaluate whether the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors has a superior efficacy and safety profile than SGLT2‐Is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114oZdM5]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

As with all new diabetes oral therapies, they require the study of cardiovascular endpoints to assess safety. Empagliflozin, the most recent SGLT2 inhibitor on the market, was found to have added benefits of reducing the relative risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack, or nonfatal stroke by 14% and a significant 38% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death rate. These positive results come from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, but it still needs to be determined if this relates to the class of drugs, as cardiovascular outcome studies are still in progress for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.

A number of clinical concerns have been raised with this group of drugs. An increased risk of acidosis with euglycemia has been noted, particularly during the first 2 months of treatment. Whilst the case numbers were low and a third were identified as having type 1 diabetes, clear guidance has been issued that — particularly when used in combination with insulin or a sulfonylurea, where doses have been reduced — vigilance for ketosis must be high. Patients therefore should be informed of the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and healthcare professionals still need to consider DKA in patients who present with the symptoms but whose glucose levels are within the normal range and, as with metformin treatment, should be suspended in patients hospitalized for major surgical procedures or acute medical illness and restarted once the patient's condition has stabilized.

Concerns in relation to an increased frequency of fractures with canagliflozin compared to placebo and links to reduced bone mineral density have resulted in changes to the drug label "warning and precaution" and "adverse reactions"; further concerns have been highlighted in the CANVAS study in relation to increased amputation rates in those patients with a high cardiovascular risk, particularly those with a previous history of amputation. In clinical practice, this requires healthcare professionals to be mindful of patient risk factors before commencing this treatment, and to consider if it actually the most appropriate treatment choice for that patient. Reporting side effects is an important way of establishing any adverse impacts from new drugs, and all healthcare professionals need to be involved in this process when appropriate. The importance of ensuring that patients maintain good levels of hydration when treated with SGLT2 inhibitors in order to minimize the risk of potential adverse outcomes is being increasingly being stressed.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin by baseline glycemic status: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^115sBuNj]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) study demonstrated risk reduction for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes with dapagliflozin versus placebo in participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with and without diabetes. We compared outcomes according to baseline glycemic status.

Research Design and Methods

We enrolled participants with CKD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 200–5,000 mg/g. The primary composite end point was sustained eGFR decline ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney or cardiovascular death.

Results

Of 4,304 participants, 738 had normoglycemia, 660 had prediabetes, and 2,906 had type 2 diabetes. The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent (P for interaction = 0.19) in normoglycemia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62 [95% CI 0.39, 1.01]), prediabetes (HR 0.37 [0.21, 0.66]), and type 2 diabetes (HR 0.64 [0.52, 0.79]). We found no evidence for effect modification on any outcome. Adverse events were similar, with no major hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis in participants with normoglycemia or prediabetes.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin safely reduced kidney and cardiovascular events independent of baseline glycemic status.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and different risk categories: a meta-analysis [^116ERbxt]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A pre-specified meta-analysis of cardiovascular (CV) events from 21 phase 2b/3 dapagliflozin clinical trials was undertaken to characterise the CV profile of dapagliflozin. This showed no increase in CV risk with dapagliflozin compared with control (placebo or comparator treatment) with or without background glucose-lowering therapies. The analysis reported here aimed to characterise the CV profile of dapagliflozin in subgroups of patients in these 21 studies grouped by degree of CV risk, based on both baseline and in-study risk factors (including hypoglycaemic events), with a focus on major adverse CV events (MACE).

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes, both overall and with different levels of CV risk, including CV disease (CVD) history, age and other CV risk factors, were analysed. A further analysis compared CV risk in patients who experienced a hypoglycaemic event prior to MACE and those who did not. Analyses were based on time to first event using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by study comparing dapagliflozin versus control.

Results

In total, 9339 patients were included in this meta-analysis; 5936 patients received dapagliflozin 2.5–10 mg (6668 patient-years) and 3403 received control (3882 patient-years). Dapagliflozin is not associated with increased CV risk and results further suggest the potential for a beneficial effect both in the overall population [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.77; 95% CI (0.54, 1.10) for MACE] and in those with a history of CVD [HR 0.80 (0.53, 1.22)]. These findings were consistent in patients with varying degrees of CV risk, including age, number and type of CVD events in medical history and number of CV risk factors present. Furthermore, there was no increased risk of MACE in patients who experienced a hypoglycaemic event compared with those who did not.

Conclusions

There was no suggestion of increased risk for MACE with dapagliflozin compared with control in any of the populations investigated. In addition, the results suggest the potential for a beneficial CV effect which is consistent with the multifactorial benefits on CV risk factors associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111xuRj3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Attainment of optimal glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and with body weight reduction is a major goal of type 2 diabetes management. 1, 2 Metformin is the first‐line pharmacotherapy recommended for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and has proven efficacy in achieving clinically relevant reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. 1 Most patients eventually require treatment with 2 or more antidiabetes agents to maintain adequate control of blood glucose levels, 3 and international treatment guidelines recommend stepwise intensification of therapy through add‐on to metformin. 1, 4

The latest generation of oral antidiabetes drugs, including sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, have demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with inadequate glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Moreover, in a 24‐week study, triple therapy with concomitant addition of dapagliflozin, an SGLT‐2 inhibitor, plus the DPP‐4 inhibitor saxagliptin to metformin led to greater improvements in glycaemic control than add‐on of either agent alone. 11 These improvements were achieved without increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared with dual therapy, and both dapagliflozin‐containing regimens were associated with the benefit of weight loss. 11 Dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens, therefore, may be a promising second‐line treatment strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control.

Sulphonylureas are widely used as second‐line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Although their efficacy as antidiabetes agents is established, drawbacks include hypoglycaemia, weight gain and limited long‐term efficacy. Furthermore, data from some studies have suggested a possible association between sulphonylurea use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 12, 13, 14 Use of dapagliflozin‐containing treatment regimens as second‐line therapy may provide an alternative option to sulphonylureas, with a more favourable side‐effect profile and additional beneficial effects on body weight and blood pressure control. In a head‐to‐head study, dapagliflozin and a sulphonylurea (glipizide) demonstrated similar efficacy, with the benefits of sustained reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP), greater glycaemic durability and a lower rate of hypoglycaemia with dapagliflozin compared to glipizide after 1 year of treatment. 15 These effects continued to be observed in extensions of up to 4 years. 15, 16, 17

### Iron deficiency in heart failure and effect of dapagliflozin: findings from DAPA-HF [^111xaXFd]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Iron deficiency is common in heart failure and associated with worse outcomes. We examined the prevalence and consequences of iron deficiency in the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure) and the effect of dapagliflozin on markers of iron metabolism. We also analyzed the effect of dapagliflozin on outcomes, according to iron status at baseline.

Methods:

Iron deficiency was defined as a ferritin level < 100 ng/mL or a transferrin saturation < 20% and a ferritin level 100 to 299 ng/mL. Additional biomarkers of iron metabolism, including soluble transferrin receptor, erythropoietin, and hepcidin were measured at baseline and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure (hospitalization or urgent visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death.

Results:

Of the 4744 patients randomized in DAPA-HF, 3009 had ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements available at baseline, and 1314 of these participants (43.7%) were iron deficient. The rate of the primary outcome was higher in patients with iron deficiency (16.6 per 100 person-years) compared with those without (10.4 per 100 person-years; P < 0.0001). The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in iron-deficient compared with iron-replete patients (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.58–0.92] versus 0.81 [95% CI, 0.63–1.03]; P -interaction = 0.59). Similar findings were observed for cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. Transferrin saturation, ferritin, and hepcidin were reduced and total iron-binding capacity and soluble transferrin receptor increased with dapagliflozin compared with placebo.

Conclusions:

Iron deficiency was common in DAPA-HF and associated with worse outcomes. Dapagliflozin appeared to increase iron use but improved outcomes, irrespective of iron status at baseline.

### Pharmacotherapy to delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: past, present and future [^114Ws9b1]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The DAPA-CKD trial included patients with non-diabetic renal disease. In patients with eGFR 25–75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and albuminuria, dapagliflozin demonstrated a 44% reduction in the composite renal outcome of doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD or death from renal causes (HR 0.56 (0.45–0.68); p < 0.001). The NNT was 19.

Meta-analysis confirms favourable effects of SGLT2i on the renal composite of doubling of serum creatinine (eGFR 40% decline), RRT initiation or renal related death (RR 0.63 (0.56–0.71) even in the presence of CVD or multiple risk factors (RR 0.67 (0.59–0.76)

Based on these studies, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are now licenced for use for renal and cardiovascular protection in DKD and can be initiated in patients with T2D and macroalbuminuria, and eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin) as add on to ACEI, irrespective of glucose control.

With regards to adverse effects, the commonest adverse event is genital mycotic infections, which may commonly occur early in treatment. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are less frequent. An important, but rare, adverse effect is that of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. Careful patient education around 'sick day rules' (cessation of the drug during intercurrent illness), avoidance prior to surgery and avoidance of ketogenic diets is required.

### Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on patient outcomes: a network meta-analysis [^117NM6JG]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors are generally perceived as safe, however, our findings indicate that ertugliflozin increased the risk of UTI in the patients with DM. Additionally, we observed that all SGLT2 inhibitors, with the exception of dapagliflozin were associated with increased risks of mycotic genital infections, and that canagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of lower limb amputation in in the patients with DM. A preceding NMA identified a positive relationship between rapid drug action and potent efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing HbA1c in the patients with DM. Considering that ertugliflozin is the most potent rapidly absorbed drug and that dapagliflozin is excreted most slowly by the kidneys among the three SGLT2 inhibitors, our findings further demonstrate a positive relationship between rapid drug action and higher risk of adverse events with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with DM.

Our findings highlighted that the canagliflozin users had a high risk of limb amputation. Canagliflozin exhibits less selective for SGLT2 than other SGLT2 inhibitors, leading to a more pronounced inhibitory effect on SGLT1. Lin et al. reported that the risk of lower limb amputation was slightly increased in canagliflozin users. This result is corroborated by other studies demonstrating reduced intravascular volume and hypotension due to insufficient compensatory effects of SGLT1. Consequently, consistent monitoring of lower limb perfusion for SGLT2 inhibitor users with peripheral artery occlusive disease or those on diuretics could help in mitigating the onset of lower limb complications.

### What next after metformin? Thinking beyond glycaemia: are SGLT2 inhibitors the answer? [^116EpUaL]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

If we are to advocate the use of a relatively new therapeutic entity such as an SGLT2 inhibitor as widely as the preferred treatment option following metformin failure, then safety is an extremely important consideration. Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly adverse events including mycotic genital infections, Fournier gangrene, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute kidney injury, lower-limb amputation and fracture. There has been considerable focus on the safe and optimal use of the SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice. Data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study further supports the safety profile of the SGLT2 inhibitors. Dapagliflozin was not associated with any excess in amputation, bone fracture, urinary tract infection, malignancy, Fournier gangrene, volume depletion or hypoglycaemia compared with placebo, and there were numerically fewer cases of acute kidney injury with dapagliflozin (1.5% vs. 2.0%). Genital mycotic infections and adjudicated DKA were both higher in dapagliflozin-treated subjects (0.9% vs. 0.1% and 0.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively); however, these adverse events occurred at a very low frequency and as such the benefit–risk profile remains overwhelmingly in favour of the SGLT2 inhibitor. The risk of adverse events should not mask the CV and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors as results from the majority of studies indicate that the safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is good. However, SGLT2 inhibitor clinical studies have been of relatively short duration, with DECLARE-TIMI 58 having the longest median follow-up of over 4 years. As such, further studies assessing both efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in longer-term trials are now needed.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, inform them that using FARXIGA can increase their risk of life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. For all other patients, inform them that FARXIGA can cause potentially fatal ketoacidosis and that type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are risk factors.

Educate all patients on precipitating factors (such as insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, infection, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, dehydration, and alcohol abuse) and symptoms of ketoacidosis (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and labored breathing). Inform patients that blood glucose may be normal even in the presence of ketoacidosis.

Advise patients that they may be asked to monitor ketones. If symptoms of ketoacidosis occur, instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Volume Depletion

Inform patients that symptomatic hypotension may occur with FARXIGA and advise them to contact their healthcare provider if they experience such symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Inform patients that dehydration may increase the risk for hypotension, and to have adequate fluid intake.

### Dapagliflozin [^115R8B4q]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

These data reflect exposure of 2338 adult patients to dapagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N = 1393), dapagliflozin 5 mg (N = 1145), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (N = 1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults associated with the use of dapagliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for Dapagliflozin 10 mg for Glycemic Control

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger glycemic control placebo-controlled trial pool in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled trials, including 3 monotherapy trials, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy trials, and an initial combination with metformin trial. Across these 13 trials, 2360 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Conclusion

In the clinical treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy, dapagliflozin has a significant effect, which can effectively improve the condition of patients with diabetes, control the aggravation of patients with nephropathy, reduce the symptoms of patients, and have an outstanding curative effect. In addition, the probability of adverse reactions in patients after the medication is low, safe, and effective.

### Sustained 52-week efficacy and safety of triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus dual therapy with sitagliptin added to metformin in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^111d39SD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this double‐blind, double‐dummy 52‐week trial, we report that an intensification strategy of early triple combination therapy with the addition of DAPA plus SAXA provides significantly greater improvements in glycaemic control than a dual therapy strategy with the addition of SITA alone in patients with inadequately controlled MET‐treated type 2 diabetes. These improvements were sustained after 52 weeks and were not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia or other diabetes‐specific events, and the overall incidence of AEs was low. Furthermore, the improvement in glycaemic control with DAPA plus SAXA treatment was accompanied by a greater reduction in body weight and systolic blood pressure compared with treatment with SITA.

Therapeutic guidelines recommend treatment intensification through addition of anti‐diabetes agents for patients with inadequate glycaemic control with MET. 7 However, dual add‐on therapy is rarely used, despite the knowledge that glycaemic control is seldom achieved with single‐agent add‐ons. The use of single‐agent add‐ons often leads to long periods of hyperglycaemia, 8 which are associated with increased morbidity. 9 The objective of this study was to evaluate the strategy of adding two anti‐hyperglycaemic agents (DAPA plus SAXA) simultaneously compared with the more common approach of adding one agent at a time (SITA) in patients with type 2 diabetes that is uncontrolled by MET. Adding two therapies simultaneously led to more rapid glucose control, which was sustained over 52 weeks, suggesting that there may be underlying improvements in insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Treatment with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET provided greater reductions in HbA1c and FPG than treatment with SITA add‐on, although, even with triple therapy, mean final HbA1c values were greater than 7% (53 mmol/mol), probably the result of the patients' high baseline HbA1c levels. However, a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved HbA1c less than 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on therapy than with SITA add‐on after 26 and 52 weeks, despite high baseline HbA1c levels. Differences in adjusted mean change from baseline in both HbA1c and FPG between the two treatment groups increased from Week 26 to Week 52, and a lower proportion of patients in the DAPA plus SAXA group required rescue therapy, indicating that SITA add‐on therapy is associated with more rapid increases in HbA1c and FPG over time, and that the efficacy of early triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET is durable. These improvements in glycaemic control are consistent with those reported in a previous clinical study that investigated the efficacy and safety of DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET compared with the addition to MET of each agent alone. 16 In separate 52‐week studies in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, triple therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin plus SITA add‐on to MET resulted in greater improvements in glycaemic control compared with SITA add‐on, 17 and triple therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin plus the DPP‐4 inhibitor linagliptin added to MET significantly reduced HbA1c levels compared with the individual drugs added to MET. 18 Together, these studies indicate that a treatment strategy with early combination therapy may result in more rapid and more durable glycaemic control, with no increase in AEs, than single‐agent sequential add‐on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes that is inadequately controlled with MET. The proportion of patients experiencing AEs and hypoglycaemia was similar for treatment with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on and for treatment with SITA add‐on therapies. The incidence of genital infections was low and similar between treatment groups; the incidence of UTIs was slightly higher in both men and women with triple therapy than with dual therapy (men, 4.0% vs 1.8%; women, 8.3% vs 5.0%, respectively). The overall incidence of both genital infections and UTIs after 52 weeks was only slightly higher than that observed at 26 weeks, were only mild or moderate in severity, and were similar to those previously reported for DAPA. 19, 20 Triple therapy with DAPA plus SAXA add‐on to MET was associated with cumulative weight loss from 26 to 52 weeks, which was greater than that with dual therapy with SITA add‐on.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in heart failure trial [^111zm3uH]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Women may respond differently to certain treatments for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than men.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin compared with placebo in men and women with HFrEF enrolled in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prespecified subgroup analysis of a phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted at 410 sites in 20 countries. Patients with New York Heart Association functional class II through IV with an ejection fraction of 40% or less and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were eligible. Data were analyzed between June 2020 and January 2021.

Interventions

Addition of once-daily 10 mg of dapagliflozin or placebo to guideline-recommended therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of an episode of worsening HF (HF hospitalization or urgent HF visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death.

Results

A total of 4744 patients were randomized in DAPA-HF, of whom 1109 were women (23.4%). Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening HF events or cardiovascular death to a similar extent in both men and women (hazard ratios, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.85] and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.59–1.06], respectively; P for interaction = .67). Consistent benefits were observed for the components of the primary outcome and all-cause mortality. Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin increased the proportion of patients with a meaningful improvement in symptoms (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score of ≥ 5 points; men, 59% vs 50%; women, 57% vs 54%; P for interaction = .14) and decreased the proportion with worsening symptoms (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score decrease of ≥ 5 points; men, 25% vs 34%; women, 27% vs 31%; P for interaction = .15), irrespective of sex. Results were consistent for the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score and overall summary score. Study drug discontinuation and serious adverse events were not more frequent in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group in either men or women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening HF, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death and improved symptoms, physical function, and health-related quality of life similarly in men and women with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. In addition, dapagliflozin was safe and well-tolerated irrespective of sex.

Safety

Adverse events were reported in 56% (44/78) of the participants in the dapagliflozin group, compared with 64% (49/76) of those in the placebo group (supplementary table 7). The common adverse events were covid-19, insomnia, and gout. Admission to hospital due to diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in one participant in the placebo group and no serious adverse event occurred in the dapagliflozin group. The proportion of participants who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1% (1/78) with dapagliflozin and 3% (2/76) with placebo. Urinary tract infection and diabetic ketoacidosis were the most common reasons for discontinuation. No cases of cardiovascular disease events, cancer, or deaths were observed. Furthermore, no cases of severe hypoglycaemia were reported. Occurrences of mild adverse events, such as insomnia, gout, nasopharyngitis, hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal polyp, fatigue, dizziness, gastroenteritis, rash, bone fracture, alopecia, circumcision, dermatitis, face oedema, genital pruritus, headache, and upper abdominal pain, were similar between the two groups (supplementary table 7).

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis of data from across the dapagliflozin clinical development programme, including high CV risk patients, there was no evidence for increased risk of major adverse CV events with dapagliflozin. The results suggest the potential for a beneficial CV effect by dapagliflozin which is consistent with the multifactorial benefits on CV risk factors associated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Trials with Metformin HCl Extended-Release in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in > 5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release.

Clinical Trials with Dapagliflozin in Adults

Dapagliflozin

Dapagliflozin has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adult patients with heart failure, and in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin was consistent across the studied indications. No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF, DELIVER and DAPA-CKD trials.

Pools of Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials for Glycemic Control in Adults

Pool of 8 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl for Glycemic Control

Data from a prespecified pool of adult patients from 8 short-term, placebo-controlled trials of dapagliflozin coadministered with metformin HCl immediate- or extended-release was used to evaluate safety. This pool included several add-on trials (metformin HCl alone and in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP4] inhibitor and metformin HCl, or insulin and metformin HCl, 2 initial combination with metformin HCl trials, and 2 trials of patients with CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus who received their usual treatment [with metformin HCl as background therapy]). For trials that included background therapy with and without metformin HCl, only patients who received metformin HCl were included in the 8-trial placebo-controlled pool. Across these 8 trials, 983 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl, and 1185 were treated with placebo and metformin HCl. These 8 trials provide a mean duration of exposure of 23 weeks. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years. Fifty-four percent (54%) of the population was male; 88% White, 6% Asian, and 3% Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.4%, and renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 90% of patients and moderately impaired in 10% of patients.

### European Society of Cardiology / heart failure association position paper on the role and safety of new glucose-lowering drugs in patients with heart failure [^114KPK7n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Significant advances have recently occurred in the treatment of T2DM, with evidence of several new glucose-lowering medications showing either neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, some of these agents have safety characteristics with strong practical implications in HF [i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors]. Regarding safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin is not recommended in HF because of a greater risk of HF hospitalisation. There is no compelling evidence of excess HF risk with the other DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs have an overall neutral effect on HF outcomes. However, a signal of harm suggested in two small trials of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction indicates that their role remains to be defined in established HF. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) have shown a consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation regardless of baseline cardiovascular risk or history of HF. Accordingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could be recommended to prevent HF hospitalisation in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors. The recently completed trial with dapagliflozin has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and HF events in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with or without T2DM. Several ongoing trials will assess whether the results observed with dapagliflozin could be extended to other SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HF, with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence of T2DM. This position paper aims to summarise relevant clinical trial evidence concerning the role and safety of new glucose-lowering therapies in patients with HF.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to frailty in patients with heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the DELIVER trial [^115USVgG]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prespecified analysis of DELIVER, ≈63% of patients were categorized as frail. Greater frailty was associated with more impairment in health status and worse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations and death. The beneficial effects of dapagliflozin compared with placebo on clinical outcomes were consistent regardless of frailty class. The improvements in symptoms, physical function, and quality of life were larger in the patients with the greatest degree of frailty. Adverse events, although more frequent in patients with a greater degree of frailty, were not more common in those randomized to dapagliflozin compared with placebo.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116FDAZh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2), which mediates approximately 90% of active renal glucose reabsorption in the early proximal tubule of the kidney. Dapagliflozin significantly reduces glucose reabsorption and decreases serum glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner. The decrease of glucose reabsorption by dapagliflozin has also been associated with a reduction in body weight. Furthermore, the drug modestly reduces blood pressure levels through weight loss and its action as osmotic diuretic. Dapagliflozin has been approved as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who cannot tolerate metformin or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, with the exception of pioglitazone due to the theoretical increased risk of bladder cancer. The drug should not be prescribed in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients at risk for developing volume depletion. Dapagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of genital and lower urinary tract infections, but these infections are usually mild to moderate and respond to standard antimicrobial treatment. Based on current evidence, dapagliflozin is a useful drug for patients with T2DM with a favorable safety profile. However, further research regarding the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes is needed.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^113vNL8k]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The overall incidence of adverse events for the 8-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pool in adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl was 60.3% compared to 58.2% for the placebo and metformin HCl group. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events in patients who received dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl was 4% compared to 3.3% for the placebo and metformin HCl group. The most commonly reported events leading to discontinuation and reported in at least 3 patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and metformin HCl were renal impairment (0.7%), increased blood creatinine (0.2%), decreased renal creatinine clearance (0.2%), and urinary tract infection (0.2%).

Table 2 shows common adverse reactions in adults associated with the use of dapagliflozin and metformin HCl. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either dapagliflozin 5 mg or dapagliflozin 10 mg.

Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for Dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg for Glycemic Control

The data in Table 3 are derived from 12 glycemic control placebo-controlled trials in adults ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 trials dapagliflozin was used as monotherapy, and in 8 trials dapagliflozin was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin HCl [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Dapagliflozin added to usual care in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus with preexisting cardiovascular disease: a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 28-week extension [^113barQ9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, for the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, age-stratified (< 65 and ≥ 65), 24-week clinical trial with a 28-week extension.

Setting

One hundred seventy-three centers in 10 countries.

Participants

Individuals (N = 964) with T2DM, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.0% to 10.0%, and documented CVD.

Intervention

Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo was added to usual care. Participants receiving insulin had their total daily insulin dose reduced by 25% at randomization.

Measurements

Two equal primary end points: change from baseline in HbA1c and proportion of participants achieving a three-item end point (reduction of ≥ 0.5% in HbA1c, ≥ 3% in body weight, and ≥ 3 mmHg in systolic blood pressure) at 24 weeks.

Results

Forty-seven percent were aged 65 and older, 7.7% were aged 75 and older, mean duration of T2DM was 13 years, mean baseline HbA1c was 8.1%, and approximately 60% were taking insulin. The placebo-corrected change in HbA1c with dapagliflozin was -0.4% at 24 weeks. Significantly more participants achieved the three-item end point with dapagliflozin (10.0%) than with placebo (1.9%). The placebo-corrected percentage change in body weight for dapagliflozin was -1.9% (-1.8 kg). Similar results were observed in both age strata, and changes were maintained over 52 weeks. More than one-quarter (28.2%) of participants receiving dapagliflozin and 25.3% of those receiving placebo experienced hypoglycemia. More participants receiving dapagliflozin had vulvovaginitis, balanitis, or urinary tract infection.

Conclusion

When added to a usual background regimen in an older population with advanced T2DM and preexisting comorbid CVD, dapagliflozin improved glycemic control without an increase in hypoglycemic risk, promoted weight loss, and was well tolerated.

Possible Side Effects Associated with Dapagliflozin

In addition to their demonstrated efficacy, SGLT2i also have a good safety profile. The most common adverse events (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) with dapagliflozin include genital and urinary tract infections, rash, polyuria, increased haematocrit, dyslipidaemia and decreased renal creatinine clearance during initial treatment, which is usually reversed. The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease and HF was consistent with the known safety profile of dapagliflozin previously described in studies of the diabetic population.

Other uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100) side effects have been described, including yeast infection, volume depletion, pruritus and thirst, as well as rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000) events such as diabetic ketoacidosis; in fact, the reported frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis in the DECLARE clinical trial was 0.3% in the dapagliflozin group (vs 0.1% in the placebo group).

The frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background treatment used in the clinical study of diabetes mellitus: in the DECLARE, DAPA CKD and DAPA HF studies, no increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia was observed with dapagliflozin therapy compared to placebo (0.7% vs 1.0%; 0.2% vs 0.2%; 0.7% vs 1.3%, respectively). All cases were reported in patients with T2DM. Taking this into account, safety concerns do not seem to be the reason for the mismatch between evidence and prescription of SGLT2i described here.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^113PzA6a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

These data reflect exposure of 2338 adult patients to FARXIGA with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N = 1393), FARXIGA 5 mg (N = 1145), or FARXIGA 10 mg (N = 1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults associated with the use of FARXIGA. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on FARXIGA than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either FARXIGA 5 mg or FARXIGA 10 mg.

Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for FARXIGA 10 mg for Glycemic Control

FARXIGA 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger glycemic control placebo-controlled trial pool in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled trials, including 3 monotherapy trials, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy trials, and an initial combination with metformin trial. Across these 13 trials, 2360 patients were treated once daily with FARXIGA 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m2).

3.5 Safety

Overall, AEs were more common in patients treated with RASi (who were also older and had a longer duration of T2D) compared with patients without RASi treatment. However, among patients with RASi treatment, the AE profile was similar in the placebo and dapagliflozin treatment groups (Table 2). Among the group without RASi treatment, the proportion of patients with at least one AE was greater in the dapagliflozin‐treated patients than in the placebo‐treated patients (Table 2).

### Carcinogenicity risk assessment supports the chronic safety of dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116TwFPW]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The studies presented here were undertaken because it is well recognized that even the most extensive clinical development programs can at best only provide safety screening signals related to human malignancies, especially for risks involving specific cancer types. Using a multitude of different approaches and at high multiples of human exposures, this comprehensive non-clinical safety program provided a substantial body of evidence suggesting no indication of tumor initiation or promotion or enhancement of tumor progression associated with selective SGLT2 inhibition in general or with dapagliflozin specifically. Therefore, these results support the finding of no overall imbalance in malignancy observed in clinical trials and add to the weight of evidence regarding the overall safety of dapagliflozin in humans.

### Cardio-renal-metabolic overlap, outcomes, and dapagliflozin in heart Failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^117Ryrpw]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardio-renal-metabolic (CRM) conditions are individually common among patients with heart failure (HF), but the prevalence and influence of overlapping CRM conditions in this population have not been well-studied.

Objectives

This study aims to evaluate the impact of overlapping CRM conditions on clinical outcomes and treatment effects of dapagliflozin in HF.

Methods

In this post hoc analysis of DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure), we evaluated the prevalence of comorbid CRM conditions (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes), their impact on the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or worsening HF), and treatment effects of dapagliflozin by CRM status.

Results

Among 6,263 participants, 1,952 (31%), 2,245 (36%), and 1,236 (20%) had 1, 2, and 3 additional CRM conditions, respectively. HF alone was uncommon (13%). Greater CRM multimorbidity was associated with older age, higher body mass index, longer-duration HF, worse health status, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Risk of the primary outcome increased with higher CRM overlap, with 3 CRM conditions independently associated with highest risk of primary events (adjusted HR: 2.16 [95% CI: 1.72–2.72]; P < 0.001) compared with HF alone. Relative benefits of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome were consistent irrespective of the type of CRM overlap (P interaction = 0.773) and by the number of CRM conditions (P interaction = 0.734), with greatest absolute benefits among those with highest CRM multimorbidity. Estimated 2-year numbers needed to treat with dapagliflozin to prevent 1 primary event were approximately 52, 39, 33, and 24 for participants with 0, 1, 2, and 3 additional CRM conditions at baseline, respectively. Adverse events between treatment arms were similar across the CRM spectrum.

Conclusions

CRM multimorbidity was common and associated with adverse outcomes among patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction > 40% in DELIVER. Dapagliflozin was safe and effective across the CRM spectrum, with greater absolute benefits among those with highest CRM overlap (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure [DELIVER]; NCT03619213).

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in the elderly: analysis from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study [^1156zjKg]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Data regarding the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and very elderly (age ≥ 75 years) are limited.

Research Design and Methods

The Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 assessed cardiac and renal outcomes of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. Efficacy and safety outcomes were studied within age subgroups for treatment effect and age-based treatment interaction.

Results

Of the 17,160 patients, 9,253 were < 65 years of age, 6,811 ≥ 65 to < 75 years, and 1,096 ≥ 75 years. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure consistently, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.72, 1.07), 0.77 (0.63, 0.94), and 0.94 (0.65, 1.36) in age-groups < 65, ≥ 65 to < 75, and ≥ 75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.5277). Overall, dapagliflozin did not significantly decrease the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, with HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.81, 1.08), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13), and 0.84 (0.61, 1.15) in age-groups < 65, ≥ 65 to < 75, and ≥ 75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.7352). The relative risk reduction for the secondary prespecified cardiorenal composite outcome ranged from 18% to 28% in the different age-groups with no heterogeneity. Major hypoglycemia was less frequent with dapagliflozin versus placebo, with HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.58, 1.64), 0.50 (0.29, 0.84), and 0.68 (0.29, 1.57) in age-groups < 65, ≥ 65 to < 75, and ≥ 75 years, respectively (interaction P value 0.2107). Safety outcomes, including fractures, volume depletion, cancer, urinary tract infections, and amputations were balanced with dapagliflozin versus placebo, and acute kidney injury was reduced, all regardless of age. Genital infections that were serious or led to discontinuation of the study drug and diabetic ketoacidosis were uncommon, yet more frequent with dapagliflozin versus placebo, without heterogeneity (interaction P values 0.1058 and 0.8433, respectively).

Conclusions

The overall efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin are consistent regardless of age.

### Dapagliflozin and diuretic use in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in DAPA-HF [^117Kaa6s]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety

The frequency of volume depletion, renal adverse events, and study drug discontinuation as a result of an adverse event varied according to background diuretic therapy in the placebo arm. The rates of all adverse outcomes of interest were lower in patients not treated with a diuretic at baseline compared with patients treated with a diuretic. Among patients treated with a diuretic at baseline, the placebo rate of each adverse outcome was highest in patients on a dose of > 40 mg furosemide equivalent (Table 3).

When the randomized treatment arms were compared, volume depletion and renal adverse events were significantly less common in patients allocated to dapagliflozin compared with those randomized to placebo in patients not taking diuretics at baseline. In patients taking diuretics, volume depletion was slightly more common with dapagliflozin than with placebo in patients in the higher-dose diuretic groups. Other adverse effects were not different, and there was no difference between treatment groups in study drug discontinuation for adverse events.

Other Measures of Interest

From baseline to 8 months, the placebo-corrected increases in hematocrit and creatinine and decreases in systolic blood pressure and weight with dapagliflozin were similar in patients receiving and those not receiving diuretics at baseline (Table 3 and Figure 3). Although the decrease in NT-proBNP was numerically greater in patients receiving diuretics, the variance in this measure was large, and the difference was not statistically significant.

Figure 3.
Changes in laboratory and clinical measures according to diuretic therapy at baseline.

In a comparison across the diuretic dose groups, none of the placebo-corrected changes with dapagliflozin differed significantly, although the changes tended to be smallest in the highest diuretic dose group.

The elevation in hematocrit with dapagliflozin was sustained, regardless of dose of loop diuretic (Table 3 and Figure 3). This persisted regardless of whether the dose of conventional diuretic was decreased, was increased, or remained the same at 6 and 12 months.

### Dapagliflozin [^112yTeQF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for Dapagliflozin 10 mg for Glycemic Control

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger glycemic control placebo-controlled trial pool in adult patients. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled trials, including 3 monotherapy trials, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy trials, and an initial combination with metformin HCl trial. Across these 13 trials, 2360 patients were treated once daily with dapagliflozin 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Other Adverse Reactions with Dapagliflozin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) for the 12-trial and 13-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are shown in Table 4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypoglycemia

The frequency of hypoglycemia in adult patients by trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 5. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

### Effects of combined treatment with zibotentan and dapagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin alone in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^117KN6Xr]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this post‐hoc analysis of data from the ZENITH‐CKD trial, we compared the effects of combination treatment with zibotentan and dapagliflozin versus dapagliflozin alone on efficacy and safety parameters in participants with CKD, with and without type 2 diabetes.

While 1.5 mg zibotentan plus dapagliflozin consistently reduced UACR in participants with and without diabetes, treatment with 0.25 mg zibotentan and dapagliflozin compared to dapagliflozin alone showed a numerically larger effect on UACR in participants without diabetes compared to those with diabetes. This appeared to be mainly driven by a less pronounced UACR‐lowering effect of dapagliflozin alone in participants without diabetes compared to those with diabetes, consistent with previous studies. The UACR effects of combined treatment with zibotentan and dapagliflozin were similar in participants with and without diabetes. There was no clear evidence that the effects on markers of fluid retention varied in participants with and without diabetes, although fluid retention‐related adverse events were more common in participants with type 2 diabetes assigned to the 1.5 mg zibotentan plus dapagliflozin treatment group while haematocrit was lower compared to participants without type 2 diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin's effects on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes: a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 28-week extension [^112drJca]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), documented pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and a history of hypertension.

Research Design and Methods

Patients (N = 922) were randomized to receive 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo in a double-blind trial for 24 weeks, followed by a 28-week extension period. In patients receiving insulin, the insulin dose was reduced by 25% at randomization. Patients were stratified by age, insulin use, and time from the most recent qualifying cardiovascular (CV) event. Co-primary end points were a change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the proportion of patients achieving a combined reduction in HbA1c of ≥ 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), body weight (BW) of ≥ 3%, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 3 mmHg.

Results

At 24 weeks, dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.38% [-4.2 mmol/mol]) from baseline (8.18%) compared with a slight increase with placebo from baseline (8.08%) (0.08% [0.9 mmol/mol]). Significantly more patients met the three-item end point with treatment with dapagliflozin than with placebo (11.7% vs. 0.9%, respectively). Changes were maintained over 52 weeks. Although ∼42% of patients were ≥ 65 years old, similar results were observed in both age-stratified groups. Serious adverse events, hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, and cardiac disorders were similar between groups. Adverse events of hypotension, dehydration, hypovolemia, genital infection, and renal failure or impairment occurred more often with dapagliflozin treatment.

Conclusions

In this study that evaluated T2D patients who were at high risk for future CVD events, dapagliflozin administration had significantly greater effects in reducing HbA1c, BW, and SBP, without adversely impacting CV safety when compared with placebo treatment.

### Patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and effect of dapagliflozin in relation to duration of heart failure: is It ever too late to start a new therapy? [^113Dd4P6]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of heart failure (HF) duration on outcomes and treatment effect is largely unknown. We aim to compare baseline patient characteristics, outcomes, and the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, in relation to time from diagnosis of HF in DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure).

Methods

HF duration was categorized as ≥ 2 to ≤ 12 months, > 1 to 2 years, > 2 to 5 years, and > 5 years. Outcomes were adjusted for prognostic variables and analyzed using Cox regression. The primary end point was the composite of worsening HF or cardiovascular death. Treatment effect was examined within each duration category and by duration threshold.

Results

The number of patients in each category was: 1098 (≥ 2- ≤ 12 months), 686 (> 1–2 years), 1105 (> 2–5 years), and 1855 (> 5 years). Longer-duration HF patients were older and more comorbid with worse symptoms. The rate of the primary outcome (per 100 person-years) increased with HF duration: 10.2 (95% CI, 8.7–12.0) for ≥ 2 to ≤ 12 months, 10.6 (8.7–12.9) > 1 to 2 years, 15.5 (13.6–17.7) > 2 to 5 years, and 15.9 (14.5–17.6) for > 5 years. Similar trends were seen for all other outcomes. The benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent across HF duration and on threshold analysis. The hazard ratio for the primary outcome ≥ 2 to ≤ 12 months was 0.86 (0.63–1.18), > 1 to 2 years 0.95 (0.64–1.42), > 2 to 5 years 0.74 (0.57–0.96), and > 5 years 0.64 (0.53–0.78), P interaction = 0.26. The absolute benefit was greatest in longest-duration HF, with a number needed to treat of 18 for HF > 5 years, compared with 28 for ≥ 2 to ≤ 12 months.

Conclusions

Longer-duration HF patients were older, had more comorbidity and symptoms, and higher rates of worsening HF and death. The benefits of dapagliflozin were consistent across HF duration. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03036124.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There were no reports of overdose during the clinical development program for dapagliflozin.

In the event of an overdose, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. It is also reasonable to employ supportive measures as dictated by the patient's clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied.

### The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin compared to DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands [^114K8zFx]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our economic evaluation has several limitations. Only two types of adverse events were included (genital and urinary tract infections), both occurring more frequently in treatment with dapagliflozin. A potentially more severe adverse event associated with dapagliflozin is ketoacidosis, which was excluded from the analysis. Because ketoacidosis is a rare adverse event in people with type 2 diabetes, it is not expected to significantly impact cost‐effectiveness estimates, even though utility and cost impact on patients experiencing this event would be large.

However, none of the DPP‐4 inhibitor‐associated adverse events were included. These include, among others, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and headache [S2, S3]. If DPP‐4 inhibitor‐associated adverse events would have been included, QALY gains and cost savings with dapagliflozin compared with DPP‐4 inhibitors would likely be higher.

Utility is modelled in an additive fashion, such that a combination of multiple disutilities may cause an individual person's utility to drop below zero. Low utilities are especially common at long time horizons, given ageing, the assumed weight gain of people over time, and the associated weight‐related disutility. It may be more realistic to place a cap on the maximum weight‐related disutility a person experiences, because the impact of weight gain on quality of life may become smaller over time or after a certain threshold. Unfortunately, not much is known about the association between weight and utility, and further data collection would allow for model improvements. Capping weight‐related utility would likely benefit the DPP‐4 inhibitor arm, because dapagliflozin is associated with weight reduction.

Another limitation of the current model is the use of United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 68 data to inform all risk equations. This data set is relatively old and only allows for the prediction of the first event in any single category of diabetes‐related complications. 22 Concerns regarding the generalizability of model results to the Dutch situation are discussed in Appendix S2.

### Blood pressure and glycaemic effects of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes on combination antihypertensive therapy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study [^112c2R16]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for microvascular and macrovascular disease. Although the blood pressure-lowering effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are already established, guidance is needed on how to use these drugs in patients already receiving antihypertensive therapy. We aimed to compare blood pressure and glycaemic effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with placebo in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study we enrolled patients from 311 centres in 16 countries across five continents. Patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0%-10.5%; 53–91 mmol/mol) and hypertension (systolic 140–165 mm Hg and diastolic 85–105 mm Hg at both enrolment and randomisation, and a mean 24 h blood pressure of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg by ambulatory monitoring within 1 week of randomisation) and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, insulin, or both, plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker and an additional antihypertensive drug. Using an interactive voice-response system, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients to dapagliflozin 10 mg once a day or to placebo, with randomisation stratified by additional antihypertensive drug use and insulin use at baseline, in a block size of two. The co-primary endpoints were changes in seated systolic blood pressure and HbA1c measured in the full analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement of efficacy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01195662.

Findings

Between Oct 29, 2010, and Oct 4, 2012, we randomly assigned 225 patients to dapagliflozin and 224 to placebo. Seated systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the group assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -11.90 mm Hg [95% CI -13.97 to -9.82]) compared with those assigned to placebo (-7.62 mm Hg [-9.72 to -5.51]; placebo-adjusted difference for dapagliflozin -4.28 mm Hg [-6.54 to -2.02]; p = 0.0002). Reductions in HbA1c concentrations were also significantly greater in patients assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -0.63% [95% CI -0.76 to -0.50]) than in those assigned to placebo (-0.02% [-0.15 to 0.12]; placebo-adjusted difference -0.61% [-0.76 to -0.46,]; p < 0.0001). In a post-hoc analysis, we found difference in blood pressure versus placebo was greater in patients receiving a β blocker (-5.76 mm Hg [95% CI -10.28 to -1.23]) or a calcium-channel blocker (-5.13 mm Hg, [-9.47 to -0.79]) as their additional antihypertensive drug than in those receiving a thiazide diuretic (-2.38 mm Hg [-6.16 to 1.40]). Adverse events were similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (98 [44%] patients vs 93 [42%], respectively, had at least one adverse event), with few adverse events related to renal function (1% vs < 1%) or volume depletion (< 1% vs 0%).

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin 10 mg significantly improved blood pressure and HbA1c and was tolerated similarly to placebo. Its blood pressure-lowering properties were particularly favourable in patients already receiving a β blocker or calcium-channel blocker. Dapagliflozin could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes who need a diuretic-like effect to optimise control of blood pressure, adding meaningful efficacy to antihypertensive drug regimens.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in DAPA-HF according to background heart failure therapy [^111KHWHU]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Effect of dapagliflozin on symptom frequency and severity according to background therapy

A significantly greater proportion of patients randomized to dapagliflozin compared to placebo self-reported a clinically significant improvement (≥ 5 point increase) in the KCCQ-TSS at 8 months following randomization and significantly fewer dapagliflozin patients reported a meaningful deterioration (≥ 5 point decrease) compared to placebo (Table 3). This effect was consistent across all subgroups of background therapy and combinations analysed.

Table 3
Change in KCCQ total symptom score, systolic blood pressure, and creatinine at 8 months by randomized treatment and background heart failure therapy

Effect of dapagliflozin on change in systolic blood pressure and serum creatinine according to background therapy

Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin reduced blood pressure at 8 months following randomization with no significant treatment effect modification observed by individual background therapy or their combinations (Table 3). The small increase in serum creatinine observed with dapagliflozin compared to placebo at 8 months was similar among the subgroups analysed (Table 3).

Effect of dapagliflozin on volume depletion or renal adverse events according to background therapy

In patients treated with a diuretic, adverse events related to volume depletion occurred more frequently with dapagliflozin compared to placebo, with fewer events seen in those not on a diuretic and randomized to dapagliflozin (Table 4). A similar pattern was observed in those treated with ≥ 50% of target MRA dose, the combination of an RAS blocker, BB, and MRA, and combinations including ≥ 50% of both RAS blocker and BB target dose (Table 4). Renal adverse events were less common with dapagliflozin compared to placebo in those not on a diuretic at baseline with no difference in those treated with a diuretic (Table 4). Patients treated with ≥ 50% of target RAS blocker dose more frequently had a renal adverse event with dapagliflozin compared to placebo than those on < 50% target dose with the same pattern in those on combinations of therapy that include ≥ 50% of target RAS blocker dose.

### Efficacy of dapagliflozin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction according to body mass index [^113AkgpA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Effect of dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on outcomes, according to baseline body mass index

The effect of treatment according to baseline BMI analysed as a categorical variable is shown in Table 2 and analysed as a continuous variable in online supplementary Figure S3.

Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome to a similar extent across all BMI categories: HR (95% CI) 0.74 (0.58–0.94) for normal/underweight; 0.81 (0.65–1.02) for overweight; 0.68 (0.50–0.92) for obesity class I and 0.71 (0.51–1.00) for obesity class II/III category (P ‐value for interaction = 0.79). This was also true for the other outcomes examined (Table 2). There was no interaction between BMI and the effect of dapagliflozin.

Dapagliflozin increased (improved) mean KCCQ‐TSS as compared to placebo between baseline and 8 months, with a consistent effect across BMI categories. Overall, the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful (≥ 5‐point) improvement was larger, and the proportion with a ≥ 5‐point deterioration smaller, in the dapagliflozin group, compared with the placebo group. This pattern was consistent across BMI categories (Table 2).

Pre‐specified adverse events according to baseline body mass index category

None of the pre‐specified adverse events of interest were common and none occurred at a significantly different frequency across BMI categories or by randomized therapy in each category (Table 3).

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111L4KJi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

An important adverse effect of sulphonylureas is the invariable induction of hypoglycaemia, which is associated with numerous detrimental patient outcomes. 33 In this study, there were substantially fewer hypoglycaemic episodes in patients taking dapagliflozin‐containing regimens than in patients receiving glimepiride plus metformin. This is consistent with findings from a previous study 16 and with the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin, which does not depend on insulin secretion or action. A total of 329 hypoglycaemic events occurred in 87 patients in the glimepiride group, indicating that many patients in this treatment group experienced recurrent hypoglycaemia; these events may have prevented up‐titration of glimepiride. The low risk of hypoglycaemic events is an important advantage of add‐on dapagliflozin therapy, given the observed links between occurrence of hypoglycaemia and poor adherence to glucose‐lowering therapy. 34 Further, dapagliflozin‐containing regimens are without some of the practical disadvantages associated with sulphonylureas, including the need for careful titration and frequent glucose monitoring.

The enhanced glucose‐lowering efficacy of triple therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin concomitantly added to metformin is also worthy of mention. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that combining antidiabetes agents that have complementary mechanisms of action can achieve greater efficacy than add‐on of each agent alone for patients with high HbA1c levels, and dual and triple therapies have been shown to have similar safety profiles. 11, 26, 27

A key strength of this study is the up‐titration of glimepiride to reflect real‐world clinical practice. Although titration of sulphonylureas is essential to balance antihyperglycaemic efficacy with the risk of hypoglycaemia, it is not typical for clinical trials to allow continuous titration throughout the study. Potential limitations of the study include the aforementioned inability to monitor long‐term effects of study treatments on renal function, because of the strict criteria for discontinuation.

### Safety of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors [^113wcbpx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a well-defined safety profile based on data obtained from numerous clinical trials, including cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and postmarketing pharmacovigilance reporting. Adverse events including risk of genital mycotic infection and volume depletion-related events are consistent with the mechanism of action of this drug class. However, several emergent (albeit infrequent) serious safety issues have also been reported. In their respective CVOTs, the proportion of patients with reported diabetic ketoacidosis was similar in empagliflozin or canagliflozin compared with their placebo groups, but it was higher for dapagliflozin. Canagliflozin may be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and lower limb amputation; however, data are inconclusive. There is no evidence linking SGLT2 inhibitors with an increased risk of cancer, but these agents, particularly dapagliflozin, should be used with caution in patients with hematuria or a history of bladder cancer. Postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury have occurred in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, and cases identified in recent CVOTs occurred with similar frequency in SGLT2 inhibitor and placebo groups. Common adverse events associated with SGLT2 inhibitors (such as genital infections or volume depletion) are generally mild and manageable by patients or by primary care physicians, and the risk of rare events (such as ketoacidosis) can be minimized by appropriate patient selection and early recognition of symptoms. When selecting treatment, it is important that clinicians weigh the known risks of SGLT2 inhibitors against their proven benefits, including the reduction of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

### Dapagliflozin monotherapy in drug-naïve patients with diabetes: a randomized-controlled trial of low-dose range [^111eNHac]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Many patients with type 2 diabetes are suboptimally managed with currently available therapies. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in reducing diabetic hyperglycaemia. This study assessed efficacy of three lower doses in recently diagnosed patients.

Methods

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assigned treatment-naïve patients to placebo or dapagliflozin monotherapy (1, 2.5 or 5 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Patients were antidiabetic drug-naïve with inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.0%]. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and proportions achieving HbA1c < 7%.

Results

A total of 282 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. At week 24, mean HbA1c reduction was significantly greater with dapagliflozin: -0.68% for 1 mg, -0.72% for 2.5 mg, -0.82% for 5 mg, versus 0.02% for placebo (p < 0.0001); compared to mean baseline values of 7.8–8.1%. Mean FPG reduction was significantly greater for all dapagliflozin groups versus placebo (p < 0.02), as was mean weight reduction (p < 0.003). During the treatment period, 19.1% of placebo-treated patients received rescue medication or discontinued because of poor glycaemic control versus 6.9, 4.1 and 5.9% for dapagliflozin 1, 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively. Percentages of patients experiencing ≥ 1 adverse event were similar across groups.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/day is effective in reducing glycaemic levels and body weight in treatment-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated. This insulin-independent mechanism suggests a new treatment for type 2 diabetes.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^114orNkL]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin reduces the risk of kidney failure and heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes according to presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and according to underlying cause of chronic kidney disease, reported as diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritides, ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause.

Methods

DAPA-CKD was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial done at 386 study sites in 21 countries, in which participants with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–75 mL/min per 1.73m 2 were randomly assigned (1:1) to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, as an adjunct to standard care. The primary outcome was a composite of sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related or cardiovascular death. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a kidney-specific composite (the same as the primary outcome but excluding cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. In this study, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD primary and secondary endpoints by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and by aetiology of chronic kidney disease. DAPA-CKD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150.

Findings

The study took place between Feb 2, 2017, and June 12, 2020. 4304 participants were randomly assigned (2152 to dapagliflozin and 2152 to placebo) and were followed up for a median of 2.4 years (IQR 2.0–2.7). Overall, 2906 (68%) participants had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, of whom 396 (14%) had chronic kidney disease ascribed to causes other than diabetic nephropathy. The relative risk reduction for the primary composite outcome with dapagliflozin was consistent in participants with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.79) and those without diabetes (0.50, 0.35–0.72; p interaction = 0.24). Similar findings were seen for the secondary outcomes: kidney-specific composite outcome (0.57 [0.45–0.73] vs 0.51 [0.34–0.75]; P interaction = 0.57), cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure (0.70 [0.53–0.92] vs 0.79 [0.40–1.55]; P interaction = 0.78), and all-cause mortality (0.74 [0.56–0.98] vs 0.52 [0.29–0.93]; P interaction = 0.25). The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was also consistent among patients with diabetic nephropathy (n = 2510; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.78), glomerulonephritides (n = 695; 0.43, 0.26–0.71), ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease (n = 687; 0.75, 0.44–1.26), and chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause (n = 412; 0.58, 0.29–1.19; P interaction = 0.53), with similar consistency seen across the secondary outcomes. The proportions of participants in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups who had serious adverse events or discontinued study drug due to adverse events did not vary between those with and those without type 2 diabetes.

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin reduces the risks of major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion

In conclusion, dapagliflozin has the potential to be a useful addition to currently available antidiabetes treatments as it lowers fasting and postprandial glucose levels, improves glycemic control, and causes weight loss with a low risk of hypoglycemia. However, data regarding longterm safety including urinary tract infection, genital infection, and cardiovascular safety are needed, and its place in the algorithm of T2DM management is still to be determined.

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113bqX1X]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. Renal function should be monitored before initiation of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). No cardiovascular safety signals have been detected for dapagliflozin, and a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study is ongoing. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that dapagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, parallel-design, open-label, phase 3 trial [^1176FQdj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinically relevant and sustained change in BW from baseline to week 52 in the DAPA + SAXA group, which was significantly greater compared with the INS group, supports results from previous studies showing that treatment with DAPA alone or in combination with SAXA was associated with BW reduction, whereas insulin treatment was associated with BW gain. 10, 23, 26 The higher proportion of patients achieving optimal glycaemic control after 52 weeks with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia in the DAPA + SAXA group compared with those receiving INS corroborates previous evidence. 27, 28, 29 However, evidence is lacking regarding the effect of these drugs alone compared with insulin in achieving optimal glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia or BW gain. More patients required rescue medication in the INS group than the DAPA + SAXA group.

Overall, AEs and SAEs were balanced between the two groups. The safety and tolerability profile of DAPA + SAXA was consistent with that of the individual agents, supporting observations from previous studies. 5, 10, 12, 30, 31 Oral administration of glucose‐lowering drugs is often preferred to injections by both patients and healthcare professionals. 32 A treatment strategy including oral, insulin‐independent, glucose‐lowering drugs instead of injectable basal insulin in patients with uncontrolled T2D is a welcome alternative. The function of DPP‐4is with sulphonylurea mechanistically relies on residual β‐cell activity, while SGLT‐2is work complementarily to DPP4is, reducing hyperglycaemia through renal excretion of glucose, independent of insulin secretion, thus reducing glucotoxicity 33 and β‐cell burden. The risk of genital infections with combination therapy is lower than that observed with DAPA alone, which is suggestive of a protective effect. 13, 34, 35

### Dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115Wh728]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and adverse effects of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor.

Data Sources

Data were gathered from articles indexed in PubMed, International Pharmaceutical from (2006 to April 2014) was performed using the following terms "dapagliflozin", "SGLT-2 inhibitor", and "Farxiga". Abstracts and manufacturer's package insert were also used as an additional reference.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language prospective randomized, double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes were identified.

Data Synthesis

We evaluated 9 clinical trials with dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Results from these studies demonstrated that dapagliflozin to be noninferior to metformin in treatment naïve patients for reduction in A1C. Additionally, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glimepiride when added on to metformin. As an add-on therapy to insulin, insulin sensitizers or sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was found to be clinically effective compared to placebo. Finally, in all of the clinical trials increased risk of urinary infection was common in dapagliflozin group.

Conclusion

As the second SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the United States, dapagliflozin is safe and effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It appears to have no increased cardiovascular risk and provides a moderate benefit for patients with high blood pressure or those who are overweight. However, dapagliflozin was found to be associated with nasopharyngitis, mycotic infections, and genital or urinary tract infections. This medication may be best used as adjunctive therapy for patients not well-controlled on other antidiabetic agents. However, caution should be taken when used in patients at risk of urinary tract infections and dehydration.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1157CxAg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — contraindications, cautions, and adverse effects to monitor — include the following. Contraindications include history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to drug, pregnancy or breastfeeding, on dialysis, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (dapagliflozin), ESRD (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), and severe renal impairment (empagliflozin). Cautions include to discontinue at least 3 days before a planned surgery to prevent postoperative ketoacidosis; if HbA1c is well controlled or there is a history of frequent hypoglycemic events, wean or stop sulfonylurea or glinide and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy; consider diuretic dose reduction due to intravascular volume contraction; and use with caution in patients with prior amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections; note a possible increased risk of bone fractures with canagliflozin. Adverse effects to monitor are genital fungal infections, urinary tract infections, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and lower limb ulcerations and soft tissue infections.

1.9 Use in the frail and elderly

There have been some concerns that older and more frail patients may be more vulnerable to medication adverse effects and hence a less favourable risk–benefit profile. Analyses of the DAPA‐CKD and EMPA‐KIDNEY trials found similar benefits to their primary composite kidney and cardiovascular outcomes across frailty categories. The EMPA‐KIDNEY analysis, which used predicted hospitalization risk as a surrogate frailty metric, found the greatest benefits to absolute event rates among the most frail. Across the two studies, more frail individuals were at higher risk of adverse effects with SGLT2 inhibitor or placebo use, but overall rates were numerically lower in SGLT2 inhibitor treatment arms than with placebo, as were discontinuation rates. Clinical trials may not, however, capture the full spectrum of frailty seen in clinical practice. In a prospective cohort study of 739 people initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor after age 70, 23.5% discontinued within 1 year, with mild to moderate genitourinary tract infections cited as the most common reason. Discontinuation rates were nearly twice as high among those ≥ 80 years of age compared with those aged 70–79 (19.1 vs. 35.0%). No severe adverse events were documented.

1.10 Regulatory safety advice forinhibitors

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) labelling for empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin cite risks of ketoacidosis, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin or insulin secretagogues, necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum and genital mycotic infections, which are all consistent with the evidence presented above. Canagliflozin FDA and EMA advice additionally includes a warning about possible fracture risk, which arose from the finding that increased fracture rates with SGLT2 inhibitor use in major clinical trials were only observed with canagliflozin in the CANVAS programme. All three medications also include labelling for urosepsis and pyelonephritis, based upon post‐marketing reports, although no significant elevation in risk has been identified in routine care. The EMA advice for all three agents discusses a possible amputation risk, while the FDA advice only includes this caution for dapagliflozin. As discussed above, this remains a contentious association but does not appear to be specific to dapagliflozin.

### SGLT2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy for type 1 diabetes: balancing benefits and risks [^113vJezQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have several beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including glucose lowering, weight loss, blood pressure lowering, and a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. To address high unmet medical need via improved glycaemic control, several clinical trials have been done to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this Personal View, we summarise data from eight clinical trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. HbA 1c -lowering efficacy was greatest at 8–12 weeks of therapy, but the magnitude of HbA 1c lowering waned with longer duration of treatment (up to 52 weeks). Data are not yet available to establish for how long glycaemic efficacy could be sustained during long-term therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy induces serious adverse events, including a roughly six-times increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that one additional case of ketoacidosis will occur for every 26 patient-years of exposure of patients with type 1 diabetes to sotagliflozin therapy. Assuming a case mortality of 0.4%, this estimate translates into 16 additional deaths per year per 100000 patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing treatment. These considerations raise important questions about the risk-to-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors when used as adjunctive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Update on long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113f69up]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of antihyperglycaemic agents with an insulin-independent mode of action. Dapagliflozin is a member of the SGLT2 inhibitors class that has received marketing authorization in Europe and the US for use in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes current evidence from clinical trials assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, and presents data regarding its cost-effectiveness. Treatment with dapagliflozin results in similar reduction in haemoglobin A1c with other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, which is preserved over 4 years of treatment. However, compared with most antidiabetic agents, dapagliflozin provides additional clinical benefits including body weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Moreover, treatment with dapagliflozin does not increase risk for hypoglycaemia, but is associated with increased incidence of mild to moderate urinary and genital tract infections. A pivotal outcomes trial of dapagliflozin is expected to clarify its effect on cardiovascular endpoints, whilst a causative relationship between dapagliflozin and select malignancies is unlikely. Finally, based on recent economic evaluations dapagliflozin seems to be a cost-effective option for type 2 diabetes in some settings.

### Dapagliflozin treatment for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1115nhpm]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and places a heavy burden on society. Dapagliflozin is a novel treatment choice for type 2 diabetes.

Objective

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin treatment.

Data Sources

Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and the Cochrane Library (up to August 2012) were searched, and RCTs were collected.

Study Selection

Studies included type 2 diabetic subjects, who had been treated with dapagliflozin, and recorded HbA1c as outcomes.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed articles and study quality. Patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes were collected.

Data Synthesis

Ten RCTs were included. Risk of bias for outcomes was low. Fixed or random effects models were used to pool the results. Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduction in HbA1c [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.53%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58% to -0.47%; p < 0.00001], fasting plasma glucose (WMD: -1.06mmol/L; 95% CI: -1.20, -0.92; p < 0.00001), and body weight (WMD: -1.63kg; 95% CI: -1.83, -1.43; p < 0.00001). Dapagliflozin monotherapy did not lead to hypoglycaemia [relative risk (RR): 1.44; 95% CI: 0. 86, 2.41; p = 0.17], although hypoglycaemic risk increased (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29; p = 0.005) when dapagliflozin was combined with other hypoglycaemic drugs. Dapagliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion (WMD: 26.98; 95% CI: 21.72, 32.24; p < 0.00001) and was associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.60; p = 0.004) and genital tract infections (RR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.50, 4.18; p = 0.00001).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin appears to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, although it may increase the risk of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, parallel-design, open-label, phase 3 trial [^115z5tov]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metformin monotherapy frequently proves inadequate for glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), necessitating additional glucose‐lowering agents. 1, 2, 3, 4 A patient‐centric approach is recommended to select an appropriate add‐on therapy. 5 Injectable insulin may not appeal to the patient and is associated with body weight (BW) gain and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The ideal oral add‐on antihyperglycaemic agent should have long‐term efficacy, attain glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA1c) targets without hypoglycaemia through complementary mechanisms of action, 5, 6 and achieve BW reduction or neutrality.

Studies have reported that the sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT‐2i) dapagliflozin (DAPA) plus the dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i) saxagliptin (SAXA) in combination with metformin provides superior HbA1c reductions versus either agent added to metformin alone, with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and BW gain. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The risk of genital infection is lower in treatment regimens with the combination of DAPA + SAXA than DAPA monotherapy. 13 However, validation is needed to determine the long‐term efficacy of DAPA + SAXA versus injectable insulin as an add‐on to metformin therapy in patients with T2D.

This Phase 3 study is part of a clinical programme supporting the development of a fixed‐dose combination (FDC) of DAPA 10 mg and SAXA 5 mg for T2D management. In an earlier 24‐week randomized trial, in patients with T2D that were inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulphonylurea, co‐administration with DAPA + SAXA was non‐inferior to co‐administration with insulin glargine (INS) in achieving HbA1c reductions and reducing BW gain and hypoglycaemia. 14 In the 28‐week extension, we compared the efficacy, tolerability and safety of DAPA + SAXA versus INS over 52 weeks with respect to HbA1c, BW and glycaemic control in patients with T2D that were inadequately controlled on metformin with or without sulphonylurea.

### Safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Saudi arabia: a post authorization safety study [^115ZmHQD]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors moderately reduce glucose levels in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Some cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported with SGLT2 inhibitors. However, data on the long-term safety of dapagliflozin in Saudi Arabia are lacking. The present study aimed to monitor the safety of dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM and evaluate the change in HbA1c during the observation period compared to baseline.

Methods

This was a local, prospective, single-arm, non-interventional, regulatory post-marketing study. The study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from May 2017 to September 2019. Patients received either 5 or 10 mg dapagliflozin in conjunction with diet and exercise modifications to treat T2DM. The occurrence of adverse events was observed over the treatment duration and for 3 days after administering the last dose of dapagliflozin.

Results

A total of 527 patients were recruited in the study, 524 of which were eligible for the statistical analysis. About 62% were males. The median (IQR) age was 52.3 (14.8) years, while the median (IQR) body mass index was 31.6 (7.7) kg/m 2. The median (IQR) duration since the patients were first diagnosed with T2DM was 8.78 (6.73) years. The most common comorbidities were hyperlipidemia (51.1%) and hypertension (41.1%). Almost three-quarters of the study population (73.7%) received other antidiabetic medications in addition to dapagliflozin. Over a period of 12 months, a total of 106 adverse events were experienced by 65 (12.33%) patients. Vulvovaginal pruritus (3.1%), dysuria (2.7%), polyuria (1.3%), urinary tract infections (1%), fatigue (0.8%), and hypoglycemia (0.8%) were among the reported adverse events. One case of DKA (0.2%) was reported. The mean (SD) HbA1c% level significantly decreased from 8.6 (1.6) % at baseline to reach 7.2 (1.2) % after 12 months of treatment (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin was found to be a well tolerated and effective treatment option for T2DM patients in Saudi Arabia. Vulvovaginal pruritus and dysuria were the most common adverse events.

6 Implications for Future Research

Future research should focus on longer‐term cardiovascular outcomes, optimal dosing strategies and effectiveness in diverse populations. Additionally, head‐to‐head comparisons with other third‐line agents would help further define pioglitazone's place in the treatment algorithm. Future studies need to include a large number of patients to increase the power of the findings.

### Dapagliflozin as monotherapy or combination therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: an open-label study [^115EXUDR]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control and reduces body weight and systolic blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin is effective and well tolerated over 12–24 weeks in Japanese patients with T2DM. In this study, the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin administered as monotherapy and combination therapy were assessed over 52 weeks in Japanese patients with T2DM.

Methods

This was a 52-week open-label Phase 3 study consisting of a single treatment arm with no comparator. Dapagliflozin was administered as monotherapy (n = 249) or combination therapy (n = 479) with existing antihyperglycemic agents (sulfonylurea, glinides, metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) to Japanese patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control for 52 weeks. Treatment with dapagliflozin was initiated at 5 mg/day and titrated to 10 mg/day as required.

Results

Dapagliflozin administered as monotherapy or combination therapy was well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) over 52 weeks was similar between monotherapy (79.1%) and combination therapy (72.4%) groups, and AEs were mostly mild or moderate. The incidence of hypoglycemia at 52 weeks was 2.4% in the monotherapy group and 4.0% in the combination therapy group. In patients receiving dapagliflozin as monotherapy or combination therapy, reductions from baseline to week 52 were observed in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) (−0.7% in both groups), weight (−2.6 and −2.1 kg, respectively), and systolic blood pressure (−5.2 mmHg and −3.9 mmHg). In patients with insufficient response to 5 mg/day, dapagliflozin was increased to 10 mg/day, and a further decrease in HbA 1c from the pre-titration value was observed in both groups.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin was well tolerated and effective as monotherapy or combination therapy in Japanese patients with T2DM over 52 weeks.

### Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving high doses of insulin: a randomized trial [^116UXkcX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, may improve glycemic control with a lower dose of insulin and attenuate the associated weight gain in patients with inadequate control despite high doses of insulin.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding dapagliflozin therapy in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is inadequately controlled with insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

Design

A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial followed by a 24-week extension period. An additional 56-week extension period is ongoing. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00673231)

Setting

126 centers in Europe and North America from 30 April 2008 to 19 November 2009.

Patients

808 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving at least 30 U of insulin daily, with or without up to 2 oral antidiabetic drugs.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and allocated with a computer-generated scheme to receive placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily, for 48 weeks.

Measurements

The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, insulin dose, and fasting plasma glucose level at 24 weeks and during the 24-week extension period. Adverse events were evaluated throughout both 24-week periods.

Results

800 patients were analyzed. After 24 weeks, mean hemoglobin A(1c) decreased by 0.79% to 0.96% with dapagliflozin compared with 0.39% with placebo (mean difference, -0.40% [95% CI, -0.54% to -0.25%] in the 2.5-mg group, -0.49% [CI, -0.65% to -0.34%] in the 5-mg group, and -0.57% [CI, -0.72% to -0.42%] in the 10-mg group). Daily insulin dose decreased by 0.63 to 1.95 U with dapagliflozin and increased by 5.65 U with placebo (mean difference, -7.60 U [CI, -10.32 to -4.87 U] in the 2.5-mg group, -6.28 U [CI, -8.99 to -3.58 U] in the 5-mg group, and -6.82 U [CI, -9.56 to -4.09 U] in the 10-mg group). Body weight decreased by 0.92 to 1.61 kg with dapagliflozin and increased by 0.43 kg with placebo (mean differences, -1.35 kg [CI, -1.90 to -0.80 kg] in the 2.5-mg group, -1.42 kg [CI, -1.97 to -0.88 kg] in the 5-mg group, and -2.04 kg [CI, -2.59 to -1.48 kg] in the 10-mg group). These effects were maintained at 48 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pooled dapagliflozin groups had a higher rate of hypoglycemic episodes (56.6% vs. 51.8%), events suggesting genital infection (9.0% vs. 2.5%), and events suggesting urinary tract infection (9.7% vs. 5.1%).

Limitation

Insulin doses were not titrated to target, and the study was not designed to evaluate long-term safety.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control, stabilizes insulin dosing, and reduces weight without increasing major hypoglycemic episodes in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin monotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 102-week trial [^115hdC8y]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess initial pharmacotherapy of Type 2 diabetes with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin.

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, randomly allocated people with Type 2 diabetes aged 18–77 years and inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise [HbA1c 53–86 mmol/mol (7.0–10.0%)] to receive placebo (n = 75) or dapagliflozin monotherapy 2.5 mg (n = 65), 5 mg (n = 64) or 10 mg (n = 70) once daily in the morning. After 24 weeks, low-dose double-blind metformin 500 mg/day was added to the placebo group regimen (placebo+low-dose metformin group). Changes in HbA1c level, fasting plasma glucose and body weight, as well as adverse events, were assessed over 102 weeks.

Results

Of the 274 participants randomized, 167 completed the study (60.9%). At 102 weeks, significant differences vs placebo+low-dose metformin with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg were observed for HbA1c (-5.8 mmol/mol [-0.53%], P = 0.018; and -4.8 mmol/mol [-0.44%], P = 0.048), respectively); and for FPG (-0.69 mmol/L, P = 0.044; and -1.12 mmol/l, P = 0.001, respectively). For body weight, the difference between the dapagliflozin 10-mg group and the placebo+low-dose metformin group was significant (-2.60 kg; P = 0.016). Hypoglycaemic events were uncommon, with rates of 5.3% for placebo+low-dose metformin group and 0–4.6% for the dapagliflozin groups. Genital infections and urinary tract infections were more common in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo+low-dose metformin group.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in treatment-naïve people with early Type 2 diabetes improved glycaemic control and reduced weight without increasing hypoglycaemia over 102 weeks. Dapagliflozin may provide an alternative initial pharmacotherapy in such people.

### Sodium glucose Co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: targeting the kidney to improve glycemic control in diabetes mellitus [^111QGxmf]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by up to 5 mmHg, with no significant increase in heart rate or occurrence of orthostatic hypotension.

Rates of hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia were similar in dapagliflozin groups (1–2%) to those in the placebo/comparator groups (0–1%). Dapagliflozin treatment was not associated with an increased risk of acute renal toxicity or deterioration of renal function. The dapagliflozin Summary of Product Characteristics advises against its use in patients receiving loop diuretics or who are volume depleted, and recommends appropriate monitoring if volume depletion is likely to occur.

Symptoms suggestive of genital infection, such as cutaneous fungal infections, and lower urinary tract infection (UTI) were common adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported more frequently compared with placebo/comparator. Genital infection occurred in 2–13% of patients receiving dapagliflozin compared with 0–5% of those receiving placebo/comparator, with women affected more commonly than men. Most cases were not severe and responded well to standard therapy. Lower UTIs also occurred more frequently with dapagliflozin (3.0–12.5%) than with placebo/comparator (0–9.0%). None of these events were serious, and all cases resolved with standard antibiotic therapy. The pooled safety analysis (n = 4,545) reported that genital infections and UTIs were more common with dapagliflozin than placebo, and between-group differences were less marked for UTIs (genital infection: 4.1–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 0.9% placebo; UTIs: 3.6–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 3.7% placebo).

### Sodium glucose transporter protein 2 inhibitors: focusing on the kidney to treat type 2 diabetes [^1124E6RR]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Treatment of T2DM continues to present challenges, with a significant proportion of patients failing to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Despite the availability of many oral antidiabetic agents, therapeutic efficacy is also offset by side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents with an improved benefit-risk profile continues. In the following review we focus on a novel class of oral antidiabetic drugs, the sodium glucose transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have unique characteristics. SGLT2 inhibitors focus on the kidney as a therapeutic target, where they inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, causing an increase in urinary glucose excretion. Doing this, they reduce plasma glucose independently of the β-cell function of the pancreas. SGLT2 inhibitors are effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c, but also induce weight loss and reduce blood pressure, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. In general, the SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being mild urinal and genital infections. Since their primary site of effect is the kidney, these drugs are less effective in patients with impaired kidney function but evidence is emerging that these drugs may also have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy. This review focuses on the most extensively studied SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have already been approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration. The European Medicines Agency has accepted all three drugs for marketing.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and different risk categories: a meta-analysis [^117MxE7S]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

In a pre-specified meta-analysis investigating CV outcomes in 21 trials from the dapagliflozin clinical development programme, which was conducted in line with the FDA guidance, no increase in CVD risk was observed in patients with T2DM receiving dapagliflozin compared with those receiving control (placebo or comparator treatment) with or without background glucose-lowering therapies. The CV risk increases in patients with age, decrease in renal function and presence of one or several risk factors or comorbid conditions. The meta-analysis reported here aimed to characterise the CV profile of dapagliflozin overall and in subgroups of patients grouped by degree of CV risk, based both on baseline and in-study risk factors (i.e. hypoglycaemic events), with a focus on major adverse CV events (MACE).

### Meta-analysis of effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114T9Jmj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The benefit or risk of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not been established. We aimed to assess the comparative CV safety and mortality risk associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched up to January 27, 2016, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors of at least 24 weeks of duration. The primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We identified 37 eligible trials involving 29,859 patients that compared 3 SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) to placebo and other active antidiabetic treatments. Of all direct and indirect comparisons, only empagliflozin compared with placebo was significantly associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.81) and major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93). However, the significant effect of empagliflozin was largely driven by one large randomized trial (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial). Neither dapagliflozin nor canagliflozin was significantly associated with any harm. In conclusion, current RCT evidence suggests that 3 common SGLT2 inhibitors are not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality and CV outcomes when used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although empagliflozin may have a protective effect, further confirmative data from rigorous RCTs are needed.

### Effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on HbA (1c), body weight, and hypoglycemia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy [^115JPWz4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) represents a novel mechanism that reduces hyperglycemia independent of insulin secretion or action. In addition, this inhibitory action can induce mild osmotic diuresis and increase urinary excretion of glucose with modest caloric elimination leading to weight loss. Dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, or insulin, but not yet with a thiazolidinedione.

Some patients with type 2 diabetes use pioglitazone, which lowers glucose by altering gene transcription enhancing insulin sensitivity. However, safety concerns of fluid retention, weight gain, congestive heart failure, bone fractures, and, more recently, concerns about bladder cancer has limited its use as second line therapy when metformin is not tolerated or as triple oral therapy.

The safety hypothesis for a trial combining pioglitazone with dapagliflozin would not be anticipated to worsen the pioglitazone-related side effects and, because dapagliflozin causes glucosuria, which drives diuresis and caloric loss, it may mitigate the concerns of weight gain and fluid retention/edema. This is the first clinical study to examine additive effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor administered in combination with pioglitazone.

Other Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the 12 trial and 13 trial, short term, placebo controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypoglycemia

The frequency of hypoglycemia by trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 3. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

Genital Mycotic Infections

In the glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 1). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the trial than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively). In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], serious genital mycotic infections were reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with dapagliflozin and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Genital mycotic infections that caused trial drug discontinuation were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with dapagliflozin and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.

### Randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of triple therapy with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin in type 2 diabetes [^1125MF7o]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with dapagliflozin versus that with placebo add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin in patients whose type 2 diabetes is inadequately controlled with saxagliptin plus metformin treatment.

Research Design and Methods

Patients receiving treatment with stable metformin (stratum A) (screening HbA1c level 8.0–11.5% [64–102 mmol/mol]) or stable metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (stratum B) (HbA1c 7.5–10.5% [58–91 mmol/mol]) for ≥ 8 weeks received open-label saxagliptin 5 mg/day and metformin for 16 weeks (stratum A) or 8 weeks (stratum B) (saxagliptin replaced any DPP-4 inhibitor). Patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7–10.5% [53–91 mmol/mol]) were randomized to receive placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus saxagliptin and metformin. The primary end point was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary end points included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) level, body weight, and proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c level of < 7% (53 mmol/mol).

Results

Treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in a greater mean HbA1c reduction than placebo (-0.82 vs. -0.10% [-9 vs. -1.1 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001). Significantly greater reductions in FPG level, 2-h PPG level, and body weight were observed, and more patients achieved an HbA1c level of < 7% (53 mmol/mol) with treatment with dapagliflozin versus placebo. Adverse events were similar across treatment groups, with a low overall risk of hypoglycemia (∼1%). Genital infections developed in more patients with dapagliflozin treatment (5%) than with placebo (0.6%).

Conclusions

Triple therapy with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin improves glycemic control and is well tolerated in patients whose type 2 diabetes is inadequately controlled with saxagliptin plus metformin therapy.

### Dapagliflozin add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 102-week trial [^1118ZRGr]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Management of type 2 diabetes with metformin often does not provide adequate glycemic control, thereby necessitating add-on treatment. In a 24-week clinical trial, dapagliflozin, an investigational sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, improved glycemic control in patients inadequately controlled with metformin. The present study is an extension that was undertaken to evaluate dapagliflozin as long-term therapy in this population.

Methods

This was a long-term extension (total 102 weeks) of a 24-week phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to blinded daily treatment (placebo, or dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, or 10 mg) plus open-label metformin (≥ 1,500 mg). The previously published primary endpoint was change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 weeks. This paper reports the follow-up to week 102, with analysis of covariance model performed at 24 weeks with last observation carried forward; a repeated measures analysis was utilized to evaluate changes from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and weight.

Results

A total of 546 patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 treatments. The completion rate for the 78-week double-blind extension period was lower for the placebo group (63.5%) than for the dapagliflozin groups (68.3% to 79.8%). At week 102, mean changes from baseline HbA1c (8.06%) were +0.02% for placebo compared with -0.48% (P = 0.0008), -0.58% (P < 0.0001), and -0.78% (P < 0.0001) for dapagliflozin 2.5 to 5, and 10 mg, respectively. In addition, all dapagliflozin groups had sustained reductions from baseline in FPG (-1.07 to -1.47 mmol/l) and body weight (-1.10 to -1.74 kg) at 102 weeks, whereas increases were noted in placebo-treated patients for both of these outcomes. Events of hypoglycemia were rare and were not severe. Evidence suggestive of genital infection was reported in 11.7% to 14.6% of dapagliflozin patients and 5.1% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 5 mg). Evidence suggestive of urinary tract infection was reported in 8.0% to 13.3% of dapagliflozin patients and 8.0% of placebo patients, with one related discontinuation (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin added to metformin for 102 weeks enabled sustained reductions in HbA1c, FPG, and weight without increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

Benefit-Risk Profile of Dapagliflozin

The DEPICT trial results demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline in people in the dapagliflozin arm compared with those in the placebo arm. In addition, participants receiving dapagliflozin lost more weight than those in the placebo group. The reduction of weight is likely to be of importance for many people with T1DM and also has the potential to limit later cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated a proven benefit for cardio-renal outcomes in T2DM. It remains unclear whether or not these benefits would be replicated in people with T1DM as the pathophysiology of cardiorenal disease may be different in T1DM. Therefore, despite the potential for cardio-renal benefits with SGLT2 inhibitors in T1DM, further evidence is required to verify this.

The overall adverse event profile for dapagliflozin use in people with T1DM was similar to dapagliflozin use in people with T2DM. The most common side effects reported with dapagliflozin 5 mg across the DEPCIT clinical trial programme for T1DM were an increased incidence of genital mycotic infections (10–16% compared with 2–3% for placebo) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) (7–12% compared with 4–8% for placebo). The increased risk of genital mycotic infections associated with SGLT2 inhibitors has also been reported in a real-world setting. Although these infections have the potential to significantly impact quality of life, most are mild-to-moderate infections that can be easily managed and do not necessitate dapagliflozin discontinuation.

Summary and Therapeutic Applications

T2DM is a progressive disease with a significant impact on patients, society, and healthcare systems. The aim of treatment is to achieve near normal glycemia in order to prevent the development or slow the progression of microvascular and possibly macrovascular complications. Currently available antidiabetes treatments have many limitations, including hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulin), weight gain (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, TZDs, and insulin), heart failure (TZDs), gastrointestinal side effects (alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin), and the need for multiple injections and/or self-monitoring (insulin, amylin mimetics, and GLP-1 analogs). Furthermore, due to the progressive nature of the disease, most patients will ultimately require multiple antidiabetes treatments to achieve glycemic targets. Hence, there is a need for new antidiabetes treatments that produce a sustainable impact on glycemic control with low risk for hypoglycemia and weight loss, and minimal need for self-monitoring. SGLT2 inhibitors are a novel class of antidiabetes therapy that are taken orally, result in improvements in glycemic parameters with a low risk for hypoglycemia, and are associated with weight loss. They have the potential to harness what has long been considered a manifestation of diabetes, glucosuria, and turn it into a therapeutic strategy. However, like other newer antidiabetes treatments, this class lacks long-term (including cardiovascular) safety data.

With such a plethora of options to treat patients with T2DM, the decision to use a particular drug, or combination of drugs, in a particular patient should be individualized based on the patient's specific risk-benefit balance and not solely upon a drug's perceived ability to lower HbA 1c. Metformin (in addition to lifestyle changes) remains a well-established first-line treatment for patients with T2DM, due to good long-term safety data, lack of hypoglycemia or weight gain, and evidence for cardiovascular protection. However, as metformin does not halt the progression of the disease, patients with T2DM are likely to need additional antidiabetic medications administered alone or in combination with metformin. Should SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, prove to have an acceptable safety profile they may have the potential to be administered alone or in combination with metformin or insulin. The lack of long-term (including cardiovascular) safety data and other outcome data may limit their use initially to specific/defined low-risk patient groups.

### Effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on HbA (1c), body weight, and hypoglycemia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy [^1134r7Xh]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure, bladder cancer, or bone fractures, known side effects of long-term use of pioglitazone, were rare events; too rare at this stage to infer any effect on the risk of these events with the addition of dapagliflozin. Two fractures did occur in the dapagliflozin 5-mg group, but all patients received pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones are known to increase the risk of fractures.

Dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone resulted in sustained glycemic benefits in both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. As a possible mild diuretic and consistent glucouretic, dapagliflozin mitigated the weight gain and fluid retention due to pioglitazone. Even though more genital infections occurred with dapagliflozin than placebo, dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone was effective and well-tolerated. The direct removal of glucose by dapagliflozin complements the insulin-sensitizing action of pioglitazone, providing a potential combination that balances well the benefits and risks of therapy for some patients with type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin added to metformin over 102 weeks showed sustained improved glycemic control, modest weight reduction, and no increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. These effects suggest a complementary use of the insulin independent effects of dapagliflozin in combination with metformin.
