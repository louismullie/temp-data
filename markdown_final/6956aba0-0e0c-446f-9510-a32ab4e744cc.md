## Question

When you get a cardiac ablation are you adding scar tissue or taking away?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cardiac ablation adds scar tissue or removes/takes away tissue, and how to think about this process and its effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic biophysics of lesion formation during catheter ablation. Then, I should verify the histopathologic tissue effects that evolve over time. Next, I will review the electrophysiologic purpose of ablation in different arrhythmias and how that purpose relates to creating new nonconducting tissue. After that, I need to consider the clinical imaging correlates that distinguish newly created ablation lesions from preexisting scar. Finally, I will reconcile any ambiguities about "removal" versus "creation" of tissue and synthesize a clear, reference-backed conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the biophysical mechanism of radiofrequency ablation. RF energy causes resistive heating of myocardium, and when tissue is maintained at about 50°C or higher for several seconds, it undergoes irreversible coagulation necrosis and evolves into a nonconducting myocardial scar, which is exactly the intended effect in arrhythmia therapy [^115bn9ge] [^1132ehg6]. Wait, let me verify that the lesion growth kinetics match what we see clinically; yes, the half-time of lesion growth is roughly 5–15 seconds and maximum size is usually achieved within about 1 minute, which aligns with real-world ablation workflows and endpoints [^1132ehg6].

> Hold on, I should verify the histopathology and time course of the resulting tissue. Immediately after RF delivery, there is coagulative necrosis; within 2–7 days, an inflammatory infiltrate appears; and over ensuing weeks to months, necrotic cardiomyocytes are replaced by fibrosis, yielding a durable nonconducting scar, a sequence confirmed by consensus statements and validated histologic work in preclinical models and human studies of ablation lesions in and around scar [^1132ehg6] [^1179ES1H]. Let me consider electroporation briefly; with pulsed field ablation, cell death is nonthermal and fibrotic replacement evolves over weeks, but the net effect is still the creation of a scar zone that is electrically inert, which reinforces the same conceptual endpoint for ablation strategies [^117VM7G2].

> Next, I should review the electrophysiologic rationale across arrhythmia mechanisms. For atrial fibrillation, pulmonary vein isolation and adjunctive substrate modification work by creating circumferential or linear lesions that electrically isolate triggers and interrupt sustaining pathways, thereby adding lines of conduction block. For scar-related ventricular tachycardia, ablation targets channels of surviving myocytes within fibrotic scar, adding lesions that transect or homogenize the arrhythmogenic substrate. For focal arrhythmias, focal RF lesions destroy the source, again adding a scar to extinguish automaticity or triggered activity [^112vS9nd] [^115aYDvJ] [^116d1mVk]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating a single strategy; multiple techniques exist, but they all share the same principle of creating new nonconducting tissue to achieve electrical disconnection or source elimination [^1132ehg6].

> I will now examine the clinical imaging correlates that help us see these new lesions as distinct from preexisting scar. On T1-weighted cardiac MRI, fresh RF lesions are characteristically hyperintense, whereas chronic infarct scar is hypointense, allowing clinicians to distinguish newly created ablation lesions from older fibrosis. CMR studies in humans and swine models demonstrate that ablation necrosis can extend into and beyond fibrotic scar and that fat can act as a thermal insulator, modifying lesion geometry in some contexts [^1179ES1H]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated scar and ablation lesion enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging; I should double-check: with gadolinium, both ablation lesions and infarct scar may enhance, making them difficult to differentiate, which is why noncontrast T1w sequences are useful to separate new ablation lesions from old scar, confirming that ablation indeed adds a new lesion within or adjacent to existing substrate [^1179ES1H].

> But wait, what if someone says ablation "removes" tissue rather than "adds" scar? I need to clarify that terminology. In cardiology, ablation is best understood as destroying viable myocardium to create a new, nonconducting lesion, not as a surgical excision that physically removes mass from the heart; while necrotic tissue is cleared by inflammatory and remodeling processes, the functional endpoint is the addition of a scar that disrupts arrhythmia circuits rather than the subtraction of tissue mass from the organ, and contemporary consensus statements consistently describe ablation as creating lesions that evolve into scar rather than removing tissue per se [^1132ehg6] [^115bn9ge]. Hold on, I should verify that emerging nonthermal modalities like electroporation or radiation still follow this principle; yes, even with nonthermal ablation, the ultimate tissue effect is replacement fibrosis forming a durable scar, reinforcing that ablation adds a new lesion rather than removing tissue in the surgical sense [^117VM7G2] [^1151pDWq].

> Synthesis and answer: Cardiac ablation adds scar tissue; it does not take away tissue in the sense of surgical removal. By delivering energy that produces irreversible injury, ablation creates new areas of coagulation necrosis that mature into fibrotic scar, thereby interrupting arrhythmogenic conduction pathways or isolating triggers, which is the therapeutic objective across AF, VT, and focal tachycardias [^1132ehg6] [^115bn9ge] [^115aYDvJ].

---

Cardiac ablation **adds scar tissue** by delivering energy (radiofrequency, cryo, or pulsed field) [^114nMFuf] to destroy arrhythmogenic myocardium [^115iqrgP], creating nonconducting lesions that interrupt abnormal electrical pathways [^1132ehg6]. This iatrogenic scar is **intentional and therapeutic**, not pathological, and is essential for restoring sinus rhythm and reducing arrhythmia recurrence [^116d1mVk] [^112CiN99]. The extent and pattern of scar are shaped by energy type, contact, and tissue properties [^11649ekv] [^114T6XoN] [^1179ES1H], and can be monitored with imaging [^114dEF16] to guide therapy and assess durability [^111cGQY4].

---

## Mechanism of scar formation in cardiac ablation

During ablation, energy is delivered to targeted myocardium, causing **irreversible thermal or nonthermal injury** that destroys cardiomyocytes and replaces them with fibrotic scar [^115bn9ge] [^1132ehg6]. The principal energy sources are **radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**, which uses resistive/conductive heating to coagulate tissue and form scar [^115bn9ge]; **cryoablation**, which freezes tissue to induce cell death and fibrosis [^111wm67G]; and **pulsed field ablation (PFA)**, which uses electric fields to cause irreversible electroporation and cell death with subsequent fibrosis [^1156hp2x]. Regardless of modality, the endpoint is a **nonconducting lesion** that disrupts the arrhythmia substrate [^115aYDvJ].

---

## Histological evidence of scar formation

Histologically, ablation lesions show coagulative necrosis with loss of myocytes, followed by **collagen deposition and fibrosis** [^1132ehg6] [^1179ES1H]. Over weeks to months, necrotic tissue is replaced by dense scar that is electrically inert, achieving durable conduction block [^111cGQY4].

---

## Imaging evidence of scar formation

Imaging confirms **ablation-induced scar**: late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) shows ablation lesions as nonenhancing cores within or adjacent to existing scar, confirming lesion creation and maturation [^111cGQY4] [^114dEF16]. CT and electroanatomic mapping also identify ablation scar and help assess transmurality and continuity, which are critical for durable arrhythmia control [^116NsXPg] [^1172iGYX].

---

## Clinical implications of scar formation

- **Restoration of sinus rhythm**: Scar interrupts arrhythmogenic circuits, restoring sinus rhythm and reducing recurrence [^112F2pzt].
- **Reduction of arrhythmia burden**: Effective scar creation lowers VT/VF episodes and ICD shocks, improving quality of life [^116FG1Ua].
- **Potential complications**: Excessive or misplaced scar can impair mechanical function or cause conduction delay; careful energy titration and mapping mitigate risk [^115bn9ge].

---

## Factors influencing extent and pattern of scar formation

Several factors shape scar extent and geometry:

| **Factor** | **Influence on scar formation** |
|-|-|
| Energy source | RFA, cryo, and PFA have distinct lesion sizes and depths [^114T6XoN] [^113GXEKS] |
| Contact force | Higher contact force increases lesion depth and transmurality [^114WKRMi] [^11649ekv] |
| Tissue thickness | Thicker walls (e.g. ventricles) may require deeper or multiple lesions [^112ht2C8] |
| Epicardial fat | Fat insulates and limits lesion depth, especially epicardially [^112nGy3U] [^1145DLMd] |
| Patient-specific factors | BMI, atrial size, and fibrosis burden affect scar formation and durability [^112AmTm5] [^116W5QLk] |

---

## Comparison with other medical procedures

Unlike surgical removal, ablation **does not excise tissue**; it destroys tissue in place, replacing it with scar. This contrasts with surgical myectomy or tumor resection, where tissue is physically removed, and with pharmacologic therapy, which modifies physiology without creating scar.

---

## Long-term durability and stability of ablation scar

Ablation scar is generally **stable over time**, with low remodeling once matured [^117VM7G2]. Recurrence is often due to gaps or nontransmural lesions rather than scar regression; durable block depends on transmural, contiguous lesions confirmed by imaging or electrophysiologic criteria [^111cGQY4] [^116d1mVk].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Outcomes depend on scar quality and completeness: well-transmural, contiguous lesions yield **lower recurrence** and higher freedom from arrhythmia [^112CiN99]. In persistent AF, incomplete PVI or non-PV substrate drives recurrence; similar principles apply to VT, where incomplete isthmus ablation or residual channels increase recurrence risk [^116W5QLk] [^112CiN99].

---

Cardiac ablation **adds scar tissue** by replacing arrhythmogenic myocardium with nonconducting fibrosis, thereby interrupting abnormal circuits and restoring rhythm. This iatrogenic scar is the intended therapeutic effect, and its extent and durability are key determinants of procedural success.

### Myocardial scarring… [^116GY29h]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

Myocardial scarring is the accumulation of fibrous tissue resulting after some form of trauma to the cardiac tissue. Fibrosis is the formation of excess tissue in replacement of necrotic or extensively damaged tissue. Fibrosis in the heart is often hard to detect because fibromas, scar tissue or small tumors formed in one cell line, are often formed. Because they are so small, they can be hard to detect by methods such as magnetic resonance imaging. A cell line is a path of fibrosis that follow only a line of cells. Causes Myocardial infarction A myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, often result in the formation of fibrosis. A myocardial infarction is an ischemic event, or a restriction of blood flow to body tissue, such as by atherothrombosis. Without blood flow to the myocardium, it is deprived of oxygen, causing tissue death and irreversible damage.

The tissue destroyed by the infarction is replaced with non-functioning fibrosis, restoring some of the structural integrity of the organ but resulting in impaired myocardial function. Coronary heart disease Coronary heart disease, also known as coronary artery disease, is one of the most common causes of myocardial damage, affecting over three million people in the United States. In coronary heart disease, the coronary arteries narrow due to the buildup of atheroma or fatty deposits on the vessel walls. The atheroma causes the blood flow of the arteries to be restricted. By restricting the blood flow, the tissue is still receiving some oxygen, but not enough to sustain the tissue over time. The accumulation of the fibrotic tissue is much slower in coronary heart disease compared to an infarction because the tissue is still receiving some oxygen. Birth defect repairs Another form of myocardial scarring results from surgical repairs.

Surgical repairs are often necessary for a person born with a congenital defect of the heart. While surgical laparoscopy still leaves myocardial scarring, the trauma seems to be less damaging then naturally occurring scarring. Excessive exercise Excessive exercise, particularly in endurance athletes, has been linked to myocardial scarring, a condition where fibrous tissue in the heart muscle forms. Intense, prolonged physical activity can lead to repetitive stress on the myocardium, causing micro-injuries that may trigger inflammation and subsequent scarring. This is especially prevalent in individuals engaging in extreme endurance sports, such as marathons or ultra-marathons, very long bicycle racing, where sustained high cardiac output can strain the heart. Studies have shown that some athletes develop focal myocardial fibrosis, detectable via cardiac imaging, which may increase the risk of arrhythmias or reduced cardiac function over time.

While exercise is generally beneficial for heart health, excessive and prolonged exertion without adequate recovery may contribute to pathological changes in susceptible individuals
- genetic tendency toward cardiac fibrosis, undiagnosed heart issues, or a reduced ability to recover from exercise-induced inflammation or micro-injuries. Hypertension Chronic hypertension can lead to myocardial scarring by imposing persistent high pressure on heart walls. This stress causes left ventricular hypertrophy, increasing oxygen demand and potentially leading to micro-ischemia. Over time, these changes may result in fibrosis as the heart attempts to repair damaged tissue, impairing cardiac function. Cardiomyopathies Cardiomyopathies, such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, are associated with myocardial scarring. These conditions alter heart muscle structure and function. Scarring may contribute to heart failure or arrhythmias.

Ventricular tachycardia — history and validation of 3D mapping: Prior to the advent of 3D mapping systems, ablation of VT was guided solely by local abnormal electrograms during sinus rhythm and VT, with a heavy reliance on fluoroscopy to direct the catheter toward desired anatomic locations. Validation of the accuracy of 3D mapping for detecting and characterizing scar as low-voltage regions with single-point contact mapping was first demonstrated in porcine infarct models, and Callans et al demonstrated excellent correlation between infarct size by pathology and low-voltage areas at specific thresholds of bipolar electrograms < 1.0 mV using CARTO. In anatomically based ablation, short linear lesions aimed to connect dense scar regions (< 0.5 mV) to normal tissue or anatomic boundaries was first shown to be effective in reducing recurrent VT, and the authors used control data from six normal patients without structural heart disease to define a statistical cutoff.

### Effect of epicardial fat on electroanatomical mapping and epicardial catheter ablation [^112nGy3U]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to correlate 3-dimensional distribution of epicardial fat on computed tomography (CT) with electroanatomical (EA) voltage maps obtained during percutaneous epicardial mapping in order to determine the fat thickness cut-off that results in voltage attenuation and to establish normal ventricular epicardial voltage criteria in the absence of fat.

Background

Epicardial fat can mimic scar tissue when epicardial voltage mapping is performed, as both result in low epicardial voltage. Cardiac CT can differentiate epicardial fat from scar or muscle on the basis of their distinct attenuations.

Methods

Transcutaneous epicardial mapping was performed in a consecutive series of 14 patients. A cardiac CT was performed before the procedure and a 3-dimensional image of the epicardial fat was generated and registered with the epicardial EA voltage map.

Results

In patients without cardiomyopathy (n = 8), a voltage ≥ 1.5 mV best correlated with the absence of epicardial fat. A fat thickness ≥ 2.8 mm resulted in voltage attenuation and best separated low voltage (< 1.5 mV) from normal voltage (≥ 1.5 mV; sensitivity 81%, specificity 81%, area under the curve 0.85). In patients without cardiomyopathy, the low-voltage area matched well with the area of epicardial fat. In the 6 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the low-voltage area by far exceeded the area accounted for by epicardial fat; this corresponded with the presence of scar tissue. Epicardial ablations at sites with > 10 mm of fat were ineffective.

Conclusions

Cardiac CT identifies epicardial fat that can mimic scar tissue during epicardial EA voltage mapping, which is important during epicardial mapping and ablation.

The advantage of multidetector cardiac CT (MDCT) over LGE-CMR is the higher spatial resolution that is in the submillimeter range. Various MDCT characteristics indicative of scarring have been described, including a degree of wall thinning with a cutoff wall thickness of < 5 mm, hypoattenuation, and delayed enhancement. More recently, thanks to the higher spatial resolution of MDCT, thicker ridges of tissue separating areas of thinning have been described within the myocardial scar harboring the majority of VT target sites in patients post infarction. Hence, MDCT imaging has been found to be beneficial as an alternative to CMR to indicate the location of myocardial scarring, especially in the presence of contraindications for CMR. Although assessment of wall thickness in MDCT imaging has been used successfully in patients with prior infarctions, the ability to identify scarring based on wall thickness alone has been less successful in patients with NICM, and might require a different approach. MDCT is the imaging technique of choice for preprocedural imaging of the coronary arteries, the coronary veins, and the phrenic nerve. The ability to image the coronary arteries in conjunction with the ability to image epicardial fat thickness has been especially valuable for epicardial ablation procedures to enhance safety and to quantify epicardial fat thickness covering potential epicardial VT target sites.

Nuclear imaging for the purpose of facilitating VT ablation procedures has been described for PET and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scanning, using CT for image integration. Although there is a correlation between PET/CT defined scar and EAM, the correlation of SPECT perfusion imaging with low-voltage areas on EAM is lower. It is intriguing that metabolically active areas corresponding to critical VT sites have been identified; however, they might not correspond to areas of low voltage on the EAM. Furthermore, sympathetic denervation can be imaged using tracers, such as 11C-meta-hydroxyepinephrine and iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine. Regional sympathetic denervation has been recognized as an imaging marker for an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Viable but denervated myocardium has been shown to be particularly sensitive to development of arrhythmias. Klein et al. have demonstrated that critical VT ablation sites were located in denervated areas, some of which were located in areas with preserved bipolar voltage.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111FCmbu]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Other non-PV targets have been suggested for ablation, particularly for persistent AF. CFAEs have been put forward as an important target, although many recent randomized studies and meta-analyses have not concluded that there is any benefit. Ablation of non-PV focal triggers identified via isoproterenol challenge, ablation of atrial scarred regions, or ablation of localized rotational activations (so-called rotational activity) have also been reported to have benefit over PVI alone. It appears that regardless of which target is chosen, complete local elimination of the target should be the goal, so as not to leave behind partially ablated tissue that could serve as a site for future AT recurrence. The best method of ablating a localized rotational activation is as yet unclear. Early descriptions suggested ablating the center of activation with several lesions and then remapping to confirm that the rotation is terminated. Others have suggested that central ablation should be combined with creation of a short line to an anatomical or ablated boundary that crosses and interrupts the rotational pathway. The choice at this point is unclear. Similarly, for scar-based ablation, the best methods of defining scar are not yet confirmed (late gadolinium enhancement vs voltage mapping), and even for voltage mapping, the appropriate voltage cutoffs have not yet been validated. Furthermore, it is unclear whether such scar regions should be surrounded by lesions to isolate them from the rest of the atrium; whether ablation within the scar to eliminate all residual electrograms (so-called homogenization) should be employed; or whether these regions should also be tied to anatomical boundaries by short linear ablations. It follows from earlier comments that these scar ablations should be anchored to other nonconducting anatomical structures. There will need to be much further research into the best ablative endpoint for these ancillary targets. Empiric linear ablation likely does not add much to ablation of persistent AF. However, if linear ablation along the roof or mitral annulus is added to target roof or mitral-dependent flutters, then bidirectional block is a prerequisite endpoint. Block across a line must be assessed in sinus rhythm and with differential pacing maneuvers, and these are described in detail in the following section.

### Predicting arrhythmia recurrence following catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia using late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging: implications of varying scar ranges [^116FG1Ua]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) has been proven to significantly reduce therapy and shocks from implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, current guidelines for patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy recommend catheter ablation only in case of recurrent ICD shocks due to sustained VT. There is limited evidence and therefore only a class IIa recommendation for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy suffering from their first episode of VT. This is primarily due to the relatively low procedural efficacy and low long-term success rates of ablation therapy. An important explanation lies in the complexity and incomplete understanding of the arrhythmogenic substrate.

Recent developments in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) postprocessing allow for detailed 3-dimensional (3D) scar characterization after myocardial infarction, including size (scar burden), transmurality (endocardium vs epicardial), and composition (scar core vs border zone [BZ]). Thresholding-based analysis of late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) images can be used to create scar maps depicting viable corridors in areas with scar. This allows for noninvasive identification of electrical conduction pathways in damaged myocardial tissue (isthmus corridors), the anatomic substrate for arrhythmias. Scar maps, which contain information about corridors, can be merged with invasive electroanatomic maps to facilitate catheter ablation guidance.

Clinical scar quantification most often uses a full-width-at-half-maximum thresholding approach, effectively classifying areas with a pixel signal intensity (PSI) > 40% as BZ and > 60% as scar. This threshold is derived from a single study in a very limited number of patients. A cross-validation of this approach in a larger cohort is still lacking. Therefore, the impact of variations in these predefined thresholds on the generated scar maps and subsequent prediction of the arrhythmogenic sensitivity of the underlying myocardium remains unknown.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 4 different threshold settings on scar quantification and sub-characterization in an ischemic cardiomyopathy patient cohort. In particular, the impact of threshold changes on identifying potential corridors and the association of all quantified scar metrics in predicting ventricular arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation was examined.

### Hybrid epicardial and endocardial ablation of atrial fibrillation: is ablation on two sides of the atrial wall better than one? [^112ht2C8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale for a Hybrid Surgical and Catheter Ablation Approach

Particularly in patients with long‐standing persistent atrial fibrillation, epicardial‐only minimally invasive surgical atrial fibrillation has modest efficacy. There are several opportunities to improve the outcomes of epicardial‐only minimally invasive surgical atrial fibrillation ablation. The primary rationale for hybrid surgical and catheter ablation – is the assessment of gaps and the ability to ablate these gaps. A secondary goal of the catheter ablation part of the procedure is to create lesions that are surgically difficult or impossible from the epicardial surface. These include a cavotricuspid isthmus line and completion of lines to the mitral annulus. In the Cox‐Maze‐IV procedure cryoablation was performed at the mitral annulus to complete the mitral annular line and endocardial radiofrequency ablation is currently used to replace these lesions.

There are biophysical reasons why the epicardial delivery of radiofrequency energy is limited in terms of energy and heat transfer. Excessive heating of the epicardial layers increases tissue impedance reducing current delivery. Thus repeat applications of energy may have diminishing returns. In addition excessive heating at the epicardial surface may occur while deeper layers of tissue are cooled by the endocardial intracavitary blood flow. Combining endocardial ablation with epicardial ablation may have advantages in creating transmural lesions, particularly in areas of increased tissue thickness or in patients with scar or extremely large atria.

9.1.3. Contact Force Sensing

Lesion size is critically dependent on the contact of the ablating electrode with the tissue. Catheters with contact force sensors have become common and can help to ensure lesion creation at intended sites. Although a clear improvement in clinical outcomes for catheter ablation for VA is difficult to demonstrate, RF applications with a mean contact force > 10 g are more likely to result in electrical unexcitability in scar areas, and contact force sensing has become an integral part of RF catheter ablation.

9.1.4. Hypotonic External Irrigation

Most ablation catheter tips are 3.5–4 mm in length and are typically irrigated with 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The efficiency of delivering current to myocardial tissue can be increased by using smaller electrode tip sizes and less conductive irrigant, such as 0.45% sodium chloride. These techniques deliver greater current to myocardial tissue for any given applied power but remain limited by the potential for tissue steam pops. The effectiveness and safety of using a higher impedance irrigant has been supported by a multicenter, prospective, observational human study; however, direct clinical comparisons are still pending. The use of hypotonic saline irrigant can have the additional advantage of a reduced salt load for patients with compromised ventricular function.

### Biophysics of ablation: application to technology [^113LME4Z]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The question of what happens to tissue during radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation continues to be asked as we evolve into the use of newer delivery systems.

Methods and Results

Three assumptions are made about RF ablation. (1) Tissue injury is thermally mediated; (2) heat transfer in tissue should be a predictable biophysical phenomenon; and (3) large lesion technologies have more or less equivalent efficacies. Based on these assumptions, predictions are made and discussed. Many of the predictors were proven to be true while some surprisingly were not.

Conclusion

In conclusion, tissue-area injury occurs reproducibly at a temperature of about 50 degrees C. Heat transfer in tissue is a predictable phenomenon. And finally, new technologies for large lesions are all effective, but greater surface area of ablation was achieved with a 10-mm tip and greater depth was achieved with a Chilli cooled ablation catheter.

### Single-center experience of ultra-high-density mapping guided catheter ablation of focal atrial tachycardia [^112ebjfP]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Optimal tissue contact during RF application is crucial for optimal ablation efficacy and generation of durable lesions. In RF application using standard tip catheters, tip temperature gives sufficient contact feedback. This measure of tissue contact gets lost with catheter irrigation. A technical solution for this circumstance is the measurement of CF available in Smart Touch (Biosense Webster) or TactiCath (Abbot) ablation catheters. The ablation catheter used in UHD mapping were visualized only by impedance information. This might be a significant disadvantage compared to CARTO, where impedance, magnetic, and CF information improves the visualization of the mapping catheter.

The use of CF catheters in ablation of paroxysmal AF can improve freedom from arrhythmia recurrence, shorten procedural times as well as fluoroscopy and RF timesand may also assist the creation of effective lesions in the context of scar‐related VT ablation.

In our cohort, CF catheters were used in every ablation procedure using CEAM but only one procedure using UHDM. One could speculate, that problems in effective lesion creation might have led to a less durable lesion formation, which in turn might have led to an increase in recurrence rates after primarily successful ablation.

Our investigation contains major limitations. First, a matched control group with a similar sample size was lacking and the procedural strategy was not randomized, but chosen by the individual operator. This may bias our results, as a mapping system could be selected using the expected complexity as a criterion and could be reflected in the difference of patient numbers in the two cohorts. Second the inhomogeneity of utilized ablation catheters impedes comparability in our retrospective analysis significantly. Furthermore, to overcome underrated recurrence rates we extended our definition of recurrence to any symptomatic tachycardia during our follow‐up period. However, this approach could lead to overestimated results, especially in patients with multiple atrial tachycardia or a complex history of rhythm disorders.

Ablation of fibrosis identified by voltage mapping and/or MRI mapping — voltage thresholds for atrial fibrosis — Reported electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) criteria vary, with one study using a 0.2 to 0.45 mV range to delineate scar, others using 0.2 to 0.5 mV as diseased and > 0.5 mV as healthy, and another defining 0.5 to 1.5 mV as an intermediate zone. A practical summary proposes dense fibrosis for voltages ≤ 0.5 mV, an intermediate zone of mild fibrosis for voltages > 0.5 to ≤ 1.5 mV, and normal for voltages > 1.5 mV, with mild fibrosis even assumed between 1.5 and 2.5 mV. Tissue characterization of the left atrial wall on delayed enhancement (DE) MRI correlated with EAVM and with histology from surgical biopsy specimens.

### Recovery or rehabilitation… [^112bz9EW]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Medical uses Catheter ablation may be recommended for a recurrent or persistent arrhythmia resulting in symptoms or other dysfunction. Atrial fibrillation frequently results from bursts of tachycardia that originate in muscle bundles extending from the atrium to the pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation by transcatheter ablation can restore sinus rhythm. For non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 2016 systematic review compared catheter ablation to heart rhythm drugs. After 12 months, participants receiving catheter ablation were more likely to be free of atrial fibrillation, and less likely to need cardioversion. However, the evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low A 2006 study, including both paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, found that the success rates are 28% for single procedures. Often, several procedures are needed to raise the success rate to a 70–80% range.

One reason for this may be that once the heart has undergone atrial remodeling as in the case of chronic atrial fibrillation patients, largely 50 and older, it is much more difficult to correct the 'bad' electrical pathways. Young people with AF with paroxysmal, or intermittent, AF therefore have an increased chance of success with an ablation since their heart has not undergone atrial remodeling yet. Several experienced teams of electrophysiologists in US heart centers claim they can achieve up to a 75% success rate. Technique Catheter ablation is usually performed by an electrophysiologist in a cath lab. Catheter ablation procedure involves advancing several flexible catheters into the patient's blood vessels, usually either in the femoral vein, Internal jugular vein, or subclavian vein. The catheters are then advanced towards the heart. The catheters have electrodes at the tips that can measure the electrical signals from the heart.

These electrodes create a map of the abnormal pathways causing arrhythmias. Then, the electrophysiologist uses the map to identify areas from which abnormal heart rhythms originate. During the procedure, the patient's heart rhythm is monitored continuously. The electrophysiologist can observe changes to the patient's cardiac electrical activity to determine the success of the ablation. If the cardiac rhythm shows no abnormal signals or arrhythmias, the catheters are withdrawn from the heart and the incision is closed. Epicardial ablation For patients for whom catheter ablations fail, they may then have an epicardial ablation performed. In this type of ablation, instead of a catheter being threaded through a vein in the groin area, the "most direct and safest route to the space outside the heart" is used by going into the subxiphoid region
- just under the breastbone at the bottom of the rib cage.

A needle then enters the pericardial space around the heart, where then a wire is inserted, the needle is removed, and a plastic tube is inserted over the wire. That tube is then where the ablation catheter is threaded to then burn off the offending area of the heart. Following epicardial ablation, often a small plastic tube may be left in place overnight to drain any fluid that may accumulate in the pericardial space. At most centers, epicardial ablation is not usually performed, but it is at "selected centers" such as Stanford. Recovery or rehabilitation After catheter ablation the patients are moved to a cardiac recovery unit, intensive care unit, or cardiovascular intensive care unit where they are not allowed to move for 4–6 hours. Minimizing movement helps prevent bleeding from the site of catheter insertion. Some people have to stay overnight for observation, some need to stay much longer and others are able to go home on the same day.

Significance of the Hybrid Procedure

In addition to the significant success of the hybrid procedure, one of the most important advances is creation of a collaborative approach to the treatment of atrial fibrillation between cardiac surgeons and electrophysiologists. This collaboration will also permit important advances in improving the procedure, particularly in patients with very large atria (> 5 cm or > 6 cm dimension) or extensive scar. The vision of a combined surgical and cardiac electrophysiology program might provide an ideal venue for this approach.

AF-related extracellular matrix remodeling — persistent AF leads to electrical remodeling and fibrosis with multifactorial drivers; "Persistent AF itself leads to electrical remodeling and fibrosis of the atria", and "Experimental and clinical data point to a complex pathophysiology involving diverse factors, including oxidative stress, calcium overload, atrial dilatation, microRNAs, inflammation, and myofibroblast activation". Mechanistically, "rapid atrial rates activate fibroblasts to increase collagen-gene activity, and AF in isolation might promote cardiac fibrosis", and "Cardiac fibrosis is part of the maladaptive cardiac remodeling in response to cardiac injury and has been implicated in initiation and maintenance of AF". At broader scales, "At the molecular scale are dynamics changes in the genome, the transcriptome, and the signaling pathways…; cellular changes involve interactions among the various cardiac cells…; and tissue changes relate to the dynamics of scar, angiogenesis, electrical conduction, and contractility".

### Ablation… [^114LTFP2]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Ablation is the removal or destruction of something from an object by vaporization, chipping, erosive processes, or by other means. Examples of ablative materials are described below, including spacecraft material for ascent and atmospheric reentry, ice and snow in glaciology, biological tissues in medicine and passive fire protection materials. Medicine In medicine, ablation is the removal of a part of biological tissue, usually by surgery. Surface ablation of the skin can be carried out by chemicals, by lasers, by freezing, or by electricity. Its purpose is to remove skin spots, aged skin, wrinkles, thus rejuvenating it. Surface ablation is also employed in otolaryngology for several kinds of surgery, such as the one for snoring.

The term is also often used in the context of laser ablation, a process in which a laser breaks a material's molecular bonds. For a laser to ablate tissues, the power density or fluence must be high, otherwise thermocoagulation occurs, which is simply thermal vaporization of the tissues. In cardiology, Radiofrequency ablation can be used to treat a variety of cardiac arrhythmia such as supraventricular tachycardia, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, and more recently as management of atrial fibrillation. Rotablation is a type of arterial cleansing that consists of inserting a tiny, diamond-tipped, drill-like device into the affected artery to remove fatty deposits or plaque. The procedure is used in the treatment of coronary heart disease to restore blood flow. Microwave ablation is similar to RFA but at higher frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation removes tissue from within the body noninvasively. Bone marrow ablation is a process whereby the human bone marrow cells are eliminated in preparation for a bone marrow transplant. This is performed using high-intensity chemotherapy and total body irradiation. As such, it has nothing to do with the vaporization techniques described in the rest of this article. Ablation of brain tissue is used for treating certain neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease, and sometimes for psychiatric disorders as well. Recently, some researchers reported successful results with genetic ablation. In particular, genetic ablation is potentially a much more efficient method of removing unwanted cells, such as tumor cells, because large numbers of animals lacking specific cells could be generated. Genetically ablated lines can be maintained for a prolonged period of time and shared within the research community.

Researchers at Columbia University report of reconstituted caspases combined from C. elegans and humans, which maintain a high degree of target specificity. The genetic ablation techniques described could prove useful in battling cancer. Electro-ablation Electro-ablation, is a process that removes material from a metallic workpiece to reduce surface roughness. Electro-ablation breaks through highly resistive oxide surfaces, such as those found on titanium and other exotic metals and alloys without melting the underlying non-oxidised metal or alloy. This allows very quick surface finishing. The process is particularly applicable to components produced by additive manufacturing process, such as 3D-printed metals. These components tend to be produced with roughness levels well above 5–20 micron. Electro-ablation can be used to quickly reduce the surface roughness to less than 0. 8 micron, allowing the post-process to be used for volume production surface finishing.

### Cardiac radiotherapy induces electrical conduction reprogramming in the absence of transmural fibrosis [^112ugorf]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac arrest, occurring in the setting of impaired cardiac function and structural heart disease that lead to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation, is a leading cause of death in the world. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators improve survival in at-risk populations at the cost of reduced quality of life from shocks and potential for worsening heart failure (HF). Anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) have considerable side effects and modest efficacy. Invasive radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) identifies electrically reentrant regions within scar and delivers ablative thermal energy to homogenize scar and eliminate VT. However, CA is time-consuming, technically challenging, and highly operator-dependent. Rates of acute VT cessation and durable control are high in favorable individuals, especially first-time CA patients with preserved ventricular function and ischemic cardiomyopathy with focal scar. Success rates are considerably lower in patients with severely impaired ventricular function, diffuse scar, or prior CA –. Failure of CA may occur in part due to anatomical factors or limitations in the properties of heat transfer physics to create full-thickness, gap-free ablations –.

Radiotherapy (RT) noninvasively delivers high-dose radiation to volumes of target tissue anywhere in the body, with minimal off-target exposure, and is well established for treating malignancies. Hypothetically, ablative doses of radiation could noninvasively replicate effects of CA, with a fibrotic response expected over months to years –. Recent clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cardiac RT for treatment of refractory VT in patients –. The first case series reported a 99.9% reduction in VT burden after treatment with 25 Gray (Gy) ionizing radiation. More recently, a prospective Phase I/II trial of 19 patients who had either previously failed or were not eligible for CA reported a 94% reduction in episodes of VT or premature ventricular contractions and a 12-month survival rate of 72% in this very sick population. Similar outcomes have since been replicated by several independent medical centers –. In all cases, the therapeutic effect was observed within days to weeks, well before RT-induced fibrosis is expected to occur. As such, the mechanisms by which radiation reduces VT remain unknown.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^115bn9ge]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — radiofrequency energy emphasizes lesion creation by heating tissue, as "Most tissues exposed to temperatures of 50°C or higher for more than several seconds will show irreversible coagulation necrosis, and evolve into non-conducting myocardial scar", and "High power delivery and good electrode–tissue contact promote the formation of larger lesions and improved procedure efficacy". "Thrombus and char can be minimized by limiting power and/or target temperature, by monitoring the production of steam microbubbles at the catheter tip with ICE, and by cooling the electrode–tissue interface with saline irrigated tips". Historically, "Early reports of catheter ablation of AF employed conventional 4-mm or 5-mm tip ablation catheters", whereas "The majority of the members of the Task Force now employ irrigated tip catheters". Evidence notes that "Comparative trials of irrigated tip and large tip RF technologies versus conventional RF electrodes have demonstrated increased efficacy and decreased procedure duration in the ablation of atrial flutter, but only limited trials of large tip and open irrigation catheters have been performed in patients undergoing AF ablation", and "Despite widespread adoption of irrigated RF ablation catheters, there is no definitive proof that these catheters reduce complications or improve outcomes when used for ablation of AF". "Increased efficacy is observed with higher power applications of RF energy". For safety, "Three-fourths of the Task Force routinely decrease RF power when ablating in the posterior LA", and "ICE has been employed to monitor lesion formation. If the tissue shows evidence of increased echogenicity, or if small gas bubbles are observed, then power should be reduced or terminated". Finally, "Lesion extension over time can be controlled by limiting applied power and application duration", and "Therefore, limiting lesion duration may result in smaller lesions".

### Sex difference in atrial scar prevalence: what can we learn from the STABLE-SR-III trial? [^116YjcYG]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Female sex has long been recognized to present a higher risk of stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) than in males. However, the underlying mechanisms and benefits of additional low-voltage area (LVA) modification in women remain unknown.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in atrial substrate and efficacy of additive LVA ablation between sex subgroups.

Methods

Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) aged 65–80 years were randomly assigned to either CPVI plus LVA modification (STABLE-SR) group or CPVI alone group. The primary outcome was freedom from atrial arrhythmias after a single ablation procedure.

Results

Of 414 patients included in STABLE-SR-III, 204 (49.3%) were women (mean age 70.5 ± 4.7 years). Women demonstrated significantly higher LVA prevalence (51.5% vs 32.9%; P < .001) and LVA burden (6.5% vs 2.9%; P < .001) than men. In the STABLE-SR group, additional LVA ablation was associated with a 63% reduction in recurrence for women compared with the CPVI alone group (10.8% vs 29.4%; adjusted hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.18–0.75; P for interaction = .040). However, this finding was not observed in men (18.7% vs 18.5%). In the female subgroup, both group 1 (CPVI + LVA modification) and group 3 (CPVI alone in females without LVA) had similar clinical outcomes, which were much better than in Group 2 (CPVI alone in women with LVA) (90% vs 83.8% vs 63.6%; p = 0.003).

Conclusion

In older patients with PAF, women demonstrated more advanced atrial substrate, including higher prevalence and burden of LVA compared with men. Women may receive greater benefit from additional LVA modification than men.

### Catheter ablation for the management of atrial fibrillation: current technical perspectives [^116h9htf]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Scar homogenisation

The pathophysiological importance of epicardial adipose tissue, atrial fibrosis and arrhythmogenic foci has been implicated in previous studies. The development and progression of atrial fibrosis are the primary modulator of structural remodelling in AF. Fibrosis promotes AF by interrupting fibre bundle continuity and causing disturbances in local conduction. Catheter ablation based on atrial scar sites as arrhythmic substrate has, therefore, emerged as a recent treatment approach for persistent AF. It can be detected from cardiac MRI with delayed enhancement or 3D mapping with bipolar low-voltage electrogram. Previous studies have demonstrated that atrial fibrosis, estimated by delayed-enhancement MRI, is independently associated with the likelihood of AF recurrence.51 With evolving data on the association between atrial fibrosis and AF progression, ablation strategies have been developed to eliminate low-voltage zones that may indicate scar, otherwise known as scar homogenisation. Improved AF outcomes may be achievable through patient-specific substrate modification based on targeted ablation of atrial fibrosis. Nonetheless, voltage map-guided ablation is yet to gain widespread adoption into routine practice and further investigation is required to establish its long-term safety.

### Hyperspectral imaging for label-free in vivo identification of myocardial scars and sites of radiofrequency ablation lesions [^1126qees]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias often involves ablating viable muscle tissue within or near islands of scarred myocardium. Yet, today there are limited means by which the boundaries of such scars can be visualized during surgery and distinguished from the sites of acute injury caused by radiofrequency (RF) ablation.

Objective

We sought to explore a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) methodology to delineate and distinguish scar tissue from tissue injury caused by RF ablation.

Methods

RF ablation of the ventricular surface of live rats that underwent thoracotomy was followed by a 2-month animal recovery period. During a second surgery, new RF lesions were placed next to the scarred tissue from the previous ablation procedure. The myocardial infarction model was used as an alternative way to create scar tissue.

Results

Excitation-emission matrices acquired from the sites of RF lesions, scar region, and the surrounding unablated tissue revealed multiple spectral changes. These findings justified HSI of the heart surface using illumination with 365 nm UV light while acquiring spectral images within the visible range. Autofluorescence-based HSI enabled to distinguish sites of RF lesions from scar or unablated myocardium in open-chest rats. A pilot version of a percutaneous HSI catheter was used to demonstrate the feasibility of RF lesion visualization in atrial tissue of live pigs.

Conclusion

HSI based on changes in tissue autofluorescence is a highly effective tool for revealing-in vivo and with high spatial resolution-surface boundaries of myocardial scar and discriminating it from areas of acute necrosis caused by RF ablation.

### Ablation lesion characterization in scarred substrate assessed using cardiac magnetic resonance [^1179ES1H]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study examined radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) lesions within and around scar by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and histology.

Background

Substrate modification by RFCA is the cornerstone therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. RFCA in scarred myocardium, however, is not well understood.

Methods

We performed electroanatomic mapping and RFCA in the left ventricles of 8 swine with myocardial infarction. Non-contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted (T1w) and contrast-enhanced CMR after RFCA were compared with gross pathology and histology.

Results

Of 59 lesions, 17 were in normal myocardium (voltage > 1.5 mV), 21 in border zone (0.5 to 1.5 mV), and 21 in scar (< 0.5 mV). All RFCA lesions were enhanced in T1w CMR, whereas scar was hypointense, allowing discrimination among normal myocardium, scar, and RFCA lesions. With contrast-enhancement, lesions and scar were similarly enhanced and not distinguishable. Lesion width and depth in T1w CMR correlated with necrosis in pathology (both; r² = 0.94, p < 0.001). CMR lesion volume was significantly different in normal myocardium, border zone, and scar (median: 397 [interquartile range (IQR): 301 to 474] mm³, 121 [IQR: 87 to 201] mm³, 66 [IQR: 33 to 123] mm³, respectively). RFCA force-time integral, impedance, and voltage changes did not correlate with lesion volume in border zone or scar. Histology showed that ablation necrosis extended into fibrotic tissue in 26 lesions and beyond in 14 lesions. In 7 lesions, necrosis expansion was blocked and redirected by fat.

Conclusions

T1w CMR can selectively enhance necrotic tissue in and around scar and may allow determination of the completeness of ablation intra- and post-procedure. Lesion formation in scar is affected by tissue characteristics, with fibrosis and fat acting as thermal insulators.

### Effect of ablation of frequent premature ventricular complexes on left ventricular function in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy [^112RbTHd]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Frequent idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can result in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. Frequent PVCs can also aggravate ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of frequent PVCs on nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

Methods

This was a consecutive series of 30 patients (mean age 59.1 ± 12.1; 18 men; mean ejection fraction [EF] 38% ± 15%) with structurally abnormal hearts based on the presence of scar on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and/or a history of cardiomyopathy before the presence of frequent PVCs who were referred for ablation of frequent PVCs.

Results

Ablation was successful in 18 of 30 patients (60%), resulting in an increase of mean EF from 33.9% ± 14.5% to 45.7% ± 17% (P < .0001) during mean follow-up of 30 ± 28 months. The PVC burden in these patients was reduced from 23.1% ± 8.8% to 1.0% ± 0.9% (P < .0001). Mean EF did not change in patients with a failed ablation procedure (44.4 ± 16 vs 43.5 ± 21, P = 0.85). The PVC site of origin was in scar tissue in 14 of 18 patients with a successful ablation procedure. Mean New York Heart Association functional class improved from 2.3 ± 0.6 to 1.1 ± 0.2 (P < .0001) in patients with a successful outcome and remained unchanged in patients with an unsuccessful outcome (1.9 ± 0.9 vs 1.9 ± 0.7, P = 1).

Conclusion

In patients with frequent PVCs and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, EF and functional class can be improved but not always normalized by successful PVC ablation. In most patients with an effective ablation, the arrhythmogenic substrate was located in scar tissue.

### Epicardial catheter mapping and ablation of ventricular tachycardia [^114W6Lk6]. Heart Rhythm (2006). Low credibility.

Percutaneous entry into the pericardial space allows epicardial catheter mapping and ablation in the electrophysiology laboratory, opening a perspective on cardiac electrophysiology that previously was limited largely to the operating room. Scar-related reentry after myocardial infarction usually involves the subendocardium but in some patients can only be ablated from the epicardium. Epicardial, scar-related reentry also is an important cause of ventricular tachycardia in nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Rare supraventricular tachycardias and idiopathic ventricular tachycardia that cannot be defined from the endocardium sometimes can be ablated from the epicardium. With appropriate precautions the procedural risks are low. Epicardial catheter techniques expand the options for investigating cardiac electrophysiology and treating arrhythmias in humans and may lead to insights into transmural properties influencing repolarization and the genesis of arrhythmias.

### High-voltage focal pulsed field ablation to treat scar-related ventricular tachycardia: the first-in-humanTrial [^113wK5iF]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Unlike the tremendous progress made in atrial fibrillation ablation, the greatest unmet clinical need is for innovative ablation treatments for scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) - particularly given the thick, often fibrotic tissue characteristic of the scarred substrate. A focal pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter with a novel waveform was designed: high-voltage to provide tissue penetration, and low-energy (using short duration pulses) to avoid tissue overheating. We present the outcomes of VCAS, a first-in-human study of this PFA catheter to ablate scar-related VT.

Methods

An investigational 8.5-French force-sensing PFA catheter was used for scar-VT ablation in ischemic or non-ischemic substrates. PF lesions consisted of 5 applications, each < 200 msec, of a high-voltage (> 10 kV) monophasic waveform with QRS-synchronization. The PFA catheter was localized by electrical impedance-based navigation. A sub-cohort of patients without prior cardiac surgery underwent epicardial ventricular mapping - at baseline and after endocardial PFA - to assess for transmurality of endocardial PF lesions. Study endpoints included procedural efficiency, safety and effectiveness to final follow-up of 6 months.

Results

At 2 centers, 26 patients underwent ablation: age 66 ± 9; 4% female; left ventricular ejection fraction 32 ± 10%; VT storm 42%; prior VT ablation 42%. Acute procedural success, achieved in 24 (92%) patients, required 21 [IQR 14–24] lesions per patient, with a transpired ablation time of 31 minutes [19–42]. The clinical VT was induced in 14 of 16 patients (88%) pre-ablation, and 1 of 16 patients (6%; p < 0.001) post-ablation. High-density epi-endo voltage mapping was performed in 10 patients [42%]; of the 9 patients undergoing endo cardial-only PFA, transmural tissue homogenization was observed in all 9 (100%) patients. Freedom from recurrent VT/VF or ICD shock was 81.8% [95%CI 67.1–99.8]. Regarding VT/VF burden, the incidence rate of post-ablation VT/VF significantly decreased from baseline to post-PFA by 98% (median [IQR] 6 [1–11] vs 0 [0–0], respectively; p < 0.001). Primary safety endpoints within 180 days occurred in 3 of 26 (11.5%) patients: cardiogenic shock, heart failure hospitalization, and retroperitoneal bleed.

Conclusions

In this first-in-human study, the high-voltage PFA catheter efficiently delivered transmural ventricular lesions to treat scar-related VT.

Catheter Ablation

Catheter ablation is a therapeutic option for ARVC/D patients who have VT. Fibrofatty replacement of RV myocardium creates scar regions that are regarded as arrhythmogenic substrate for VT. Ventricular tachycardia is the result of a scar-related macro-reentry circuit, similar to that observed in the postmyocardial infarction setting, which is suitable for mapping and interruption by catheter ablation. Catheter ablation may be guided by either conventional electrophysiological or substrate-based mapping during sinus rhythm. –

Fontaine et al, first studied the effects of direct current fulguration and demonstrated the feasibility of VT ablation in ARVC/D. Subsequently, several studies have reported on acute and long-term results of endocardial catheter ablation of VT using radiofrequency current. – Overall, acute success was achieved in 60% to 80% of patients, whereas the recurrence rates during long-term follow-up of 3 to 5 years were as high as 50% to 70% (online-only Data Supplement, Table S1). The high frequency of VT recurrences and the discrepancy between the successful acute results and the unfavourable long-term outcome have been explained by the progressive nature of the ARVC/D substrate (ie, fibrofatty scar), which predisposes to the occurrence of multiple reentry circuits and new arrhythmogenic foci over time. Recently, studies have suggested that epicardial location of some VT reentry circuits, which reflects the propensity of ARVC/D lesion to originate and progress from the epicardium, may partly explain the failure of conventional endocardial mapping/catheter ablation. Garcia et alfirst reported the feasibility and efficacy of epicardial catheter ablation in ARVC/D patients who underwent an epicardial approach after previously failed endocardial VT mapping/ablation procedures. In these patients, the extent of electroanatomical scar area at voltage mapping was larger on the epicardial side of the RV wall than on the endocardium. Complete success was achieved in 85% of cases (partial success in 92%) and 77% of patients were free of VT during 18 months of follow-up. Phillips et alcompared the efficacy of traditional electrophysiological VT mapping/catheter ablation with other strategies including substrate-based and epicardial catheter approaches. The recurrences of VT were significantly reduced irrespective of the mapping/ablation strategy. The cumulative freedom from VT following procedures using 3D-electroanatomical mapping and/or epicardial approach was significantly greater than conventional ablation, although the recurrence rates remain considerable. Freedom from VT after epicardial ablation of 64 and 45% at 1 and 5 years was found, which was significantly improved compared with studies using the endocardial approach. According to Berruezo et al, complete scar dechannelling with elimination of either endo or epicardial scar conducting channels (ie, intrascar, interscar, or between scar and valvular annuli) in addition to ablation of clinical VT is a promising approach to improve long-term success rate of catheter ablation.

### Role of contact force sensing in catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias: evolution or history repeating itself? [^114WKRMi]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2018). Low credibility.

Adequate catheter-tissue contact facilitates efficient heat energy transfer to target tissue. Tissue contact is thus critical to achieving lesion transmurality and success of radiofrequency (RF) ablation procedures, a fact recognized more than 2 decades ago. The availability of real-time contact force (CF)-sensing catheters has reinvigorated the field of ablation biophysics and optimized lesion formation. The ability to measure and display CF came with the promise of dramatic improvement in safety and efficacy; however, CF quality was noted to have just as important an influence on lesion formation as absolute CF quantity. Multiple other factors have emerged as key elements influencing effective lesion formation, including catheter stability, lesion contiguity and continuity, lesion density, contact homogeneity across a line of ablation, spatiotemporal dynamics of contact governed by cardiac and respiratory motion, contact directionality, and anatomic wall thickness, in addition to traditional ablation indices of power and RF duration. There is greater appreciation of surrogate markers as a guide to lesion formation, such as impedance fall, loss of pace capture, and change in unipolar electrogram morphology. In contrast, other surrogates such as tactile feedback, catheter motion, and electrogram amplitude are notably poor predictors of actual contact and lesion formation. This review aims to contextualize the role of CF sensing in lesion formation with respect of the fundamental principles of biophysics of RF ablation and summarize the state-of-the-art evidence behind the role of CF in optimizing lesion formation.

### Novel therapeutic strategies targeting fibroblasts and fibrosis in heart disease [^117BsUqb]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the functions of cardiac fibroblasts has moved beyond their roles in heart structure and extracellular matrix generation and now includes their contributions to paracrine, mechanical and electrical signalling during ontogenesis and normal cardiac activity. Fibroblasts also have central roles in pathogenic remodelling during myocardial ischaemia, hypertension and heart failure. As key contributors to scar formation, they are crucial for tissue repair after interventions including surgery and ablation. Novel experimental approaches targeting cardiac fibroblasts are promising potential therapies for heart disease. Indeed, several existing drugs act, at least partially, through effects on cardiac connective tissue. This Review outlines the origins and roles of fibroblasts in cardiac development, homeostasis and disease; illustrates the involvement of fibroblasts in current and emerging clinical interventions; and identifies future targets for research and development.

### Heart digital twins predict features of invasive reentrant circuits and ablation lesions in scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia [^115wJrow]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

All patients described in this study provided written, informed consent. The study was approved by the Health Research Authority London — Surrey Research Ethics Committee (21/LO/0083).reference number: REGISTRATION: URL:; Unique identifier: NCT04632394. The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Study Overview

Patients requiring catheter ablation for VT were prospectively enrolled into this clinical and digital twin study. Patients underwent 3-dimensional late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) before the ablation procedure. These images were used to generate digital twin representations, which accurately reflect the unique distribution of scar in each patient. VT inducibility in the personalized digital twins was tested through pacing protocols, and if reentrant arrhythmia was identified, the circuit morphology within the fibrotic milieu was analyzed to ascertain the optimum targets for ablation. Through comprehensive re-testing and application of further lesions to the postablation substrate, the models were rendered noninducible to all VT. Next, patients underwent invasive VT ablation, including VT induction, mapping, and radiofrequency ablation. The characteristics of both the digital twins' and the invasively mapped circuits were analyzed. Markers of the critical VT isthmus, as well as the predicted and invasively delivered radiofrequency lesions, were analyzed, and the overlap between the digital twins and invasive clinical findings was compared. The digital twin modeling and VT ablation procedures were each performed by independent investigators, blinded to the outcomes of the opposite modality. Figure 1 presents a schematic of the study.

### MRI-guided fibrosis ablation vs conventional catheter ablation in atrial arrhythmia recurrence… [^116W5QLk]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

eThe blanking period was defined as 90 days postablation. Patients were not monitored for the primary outcome of atrial arrhythmia recurrence during this period. AF indicates atrial fibrillation. The analysis was performed in randomized patients who remained in follow-up after the 90-day blanking period. Follow-up times are expressed in days following the end of the 90 day blanking period. No. at risk indicates the number of patients remaining at risk at the indicated follow-up times without a prior atrial arrhythmia–recurrence event. Interventions Patients with persistent AF were randomly assigned to pulmonary vein isolation plus MRI-guided atrial fibrosis ablation or PVI alone. Delayed-enhancement MRI was performed in both groups before the ablation procedure to assess baseline atrial fibrosis and at 3 months postablation to assess for ablation scar.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was time to first atrial arrhythmia recurrence after a 90-day blanking period postablation. The primary safety composite outcome was defined by the occurrence of 1 or more of the following events within 30 days postablation: stroke, PV stenosis, bleeding, heart failure, or death. Higher baseline left atrial fibrosis, determined on delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging, was independently associated with atrial arrhythmia recurrence after ablation. 9 Moreover, higher residual fibrosis has been significantly associated with worse postprocedural outcomes, 10 highlighting the role of fibrotic myopathy in maintaining an arrhythmogenic substrate. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of targeting atrial fibrotic tissue during ablation in improving rates of atrial arrhythmia recurrence in patients with persistent AF has not been tested in large randomized clinical trials.

From July 2016 through January 2020, patients were recruited and randomly assigned to undergo ablation targeting left atrial fibrosis, as detected on delayed-enhancement MRI, in addition to PVI or PVI only. Treatment assignment was masked from patients, and the duration of follow-up was 12 to 18 months after randomization. For patients randomized to the fibrosis-guided ablation group, processed delayed-enhancement MRI images were merged with the 3D mapping system at each study site to be used during the procedure. All patients underwent PVI. After the PV entrance block had been confirmed, fibrosis-guided ablation was pursued. The operator either encircled or covered with ablation lesions all fibrotic areas observed on delayed-enhancement MRI. Details regarding the ablation protocol for both treatment groups are included in the protocol in section 4. 7 of eAppendix 1 in Supplement

1.

Patients underwent a delayed-enhancement MRI within 30 days prior to the ablation procedure using the Merisight delayed-enhancement MRI protocol. The purpose of the baseline MRI was to quantify left atrial fibrosis in all patients. Patients' randomized treatment group was masked from reviewers who assessed MRI quality. MARREK Inc assisted with image segmentation, processing, and quantification of left atrial fibrosis. Following ablation, delayed-enhancement MRIs were obtained at 90 to 180 days to quantify ablation-related scar formation.
13. ECG strips data were transmitted automatically to the ECG core laboratory for reading by trained experts masked from treatment assignment. Patients were scheduled for a follow-up visit at 3 months postablation. A postablation delayed-enhancement MRI was completed to document postablation fibrosis coverage and to quantify ablation-related scar formation.

### Heart digital twins predict features of invasive reentrant circuits and ablation lesions in scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia [^1156YvAf]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

One potential strategy to overcome these limitations is the use of medical digital twins to guide catheter ablation. A medical digital twin is a digital replica of a patient or an organ that can be used to study a specific disease process, predict patient trajectories, or develop personalized therapies. In the case of cardiac electrophysiology, there have been recent advances in modeling the electrical functioning of the organ, which have led to the realization of the personalized heart digital twin. – This noninvasive tool uses cardiac imaging and other data to generate a multiscale heart model that accurately represents a patient's unique cardiac anatomy and electrophysiology. When reconstructed from contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which visualizes the distribution of scar and fibrosis in the heart, these heart digital twins incorporate the mechanistic underpinning of scar-dependent VT. Such heart digital twins have been used to test for arrhythmia inducibility and have been utilized in the prediction of risk of sudden cardiac death. Heart digital twins could also predict the optimum personalized lesion sets for ablation of scar-dependent VT, which would terminate all potential VTs in the most efficient manner possible, by identifying the VT isthmus. If accurate, these digital twin predictions have the potential to substantially reduce procedure time and may guide ablation of not only the clinical VT present in the native scar substrate, but also sites that may result in VT recurrence following an initial ablation procedure. Recently, digital twins have been shown to accurately predict sites of electrogram abnormalities as well as conduction slowing during substrate mapping in patients with VT. However, it is also essential to establish how these digital twin-derived targets compare against the conventional markers of the critical VT isthmus based on invasive activation and entrainment mapping during VT. Furthermore, establishing the relationship between the digital twin-predicted ablation targets and those formed through conventional VT mapping techniques is critical before these digital twin models can be used to guide VT ablation.

Here, we present a prospective, combined digital twin and clinical VT mapping and ablation study to determine the relationship between invasively defined VT circuits and clinical ablation targets and their respective counterparts observed in the digital twins. For the first time, digital twin-derived VT circuits and predicted ablation targets are directly compared with the invasively mapped reentrant VT and clinical ablation lesions during catheter ablation. Establishing this relationship is the foundation required for a future randomized controlled trial directly comparing digital-twin-guided ablation to conventional ablation, with the promise of a radical overhaul in our approach to scar-dependent VT ablation.

### The performance of a new nanosecond pulsed-field ablation surgical clamp in the ablation of cardiac tissue: a chronic porcine model [^116UPgWu]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this chronic porcine model is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a new nanosecond pulsed-field ablation (nsPFA) parallel clamp in ablating different cardiac tissue.

Methods

The Pulse Biosciences nsPFA CellFX Clamp System was tested on 6 pigs. Ablations were performed in all 4 heart chambers by delivering a sequence of very short-duration, high-amplitude electrical pulses taking 1.25 seconds per application independent of tissue thickness or type. Testing for electrical exit block was performed at the time of surgery and at study termination. At 35 days, animals were killed humanely and anonymized histopathology was performed to assess lesion width, depth, and transmurality. Lesion pattern and general safety were compared with 6 animals in which a bipolar radiofrequency clamp was used (AtriCure Synergy Isolator System).

Results

There were no device-related serious adverse events in the nsPFA group. There was 1 early device-related mortality at day 24 in the RFA group from perforation of 1 of the ventricular ablation sites. There were also 2 intracardiac thrombotic events with 1 systemic thromboembolic event in the radiofrequency group. Exit block was confirmed in all animals from both groups for the pulmonary veins and the posterior wall. Histologic findings were consistent and demonstrated mature scar formation in all nsPFA ablation specimens, whereas a 7.1% rate of incomplete histopathological scar maturation was present in the RFA group.

Conclusions

In this chronic porcine model, a single 1.25-second application independent of tissue thickness with the CellFX Parallel Clamp System demonstrated promising safety and efficacy profile. All lesions produced by this technology resulted in persistent exit block around pulmonary veins and the posterior atrial wall consistent with a reliable, contiguous and transmural ablation without injury to adjacent organs.

9.7. Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Key Points

Polymorphic VT and VF are the most common VAs in HCM; monomorphic VT is less common.
The arrhythmogenic substrate in HCM often involves the septum but can extend to the epicardium, often necessitating combined endocardial and epicardial ablation procedures to eliminate the VT.
VT associated with apical aneurysms is often ablated endocardially.

Malignant VA contributes to sudden death in patients with HCM. ICDs are therefore the mainstay of prevention. The substrate for VAs in HCM is complex. The combination of myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis likely generates heterogeneous conduction properties and, together with the vulnerability of the hypertrophied myocardium to supplydemand ischemia, creates a potentially arrhythmogenic milieu. Interstitial-type fibrosis (compared with replacement fibrosis), postmyectomy scars, alcohol ablation, and the presence of an apical aneurysm can also influence arrhythmogenesis. The fibrotic areas visualized on CMR that characterize HCM can result in a similar substrate to scars from ischemic disease, in which case similar techniques can be applied during VT ablation. However, increased myocardial thickness and intramyocardial or epicardial sites of fibrosis limit the reach of classical mapping and ablation methods. The varying mechanisms (eg, reentrant vs triggered) and morphology (monomorphic vs polymorphic) of VAs encountered in HCM represent further challenges. ICD records indicate that polymorphic VT degenerating to VF is the most common event.

Ablation is generally performed for monomorphic VT that recurs despite antiarrhythmic therapy, particularly with ICD shocks. These VAs are only a small proportion of VAs in HCM, and the ablation experience is limited to case reports and small case series of highly selected patients. In a series of 10 patients with preserved LVEF (LVEF of 57% ± 13%), programmed stimulation induced clinical VT in 7 patients. A mean of 2 VTs per patient (including nonclinical VTs) were induced. VTs were sometimes stable and permitted activation and entrainment mapping. Voltage mapping identified a combination of epicardial and endocardial scars in most patients. Isolated endocardial or epicardial scarring rarely occurred. The ablation strategy entailed targeting late or fractionated electrograms and pace mapping and/or substrate modification targeting low bipolar voltage (1.5 mV) regions. It is worth noting that epicardial ablation was required in most patients. During a 3-year follow-up, 30% of the patients underwent recurrent shocks, with repeat procedures required for 2 patients.

### Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: how to modify the substrate? [^113R98gr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

A frequent need for re-ablations and limited overall success rates are still major limitations of catheter ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). These limitations include not only the durability of the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) lines, but also the pathophysiological understanding of the arrhythmia's substrate. Long-term single procedure success rates in non-paroxysmal AF are disappointingly low for current stepwise ablation approaches adding the placement of linear lines and electrogram-based ablation after circumferential PVI isolation. In the future, substrate modification in AF ablation should move toward individualized patient-tailored ablation procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging could play a major role for noninvasively describing the localization and extent of fibrotic areas. Specific new strategies that could be used include precise localization and ablation of rotors that maintain the arrhythmia using multielectrode mapping during AF and box isolation of fibrotic areas guided by electroanatomic voltage mapping during sinus rhythm.

### Limitations and pitfalls of substrate mapping for ventricular tachycardia [^117BjDt8]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The fundamental hypothesis of substrate mapping for scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia is that surrogates of the isthmus can be identified and targeted with ablation during sinus rhythm. These surrogates include electrocardiographic indications for electric discontinuity such as fractionation, split, late, and long potentials, also evident as sites displaying activation slowing. However, ablation strategies targeting these surrogates during sinus rhythm have resulted in unacceptably high rates of clinical failures, promoting the idea that a more widespread ablation may be required. High-resolution mapping technologies provide an opportunity to examine the substrate at greater detail; however, their use has not yet translated into improved clinical outcomes. This may be related to ongoing efforts to examine the same surrogates at higher resolution instead of using high-resolution technologies for discovering new and potentially more specific surrogates. This article reviews common limitations and pitfalls of substrate mapping and discusses new opportunities for high-resolution mapping to increase the accuracy of substrate mapping: 1) multielectrode mapping catheters provide an opportunity to rapidly examine the substrate during electrophysiological conditions that more closely simulate ventricular tachycardia by means of activation from different directions and coupling intervals; 2) electrogram annotation methods based on the maximal negative derivative of the extracellular potential or maximal voltage are often inaccurate in nonuniform anisotropic tissue. The use of multielectrode catheters may improve the accuracy of electrogram annotation by using spatiotemporal dispersion of single-beat acquisitions and a localized indifferent reference; and 3) resetting and entrainment remain important methods for studying re-entry for and guiding ablation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116d1mVk]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, there is strong evidence that AF ablation improves QOL, and reasonable evidence that AF ablation improves ventricular function in those patients with AF who have HF. The impact of AF control with ablation on other endpoints, including stroke risk, dementia, and mortality, will require further study.

Electrophysiological Basis of AF Ablation

It is generally accepted that development of AF requires both a trigger and a susceptible substrate. Figures 3 and 4 summarize the many mechanisms of AF. Over time, AF progresses from a trigger-driven to a more substrate-mediated arrhythmia due to structural remodeling of the atria. Ablative therapy is therefore aimed at either eliminating the trigger initiating AF or modifying the arrhythmogenic substrate. The most commonly employed ablation strategy consists of electrical isolation of the PVs by creation of circumferential lesions around the right and the left PV. A schematic overview of common lesion sets created during an AF ablation procedure is shown in Figure 6. The effects of these lesions have been attributed to isolation of AF triggering PV foci, elimination of non-PV triggering foci, and/or as the result of modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate. The latter might include interruption of crucial pathways of conduction between pulmonary-atrial junctions, which play a role in sustenance of AF, reduction of the amount of mass available for the number of simultaneously circulating wavelets (atrial debulking), or partial vagal denervation by interruption of vagal stimulation from the autonomic ganglia. Adjuvant substrate modification is targeted at patient-specific AF sources in the RA and LA. AF recurrences after an initially successful AF ablation procedure are typically associated with PVI reconnection. A more recent strategy for AF ablation involves mapping and ablation of rotational activity.

### Ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation: is there a light at the end of the tunnel? [^114Te6PG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The EARNEST‐PVI and the ERASE‐AF studies seem to indicate that modification of the left atrium by creating linear lesions or homogenizing scar tissue, not unlike ablation for ventricular tachycardia in the setting of scar tissue, can yield favorable results. This assumption has to be reconciled with the recent finding from the DECAAF II (Efficacy of Delayed Enhancement MRI‐Guided Ablation Vs Conventional Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation) trial, which failed to demonstrate that targeting left atrial scar defined by magnetic resonance imaging, in addition to PVI, lowers the recurrence rate of AF when compared with PVI alone. The EARNEST‐PVI trial is one of a few emerging trials that not only herald an improvement in the outcomes of patients with persistent AF undergoing ablation but also shed light on the pathophysiology of persistent atrial fibrillation.

### Preventive catheter ablation for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with end-stage heart failure referred for heart transplantation evaluation: rationale for and design of the CASTLE-VT trial [^113RztA6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Timely referrals for transplantation and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) play a key role in favourable outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). Cardiovascular mortality, driven by sudden cardiac death, is the main reason for dying while waiting for heart transplantation (HTx). The purpose of the Preventive Catheter Ablation for ventricular arrhythmiaS in patients with end-sTage heart faiLure rEferred for heart transplantation eValuaTion (CASTLE-VT) trial is to test the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic ventricular scar tissue will reduce mortality, need for LVAD implantation, and urgent HTx in patients with end-stage HF related to ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM).

Methods

CASTLE-VT is a randomized evaluation of prophylactic ablative treatment of arrhythmogenic ventricular scar in patients referred for HTx evaluation and diagnosed with ICM. Ablation will be performed with the use of a substrate-based approach in which the myocardial scar is mapped and ablated while the heart remains predominantly in sinus rhythm. The primary endpoint is the composite of all-cause mortality, worsening of HF requiring prioritized transplantation or LVAD implantation. The main secondary study endpoints are all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, incidence of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, hospitalizations, quality of life, time to first ICD therapy, number of device-detected ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation episodes, left ventricular function, and exercise tolerance. CASTLE-VT will randomize 160 patients with a follow-up period of 2years.

Conclusion

CASTLE-VT will determine whether prophylactic catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic ventricular scar tissue reduces mortality in patients with end-stage HF who are referred for HTx evaluation.

Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is a therapeutic option for ARVC/D patients who have VT. Fibrofatty replacement of RV myocardium creates scar regions that are regarded as arrhythmogenic substrate for VT. Ventricular tachycardia is the result of a scar-related macro-reentry circuit, similar to that observed in the post-myocardial infarction setting, which is suitable for mapping and interruption by catheter ablation. Catheter ablation may be guided by either conventional electrophysiological or substrate-based mapping during sinus rhythm. –

Fontaine et al. first studied the effects of direct current fulguration and demonstrated the feasibility of VT ablation in ARVC/D. Subsequently, several studies have reported on acute and long-term results of endocardial catheter ablation of VT using radiofrequency current. – Overall, acute success was achieved in 60–80% of patients, whereas the recurrence rates during long-term follow-up of 3–5 years were as high as 50–70% (see). The high frequency of VT recurrences and the discrepancy between the successful acute results and the unfavourable long-term outcome have been explained by the progressive nature of the ARVC/D substrate (i.e. fibrofatty scar), which predisposes to the occurrence of multiple reentry circuits and new arrhythmogenic foci over time. Recently, studies have suggested that epicardial location of some VT reentry circuits, which reflects the propensity of ARVC/D lesion to originate and progress from the epicardium, may partly explain the failure of conventional endocardial mapping/catheter ablation. Garcia et al.first reported the feasibility and efficacy of epicardial catheter ablation in ARVC/D patients who underwent an epicardial approach after previously failed endocardial VT mapping/ablation procedures. In these patients, the extent of electroanatomical scar area at voltage mapping was larger on the epicardial side of the RV wall than on the endocardium. Complete success was achieved in 85% of cases (partial success in 92%) and 77% of patients were free of VT during 18 months of follow-up. Phillips et al.compared the efficacy of traditional electrophysiological VT mapping/catheter ablation with other strategies including substrate-based and epicardial catheter approaches. The recurrences of VT were significantly reduced irrespective of the mapping/ablation strategy. The cumulative freedom from VT following procedures using 3D-electroanatomical mapping and/or epicardial approach was significantly greater than conventional ablation, although the recurrence rates remain considerable. Freedom from VT after epicardial ablation of 64 and 45% at 1 and 5 years was found, which was significantly improved compared with studies using the endocardial approach. According to Berruezo et al.complete scar de-channelling with elimination of either endo or epicardial scar conducting channels (i.e. intra-scar, inter-scar, or between scar and valvular annuli) in addition to ablation of clinical VT is a promising approach to improve long-term success rate of catheter ablation.

### Cryosurgery for atrial fibrillation: physiologic basis for creating optimal cryolesions [^111wm67G]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although cryosurgery has been used to treat cardiac arrhythmias for nearly 5 decades, the mechanism of action and the surgical technique that produces optimal cryolesions for the treatment of atrial fibrillation are still poorly understood. This has resulted in surgical outcomes that can be improved by a better understanding the mechanisms of cryothermia ablation and the proper surgical techniques that take advantage of those mechanisms.

Methods

The cryobiology underlying cryosurgical ablation is described, as are the nuances of cryosurgical techniques that ensure the reliable creation of contiguous, uniformly transmural atrial cryolesions. The oft-misunderstood "2-minute rule" for the application of cryothermia is clarified in detail, along with its variations that depend on target myocardial temperature.

Results

The creation of optimal cryolesions depends on cryoprobe temperature, the temperature of the target myocardium, the duration of cryothermia application, and the presence or absence of a "heat sink" or "cooling sink" created by intracavitary blood circulation. Cryothermia kills myocardial cells during both the freezing and thawing phases of cryoablation cycle. The critical lethal temperature for myocardium is -30°C. The slower the target tissue thaws, the higher the percentage of cell death.

Conclusions

The availability of cryosurgical techniques has revolutionized the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. By utilizing modern cryosurgical devices and adhering to the technical principles described, surgeons can now perform surgical procedures for atrial fibrillation that are quicker, safer, and as effective as the standard Maze-III/IV procedure.

Dilated cardiomyopathy ablation — identifying the location and extent of scarring on CMR is beneficial in procedural planning and has improved the outcomes of ablation in patients with DCM. The ablation strategy is similar to postinfarction VT. An intramural substrate is more frequently encountered in DCM than in postinfarction patients and requires a different ablation strategy than for patients with either epicardial or endocardial scarring. Epicardial ablation is beneficial if the scar is located in the epicardium of the LV free wall. For intramural circuits involving the septum, epicardial ablation is not beneficial. In the absence of CMR, unipolar voltage mapping has been described as a method to indicate a deeper-seated scar.

### Comparison of radiofrequency ablation in normal versus scarred myocardium [^112DHnfV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reentrant circuits causing ventricular tachycardia are closely associated with previously scarred myocardium. The presence of scar has been blamed for the poor success rate of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in that context. This article investigates the in vivo effects of radiofrequency ablation in myocardium scarred from acute myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

Anterior myocardial infarction was induced in five dogs by ligating the left anterior descending artery. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction after infarction was 38%. At a mean of 15 weeks following myocardial infarction, 50 RFA lesions were created in random order, 25 in scarred and 25 in normal myocardium using a needle electrode (21 gauge, 5 mm in length) introduced from the epicardium of the left ventricle at thoracotomy. During unipolar temperature-controlled RFA (90 degrees C for 60 seconds), intramural temperatures were measured by thermistors at distances of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm from the ablating electrode. The margins of the lesions were clearly discernible in scar at histological examination in 64% of ablations where the scarring was patchy. There were no significant differences between lesion sizes, intramural temperatures at different distances, total energy required for ablation, or mean impedance during ablation of normal versus scarred myocardium.

Conclusions

Scar does not affect lesion size or intramural temperature profile during RFA if electrode size, tissue contact, and tip temperature are controlled. More radiofrequency energy is not required to maintain tip temperature at 90 degrees C in scar compared to normal myocardium.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115r9R4Q]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, the utility of delayed enhancement (DE) MRI has been introduced for detecting, quantifying, and localizing atrial fibrosis, including the definition of four categories of structural changes (Utah stages I–IV). The tissue characterization of the LA wall on DE MRI correlated with EAVM and with histology from surgical biopsy specimens. The association of atrial tissue fibrosis and AF catheter ablation outcomes, with more extensive fibrosis associated with lower efficacy, was confirmed in the multicenter Delayed Enhancement MRI and Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation (DECAAF) study. On the other hand, these MRI findings at this point in time require extensive MRI experience, including specification of image contrast and continuity, required to set boundaries for the various degrees of fibrosis. The reproducibility of this approach is still under investigation. A major limitation of this approach is that the degree of scar identified depends strongly on the above thresholds used to define scar. At the present time, no uniform standard has been developed. This limitation hinders the reader-to-reader and day-to-day reproducibility of MRI-determined measurements of atrial scar. Once established, however, the DE MRI quantification and localization of atrial fibrosis might be used effectively to guide individually tailored substrate elimination comparable to EAVM-guided substrate modification. Finally, tissue visualization before and also during and directly after RF catheter ablation is the target for introducing real-time MRI into the clinical electrophysiological laboratory. Currently, the DECAAF-2 trial has been launched to test the hypothesis that ablation of scar detected on MRI improves ablation outcomes for persistent AF compared with PVI alone.

A survey of the writing group members shows that for patients undergoing an initial AF ablation for PAF, 7% of the writing group members employ an ablation strategy based in part on MRI or voltage mapping-detected scar, and 9% of the writing group members employ this strategy for repeat AF ablation procedures in patients with PAF. For an initial ablation procedure in patients with persistent and longstanding persistent AF, 15% of the writing group members employ an ablation strategy based in part on MRI or voltage mapping-detected scar. The proportion increases to 22% for repeat ablation in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF. Based on this information and a review of the literature, the writing group recognizes that the usefulness of mapping and ablation of areas of abnormal myocardial tissue identified with voltage mapping or MRI as an initial or repeat ablation strategy for persistent and long-standing persistent AF is not well established (Class IIb, LOE B-R, Table 3).

### Characteristics of pulsed electric field cardiac ablation porcine treatment zones with a focal catheter [^1156hp2x]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 STUDY LIMITATIONS

The scope of this study has several limitations, most notably the acute nature of ablation zone assessments. The time course of gross and histopathological PEF treatment effects in cardiac tissue has been described elsewhere. Furthermore, safety of the tested technology and PEF in general in relation to sensitive structures such as blood vessels and nerves are described in. Broadly, PEF histology shows dead cardiomyocytes are replaced by fibroblast infiltration, resulting in a fibrotic scar replacement of the treated zones over the course of 2–4 weeks. While maximum treatment measurements may be influenced by late‐stage cell death onset over a short‐term (hours‐days), which may influence treatment measurements, this study sought to compare PEF lesion sizes under the same conditions as conventional RF ablation studies. It was thus not an objective of this study to evaluate the temporal evolution of these treatment effects on a longer timescale.

Another limitation of this study is that only one focal ablation catheter was tested with the system. However, other compatible catheters all utilize approximately the same materials and dimensional characteristics of the distal tip electrode. Therefore, while some minor differences in irrigation design, contact force, and mapping accuracy may be experienced between catheters, it is reasonable to expect that lesion dimensions will be similar when using this PEF system with focal ablation catheters of similar dimension and design.

An additional consideration is the exclusive evaluation of treatment size in ventricular tissue. Ablations were performed in the ventricles to reduce the occurrence of transmural lesions, permitting more accurate measurement of the resulting treatment depth. Notably, most amenable cardiac ablation targets reside within the atria. Presently, there is no evidence to suggest that cardiomyocyte PEF susceptibility changes between these two chambers, and thus it is likely that the treatment depths reported here will adequately reflect treatment depths in atrial tissue targets. For ventricular ablation objectives, namely targeting ventricular tachycardia, the treatment effect in relation to fibrotic scar tissue remain a topic of active research.

Additional notes regarding the use of ventricles in this study include the trabeculated anatomy of the ventricles makes it a challenging location for assessment of treatment size, contributing to the considerable standard deviations in measured dimensions. Furthermore, the motile nature of the ventricles makes contact force markedly less stable. However, tested contact force was limited to a range of 15–25 g, and since PEFs were gated to the R‐wave, the deliveries were synchronized to be delivered while the ventricles are in systole, providing more consistent contact force during PEF delivery.

Radiofrequency lesion formation and tissue effects — during catheter ablation, the half-time of lesion growth is approximately 5–15 seconds, with maximum lesion size usually achieved within 1 minute; subacute lesions examined 2–7 days later show infiltration of inflammatory cells; myocardium exposed to temperatures of 50°C or higher for more than several seconds will show irreversible coagulation necrosis and evolve into nonconducting myocardial scar.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^115aYDvJ]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

The most common VT mechanism in patients with SHD is scar-related reentry with continuous excitation of the circuit throughout the tachycardia CL. The QRS onset typically occurs when the impulse reaches the exit from the scar to activate the contractile myocardium. In "exit sites", electrograms can be fractionated and immediately precede the onset of the QRS complex. Ablation at exit sites can terminate the tachycardia; however, it can also result in a change of the tachycardia configuration and/or CL in which the diastolic pathway exits at different locations from the scar. Ablation of the diastolic pathway "isthmus" is therefore a more desirable target, given it can eliminate the machinery required for reentry. Electrograms at isthmus sites occur earlier during diastole, are typically of very low-voltage amplitude (< 0.5 mV), and can have multiple potentials. Mapping of these circuits with multielectrode mapping catheters can be helpful for identifying low amplitude signals, for differentiating near-field from far-field potentials, and for shortening the time required for mapping (see Section 8.1). It should be noted that the mere presence of diastolic potentials does not suggest an isthmus location. These can also be recorded in dead-end pathways and adjacent bystanders unrelated to the circuit. It is therefore important to carefully review and interpret the activation map in order to understand the location and complexity of the circuit. In principle, an activation map of a macroreentrant VT circuit should demonstrate distinct entrance, isthmus, and exit sites that all serve as obligatory parts of the circuit, such that it cannot continue without all of these elements. However, scar-related circuits (particularly in patients with a nonischemic substrate) can have intramural component(s) that might not be recorded on the surface. These usually exhibit a "gap" in the activation sequence, such that part of the circuit is "concealed" from the surface map, residing deep in the myocardium or on the opposing surface.

Activation mapping of scar-related VTs can be highly valuable for identifying the isthmus. However, it is often limited to patients with hemodynamically stable VT. In patients with less tolerated VTs, limited activation mapping can be performed in conjunction with substrate, entrainment, and/or pace mapping. The utility of HS to allow extended mapping during VT can improve the acute procedural endpoint of noninducibility; however, it has limited impact on the long-term outcome (see Section 6.4) and has not reduced VT recurrence.

Multielectrode tools for complex ventricular arrhythmias — capabilities and catheter advances: "High-resolution mapping with multielectrode mapping catheters provides enhanced capabilities for VT ablation in patients with structural heart disease, and permits identifying potentially arrhythmogenic regions of myocardium in sinus rhythm and during clinical VT". Advancements include "catheters with smaller electrodes and closer interelectrode spacing", and "the introduction of microelectrodes embedded within the circumference of the distal electrode of the conventional ablation catheter" which "enabled better differentiation of far-field from near-field electrograms to better characterize borders between scar and healthy tissue, and to map and ablate left ventricular summit arrhythmia". These developments "allow us to identify potentially arrhythmogenic regions even in sinus rhythm, avoiding arrhythmia induction", and "improve our understanding of arrhythmias such as wobbling tachycardia, unmappable VT, ventricular fibrillation, and even channelopathies".

### Fat infiltration in the infarcted heart as a paradigm for ventricular arrhythmias [^116sXmox]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2022). High credibility.

Main

Sudden cardiac death is a major leading cause of mortality in the world. Life-threatening VAs greatly increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, especially in patients with prior myocardial infarction. Despite advancements in anti-arrhythmic therapeutics and catheter ablation procedures, VA prevalence and recurrence rates remain unacceptably high, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying substrate. Thorough characterization of this substratewould improve existing, and inform novel, treatment strategies to decrease VA burden.

For decades, traditional dogma has maintained that disease-induced heterogeneous scarring and fibrosis infiltration in ventricles with ischemic (infarction) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies forms the arrhythmia substrate. Scar and fibrosis promote electrical wave conduction slowing and also uni-directional block, creating a milieu conducive to arrhythmogenesis. Many clinical studies have used the visualization of ventricular scar on late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) in localizing VA ablation targets –. However, these extensive efforts have failed to markedly improve VA recurrence rates, suggesting that scar characterization alone may be insufficient for identifying and eliminating VA.

### A tool to integrate electrophysiological mapping for cardiac radioablation of ventricular tachycardia [^115FwzmN]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The tool uses the markup editor module to enable manually drawing a closed curve on the EAM surface to outline scar area. Physicians can manipulate the surface 3D view and the mapping color tables to assist the process. As Fig. 1 shows, the software subsequently cuts the annotated patch from the EP surface, then perpendicularly extends the open patch outward by 2 mm to generate a closed surface. The closed surface represents the outlined scar, which can be converted to a scar structure into a structure set associated with 3D image space of the EAM. The scar structure overlaps on the image slices, illustrating the arrhythmogenic endocardial area that is derived from EP information by a multidisciplinary physician team.

The EAM data are translated to 3D image space by registering it with a cardiac MR or CT volume before scar contouring, which is necessary for the scar structure to spatially associate with the image data. Figure 2 shows the registration flowchart. After cardiac MR/CT data are imported into 3D Slicer, the endocardial chambers and other structures are contoured and converted to cardiac surface models to enable surface-based registration with EAM. The tool aggregates several registration functionalities in 3D Slicer to carry out the task. A typical procedure starts with manually placing landmark pairs on the EAM and cardiac surfaces and performing landmark registration for initial alignment. A closed curve can be manually drawn on the EAM to extract a partial surface of interest that is a high-quality mesh derived from densely catheter sampling in the EP study. Automatic iterative closest point registration of the partial surface with the cardiac surfaces is then conducted. Lastly, the surface alignment is manually reviewed and refined in the transformation module to finalize the registration of EAM to 3D cardiac images.

Figure 2
Registration of EAM surface to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. It starts from segmentation of left atrial and left ventricular endocardium on the images and follows a series of surface registrations. Abbreviations: EAM = electroanatomic map; ICP = iterative closest point.

The closed surfaces of the scar and the mapped anatomies are converted to structures in a structure set for the cardiac MR/CT. Functions for conversions between structures and surface models are included in the tool. In addition, an interface to export the 3D images and structure set as DICOM RT files is built. DICOM RT is the standard protocol for radiation therapy to use and transfer patient data. Subsequently, a TPS reads the files and integrates the EP structures for delineating a transmural target volume for irradiation.

### Explainable machine learning to predict anchored reentry substrate created by persistent atrial fibrillation ablation in computational models [^1113kJim]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Extraction ofTissue Regions Spatial Features

Spatial features were extracted for all nonconductive tissue regions larger than 1 mm² in area. Nonconductive tissues were defined as pulmonary vein ostia, mitral valve annuli, or ablation‐derived scar. These nonconductive tissue clusters were designated as independent entities unless they shared a common edge with a neighboring scar, vein, or valve, in which case the 2 entities were combined into 1 cluster.

The area of each nonconductive tissue cluster was defined as the surface area of all ablation‐induced scar and vein/valve tissue in that cluster. To account for the arbitrary nature of pulmonary vein segmentation, in which some veins are truncated further down the ostium than others, we eliminated the pulmonary vein ostia altogether and replaced it with a flat cap (Figure S3) for spatial feature calculations. Perimeter was determined by adding up the lengths of the outer edges of each nonconductive tissue cluster. The extent of fibrosis surrounding each nonconductive cluster was determined by iteratively adding layers of finite elements (average edge length: 188 μm) at the periphery; 50 iterations of region growing resulted in a ~1 cm‐wide neighborhood. Within this periphery, we calculated the percentage of total excitable tissue that was fibrotic (ie, nonconductive tissue was not factored into the calculation). We used a similar approach to compute proximity index, defined as the number of element layers added to each cluster before encountering a distinct nonconductive region. We opted for this approach because it was more computationally efficient than calculating geodesic distance.

### Ablation of atrial fibrillation with the epicor system: a prospective observational trial to evaluate safety and efficacy and predictors of success [^114gPXGw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly sustained cardiac rhythm disorder. An estimated 4.5 million people in the European Union and 2.2 million people in North America suffer from paroxysmal or persistent AF. All types of AF are associated with a varying increased risk of stroke and heart failure, and the overall mortality rate is doubled as compared to people with normal sinus rhythm.

In cardiac surgery, the percentage of patients with concomitant AF is increasing because AF is linked to structural heart disease and the number of patients with markedly advanced heart disease is growing. AF has also been identified as an important risk factor for both mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery. Recent studies have shown that 10-year survival of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery without conversion of atrial fibrillation into sinus rhythm is reduced by 24%.

Surgical treatment of AF began in 1987 with the Maze procedure developed by Cox. Although the procedure resulted in freedom from AF in 80% to 95% of patients after 15 years of follow-up, it was never widely accepted because of its complexity and invasiveness. Instead, less extensive alternative treatment modalities utilizing different energy sources for epi- or endocardial application, such as radiofrequency, laser, microwave and cryotherapy, were devised to avoid the cut-and-sew technique and to simplify surgery by creating a so-called box lesion or pulmonary vein isolation. Clinical studies analyzing success rates of devices using these energy sources detect success rates ranging from 65% to 90%, depending on the energy source as well as patient characteristics and follow up. A particular problem of these new ablation techniques is to create transmural lesions. Transmurality is considered essential but virtually impossible to control. Accordingly, an exaggerated use of endocardial radiofrequency application has lead to damage at surrounding structures, especially to esophageal injuries. Epicardial employment of high energy involves problems with regard to the heat sink effect and energy propagation through epicardial fat, and thus may also damage surrounding structures. In contrast, AF ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) creates transmural lesions without the need of large thermal gradients and without jeopardizing adjacent structures (Figure 1).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of left atrial HIFU ablation of AF with the Epicor Cardiac Ablation System (St. Jude Medical, Maple Grove, MN) as concomitant procedure during open heart surgery and to assess predictors of success.

### Effect of sequential, colocalized radiofrequency and pulsed field ablation on cardiac lesion size and histology [^113GXEKS]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulsed field (PF) ablation is a new technology that creates nonthermal lesions in cardiac tissue. It promises to offer ablation that is both preferential for cardiac tissue and faster to deliver compared with traditional thermal ablation. – However, many current PF systems create lesions with limited lesion depth of about 3 to 4 mm. This may be inadequate for thicker tissues in both the atria and ventricles. Radiofrequency ablation also creates lesions of similar depth. Because both PF and radiofrequency can change the electrical and thermal conductance of tissue, it is possible that combining the 2 energy sources in the same location could provide additive lesion depths.

Furthermore, many generator-catheter combinations in development will be capable of toggling between radiofrequency and PF energy delivery. Given the dual-mode nature of these tools, it is likely that operators may deliver 1 energy source but then coapply another source to electrically isolate tissue or structures that do not isolate with 1 energy alone. It is, therefore, important to understand the biological consequences of coapplication of PF with radiofrequency in either order.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of combined and colocalized PF and radiofrequency application on cardiac lesion size and their corresponding histological changes in a preclinical, animal model.

9.5.3. Mapping and Ablation Strategy

Mapping and ablation strategies are determined by the type of VT and substrate. After MI, a minority of patients have only mappable VTs (hemodynamically tolerated, reproducibly inducible, with stable morphology) that allow for extended activation and entrainment mapping. Hence, for most patients, additional mapping methods need to be employed in conjunction with entrainment mapping to identify critical components of the reentry circuit. Although there is no single gold standard approach, a reasonable workflow is presented in Figure 9.

Voltage mapping facilitated by 3D EAM systems (Section 8) is considered the standard for invasive identification of scar tissue during sinus rhythm and has been validated by histology in postinfarct animal models. For electroanatomically confluent and dense scars typical of nonreperfused infarcts, VT-related sites are often but not exclusively located in low-voltage areas. To provide additional guidance in identifying putative isthmus sites in low-voltage areas, especially for unmappable VTs, several additional strategies have been suggested focusing on electrogram characteristics (split, late, fractionated potentials) and pace mapping. Mapping within regions of low voltage while pacing with extrastimuli at sites remote from low-voltage regions has also been demonstrated to be useful for exposing abnormal conduction regions that can be critical for VT.

Various RF lesion delivery strategies have been described, ranging from focal ablations guided by entrainment mapping to ablation of the entire scar. Suggested strategies include short linear lesions from the putative VT exit sites toward the center of the substrate, across the presumed critical isthmus and/or along the scar border zone. However, the endpoint for these short linear lesions is often arbitrary. Circumferential isolation of the identified scar (bipolar voltage < 1.5 mV) or the "core" containing potential VT isthmus elements (regions with bipolar voltage < 0.5–1 mV and potentially important sites identified by entrainment, activation, and pace mapping), confirmed by demonstrating exit block from the core, has been suggested as an incrementally useful ablation endpoint beyond VT noninducibility. Other methods incorporate the goal of demonstrating functional entrance block into regions of scar tissue, as demonstrated by the elimination of all previously identified LPs or local abnormal ventricular activities, either by targeting channels of conduction or by direct ablation at all abnormal sites (,–). These approaches often involve more comprehensive substrate modification than the initial strategy of transecting potential circuits with linear lesion sets.

Postinfarction ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation — key points state that in cases of multiple inducible VTs, the clinical VT should be preferentially targeted, and elimination of all inducible VTs reduces VT recurrence and is associated with prolonged arrhythmia-free survival; for tolerated VTs, entrainment mapping allows for focal ablation of the critical isthmus, while for nontolerated VTs, various strategies include targeting abnormal potentials, matching pace mapping sites, areas of slow conduction, linear lesions, and scar homogenization; imaging can be beneficial in identifying the arrhythmogenic substrate; epicardial ablation is infrequently required, but epicardial substrate is an important reason for VT recurrence after VT ablation in patients with prior infarcts.

### Body mass index as a determinant of scar formation post-AF ablation: insights from DECAAF II [^112AmTm5]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This subanalysis of the DECAAF II trial patients led to several important findings regarding the association between BMI and ablation‐induced scar formation in our PeAF cohort. First, we confirmed the importance of ablation scar formation to ablation success in PeAF patients. Second, BMI is a significant negative predictor of ablation‐induced scar formation both in the PVI arm and the fibrosis‐guided ablation arm regardless of ablation parameters such as contact force, power, number of ablation points, and impedance drop. Third, BMI affected substrate modification, as demonstrated by covered fibrosis and residual fibrosis, in the fibrosis‐guided arm. Fourth, BMI was associated with increased LA volume at baseline and 3 months postablation. Finally, even though a higher BMI impacts scar tissue formation and obese patients had more comorbidities, obesity was not associated with a higher rate of the procedure's failure, as judged by recurrence of AF.

Ventricular arrhythmia ablation continues to have suboptimal long-term success rates, partly related to limitations of currently used ablative energies, which is typically radiofrequency current. – Creating deep lesions for intramural targets, ablating mobile intracavitary structures, and penetrating scarred myocardium are instances where radiofrequency current is known to be challenging or even ineffective. – Several approaches have been developed to overcome this, such as the use of long-duration, half-normal saline irrigation, and bipolar approaches to radiofrequency ablation, in addition to using other energy sources such as cryoablation, radioablation, and alcohol ablation. –

Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has recently been recognized for its potential to improve both the efficacy and safety of atrial ablation procedures. – Its nonthermal basis of ablation, reduced reliance on prolonged high-quality contact, and short delivery times also make it relevant for ventricular ablation, and early preclinical studies have been promising. – However, PFA's ability to make deeper and larger lesions than radiofrequency current, as well as creating adequate lesions on mobile intracavitary structures such as the papillary muscles (PMs) and moderator band has yet to be determined. – This preclinical report specifically explores the ability of PFA to target mobile intracavitary structures and details the efficacy and safety of several strategies to maximize ventricular ablation using pulsed fields via a large catheter tip form factor that favors stability.

### 2019 APHRS expert consensus statement on three-dimensional mapping systems for tachycardia developed in collaboration with HRS, EHRA, and LAHRS [^115ZjReH]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2020). High credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) activation mapping — mapping goals and interpretation emphasize tailoring to arrhythmia mechanism and rigorous electrogram analysis. In most cases, cardiac arrhythmias are mapped with the goal of designing an ablation strategy, with focal arrhythmias typically requiring only focal activation mapping surrounding the site of earliest activation while reentrant arrhythmias require individualized strategy to the putative anatomic/functional substrate. Interpretation requires careful identification of activation sequence and annotation of fragmented signals and double potentials; when double potentials are observed, annotating them as a site of block and assigning activation times on either side to the potential contiguous with surrounding tissue timing is a useful strategy. Activation mapping can be augmented with functional testing such as entrainment mapping to distinguish passive from critical portions of activation or pacing to identify the presence of unexcitable scar.

### Can fat deposition after myocardial infarction alter the performance of RF catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia? results from a computer modeling study [^114WUwAA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The outcomes of catheter ablation of scar-mediated ventricular tachycardia (VT) remain far from perfect. The presence of fat as a component of the underlying substrate for scar-mediated VT could be relevant since this entity can seriously impede the passage of RF current due to its low electrical conductivity.

Methods and Results

Computer models of RF ablation were built in order to investigate the means by which the spatial heterogeneity of different tissues represented within the ventricular infarct zone, including the viable myocardium, fibrous tissue, and fat, could influence temperature distributions during RF ablation. The results demonstrated that spatial distributions of different tissue types significantly alter the density of electrical current largely as a result of fat impeding the passage of current. However, the thermal lesions appear minimally unaffected by this phenomenon, with variations in depth of ∼1 mm.

Conclusion

While during RF ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia differences in tissue characteristics may affect the density of electrical current on a small-scale, overall this does not appear to significantly impact the size of the created thermal lesions.

### Catheter ablation for the management of atrial fibrillation: current technical perspectives [^114nMFuf]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Catheter technology and energy sources

To date, a variety of energy modalities have been employed for the catheter ablation of AF including radiofrequency (RF), cryoablation (CB), microwave, high-intensity focused ultrasound and electroporation. Notably, the two most commonly used sources in clinical practice are RF and CB.

RF energy is generated at a frequency of 500–1000 KHz and transmitted between the catheter tip and an electrode patch positioned on the skin. The maximum amount of resistive energy occurs within approximately 2 mm of the catheter tip and is either transmitted to the endocardial surface of the heart or the blood. The majority of lesion formation occurs as a result of conductive heat, which is inversely proportional to the distance from the tip of the electrode. CB on the other hand involves three phases of tissue damage. The first occurs during delivery of CB and is known as the freezing–thawing phase. As the temperature drops below −15°C, microscopic extracellular ice formation occurs, followed by intracellular ice formation when the temperature drops below −40°C and results in localised tissue damage. As thawing occurs, there is fusion of the ice crystals with mircothrombi and platelet aggregation. Subsequently, the hemorrhagic-inflammatory phase occurs with localised tissue inflammation and oedema and finally, the replacement-fibrosis phase takes place and a fibrotic scar develops.

When compared with RF energy, patients randomised to either CB or RF groups had similar success rates and safety outcomes at 1.5 years follow-up. The results of the large multicentre Cryobaloon or Radiofrequency Ablation for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (FIRE AND ICE) trial, therefore, validate the use of CB as an alternative to conventional RF ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. While the results of this trial may have been limited by the combined use of both first-generation non-contact force and second-generation contact force (CF) catheters, freedom from AF was still observed in 64.1% of subjects undergoing RF ablation and 65.4% of those undergoing CB. Additional 30 months freedom from AF data supported the non-inferiority of CB to RF ablation. It is important to note that cryoballoon ablation has been associated with significantly higher radiation doses due to the need for PV angiography to confirm complete PV occlusion and ensure optimal tissue freezing. Nonetheless, more than 35 000 CB-based ablations have been performed worldwide to date.

### Electrical homogenization of ventricular scar by application of collagenase: a novel strategy for arrhythmia therapy [^111mLJxf]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Radiofrequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia is an established therapy. Use of chemical agents for scar homogenization represents an alternative approach. The purpose of this study was to characterize the efficacy of collagenase (CLG) application on epicardial ventricular scar homogenization.

Methods and Results

Myocardial infarcts were created in Yorkshire pigs (n = 6) by intracoronary microsphere injection. After 46.6 ± 4.3 days, CLG type 2, type 4, and purified CLG were applied in vitro (n = 1) to myocardial tissue blocks containing normal myocardium, border zone, and dense scar. Histopathologic studies were performed to identify the optimal CLG subtype. In vivo high-density electroanatomic mapping of the epicardium was also performed, and border zone and dense scar surface area and late potentials were quantified before and after CLG-4 application (n = 5). Of the CLG subtypes tested in vitro, CLG-4 provided the best scar modification and least damage to normal myocardium. During in vivo testing, CLG-4 application decreased border zone area (21.3 ± 14.3 to 17.1 ± 11.1 mm², P = 0.043) and increased dense scar area (9.1 ± 10.3 to 22.0 ± 20.6 mm², P = 0.043). The total scar area before and after CLG application was 30.4 ± 23.4 and 39.2 ± 29.5 mm², respectively (P = 0.08). Late potentials were reduced by CLG-4 application (28.8 ± 21.8 to 13.8 ± 13.1, P = 0.043). During CLG-4 application (50.0 ± 15.5 minutes), systolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significantly changed (68.0 ± 7.7 versus 61.8 ± 5.3 mmHg, P = 0.08; 77.4 ± 7.3 versus 78.8 ± 6.0 beats per minute, P = 0.50, respectively).

Conclusions

Ventricular epicardial scar homogenization by CLG-4 application is feasible and effective. This represents the first report on bioenzymatic ablation of arrhythmogenic tissue as an alternative strategy for lesion formation.

Ventricular tachycardia catheter ablation — knowledge gaps and research recommendations — unknowns remain about optimal energy delivery and potential undertreatment in women, as it is unknown if female patients with smaller hearts should receive less RF energy to avoid complications or on the contrary, undertreatment of female patients during catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular arrhythmias leads to incomplete substrate modification and higher VT recurrence rates. Study design guidance specifies that sufficient number of (or only) female patients should be included in RCTs of catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias associated with structural (especially coronary artery) disease to ensure adequate statistical power for analysis; comparing sex ratio in screening and inclusion of all eligible patients should highlight if inclusion or referral bias is present; sex differences in target sites and effective ablation characteristics; in the case of scar-related arrhythmias in substrate characteristics should be investigated in single and multicentre registries; and in case of VT recurrence, recurrence of the same clinical VT vs. appearance of new VT(s) may be investigated to identify undertreatment during the initial procedure.

### A tool to integrate electrophysiological mapping for cardiac radioablation of ventricular tachycardia [^1154YQTk]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the United States.VT often arises from local structural damage in the ventricular muscle resulting from myocardial infraction or other heart diseases. The scar creates a reentry circuit or self-activated myocardial abnormality, leading to cardiac arrhythmia. Scar related ventricular arrhythmia can be challenging to treat and may persist despite pharmacologic and catheter-based therapy. Cardiac radioablation (CR), also referred as cardiac stereotactic body radiation therapy, is a novel emerging treatment option for VT. A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the treatment in reducing VT burden in patients refractory to drugs and standard catheter ablation, and in patients with advanced heart failure.

CR delivers ablative radiation dose precisely to the arrhythmogenic scar while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue. Stereotactic body radiation therapy planning is performed on target volumes and organs at risk contoured on 3-dimensional (3D) simulation computed tomography (CT). The location within what may be extensive myocardial scar is often most precisely determined during a catheter-based procedure in which the local electrical properties of the myocardium are registered in 3D space to create an electroanatomic mapping (EAM). Patients referred for CR typically have ventricular arrhythmia refractory to catheter ablation, and thus the EAM can provide critical information for determination of CR target volume. However, integration of surface-based electrophysiology (EP) data poses a technical barrier for enabling a modern radiation treatment planning system (TPS) to use the information.

A current clinically used solution to integrate EAM is limited to side-by-side visual comparison of 3D simulation images with the surface mapping. Recently, Brett et al implemented a workflow that converted the maps into binary volumes and fused the volumes with simulation CT using anatomic landmarks. Hohmann et al developed a plugin module on the open-source software, 3D Slicer, to read and use EAM obtained on 3 commonly used mapping systems. Both studies were performed for specific EAM data and required physicians to outline the scars on 2-dimensional image slices based on the landmarks defined on the EAM surfaces. To improve the workflow, we incorporated the 2 methods and developed a software tool, named as HeaRTmap, a 3D Slicer module that enables integration of EP information for CR treatment planning with minimal user operations. The tool assembled a number of functionalities in 3D Slicer into a comprehensive solution to facilitate clinical implementation of the emerging treatment.

9.1.5. Simultaneous Unipolar or Simultaneous Bipolar Radiofrequency Delivery

Conventional unipolar RF catheter ablation delivers current between the catheter tip and a dispersive skin electrode. Two catheters placed on either side of the target tissue, delivering simultaneous unipolar RF energy (using two RF generators), have been employed to reach deeper myocardial substrates, which could create larger lesions than sequential ablations at each of these sites by raising the temperature of tissue deep to either ablation site, limiting its heat sink effect, and increasing the conductive heating zone. This method provides independent control and monitoring of RF delivery from each ablating catheter but can pose technical challenges with device interactions. The efficacy and risks of this procedure have not been completely characterized.

Bipolar ablation is performed by replacing the dispersive skin electrode with a second catheter that is closely apposed to tissue with culprit substrate between the catheters. This technique concentrates current density between the catheters. Lesion creation extends from both catheters, and lesions are larger and more likely to be confluent than those achieved with sequential unipolar energy delivery. The efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in both preclinical models and in humans. Bipolar ablation can be delivered between catheters that are positioned across the interventricular septum from one another, on either side of a papillary muscle, or with catheters in the endocardial and epicardial spaces. Bipolar ablation is limited by the requirement for custom cabling and the technical challenges of visualizing and placing two catheters sufficiently close with target tissue between them. The catheter tip temperature cannot be monitored simultaneously for both catheters, and impedance will be influenced by both tip-tissue interfaces. Optimal power and current settings have not yet been defined, and the risk of coagulation has not yet been fully characterized. An investigational system is under evaluation.

9.1.6. Needle Ablation

Infusion needle ablation has been reported as a means to achieve intramural ablation lesions. A catheter with an extendable/retractable needle at the tip can function as an intramural electrode for the temperature-controlled delivery of RF energy, which can create large, deep lesions during saline irrigation. This approach has been demonstrated to be effective for select patients with treatment-refractory VA in small series. The efficacy and procedural risks of this technique have not been fully characterized. Investigational systems are under evaluation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^112vS9nd]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiological basis of AF ablation — targets and strategies — indicates that development of atrial fibrillation (AF) requires both a trigger and a susceptible substrate, with progression over time from a trigger-driven to a substrate-mediated arrhythmia due to atrial remodeling. The most commonly employed ablation strategy consists of electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) by creation of circumferential lesions, with lesion effects attributed to isolation of PV foci, elimination of non-PV triggers, and modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate; substrate modification targets patient-specific sources in the right atrium (RA) and left atrium (LA). AF recurrences after an initially successful procedure are typically associated with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) reconnection, and a more recent strategy involves mapping and ablation of rotational activity.

### Catheter ablation of ventricular epicardial tissue: a comparison of standard and cooled-tip radiofrequency energy [^1145DLMd]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Transthoracic epicardial catheter ablation is an emerging catheter ablation strategy being used clinically at increasing frequency. However, the efficacy of standard RF ablation on the epicardial surface of the heart is hindered by (1) the lack of convective cooling of the ablation electrode and (2) the varying presence of epicardial adipose tissue interposed between the ablation electrode and the target site. This experimental animal study examines the biophysical characteristics of radiofrequency (RF) ablation lesions generated by either standard or cooled-tip ablation of the ventricular epicardium.

Methods and Results

Nonsurgical subxyphoid pericardial access was achieved in 10 normal goats and 7 pigs with healed myocardial infarctions. A 4-mm cooled-tip RF ablation catheter (continuous 0.9% saline circulation at 0.6 mL/s; goal temperature, 40 degrees C; 60 seconds) was used to deliver epicardial ventricular lesions: 47 in normal tissue and 22 in infarcted tissue. Standard RF ablation lesions (n = 33) using a 4-mm top catheter (goal temperature, 70 degrees C; 60 seconds) were also placed on normal epicardial tissue. Lesions created with standard and cooled-tip RF ablation were 3.7 ± 1.3 mm (25 ± 16.8 W) and 6.7 ± 1.7 mm (44.8 ± 6.8 W) in depth, respectively. On scar tissue, lesions made with the cooled-tip catheter measured 14.6 ± 2.7 mm in length, 11.8 ± 2.9 mm in width, and 5.6 ± 1.2 mm in depth (35.6 ± 7.1 W). In areas covered by epicardial fat (3.1 ± 1.2 mm thick), standard RF energy did not generate any appreciable lesions, but cooled-tip RF lesions were 4.1 ± 2 mm in depth (45 ± 4.4 W).

Conclusions

Cooled-tip RF ablation can generate epicardial lesions more effectively than standard RF ablation and appears to be of particular benefit in ablating areas with overlying epicardial fat.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of atrial fibrosis and ablation lesions — capabilities and current limitations: MRI using gadolinium "delayed enhancement" visualizes myocardial fibrosis and inflammation, is "well validated to visualize myocardial scars in the left ventricular myocardium", and "can also visualize lesions induced by radio frequency catheter ablation in atrial tissue". Single‑center work shows "the extent of LA fibrosis prior to ablation can predict the outcomes of catheter ablation of AF", but "further work is needed" to establish reproducibility and predictive accuracy across centers. Although "efforts are now underway to allow catheter ablation of AF to be performed under MRI guidance", technical factors "make it difficult to adapt these techniques for clinical use today".

### Acute and long-term scar characterization of venous ethanol ablation in the left ventricular summit [^111kPPKv]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous ethanol ablation (VEA) can be effective for ventricular arrhythmias from the left ventricular summit (LVS); however, there are concerns about excessive ablation by VEA.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to delineate and quantify the location, extent, and evolution of ablated tissue after VEA as an intramural ablation technique in the LVS.

Methods

VEA was performed in 59 patients with LVS ventricular arrhythmias. Targeted intramural veins were selected by electrograms from a 2F octapolar catheter or by guide-wire unipolar signals. Median ethanol delivered was 4 mL (IQR: 4–7 mL). Ablated areas were estimated intraprocedurally as increased echogenicity on intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and incorporated into 3-dimensional maps. In 44 patients, late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaged VEA scar and its evolution.

Results

ICE-demonstrated increased intramural echogenicity (median volume of 2 mL; IQR: 1.7–4.3) at the targeted region of the 3-dimensional maps. Post-ethanol CMR showed intramural scar of 2.5 mL (IQR: 2.1–3.5 mL). Early (within 48 hours after VEA) CMR showed microvascular obstruction (MVO) in 30 of 31 patients. Follow-up CMR after a median of 51 (IQR: 41–170) days showed evolution of MVO to scar. ICE echogenicity and CMR scar volumes correlated with each other and with ethanol volume. Ventricular function and interventricular septum remained intact.

Conclusions

VEA leads to intramural ablation that can be tracked intraprocedurally by ICE and creates regions of MVO that are chronically replaced by myocardial scar. VEA scar volume does not compromise septal integrity or ventricular function.

### Magnetic resonance mapping of catheter ablation lesions after post-infarction ventricular tachycardia ablation [^111cGQY4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to describe cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) characteristics of ablation lesions within post-infarction scar.

Background

Chronic ablation lesions created during radiofrequency ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of prior myocardial infarction have not been described in humans.

Methods

Seventeen patients (15 men, ejection fraction 25 ± 8%, 66 ± 6 years of age) with CMR imaging prior to repeat ablation procedures for VT were studied. Electroanatomic maps from first-time procedures and subsequent CMR images were merged and retrospectively compared with electroanatomic maps from repeat procedures.

Results

The delay between the index ablation procedure and the CMR study was 30 ± 29 months. Late gadolinium-enhanced CMR revealed a confluent nonenhancing subendocardial dark core within the infarct-related scar tissue in all patients. Intracardiac thrombi were ruled out by transthoracic and intracardiac echocardiography. These core lesions matched the distribution of prior ablation lesions, and corresponded to unexcitable areas at repeat procedures.

Conclusions

Ablation lesions can be detected by CMR after VT ablation in post-infarction patients and have a different appearance than scar tissue. These lesions can be observed many months after an initial ablation.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115iqrgP]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) — For most patients with structural heart disease, sustained monomorphic VT is due to reentry through regions of surviving myocardial fibers associated with areas of fibrous scar; ablation strategy is to identify and eliminate channels of surviving myocardium within scar associated with slow conduction facilitating reentry, with prior myocardial infarction (MI) substrates on the subendocardial surface of the left ventricle and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) circuits more variable, often epicardial and extending into midmyocardium; electroanatomical mapping is commonly employed, scars are appreciated as regions of relatively low electrogram voltage, mapping during VT is often limited by hemodynamic intolerance and ablation is then often guided by substrate mapping during hemodynamically stable rhythm, and catheter ablation requires advanced operator and laboratory experience with surgical back-up and specialized equipment available.

### Effects of electrode-tissue proximity on cardiac lesion formation using pulsed field ablation [^1158pCtx]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Thermal-based catheter ablation systems (eg, radiofrequency and cryoablation) are the cornerstone treatment modalities for patients with antiarrhythmic drug resistant, symptomatic paroxysmal, and persistent atrial fibrillation. Standard catheter ablation technologies depend upon electrode-tissue contact to optimize lesion delivery and clinical outcomes. Lack of contact with the tissue during ablation may lead to ineffective lesion formation using thermal technologies, although an important balance is often necessary to prioritize safety and avoid excessive energy delivery. Therefore, operators rely on multiple surrogate indicators of stable and safe catheter-tissue placement including the additional use of tactile feedback, contact force measurements, impedance and electrode temperature measurements, and identification of catheter location by imaging. –

Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is an emerging energy modality for catheter-based treatment of cardiac arrhythmias currently in clinical development. – PFA employs a nonthermal ablative mechanism of action called irreversible electroporation, in which application of high voltage electric pulses induces transient permeabilization of cell membranes which (subsequently) leads to cell death. – This mechanism is linked with potential clinical benefits, including avoiding/reducing the probability of forming atrioesophageal fistula and reduction in pulmonary vein stenosis. Additionally, existing preclinical work indicated that the heavily trabeculated appendages can be ablated in a durable, transmural manner with a circular PFA catheter. Nevertheless, the impact of electrode-tissue proximity on cardiac lesion formation with a biphasic, bipolar PFA system has not been conclusively assessed.

In our study, we hypothesize that direct electrode-tissue contact is not required to create effective cardiac lesions with PFA, due to irreversible electroporation dependence on the electric field distribution. We aimed to identify the impact of electrode-tissue proximity on lesion creation in an isolated porcine heart model using a prototype catheter and replicated these results with numerical modeling.

### Value of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with failed ablation procedures for ventricular tachycardia [^115kFSgy]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with cardiomyopathy originates in scar tissue. Intramural or epicardial scar may result in ineffective ablation if mapping and ablation are limited to the endocardium. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preprocedural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is beneficial in patients with failed endocardial VT ablations in determining an appropriate ablation strategy.

Methods and Results

A cardiac MRI was performed in 20 patients with a failed ablation procedure and cardiomyopathy (nonischemic n = 12, ischemic n = 8). A subsequent ablation strategy was determined by a delayed enhanced MRI (DE-MRI) and an epicardial subxyphoid access was planned only in patients with epicardial or intramural free-wall scar. MRIs were performed in all patients with or without an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The location of scar tissue in the MRI predicted the origin of VT in all patients. In 9/20 patients an epicardial procedure was performed based on the result of the MRI. An endocardial procedure was performed in the remaining 11 patients who had either endocardial or septal scarring and one patient in whom the MRI only showed artifact. Five patients remained inducible postablation and four patients had VT recurrence within a follow-up period of 17 ± 22 months. All of the latter patients had an intramural scar pattern.

Conclusions

Imaging with DE-MRI prior to VT ablation in patients with previously failed endocardial ablation procedures is beneficial in identifying an ablation strategy, helps to focus on an area of interest intraprocedurally, and provides valuable outcomes information.

### Catheter-free ablation of infarct scar through proton beam therapy: tissue effects in a porcine model [^1151pDWq]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Scar-related ventricular arrhythmias are common after myocardial infarction. Catheter ablation can improve prognosis, but the procedure is invasive and results are not always satisfactory. Noninvasive, catheter-free ablation using ionizing radiation has recently gained interest among electrophysiologists, but the tissue effects and physiological outcome have not been fully characterized.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the structural effects of cardiac scanned pencil beam proton therapy on infarct scar, the time course of imaging biomarkers, arrhythmias, and cardiac function in a porcine model.

Methods

Fourteen infarcted swine underwent proton beam treatment of the scar (40 or 30 Gy) and were followed for up to 30 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed every 4 weeks.

Results

Treated scar areas showed a significantly lower fraction of surviving myocytes at 30 weeks compared to untreated scar (30.1% ± 18.5% and 59.9% ± 10.1% in treated and untreated infarct, respectively), indicating scar homogenization. Four animals died suddenly during follow-up, all from documented monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac function remained stable over the course of the study. Distinct imaging morphologies corresponded to certain tissue dose ranges and time points.

Conclusion

Radioablation of cardiac infarct scar leads to significant homogenization of the scar, replicating the histologic effects of radiofrequency ablation. These changes correspond to distinct imaging morphologies on delayed contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, enabling noninvasive confirmation of tissue ablation effects The present study is the first to thoroughly investigate the structural effects of cardiac proton beam therapy in infarcted myocardium.

Cardiac sarcoidosis — key points for ablation planning indicate that the arrhythmogenic substrate in cardiac sarcoidosis is often intramurally located but can include the endocardium and epicardium; a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is beneficial in planning an ablation procedure in cardiac sarcoidosis; the arrhythmogenic substrate can be complex and can include areas of active inflammation and chronic scarring; and the ventricular tachycardia (VT) recurrence rate after ablation is high.

### Regeneration in humansen.wikipedia.org › wiki › regeneration_in_humans… [^116rgez2]. Wikipedia (2014). Low credibility.

History of human tissue In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue naturally regenerates over time; by default, new available cells replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within ten years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks. With injured tissue, the body usually has a different response. This emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. In full thickness wounds that are under 2mm, regeneration generally occurs before scarring. In 2008, in full thickness wounds over 3mm, it was found that a wound needed a material inserted in order to induce full tissue regeneration.

Whereas 3rd degree burns heal slowly by scarring, in 2016 it was known that full thickness fractional photothermolysis holes heal without scarring. Up to 40% of full thickness skin can be removed without scarring in an area, in a fractional pattern via coring of tissue. By instrument A cut by a knife or a scalpel generally scars, though a piercing by a needle does not. In 1976, a 3 by 3 cm scar on a non-diabetic was regenerated by insulin injections and the researchers, highlighting earlier research, argued that the insulin was regenerating the tissue. The anecdotal evidence also highlighted that a syringe was one of two variables that helped bring regeneration of the arm scar. The syringe was injected into the four quadrants three times a day for eighty-two days. After eighty-two days, after many consecutive injections, the scar was resolved and it was noted no scar was observable by the human eye.

After seven months the area was checked again and it was once again noted that no scar could be seen. In 1997, it was proven that wounds created with an instrument that are under 2mm can heal scar free, but larger wounds that are larger than 2mm healed with a scar. In 2013, it was proven in pig tissue that full thickness micro columns of tissue, less than 0. 5mm in diameter could be removed and that the replacement tissue, was regenerative tissue, not scar. The tissue was removed in a fractional pattern, with over 40% of a square area removed; and all of the fractional full thickness holes in the square area healed without scarring. In 2016 this fractional pattern technique was also proven in human tissue. In 2021, more people were paying attention to the possibility of scar free healing alongside new technologies involving instruments. With materials Generally, humans can regenerate injured tissues in vivo for limited distances of up to 2mm.

The further the wound distance is from 2mm the more the wound regeneration will need inducement. By 2009, via the use of materials, a max induced regeneration could be achieved inside a 1 cm tissue rupture. Bridging the wound, the material allowed cells to cross the wound gap; the material then degraded. This technology was first used inside a broken urethra in 1996. In 2012, using materials, a full urethra was restored in vivo. A syringe injected insulin under the skin equally in the four quadrants of the defect. To layer four units of insulin evenly into the base of the defect, each quadrant of the defect received one unit of insulin three times a day, for eighty-two days. After eighty-two days of consecutive injections the defect regenerated to normal tissue. Naturally regenerating appendages and organs Cardiomyocyte necrosis activates an inflammatory response that serves to clear the injured myocardium from dead cells, and stimulates repair, but may also extend injury.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiologic basis for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation — ablation targets triggers and substrate, with pulmonary vein (PV) isolation via circumferential lesions commonly used; development of AF requires both a trigger and a susceptible substrate; the goals of AF ablation are to prevent AF by eliminating the trigger that initiates AF or by altering the arrhythmogenic substrate; the most commonly employed strategy involves electrical isolation of the PVs by creation of circumferential lesions around the right and left PVs, which probably impacts both the trigger and substrate of AF.

Substrate mapping in sinus rhythm — scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation is guided as follows: In patients with scar-related VT, substrate-guided ablation is useful for prevention of arrhythmic recurrences. High-density multielectrode mapping to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of the arrhythmogenic tissue during catheter ablation of scar-related VT can be useful. In patients with no or minimal endocardial bipolar electrogram abnormalities, reduced unipolar voltage can be useful for detection of epicardial or intramural scar.

### Differences in postablation cardiac MRI scar between radiofrequency and cryoballoon ablation: a DECAAF II subanalysis [^114T6XoN]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using radiofrequency (RF) and cryoballoon (Cryo) ablation are standard approaches for rhythm control in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Both strategies create scars in the left atrium (LA). There have been few studies investigating the difference in scar formation between patients undergoing RF and Cryo using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.

Methods

The current study is a subanalysis of the control arm of the Delayed-Enhancement MRI Determinant of Successful Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation study (DECAAF II). The study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial that evaluated atrial arrhythmia recurrence (AAR) between PVI alone and PVI plus CMR atrial fibrosis-guided ablation. Preablation CMR and 3- to 6-month postablation CMR were obtained to assess baseline LA fibrosis and scar formation, respectively.

Results

Of the 843 patients randomized in the DECAAF II trial, we analyzed the 408 patients in the primary analysis control arm that received standard PVI. Five patients received combined RF and Cryo ablations, so they were excluded from this subanalysis. Of the 403 patients analyzed, 345 underwent RF and 58 Cryo. The average procedure duration was 146min for RF and 103min for Cryo (p = .001). The rate of AAR at ~15 months occurred in 151 (43.8%) patients in the RF group and 28 (48.3%) patients in the Cryo group (p = .62). On 3-month post-CMR, the RF arm had significantly more scar (8.8% vs. 6.4%, p = .001) compared to Cryo. Patients with ≥ 6.5% LA scar (p < .001) and ≥ 2.3% LA scar around the PV antra (p = .01) on 3-month post-CMR had less AAR independent of the ablation technique. Cryo caused a greater percentage of right and left pulmonary vein (PV) antral scar (p = .04, p = .02) and less non-PV antral scar (p = .009) compared to RF. On Cox regression, Cryo patients free of AAR had a greater percentage of left PV antral scar (p = .01) and less non-PV antral scar (p = .004) compared to RF free of AAR.

Conclusion

In this subanalysis of the control arm of the DECAAF II trial, we observed that Cryo formed a more significant percentage of PV antral scar and less non-PV antral scar compared to RF. Post ablation LA scar ≥ 6.5% predicted freedom from AAR, independent of ablation technique. These findings may have prognostic implications in ablation technique selection and freedom from AAR.

### Characteristics and time course of acute and chronic myocardial lesion formation after electroporation ablation in the porcine model [^117VM7G2]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Electroporation ablation creates deep and wide myocardial lesions. No data are available on time course and characteristics of acute lesion formation.

Methods

For the acute phase of myocardial lesion development, seven pigs were investigated. Single 200J applications were delivered at four different epicardial right ventricular sites using a linear suction device, yielding a total of 28 lesions. Timing of applications was designed to yield lesions at seven time points: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60min, with four lesions per time point. After killing, lesion characteristics were histologically investigated. For the chronic phase of myocardial lesion development, tissue samples were used from previously conducted studies where tissue was obtained at 3 weeks and 3 months after electroporation ablation.

Results

Acute myocardial lesions induce a necrosis pattern with contraction band necrosis and interstitial edema, immediately present after electroporation ablation. No further histological changes such as hemorrhage or influx of inflammatory cells occurred in the first hour. After 3 weeks, the lesions consisted of sharply demarcated loose connective tissue that further developed to more fibrotic scar tissue after 3 months without additional changes. Within the scar tissue, arteries and nerves were unaffected.

Conclusion

Electroporation ablation immediately induces contraction band necrosis and edema without additional tissue changes in the first hour. After 3 weeks, a sharply demarked scar has been developed that remains stable during follow-up of 3 months. This is highly relevant for clinical application of electroporation ablation in terms of the electrophysiological endpoint and waiting period after ablation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) in structural heart disease — sustained monomorphic VT is due to reentry through regions of surviving myocardial fibers within fibrous scar, and ablation targets channels of surviving myocardium within scar that often show slow conduction; in prior myocardial infarction the substrate is typically subendocardial in the left ventricle, whereas in nonischemic cardiomyopathy circuits are more variable, often epicardial and extending into the midmyocardium; electroanatomical mapping is commonly used to identify low-voltage scar regions, mapping during VT can be limited by hemodynamic intolerance, and ablation is often guided by substrate mapping during stable rhythm; catheter ablation requires advanced operator and laboratory expertise and access to surgical back-up and specialized mapping, imaging, and ablation equipment.

### Cardiac pulsed field ablation lesion durability assessed by polarization-sensitive optical coherence reflectometry [^115PYjd7]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The goal of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is to eliminate the triggers for atrial fibrillation by creating transmural lesions, which will result in durable pulmonary vein isolation. Our inability to create continuous and transmural lesions with thermal energy is one reason why the success rates of ablation are still limited to 55% to 70%. – Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is a novel energy that uses electrical fields to cause cardiac cell death. PFA causes a supraphysiological transmembrane voltage gradient in the cardiomyocyte cells that damage voltage-dependent membranes and intracellular proteins, leading to cellular dysfunction and nonthermal cardiac cell death over hours to days. PFA promises a safer procedure because noncardiac tissues have higher thresholds for PFA damage, minimizing adverse events such as esophageal fistula or phrenic nerve palsy.

See Editorial by

However, the typical lesion depth of bipolar PFA systems is limited to 2 to 4 mm 7 due to the distribution of the electric field between the ablation electrodes. Furthermore, monitoring for the disappearance of bipolar signals in tissue is not reliable with PFA because even subtherapeutic pulses cause signal abatement because of cellular stunning. Therefore, assessing for the completion of transmural PFA lesions is challenging, and operators are left with performing an empirical number of applications in hopes that a complete lesion is achieved.

Optical imaging to directly visualize the tissue may help determine the depth and durability of a delivered lesion during ablation using polarization-sensitive optical coherence reflectometry (PS-OCR) based on the birefringence tissue properties. PS-OCR has been shown to predict lesion depth and durability with radiofrequency ablation. – However, it is unknown whether PS-OCR could be useful in monitoring lesion formation with PFA. The purpose of this preclinical trial is to evaluate the ability of PS-OCR to assess for durability of PFA cardiac lesions.

### Heart digital twins predict features of invasive reentrant circuits and ablation lesions in scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia [^113udZb9]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a life-threatening arrhythmia that predisposes patients to sudden cardiac death. Catheter ablation therapy, aimed at destroying myocardial tissue that perpetuates the arrhythmia, offers freedom from VT. – The current gold standard approach for catheter ablation of VT is to induce and map the clinical VT and ablate the critical isthmus of the reentrant circuit. Isthmus sites are characterized by surviving channels of viable myocytes through an area of scar tissue and are complex in their architecture, characterized by variations in conduction velocity, tissue anisotropy, and regions of conduction block, – providing the necessary milieu for reentry to occur. Classical studies have demonstrated the presence of diastolic activity and typical responses to ventricular entrainment during VT at these critical sites, which mark them out as optimal ablation targets if observed, and where termination of VT with ablation is frequently achieved. In clinical practice, this approach is often impossible due to hemodynamic instability. This limitation, in part, explains the suboptimal outcomes and high recurrence rates observed in large VT ablation trials. Furthermore, VT ablation is time consuming and is associated with a significant risk of complications. Therefore, new strategies are required to overcome these limitations and improve outcomes in VT ablation.

### Clinical use of cooled radiofrequency ablation [^1155LLJ1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Irrigated (cooled) radiofrequency (RF) ablation has become our primary ablation tool for treating atrial fibrillation, macroreentrant atrial tachycardias, and scar-related ventricular tachycardias. As with any technology that increases ablation lesion size, there is the potential for increased risk. The methods described are a cautious approach to power titration that considers the risks of excessive heating and the lesion size needed for a particular site. Future methods of assessing lesion creation will hopefully refine energy titration to improve safety and efficacy of cooled RF ablation.

### Transcatheter creation of atrial septal perforation using a radiofrequency transseptal system: novel approach as an alternative to transseptal needle puncture [^112rHEYf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2005). Low credibility.

Indications for the transseptal approach to the left side of the heart have recently broadened, as it provides a therapeutic access for both left-sided catheter ablation and also percutaneous transvenous valvular intervention. Despite rising demand for transseptal procedures, the technique and device used for this purpose have remained essentially unchanged over the past 4 decades. The possibilities of failure of puncturing distorted and thickened atrial septal tissue or risks of complications related to cardiac perforation remain limitations of the technique. A new radiofrequency catheter provides an alternative approach to create a controlled transseptal perforation. We applied this technique to a series of patients and evaluated its feasibility as an alternative to conventional transseptal needle puncture.

### Insurance lesions: does a second lesion make a difference? [^111f1Rt1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In radiofrequency ablation procedures for cardiac arrhythmia, the efficacy of creating repeated lesions at the same location ("insurance lesions") remains poorly studied. We assessed the effect of type of tissue, power, and time on the resulting lesion geometry during such multiple ablation procedures.

Methods

A custom ex vivo ablation model was used to assess lesion formation. An ablation catheter was oriented perpendicular to the tissue and used to create lesions that varied by type of tissue (atrial or ventricular free wall), power (30 or 50W), and time (30, 40, or 50s for standard ablations and 5, 10, or 15s for high-power, short-duration [HPSD] ablations). Lesion dimensions were recorded and then analyzed. Radiofrequency ablations were performed on 57 atrial tissue samples (28 HPSD, 29 standard) and 28 ventricular tissue samples (all standard).

Results

With ablation parameters held constant, performing multiple ablations significantly increased lesion depth in ventricular tissue when ablations were performed at 30W for 50s. No other set of ablation parameters was shown to affect the width or depth of the resulting lesions in either tissue type.

Conclusion

Multiple ablations created with the same power and time, delivered within 30s of each other at the same exact location, offer no meaningful benefit in lesion depth or width over single ablations, with the exception of ventricular ablation at 30W for 50s. Given the risks associated with excessive ablation, our results suggest that this practice should be re-evaluated by clinical electrophysiologists.

### Characteristics of myocardial tissue staining and lesion creation with an infusion-needle ablation catheter for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in humans [^1117ySam]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intramural substrate causing ventricular tachycardia can be targeted by radiofrequency (RF) infusion-needle catheter ablation.

Objective

The purpose of the study was to assess fluid distribution within the myocardium after needle-ablation catheter infusion and its evidence to RF lesion creation.

Methods

In 25 patients (21 (84%) male; 67 ± 9 years; 8 (32%) with ischemic cardiomyopathy) intramural ablation of ventricular tachycardia was performed with a needle catheter. Fluoroscopic images of myocardial staining patterns produced by pre-RF saline/contrast infusion were analyzed. Lesion creation was defined as tissue inexcitability to high-output needle pacing.

Results

Data from 155 sites were eligible for analysis. Tissue staining was evident in 111 (72%) and absent in 44 (28%). The stain shapes were variable, with average dimensions of 20 ± 10 × 8 ± 4 mm with an area of 68 ± 58 mm². Round/oval-shaped stains were most common (62 [56%]), while multisegmented (36 [32%]) and long flat (13 [12%]) configurations were less frequent. Evidence of staining was associated with evidence of lesion creation (92/111 (83%) vs 17/44 (39%); P ≤ .0001). Contrast staining around the needle was present in 50%, usually had blurred margins, and was associated with lesion creation. When staining extended well beyond the needle, the margins were often sharp, suggesting dissection through tissue planes, and lesion creation tended to be less effective.

Conclusion

With infusion-needle ablation, preablation injection of contrast can help confirm an intramural position and predict lesion creation. Tissue diffusion patterns vary markedly, and studies to assess its relation to tissue architecture and ablation lesion geometry warrants further investigation. The findings also have implications for the injection of therapeutic agents into the regions of scar.

### Left atrial functional changes associated with repeated catheter ablations for atrial fibrillation [^112F2pzt]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Catheter ablation, a key intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF), aims to restore sinus rhythm by isolating the pulmonary veins and creating scar tissue to disrupt the abnormal electrical pathways responsible for arrhythmias. While effective, this procedure can inadvertently impact normal cardiac electrical signaling and left atrial (LA) conduit and contractile function due to scar tissue formation and fibrosis. An immediate consequence of catheter ablation is a temporary reduction in LA function, typically followed by a period of restoration. However, the cumulative effects of repeated ablations and the resulting scar formation on LA mechanical function are not well‐understood. Research indicates that scar tissue and fibrosis postablation can significantly impair LA function and reduce its contractile capacity. Given the prevalence of AF recurrence, especially in persistent AF cases, repeated ablations are often necessary to improve outcomes. Despite restoring sinus rhythm, the creation of extensive scar tissue in the LA wall through multiple ablations has shown an inverse relationship with LA function.

The natural history of AF can simultaneously negatively impact LA function with intrinsic scar and fibrosis formation over time that is both dependent and independent of treatment approach. For example, over time, a gradual shift from paroxysmal to chronic AF is observed in more than 50% of patients with high HATCH scores (hypertension, age > 75 years, transient ischemic attack or stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, heart failure), within a decade of diagnosis. Additional factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome further contribute to the progression of AF. As ablation adds "therapeutic" scar to the left atrium, this scar can be a positive if it offsets and is less than the scar related to the natural history of AF and exposure of the atrium to AF.

This study investigates the interplay between disease progression and the effects of catheter ablation on atrial mechanical performance. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed here as a robust tool for evaluating LA volume and function. Notably, feature‐tracking MRI has proven effective in assessing peak longitudinal atrial strain (PLAS), a vital measure of atrial mechanical performance. This study aims to monitor changes in LA function using PLAS analysis in MRI examinations conducted before and after AF ablation procedures. We hypothesize that an increase in number of ablation procedure correlates with a decline in LA mechanical performance. Additionally, this research seeks to compare the impact of catheter ablation with the natural progression of AF, examining patient cases spanning nearly a decade post‐diagnosis.

### Cryoablation… [^1117oV1X]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Cryoablation is a process that uses extreme cold to destroy tissue. Cryoablation is performed using hollow needles through which cooled, thermally conductive fluids are circulated. Cryoprobes are positioned adjacent to the target in such a way that the freezing process will destroy the diseased tissue. Once the probes are in place, the attached cryogenic freezing unit removes heat from the tip of the probe and by extension from the surrounding tissues. Ablation occurs in tissue that has been frozen by at least three mechanisms:

1. formation of ice crystals within cells thereby disrupting membranes, and interrupting cellular metabolism among other processes;
2. coagulation of blood thereby interrupting bloodflow to the tissue in turn causing ischemia and cell death; and 3. induction of apoptosis, the so-called programmed cell death cascade.

The most common application of cryoablation is to ablate solid tumors found in the lung, liver, breast, kidney and prostate. The use in prostate and renal cryoablation are the most common. Although sometimes applied in cryosurgery through laparoscopic or open surgical approaches, most often cryoablation is performed percutaneously by a medical specialist, such as an interventional radiologist. The term is from cryo- + ablation. This offers distinct advantages and disadvantages when compared to other pain management modalities. Unlike chemical neurolysis, cryoanalgesia is non-neurolytic and maintains the nerve's architectural integrity, facilitating regeneration and reducing the risk of deafferentation pain. Compared to radiofrequency ablation, cryoanalgesia often results in a less painful procedure and a lower incidence of neuroma formation.

However, RFA may offer longer-lasting pain relief in some cases. Traditional local anesthetic nerve blocks provide immediate but short-lived relief, whereas cryoanalgesia provides extended pain control without permanent nerve destruction. Cryoanalgesia is indicated for a wide range of chronic pain conditions where a temporary but prolonged nerve block is desired. Common indications include post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, intercostal neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, neuropathic pain following surgery or trauma, phantom limb pain, and pain associated with spasticity. It is also used for managing acute pain in certain surgical procedures, such as rib fractures or sternotomy. Prostate Prostate cryoablation is moderately effective but, as with any prostate removal process, also can result in impotence. Prostate cryoablation is used in three patient categories:

Bone cancer Cryoablation has been explored as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in people with metastatic bone disease. The area of tissue destruction created by this technique can be monitored more effectively by CT than RFA, a potential advantage when treating tumors adjacent to critical structures. In this procedure which has been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, an ultrasound-guided probe is inserted into the fibroadenoma and extremely cold temperatures are then used to destroy the abnormal cells. Over time the cells are reabsorbed into the body. The procedure can be performed in a doctor's office setting with local anesthesia and leaves very little scarring compared to open surgical procedures.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^112fe2tq]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

New surgical ablation technology — energy sources and limitations are contrasted. To simplify and broaden adoption compared with the traditional cut-and-sew Cox-Maze, groups replaced incisions with linear ablation lines created using energy sources including RF energy, cryoablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound, organized into unipolar and bipolar approaches. Unipolar devices do not reliably indicate transmurality, were released clinically without dose–response studies with occasional collateral cardiac and extracardiac damage, and have difficulty creating transmural lesions on the beating heart because the circulating intracavitary blood pool makes transmural lesions difficult to achieve; their fixed depth of penetration may be problematic in pathologically thickened atria. Bipolar RF ablation has been able to overcome some of these shortcomings.

### 2019 APHRS expert consensus statement on three-dimensional mapping systems for tachycardia developed in collaboration with HRS, EHRA, and LAHRS [^114mWxnx]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2020). High credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia — scar-related ischemic and nonischemic etiologies: consensus recommendations state the following. The use of a 3D mapping system is recommended for mapping of scar-related VT to define the low-voltage substrate and annotate abnormal electrograms to reduce procedure duration and radiation exposure for both the patient and the operator (Class I, LOE B-NR). The use of a 3D mapping system is recommended for ablation of scar-related VT to guide, track, and record ablation applications and lesion locations to reduce procedure duration and radiation exposure for both the patient and the operator (Class I, LOE C-LD). In cases of percutaneous epicardial mapping and ablation, the use of 3D mapping system is recommended to reduce radiation exposure during substrate characterization and annotate ablation (Class I, LOE C-LD). The use of multielectrode catheters when using a 3D mapping system for high-density delineation of the substrate to reduce mapping duration and improve resolution can be beneficial (Class IIa, LOE B-NR).
