## Question

What does an elevated total bilirubin mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an elevated total bilirubin means and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and the immediate clinical context. Then, I should verify the bilirubin fractionation into direct and indirect components. Next, I will categorize the pattern into unconjugated, conjugated, or mixed hyperbilirubinemia and map likely etiologies. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic workup, including labs and imaging. Finally, I should consider special populations, red flags, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking thresholds and guideline nuances throughout.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its clinical significance. Total bilirubin is typically reported with an upper limit of normal around 1.0–1.2 mg/dL, and jaundice becomes clinically apparent when total bilirubin exceeds roughly 3 mg/dL, so any elevation warrants attention, especially if symptomatic or persistent [^113LJvTk] [^115Txxj6]. Hold on, I should verify the lab's reference range and whether the result is new or chronic, because interpretation hinges on context and trajectory, and I also need to check for concurrent symptoms like pruritus, dark urine, or pale stools that would push me toward cholestasis or obstruction [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the bilirubin fractions, because the first branch point in interpretation is direct (conjugated) versus indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. Wait, let me verify the lab method, since some assays report "direct" bilirubin that includes delta-bilirubin and can overestimate conjugated bilirubin, particularly at higher total bilirubin levels; when available, specific conjugated bilirubin measurement is preferred, especially in neonates and prolonged jaundice [^114LWwmT]. I need to ensure I calculate the indirect fraction as total minus direct, and I should double-check that the direct fraction is truly elevated before labeling cholestasis [^notfound].

> If the pattern is predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, I will now examine three mechanisms: increased production (hemolysis), decreased uptake, or decreased conjugation. Let me consider hemolysis first by checking CBC, reticulocyte count, LDH, and haptoglobin, and I should confirm there is no anemia or hemolysis on smear before moving on, because hemolysis can raise unconjugated bilirubin and occasionally to high levels if severe or with renal/hepatic comorbidity [^113iG5vj]. If hemolysis is excluded and the indirect bilirubin is mild, I should think about Gilbert syndrome, which affects 3–7% of the population, typically presents with total bilirubin less than 3–6 mg/dL, and can rise with fasting or intercurrent illness; fasting can increase bilirubin in healthy males, so I should repeat testing nonfasting if Gilbert is suspected [^113iG5vj] [^116Zk95X]. But wait, what if the indirect bilirubin is markedly elevated, say above 40 μmol/L (about 2.3 mg/dL)? Then I should reconsider rarer causes like Crigler–Najjar and consider genetic testing for UGT1A1 variants, especially if persistent and unexplained [^112XLmib].

> If the pattern is predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, I need to ensure I am thinking hepatocellular disease versus cholestasis/obstruction. I should confirm that direct bilirubin exceeds about 1.0 mg/dL, because that threshold is considered pathologic in most settings and should prompt evaluation for liver disease or biliary obstruction rather than benign causes [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify accompanying liver chemistries: a disproportionate rise in alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggests cholestasis or obstruction, whereas marked AST/ALT elevations point to hepatocellular injury; if ALP is elevated, I should confirm hepatic origin with GGT and proceed to right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess ducts and liver parenchyma [^1155asMt] [^113BpbEZ]. If ultrasound shows ductal dilation, I should plan MRCP or ERCP, and if no dilation, I should check autoimmune markers and consider infiltrative or drug-induced etiologies, escalating to liver biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear or the course is progressive [^113BpbEZ].

> Mixed hyperbilirubinemia implies both increased production and impaired excretion, so I should double-check for concurrent hemolysis superimposed on hepatobiliary disease, and I should review medications carefully for drug-induced liver injury, which can present with mixed patterns and carries prognostic weight when bilirubin and transaminases are both significantly elevated [^113s1NHW]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a direct fraction greater than 20% of total defines cholestasis, but I should correct that: while older teaching used a 20% cutoff, current pediatric and adult guidance emphasizes an absolute direct bilirubin greater than 1.0 mg/dL as abnormal, and in prolonged neonatal jaundice, relying on a direct-to-total ratio alone is unreliable due to variability; thus, I should prioritize the absolute direct value and clinical context over the ratio [^116ESYnj] [^116saypi].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic workup that applies broadly. Let me first confirm a complete set of liver chemistries including AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, and INR, because bilirubin reflects hepatic excretory function while albumin and INR inform synthetic function and severity; I should also obtain a CBC to assess for anemia or thrombocytopenia, and a basic metabolic panel to contextualize renal function and electrolytes [^113iG5vj] [^115Txxj6]. Next, I should review medications meticulously, including prescription, OTC, and herbal agents, since drug-induced liver injury is common and often overlooked; if DILI is suspected, I should apply causality frameworks and recognize that bilirubin elevation in the setting of hepatocellular injury heightens concern for severe outcomes, including Hy's law scenarios in drug development [^113s1NHW] [^111AfHzz].

> For imaging, I need to ensure I choose the right first test. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is the initial modality of choice to distinguish intrahepatic from extrahepatic processes, evaluate duct caliber, and screen for masses. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic and obstruction remains suspected, MRCP provides high-quality noninvasive cholangiography, reserving ERCP for therapeutic intervention or when MRCP is contraindicated or unavailable [^113BpbEZ] [^115Txxj6]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not overcall stones on ultrasound alone; if clinical suspicion is high and ultrasound is negative, MRCP can improve sensitivity for choledocholithiasis and strictures, guiding definitive management [^notfound].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with neonates and infants. I should confirm that any jaundice persisting beyond 2 weeks in formula-fed infants or 3 weeks in breastfed infants mandates measurement of total and direct bilirubin, because conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic and warrants urgent evaluation for cholestasis. A direct bilirubin greater than 1.0 mg/dL is abnormal and should trigger expedited workup for biliary atresia and other causes [^116ESYnj] [^115AYnqK]. In the first 24 hours of life, any jaundice is abnormal and should prompt immediate total serum bilirubin measurement and evaluation for hemolysis, given the risk of rapid bilirubin rise and neurotoxicity; I should double-check for G6PD deficiency if the course is atypical or severe [^115NLkzy] [^1178qSwQ]. For older infants and children, I need to ensure I consider genetic cholestatic disorders, especially if GGT is unexpectedly normal in the face of cholestasis, which can indicate specific bile acid synthesis defects [^112XLmib].

> In critically ill adults, I should confirm that bilirubin elevation often reflects sepsis-associated cholestasis, ischemic hepatitis, parenteral nutrition, or drug toxicity, and that bilirubin serves as a stable marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor in ICU cohorts. However, I need to check for hemolysis from transfusion, devices, or ECMO, which can confound interpretation, and I should remember that indocyanine green clearance may outperform bilirubin for detecting early excretory dysfunction in hypoxic liver injury [^115JuCqn] [^115FsVzk]. Hold on, I should verify that rising bilirubin in the ICU is not simply cholestasis of critical illness; correlating with GGT, ALP, clinical course, and imaging helps distinguish isolated cholestasis from evolving hepatocellular failure or biliary obstruction [^115JuCqn].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate urgent action. Acute liver failure features such as INR above 1.5 with encephalopathy, rapidly rising bilirubin with coagulopathy, or severe transaminase elevations with jaundice require immediate hepatology consultation and transplant center referral; similarly, suspected extrahepatic obstruction with cholangitis, right upper quadrant pain, or sepsis needs urgent biliary decompression and antibiotics [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ]. But wait, what if the bilirubin rise is driven by a drug? In that case, prompt cessation of the offending agent and close monitoring are essential, and I should apply DILI severity criteria to guide management and prognosis [^113s1NHW].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm the total bilirubin and fractionate into direct and indirect. Second, categorize as unconjugated, conjugated, or mixed. Third, if unconjugated, exclude hemolysis and consider Gilbert syndrome or rarer conjugation disorders. Fourth, if conjugated, obtain RUQ ultrasound and, if dilated ducts, proceed to MRCP/ERCP, and if nondilated, evaluate for hepatocellular and cholestatic liver diseases with serologies and consider biopsy. Fifth, if mixed, evaluate both hemolysis and hepatobiliary disease concurrently. Throughout, review medications, monitor for red flags, and tailor the pace of workup to severity and acuity [^113BpbEZ] [^113iG5vj]. I need to ensure I communicate clearly that isolated mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an otherwise healthy adult with normal liver enzymes is most often benign and consistent with Gilbert syndrome, which requires no treatment beyond reassurance and avoidance of overtesting [^113iG5vj] [^112XLmib].

> Finally, I should review prognostic implications and follow-up. In chronic cholestatic diseases like primary biliary cholangitis, bilirubin is a strong prognostic marker, and rising bilirubin despite therapy signals advanced disease and should prompt escalation. In drug-induced liver injury, the combination of ALT or AST above 3 times the upper limit of normal with bilirubin above 2 times the upper limit of normal defines a Hy's law case and portends a high risk of liver failure, necessitating immediate drug withdrawal and close monitoring [^117GDdhd] [^111AfHzz]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not overinterpret mild bilirubin fluctuations in stable chronic liver disease; trends over time and correlation with synthetic function and clinical status are more informative than single values, guiding timing of interventions and transplant referral when appropriate [^113iG5vj].

An elevated total bilirubin reflects **increased bilirubin production** (hemolysis, hematoma resorption), **impaired hepatic conjugation** (Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar, neonatal immaturity), or **reduced excretion** (hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, biliary obstruction) [^113iG5vj] [^112RBbyZ]. The first step is to **fractionate bilirubin** into direct and indirect components to localize the cause, then add liver enzymes, CBC, and imaging as indicated [^113BpbEZ] [^115Txxj6]. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is often benign (e.g. Gilbert syndrome) or due to hemolysis, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinemia suggests hepatobiliary disease or obstruction and warrants urgent evaluation [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6].

---

## Physiological basis of bilirubin metabolism

Bilirubin is a yellow pigment derived from heme breakdown; it circulates as **unconjugated bilirubin** (insoluble, albumin-bound) and is processed by the liver via uptake, conjugation, and excretion [^112RBbyZ]. Disruption at any step can raise total bilirubin and cause jaundice [^113iG5vj].

---

## Classification of hyperbilirubinemia

Hyperbilirubinemia is classified as **unconjugated (indirect)** or **conjugated (direct)** based on the predominant fraction; this guides the differential and workup [^113iG5vj].

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Unconjugated | Increased production or impaired conjugation | - Hemolysis <br/> - Gilbert syndrome <br/> - Crigler-Najjar <br/> - Neonatal immaturity [^113iG5vj] [^112RBbyZ] |
| Conjugated | Impaired excretion or hepatobiliary disease | - Hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Cholestasis <br/> - Biliary obstruction <br/> - Drug-induced liver injury [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6] |

---

## Causes of elevated total bilirubin

### Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

- **Hemolysis**: Increased RBC breakdown overwhelms conjugation (e.g. sickle cell, G6PD deficiency, autoimmune hemolysis) [^113iG5vj] [^112WABNi].
- **Gilbert syndrome**: Mild UGT1A1 deficiency; benign, often < 3 mg/dL, worsens with fasting or stress [^113iG5vj] [^113okhnX].
- **Crigler-Najjar syndrome**: Severe UGT1A1 deficiency causing marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^112qqg88].
- **Neonatal jaundice**: Immature conjugation; usually unconjugated and self-limited [^114C1wUF] [^117C8yTD].

---

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

- **Hepatocellular injury**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol-related liver disease, ischemic hepatitis [^113iG5vj] [^1155asMt].
- **Cholestasis**: Impaired bile flow (e.g. primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, drug-induced cholestasis) [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6].
- **Biliary obstruction**: Stones, strictures, tumors causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^113iG5vj] [^115Txxj6].
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Many agents cause mixed or cholestatic injury (e.g. antibiotics, antiepileptics, biologics) [^112XLmib].

---

## Clinical evaluation of elevated total bilirubin

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Direct and indirect components to classify hyperbilirubinemia [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ].
- **Liver enzymes**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT to assess hepatocellular vs cholestatic injury [^111Zqb9T] [^1155asMt].
- **Complete blood count**: Evaluate hemolysis or infection [^112XLmib] [^115Txxj6].
- **Additional tests**: PT/INR, albumin, viral hepatitis serologies, autoimmune markers, iron studies as indicated [^115Txxj6] [^1155asMt].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging selection depends on clinical suspicion: **ultrasound** is first-line to assess biliary obstruction, gallstones, and liver parenchyma; **MRCP or ERCP** are used for detailed biliary evaluation or intervention when obstruction is suspected [^113BpbEZ] [^115Txxj6].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Often benign (e.g. Gilbert) but can signal hemolysis or genetic disease; neonatal unconjugated bilirubin poses neurotoxic risk at high levels [^113iG5vj] [^113ZqYGr].
- **Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: Usually indicates hepatobiliary disease or obstruction and warrants urgent evaluation [^113iG5vj] [^114Kk3U6].
- **Prognostic marker**: Elevated bilirubin correlates with severity in liver disease, sepsis, and critical illness [^115JuCqn] [^113zdzMx].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**: treat hemolysis, remove obstructing lesions, manage liver disease, or stop offending drugs [^113iG5vj] [^113s1NHW]. Supportive care includes hydration, phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, and ursodeoxycholic acid for cholestasis [^114K38Di] [^117GDdhd]. Monitoring entails serial bilirubin, liver enzymes, and imaging to track response and detect complications [^117AbP9B] [^113BpbEZ].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **bilirubin encephalopathy** from severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates [^112Vxztf] and hepatic encephalopathy from advanced liver disease with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound]. Persistent cholestasis can cause pruritus, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, and renal dysfunction [^notfound].

---

Elevated total bilirubin signals disruption in bilirubin production, conjugation, or excretion; **accurate interpretation requires fractionation**, clinical context, and targeted testing to guide diagnosis and management [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ].

We therefore sought to re-evaluate the poorly evidenced thresholds through characterising the natural history of both total and direct bilirubin levels. Total bilirubin levels have previously been shown to decrease reverse-exponentially with age in disease-free neonates, but to our knowledge the variation of direct bilirubin levels with age in this population is yet to be characterised (explaining the lack of evidence behind NICE's 25 µmol/L cut-off). Hence, our aims were to establish the spread of direct bilirubin levels in our sample and concordantly inform national guidance for the investigation of prolonged neonatal jaundice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

5.5 Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury has occurred in patients treated with fingolimod in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, have occurred as early as ten days after the first dose and have also been reported after prolonged use. Cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant have been reported.

In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients, elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on fingolimod and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, fingolimod was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.

Prior to starting treatment with fingolimod (within 6 months), obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Obtain transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels periodically until two months after fingolimod discontinuation.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury. Measure liver transaminase and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range, treatment with fingolimod should be interrupted. Treatment should not be resumed if a plausible alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established, because these patients are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Because fingolimod exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^116saypi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Our direct bilirubin values are generally higher than those found in previous population studies which have been based on neonates in the first 2 weeks of life. Previous work from Birmingham has shown the 97.5th centile for direct bilirubin measured in routinely collected screening specimens of approximately 27 000 neonates at 6–10 days was 21 µmol/L. Davis et al found 96% of approximately 70 000 neonates undergoing clinically indicated split bilirubin measurements had a maximum conjugated bilirubin < 17 µmol/L in the first 2 weeks of life. Although the neonates in these studies were less than 14 days of age, this appears to be the only evidence informing current advice regarding investigation of prolonged jaundice. Combining our data with previous studies suggests that the direct bilirubin tends to rise in the first 2 weeks of life, but thereafter decreases slowly in disease-free neonates.

We also calculated the direct–total bilirubin ratio. Linear regression analysis found no significant change with age. The 95th centile values were particularly variable with some > 30% and so the direct–total bilirubin ratio used alone is unlikely to be a reliable marker of pathology.

Sixty neonates had two complete split bilirubin samples, allowing us limited interpretation of trends over time at the individual level. Both total and direct bilirubin levels decreased significantly (P values < 0.0001) — direct bilirubin by a mean of 4.5 µmol/L over a median of 5 days — while the direct–total bilirubin ratio showed no significant trend (P value 0.8785). The average drop in direct bilirubin was 6.4%/day compared with 2.6%/day at the population level. Therefore, failure for direct bilirubin to decrease in an individual must be taken particularly seriously. There is, however, a bias towards these individuals having higher bilirubin levels than those with only one sample taken. Of interest, this was more marked with direct–total bilirubin ratio (30% greater) than direct bilirubin (6% greater), thus highlighting that practitioners continue to consider a raised ratio more significant (warranting further investigations, including repeat split bilirubin) than a raised direct bilirubin which, as discussed above, may be inappropriate.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^115d9efD]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia — bilirubin measurement and consultation triggers state that the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin concentration should not be subtracted from the total serum bilirubin concentration when using Figs 2 or 3. If the direct-reacting or conjugated fraction of the TSB exceeds 50% of the TSB, consultation with a knowledgeable specialist (eg, pediatric gastroenterologist or neonatologist) is recommended, and the figure caption also advises to consult an expert. Infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease.

Conclusion

Higher serum bilirubin within the normal range may be associated with lower mortality and risk of COPD exacerbations, a reduced incidence in COPD diagnosis and improved lung function Interventional trials are needed to test if medications that raise serum bilirubin levels can safely improve COPD outcomes.

Prognostic clinical features

Serum bilirubin is a stable and prevailing marker of liver impairment in the ICU. Its concentration is influenced by bilirubin synthesis, transport, uptake, conjugation and excretion. Ischemic and sepsis-associated cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury and parenteral nutrition are predominant causes of hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU. Bilirubin is a marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor. It has been shown to be linked to infections in surgical patients, to an increased mortality among trauma patients, sepsis or hematological malignancies, to a poor prognosis among ARDS patients, or simply to a worse outcome in the ICU (summarized in Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of the incidence and the overall mortality associated with increased bilirubin in ICU patients as reported in the literature

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, N.d not documented, TA transaminases, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CA cardiac arrest

*Increase of 2 mg/dl from baseline

**OR for complications, not for mortality

***Within the first 2 days after ICU admission

****OR for unfavorable neurological outcome, not for mortality

In the case of cholestasis, total bile acids are also an independent prognostic factor of disease severity. An elevation of 5.2 µmol/l of total bile acids from baseline data demonstrated discriminating value, while mortality was specifically augmented with increases > 10 µmol/l. Horvatits et al. suggested that bile acids could be a better prognostic factor than bilirubin in the ICU. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the elevation of bile acids in critically ill patients is a distinct pathophysiological entity or a compensatory mechanism.

Regarding hypoxic liver injury, the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is an effective tool for assessing liver function. In an observational study with 97 patients, a cutoff value of 9% 48 h after ICU admission demonstrated a significant prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality. In contrast, bilirubin, due to the later peak time, might not be a reliable marker and is elevated in only one-third of patients with hypoxic liver injury. The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate outperforms bilirubin as a more sensitive combined indicator of perfusion and excretory liver function in the ICU.

Finally, underlying and concomitant syndromes will impact the outcome, such as sepsis or need for organ support. Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients with hypoxic liver injury. As expected, the severity of organ failure results in higher mortality rates.

Mechanical circulatory support — Hepatic dysfunction considerations include that functional liver abnormalities are often seen with a cardiac index of < 1.5 L/min/m2, and only portal vein pulsatility index is statistically significant as a predictor of total bilirubin level. Monitoring should include liver enzymes and direct and indirect bilirubin for congestive hepatic dysfunction, optimally coordinated with monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) (Class I, Level of evidence: C.).

### Fingolimod [^1113muSA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury has occurred in patients treated with Fingolimod Capsules in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, have occurred as early as ten days after the first dose and have also been reported after prolonged use. Cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant have been reported.

In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients, elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with Fingolimod Capsules 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on Fingolimod Capsules and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, Fingolimod Capsules was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of Fingolimod Capsules. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.

Prior to starting treatment with Fingolimod Capsules (within 6 months), obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Obtain transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels periodically until two months after Fingolimod Capsules discontinuation.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury. Measure liver transaminase and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range, treatment with Fingolimod Capsules should be interrupted. Treatment should not be resumed if a plausible alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established, because these patients are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Because Fingolimod Capsules exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prognostic value of bilirubin and drug interactions [^111te55T]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Dear Editor:

I read with interest the results presented by Weber and colleagues, regarding the correlations between at-admission liver function parameters, and severity of COVID-19 infection. The authors reported that over half (57.6%) of the cohort presented with any liver function abnormality on admission. Adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidities, hypoalbuminaemia was the most predictive of severe COVID-19 (OR 9.95, p < 0.001). This was followed by AST elevation (OR 2.54, p = 0.005), and ALT elevation (OR 2.10, p = 0.030). Total bilirubin elevation was the most predictive singular factor of COVID-19-related death (OR 4.80, p = 0.032). The predictive value was doubled when combined with hypoalbuminaemia (OR 9.64, p = 0.024).

However, there are concerns as to whether the predictive value of bilirubin in COVID-19 is fully explored in the study. Total bilirubin comprises direct (conjugated) bilirubin, and indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin. The normal values for total bilirubin and direct bilirubin are, respectively, at 1.2 mg/dL, and 0.3 mg/dL. Direct bilirubin indicates the presence of cholestasis. Yet, from the study, only 4.6% of the cohort experienced total bilirubin elevation at admission. The figure rose to 19.8% at peak level. This formed a contrast with the much higher prevalence gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation (At admission: 36.9%; peak level: 59.9%), which is another marker for biliary disease. Furthermore, the least patients experienced total bilirubin elevation both at admission, and at peak, relative to other recorded liver parameters.

### High serum bilirubin concentrations preserve coronary flow reserve and coronary microvascular functions [^113NoAuq]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum bilirubin concentrations protect against atherosclerotic diseases; however, it is not clear whether higher serum bilirubin concentrations in physiological ranges work in favor of the cardiovascular system in younger persons with no cardiovascular risk factors. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of high, intermediate, and low serum bilirubin concentrations on coronary flow reserve (CFR).

Methods and Results

Fifty-two healthy subjects with hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 1.43 ± 0.33 mg/dL; mean age 35.9 ± 7.3), 55 subjects with intermediate bilirubin level (total bilirubin: 0.69 ± 0.11 mg/dL; mean age: 36.4 ± 6.8), and 53 healthy subjects with hypobilirubinemia (total bilirubin 0.37 ± 0.08 mg/dL; mean age, 37.6 ± 6.6) were studied. Transthoracic second harmonic Doppler echocardiography examination was performed using an Acuson Sequoia C256 Echocardiography System. Coronary diastolic peak flow velocities were measured at baseline and after dipyridamole infusion (0.84 mg/kg over 6 minutes). CFR was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline diastolic peak velocities. Demographic features, coronary risk factors, echocardiographic measurements, and biochemical measurements were similar among the 3 groups, except high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). CFR values were significantly higher in subjects with high bilirubin concentrations than those were in the intermediate and the low bilirubin groups (3.19 ± 0.73; 2.75 ± 0.42; 2.56 ± 0.52, respectively; P < 0.0001), and hsCRP levels were significantly lower in subjects with high bilirubin concentrations than those in both intermediate and low bilirubin groups (1.4 ± 1.0, 2.0 ± 1.7, 3.0 ± 1.9 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.001). hsCRP levels correlated with total bilirubin concentration and with CFR.

Conclusions

Elevated serum bilirubin concentrations protect from CFR impairment, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and possibly coronary atherosclerosis.

### Elevated serum bilirubin level correlates with the development of cholangiocarcinoma, subsequent liver transplantation, and death in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113zdzMx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Predicting the clinical course of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is difficult. There are currently a paucity of studies evaluating serum chemistries as predictors of conventional clinical endpoints. The purpose of this study was to prognosticate key clinical endpoints in patients with PSC who had elevated serum liver chemistries at the time of their initial presentation.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of PSC patients at our institution. The aim of our study was to determine the association between elevated liver chemistries at initial presentation-bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, or alkaline phosphatase-with a primary outcome of either cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation, death, or composite of the 3. The secondary endpoints examined were development of severe biliary ductal disease and need for biliary stent placement.

Results

Eighty-one PSC patients (61 males and 20 females) were included in this study. By univariate analysis, there was a significant association between initial bilirubin elevation > 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and death (P < 0.009). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that an elevated initial serum total bilirubin > 2xULN (P < 0.017) significantly predicted the composite endpoint. By univariate analysis of pre-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography labs, serum bilirubin level elevation > 2xULN showed an association with severity of biliary ductal disease (P < 0.0001). A logistic regression of outcome variables also proved that > 2xULN serum bilirubin levels predicted the ductal disease severity (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

An initial elevation of serum total bilirubin > 2xULN in PSC patients correlates positively with the development of cholangiocarcinoma, subsequent liver transplantation, and death. Elevated bilirubin also correlates positively with the severity of cholangiographic findings.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### UGT1A1 genetic variants are associated with increases in bilirubin levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with sarilumab [^112nfebg]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Baseline total bilirubin levels (mg/dl) by UGT1A1 (rs4148325) genotype for all patients (placebo + DMARD and sarilumab + DMARD arms are combined).

Boxplots of the baseline bilirubin level by genotype are shown. Treatment arms were combined to assess bilirubin levels pre-treatment.

To assess the potential clinical impact of the variability in bilirubin level by rs4148325 genotype, analysis of bilirubin elevations with respect to ULN were conducted. By study entry criteria, no patients had bilirubin elevations in excess of 1.5 × ULN at baseline. Additionally, no elevations > 1.5 × ULN in bilirubin were observed in placebo+DMARD-treated patients, while 18 sarilumab-treated patients had bilirubin elevations > 1.5 × ULN. In the binary analysis of maximum total bilirubin among sarilumab-treated patients, the TT genotype was significantly associated with bilirubin elevations (Table 2; odds ratio 47.79; p = 5.67 × 10 −10). This finding was confirmed with a Fisher's exact test (p = 1.14 × 10 −47). In total, 18 of 755 (2.4%) of sarilumab-treated patients had bilirubin elevations > 1.5 × ULN, and of those, 16 of 18 (89%) were homozygous for the T allele, while only two patients (11%) were in either the CC or CT genotype group. Only 2 of 664 (0.3%) CC or CT patients had bilirubin elevations > 1.5 × ULN compared to 16 of 91 (17.6%) of TT patients with bilirubin elevations > 1.5 × ULN (Table 2).

### Circulating total bilirubin and risk of incident cardiovascular disease in the general population [^115cR7yZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of circulating total bilirubin and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a new prospective study and to determine whether adding information on total bilirubin values to established cardiovascular risk factors is associated with improvement in prediction of CVD risk.

Approach and Results

Circulating total bilirubin levels were measured at baseline in the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) prospective study of 7222 participants and 773 incident CVD events. Total bilirubin was log-linearly associated with CVD risk. Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for CVD per 1-SD increase in loge total bilirubin was 0.82 (0.76 to 0.88; P < 0.001), which was minimally attenuated to 0.89 (0.82 to 0.96; P = 0.003) after further adjustment for established risk factors. In a meta-analysis of 12 population-based prospective studies involving 9378 incident CVD cases, the pooled multivariate-adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for CVD was 0.93 (0.90 to 0.97; P < 0.001) per 1-SD increase in total bilirubin levels. The corresponding pooled risks for coronary heart disease and stroke were 0.95 (0.92 to 0.99; P = 0.018) and 0.93 (0.88 to 0.98; P = 0.006), respectively. Addition of information on total bilirubin to a CVD risk prediction model containing established risk factors was associated with a C-index change of 0.0013 (-0.0004 to 0.0029; P = 0.13).

Conclusions

There is a log-linear inverse association between circulating total bilirubin level and CVD risk, which is independent of established risk factors. Nonetheless, inclusion of total bilirubin in the standard established risk factors panel provides no significant improvement in CVD risk prediction.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults | AAFP… [^112WABNi]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

4, 6 Jaundice occurs when there are disruptions along this metabolic pathway, causing an increase in unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery. Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers. The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice.

3 Jaundice in persons with alcoholic liver disease can occur via multiple mechanisms, such as direct hepatocellular damage caused by ethanol metabolites or from alcohol's effect on bile acid uptake and secretion contributing to cholestasis. 3, 16 Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and approximately 40% to 50% of these patients develop fibrosis or cirrhosis that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia. 17 Although the exact mechanism is poorly understood, liver lipid deposition may trigger inflammation and fibrosis, particularly when coupled with type 2 diabetes. 17 Sepsis may also induce hyperbilirubinemia as circulating acute phase reactants and bacterial endotoxins disrupt bilirubin transport, leading to cholestasis and elevated bile salt levels. 18, 19.

20 Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder, is associated with a loss of function of a cellular transporter responsible for moving dietary copper into liver canaliculi. Elevated liver copper levels affect hepatic lipid metabolism, which leads to steatosis and cholestasis. 21 Additional causes of intrahepatic hyperbilirubinemia include autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis and the rare autoimmune condition primary biliary cirrhosis, which occurs most commonly in middle-aged women. Both conditions are associated with inflammation, which disrupts the transport of bilirubin within the liver. 3.

### Management of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the cholestatic neonate: a review and an approach [^111wAmpe]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A review of the literature demonstrates that severe total hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL [340 µmol/L]) in some cholestatic term (≥ 37 weeks) and late-preterm (≥ 34 0/7 6/7 weeks) gestation neonates poses a risk for bilirubin-induced brain damage. When the direct bilirubin fraction is < 50% of the total serum bilirubin this risk is associated with the total serum bilirubin alone and treatment decisions should be based on the total serum bilirubin. On the other hand, there are limited data on the risk of bilirubin-induced brain damage in the neonate with severe total hyperbilirubinemia and a direct bilirubin fraction that is equal to or exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin. When this rare combination occurs, efforts to keep the indirect bilirubin fraction from reaching severe levels might, nevertheless, be prudent.

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^112qqg88]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously or can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. These disorders-Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome-both involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

### Total bilirubin as a marker for hemolysis and outcome in patients with severe ARDS treated with veno-venous ECMO [^115FsVzk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with ARDS and treatment with veno-venous ECMO, elevated plasma concentrations of CFH are known to be associated with increased ICU-mortality and organ failure. Serum bilirubin may not only act as a marker of disease severity and hemolysis, but has also been proposed to contribute to disease progression in ARDS patients, e.g. by direct toxic effects of bilirubin on lung surfactant. As a downstream product of CFH metabolism, bilirubin plasma concentration might be affected not only by the underlying disease but also by the degree of hemolysis induced by extracorporeal circulation. In this study, the prognostic potential of elevated initial total bilirubin (tBili) concentrations for survival and recovery from organ dysfunctions including successful weaning from organ replacement therapies in patients with ARDS and therapy with veno-venous ECMO was investigated.

### Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) [^115t16N1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including OCREVUS. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with OCREVUS found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with OCREVUS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue OCREVUS.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn… [^113ZqYGr]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Risk Factors for Hyperbilirubinemia Infants without identified risk factors rarely have total serum bilirubin levels above 12 mg per dL. As the number of risk factors increases, the potential to develop markedly elevated bilirubin levels also increases. 2 Common risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia include fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, prematurity, and a previously affected sibling. 2–4 Cephalohematomas, bruising, and trauma from instrumented delivery may increase the risk for serum bilirubin elevation. Delayed meconium passage also increases the risk. Infants with risk factors should be monitored closely during the first days to weeks of life.

| Maternal factors Blood type ABO or Rh incompatibility Breastfeeding Drugs: diazepam, oxytocin Ethnicity: Asian, Native American Maternal illness: gestational diabetes|Neonatal factors Birth trauma: cephalohematoma, cutaneous bruising, instrumented delivery Drugs: sulfisoxazole acetyl with erythromycin ethylsuccinate, chloramphenicol Excessive weight loss after birth Infections: TORCH Infrequent feedings Male gender Polycythemia Prematurity Previous sibling with hyperbilirubinemia. The precise role of bilirubin in the development of kernicterus is not completely understood. If the serum unconjugated bilirubin level exceeds the binding capacity of albumin, unbound lipid-soluble bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier. Albumin-bound bilirubin may also cross the blood-brain barrier if damage has occurred because of asphyxia, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hyperosmolality, or sepsis in the newborn.

Management Studies on the toxic effects of hyperbilirubinemia historically involved infants with hemolytic disease. An increased incidence of kernicterus was found to be associated with total serum bilirubin levels above 20 mg per dL in the presence of hemolysis. 19, 20 This observation was the basis for aggressive guidelines recommending the use of exchange transfusion in all infants with significant hyperbilirubinemia. More recently, term infants without hemolysis have been found to tolerate higher total serum bilirubin levels, 21 and management guidelines now focus primarily on phototherapy as initial treatment. 1.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### Interpreting conjugated bilirubin levels in newborns [^114VDMzH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the clinical significance of elevated conjugated bilirubin (CB) levels in newborns.

Study Design

This retrospective study evaluated a birth cohort of 271 186 full-term newborns born within a Northern California hospital network from 1995 to 2004. All CB and direct bilirubin (DB) levels were available in a database and were correlated with the patients' inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnoses.

Results

The 99th percentile for CB is 0.5 mg/dL, and the 99th percentile for DB is 2.1 mg/dL. CB levels between 0.5 and 1.9 mg/dL can be associated with infection, but most often remain unexplained. Liver and biliary disease become increasingly likely as CB levels increase; for CB ≥ 5 mg/dL, 47% of newborns have biliary disease and 43% have liver disease.

Conclusions

CB and DB levels are not interchangeable. In newborns with CB levels ≥ 0.5 mg/dL and < 2 mg/dL, infection must be ruled out, and the newborn should be observed. In newborns with levels ≥ 2 mg/dL, a more in-depth assessment of the hepatobiliary system is indicated.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114K38Di]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 3 advises using total serum bilirubin (TSB) as the definitive diagnostic test to guide phototherapy and escalation-of-care decisions, including exchange transfusion, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X and a Recommendation. Benefits include that virtually all treatment studies are based on TSB concentrations, while risks note there is some laboratory variation. The guideline adds that using TSB can lead to timely treatment and may help reduce overtreatment in infants in whom transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) overestimates TSB, although there are no direct comparisons between TSB and TcB as a diagnostic test and such studies are unlikely to be performed.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### Gilbert's syndrome revisited [^115fqT1w]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gilbert's syndrome, also known as benign hyperbilirubinaemia, was described more than 100 years ago. It has usually been considered a physiological abnormality characterised by a mild elevation of the systemic level of unconjugated bilirubin, in the absence of any underlying liver or overt haemolytic disease. However, since the re-discovery of the potent antioxidant effects of bilirubin in the late 1980s, as well as multiple intracellular signalling pathways affected by bilirubin, an ever-increasing body of evidence suggests that individuals with Gilbert's syndrome may benefit from the mild hyperbilirubinaemia and are actually protected from the development of a wide variety of "diseases of civilisation" such as cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. This review analyses the current state of medical knowledge given recent discoveries in this rapidly developing field, as well as their possible clinical significance, and provides a new perspective on this condition.

### Fasting increases serum bilirubin levels in clinically normal, healthy males but not females: a retrospective study from phase I clinical trial participants [^116Zk95X]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine if fasting affects serum bilirubin levels in clinically healthy males and females.

Methods

We used retrospective data from phase I clinical trials where blood was collected in either a fed or fasting state at screening and predosing time points and analysed for total bilirubin levels as per standard clinical procedures. Participants were clinically healthy males (n = 105) or females (n = 30) aged 18–48 inclusive who participated in a phase I clinical trial in 2012 or 2013.

Results

We found a statistically significant increase in total serum bilirubin levels in fasting males as compared with non-fasting males. The fasting time correlated positively with increased bilirubin levels. The age of the healthy males did not correlate with their fasting bilirubin level. We found no correlation between fasting and bilirubin levels in clinically normal females.

Conclusions

The recruitment and screening of volunteers for a clinical trial is a time-consuming and expensive process. This study clearly demonstrates that testing for serum bilirubin should be conducted on non-fasting male subjects. If fasting is required, then participants should not be excluded from a trial based on an elevated serum bilirubin that is deemed non-clinically significant.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116kht1X]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated hepatic events — indirect hyperbilirubinemia with atazanavir (ATV) — present in children within the first months of therapy and can be asymptomatic or associated with jaundice, with levels of direct bilirubin normal or slightly elevated when indirect levels are very high and with normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). In long-term follow-up, 9% of children who were receiving ATV had at least one total bilirubin level > 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and 1.4% of children experienced jaundice. Risk factors are none established. For prevention/monitoring, no ongoing monitoring is needed, and after an initial rise over the first few months of therapy, unconjugated bilirubin levels generally stabilize; levels can improve over time. Management states that isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia is not an indication to stop ATV; the psychological impact of jaundice should be evaluated and alternative agents should be considered, and because jaundice can result in nonadherence, particularly in adolescents, this side effect should be discussed with patients.

### Potential impact of the joint association of total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltransferase with metabolic syndrome [^111UZ6cf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, the mean age of the subjects was 44.8 years (standard deviation, 9.3 years; range, 21–84 years), and 49.0% were women. The median total bilirubin levels in both men and women, men, and women were 13.7 μmol/L (interquartile range, 10.3–17.1 μmol/L), 15.4 μmol/L (12.0–18.8 μmol/L), and 12.0 μmol/L (10.3–15.4 μmol/L), respectively. The median GGT levels in both men and women, men, and women were 0.33 μkat/L (interquartile range, 0.23–0.52 μkat/L), 0.44 μkat/L (0.32–0.68 μkat/L), and 0.26 μkat/L (0.20–0.35 μkat/L), respectively. The characteristics of the subjects in each group (both-low, GGT-high, total bilirubin-high, and both-high) are shown in Table 1. In men, the incident rate of metabolic syndrome during the follow-up was 6.1% (79 of 1303) in the both-low group, 15.0% (199 of 1331) in the GGT-high group, 4.2% (42 of 1007) in the total bilirubin-high group, and 14.8% (140 of 945) in the both-high group. In women, the incident rate of metabolic syndrome during the follow-up was 3.0% (36 of 1186) in the both-low group, 8.5% (87 of 1026) in the GGT-high group, 1.4% (16 of 1125) in the total bilirubin-high group, and 6.8% (73 of 1069) in the both-high group. The prevalence of fatty liver disease in men was 19.3% (252 of 1303) in the both-low group, 42.8% (569 of 1331) in the GGT-high group, 16.2% (163 of 1007) in the total bilirubin-high group, and 42.1% (398 of 945) in the both-high group. In women, the prevalence of fatty liver disease was 5.6% (66 of 1186) in the both-low group, 17.5% (180 of 1026) in the GGT-high group, 4.2% (47 of 1125) in the total bilirubin-high group, and 10.4% (111 of 1069) in the both-high group. In all subjects, the main effect of high total bilirubin (p = 0.0001), the main effect of high GGT (p < 0.0001), and the interaction between total bilirubin and GGT (p = 0.0222) were all significant (Table 2). Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between the four study groups and incident metabolic syndrome (Table 3). In all subjects, the both-low group [HR, 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28–2.40], GGT-high group (HR, 4.55; 95% CI 3.46–6.09), and both-high group (HR, 3.97; 95% CI 2.99–5.35) showed an increased unadjusted HR for incident metabolic syndrome compared with the total bilirubin-high group. In all subjects or in women, the both-low, GGT-high, and both-high groups showed an increased adjusted HR for incident metabolic syndrome after adjusting for covariates compared with the total bilirubin-high group. On the other hand, in male subjects, the GGT-high and both-high groups showed an increased adjusted HR for incident metabolic syndrome after adjusting for covariates compared with the total bilirubin-high group; however, the risk in the both-low group did not differ from that of the total bilirubin-high group.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

### Hypercortisolism in patients with cholestasis is associated with disease severity [^111RD3vr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cholestasis might lead to an impairment of adrenal function as suggested by in vitro and in vivo data as well as by clinical findings. Bile acid and adrenal steroid metabolism not only share the receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5), but supraphysiological bile acid levels were found to stimulate steroidogenesis independent of FXR and TGR5. Our previous experimental findings revealed that mice fed bile acids or subjected to common bile duct ligation develop hypercortisolemia. We thus aimed to assess adrenal gland function in patients with cholestasis.

Methods

Adrenal gland function was assessed in 36 patients with cholestasis and in 32 patients without cholestasis by measuring total serum cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), as well as the increase of cortisol 20 and 30 min after administration of 1 µg of ACTH. Bile acid levels and bile acid pool composition were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry.

Results

Patients with cholestasis per definition had markedly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP), bilirubin and serum bile acids. Baseline cortisol and maximum cortisol after ACTH stimulation were significantly higher in patients with cholestasis compared to controls. Increase of cortisol after ACTH stimulation and ACTH did not differ. In the cholestasis group, baseline cortisol correlated with bilirubin but not with AP, total serum bile acids and levels of conjugated and unconjugated bile acid species. Patients with duration of cholestasis < 6 months (n = 30) had significantly higher baseline cortisol levels than those with long standing cholestasis (> 6 months), together with higher bilirubin levels.

Conclusions

We find no evidence of adrenal insufficiency in non-cirrhotic patients with cholestasis. In contrast, patients with cholestasis show hypercortisolism associated with disease severity as mirrored by levels of bilirubin. Lack of ACTH increase in cholestasis suggests a direct effect of cholestasis on adrenals and not on the pituitary gland. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of cortisol elevation in patients with cholestasis and its clinical significance.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^111oE3AL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussions

In our study, we demonstrated that transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) levels measured from different maternal skin sites were significantly higher in women with preeclampsia and pre-eclampsia with severe features compared to the control group. Furthermore, TcB values showed a stepwise increase in parallel with the severity of the disease. In contrast, total serum bilirubin (TsB) levels did not differ significantly among the control, preeclampsia, and pre-eclampsia with severe features groups. These findings suggest that TcB measurement may serve as a valuable non-invasive tool in the classification of preeclampsia.

While transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia, total serum bilirubin levels remained within normal limits and did not differ significantly among groups. This divergence may reflect the subclinical accumulation of bilirubin in tissue compartments that is not captured by serum measurements, possibly due to efficient hepatic clearance or early-stage hemolysis. Additionally, the observed elevation in LDH without corresponding reductions in hemoglobin may indicate subclinical hemolytic activity or hepatic dysfunction, which precedes measurable changes in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels.

Conditions that affect bilirubin metabolism may lead to elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. When blood bilirubin levels exceed 1 mg/dL, bilirubin begins to accumulate in tissues rich in elastic fibers, such as the skin and conjunctiva. At serum levels above 2.5 mg/dL, a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes becomes apparent. In adults, hyperbilirubinemia alone does not indicate a poor prognosis, as the body possesses effective detoxification mechanisms.

Pre-hepatic hyperbilirubinemia refers to elevated bilirubin levels resulting from excessive bilirubin production. The most common cause is accelerated hemolysis. When the rate of bilirubin production exceeds the liver's capacity for uptake and excretion, serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels rise, while conjugated bilirubin levels remain normal or only mildly elevated. In the presence of elevated bilirubin levels, hepatic injury is typically absent if there is no disruption in aminotransferase levels, albumin concentration, or prothrombin activity. Moreover, increased bilirubin concentrations are not considered a sensitive marker of liver damage. A healthy liver is capable of conjugating up to twice the daily production of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) without causing an increase in total bilirubin concentrations. Additionally, the hepatic clearance rate of bilirubin exceeds its production rate by up to tenfold.

### Severe elevation of liver tests in choledocholithiasis: an uncommon occurrence with important clinical implications [^1143Kinu]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Choledocholithiasis is not commonly associated with dramatic elevations in aminotransferase or total serum bilirubin. Ours is the largest case series thus far studying the prevalence of dramatic elevations in liver tests associated with choledocholithiasis.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choledocholithiasis diagnosed on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiogram at a tertiary referral hospital over 7 years. We identified 740 patients with available liver tests and determined the prevalence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 1000 IU/L and of total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL. We compared clinical characteristics of these 2 nonoverlapping groups.

Results

Of 740 patients, AST and/or ALT values > 1000 IU/L were present in 45 (6.1%) patients. On average AST and ALT decreased 79% and 56%, respectively, at discharge 1 to 8 days later. Total serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dL were present in 35 (4.7%) patients and decreased by an average of 64% at discharge 1 to 8 days later. When compared with the group with total serum bilirubin > 10 mg/dL, the group with elevated aminotransferases had significantly more females (93% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), had smaller common bile duct diameter (8.5 vs. 10.6 mm, P = 0.04), and were more likely to have had a prior cholecystectomy (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). These 80 patients had higher utilization of health resources: half had additional laboratory studies and one fourth had additional imaging studies performed.

Conclusions

In patients with high AST and/or ALT and serum total bilirubin levels with known choledocholithiasis, elaborate work up to look for another etiology is not required. As long as the values decrease significantly, they do not need to be followed until they normalize in the same hospitalization.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^114MYtkd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a complex, multisystem obstetric disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often requiring enhanced strategies for early detection, management, and risk stratification. This study aimed to evaluate potential alterations in non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubin levels measured at various maternal body sites in pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia.

Methods

A total of 86 pregnant women who delivered at our institution were enrolled and classified into three groups: healthy pregnant women (Group 1, n = 30), women with preeclampsia (Group 2, n = 30), and women with pre-eclampsia with severe features (Group 3, n = 26). In addition to routine pre-delivery laboratory assessments, transcutaneous bilirubin levels were measured at two anatomical sites-the forehead and the abdominal skin overlying the uterine fundus-using a standard bilirubinometer. Each site was measured three times, and the mean of the three readings was recorded for analysis. Complete Blood Count and biochemical blood parameters of the women were evaluated. Relevant obstetric and demographic data were also collected and recorded.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of maternal age, gravidity, parity, or body mass index (p > 0.05). Similarly, total serum bilirubin levels were comparable across the groups (Group 1: 0.45 mg/dL; Group 2: 0.39 mg/dL; Group 3: 0.44 mg/dL; p > 0.05). In contrast, transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in Group 3 compared to Groups 1 and 2. The mean transcutaneous bilirubin values for the forehead, uterine fundus, and overall (combined sites) were as follows: Group 1–3.07 ± 0.85, 2.35 ± 0.97, and 2.71 ± 0.76; Group 2–6.09 ± 1.94, 4.94 ± 1.64, and 5.52 ± 1.59; Group 3–7.12 ± 1.81, 6.12 ± 2.25, and 6.63 ± 1.69, respectively. All pairwise comparisons demonstrated statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia, particularly among those with severe disease. As a non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective approach, TcB measurement may function as an adjunctive tool for the initial clinical assessment and risk stratification of preeclamptic patients.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^1149UGfc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards. Our protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019145747).

Data sources and searches

We searched MEDLINE® and Embase databases using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019) for peer-reviewed, English language studies. The search strategy for the MEDLINE® search is provided in Additional file 1: Appendix 1.

Study selection

Two authors (AKB and DMM) independently reviewed each study at the abstract and full-text level to determine eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and evaluation by a third reviewer, if needed.

Reports were eligible if they were randomized or observational (cohort, cross-sectional, case control) studies that enrolled participants greater than 18 years of age. We did not exclude studies based on pulmonary function or pulmonary diagnoses and included studies conducted in both general populations and in samples restricted to those with obstructive lung disease. We excluded case reports and case series, studies published in only abstract form, and those without a full text publication in English. We did not have a numerical cutoff for bilirubin levels because there are no defined criteria for what constitutes a pathologic elevation in bilirubin, but we excluded studies evaluating elevations in serum bilirubin in the context of hepatobiliary diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Eligible studies reported serum bilirubin levels and any outcome of interest related to our three key questions.

Outcome measures

We examined clinically important outcomes by cross sectional measures and longitudinal measures. Clinical effect sizes are included in Additional file 1: Appendix 2.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^111fjDtB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

### Evaluation of role of hyperbilirubinemia as a new diagnostic marker of complicated appendicitis [^115LMH63]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There was significant rise in both components of total bilirubin, direct as well as indirect bilirubin in subjects with complicated appendicitis, so it was Mixed Type of Hyperbilirubinemia in gangrenous/perforated appendicitis. The sensitivity of Total serum bilirubin in predicting complicated appendicitis was found 91.43% (76.942% to 98.196%), where as the specificity of this test was 88.00% (78.439% to 94.363%). positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 78.03% and 95.65% respectively. Positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were found to be 7.619 and 0.097 respectively taking prevalence of Complicated appendicitis be 31.80% (Table 2).

After plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR)/sensitivity of Total Serum Bilirubin level against the False Positive Rate (FPR) of its detection of complicated appendicitis at various threshold settings a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve was obtained which shows optimal criterion at Total Bilirubin Level 1.06 mg/dl where sensitivity was 91.43% and specificity was 97.33% at 95% confidence interval with 31.8% disease prevalence (Table 2).

The prevalence of complicated appendicitis was found to be 31.8% among all cases. So Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.958 [standard error 0.0246, 95% Confidence interval0.902 to 0.987, z statistic 18.614, Significance level p (area = 0.5) < 0.0001]. Figure 2 shows criterion values and coordinates of the ROC curve. This ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) curve reveals diagnostic ability of Total Serum Biliruin level for complicated appendicitis, after taking into consideration of prevalence of complicated appendicitis among total cases. Optimal criterion was found at total bilirubin level 1.06 mg/dl.

Fig. 2
statistical significance of hyperbilirubinemia in complicated appendicitis with criterion values and coordinates of the roc curve (n = 110)

So we can infer that, subjects with clinical features suggestive of appendicitis with higher values of serum total bilirubin, are more susceptible of having complicated appendicitis than those with normal or mildly elevated total bilirubin level.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Jaundice in the intensive care unit [^1168E8GG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, is common in the ICU, with incidence up to 40% among critically ill patients. Unfortunately, it is poorly understood in the critically ill, and too often presents a diagnostic dilemma to the ICU physician. Causes of jaundice in the ICU are multiple; the etiology in any given patient, multifactorial. Acute jaundice can be a harbinger or marker of sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), or a reflection of transient hypotension (shock liver), right-sided heart failure, the metabolic breakdown of red blood cells, or pharmacologic toxicity. Acute ICU jaundice is best divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. This stratification directs subsequent management and therapeutic decisions.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^11558j4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in infants — initial bilirubin evaluation recommends that any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age should be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin (1A), while breast-fed babies that appear otherwise well may be followed clinically until 3 weeks of age and, if still icteric, should then undergo serum evaluation of total and conjugated (direct) serum bilirubin. Measurements of serum bilirubin should always be fractionated into unconjugated (indirect) or conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (1A), and conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia (> 1.0 mg/dL, 17 μmol/ L) is considered pathologic and warrants diagnostic evaluation (1A).

### Neonatal cholestasis [^114C1wUF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of icteric index to detect abnormal total bilirubin values [^112sGr64]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Total bilirubin tests are individually inexpensive but can result in huge costs to healthcare systems worldwide, because they are very commonly requested. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the icteric index, a test with zero reagent cost, as a preliminary biomarker to decide when total bilirubin measurement is necessary.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all the requested total bilirubin values and their corresponding icteric index results in a 2-year period (2010–11). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal icteric index cut-off value to discriminate between normal and abnormal bilirubin values (> 20.5 μmol/l; > 1.2 mg/dl).

Results

The study included total bilirubin and icteric index results of 100,207 patients. The ROC curve analysis suggested 34.2 μmol/l (2 mg/dl) as the optimal icteric index threshold to identify abnormal bilirubin values. The area under the curve was 0.981. Regardless of the patient population studied (primary care, hospital and different individual hospital departments), sensitivity was greater than 94% and specificity was over 98%. Likelihood ratio values provided strong evidence that total bilirubin is less than 20.5 μmol/l (< 1.2 mg/dl) when the icteric index is less than 34.2 μmol/l (< 2 mg/dl).

Conclusions

This study supports the use of the icteric index to identify patients with abnormal total bilirubin values. Considerable economic savings can be achieved if this strategy is applied on a clinical daily basis. Its implementation and report should be discussed and planned by laboratory professionals together with requesting physicians.

### Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) [^117AbP9B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate. Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels in all patients and monitor yearly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt treatment until the levels have returned to baseline values. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI. (5.1)

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Chenodiol, including CTEXLI, has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In Trial 1, one CTEXLI-treated patient (7%) had increased ALT levels > 3 times ULN, which led to treatment interruption. Patients with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities may be at higher risk for hepatotoxicity during treatment with CTEXLI. Published reports suggest patients who are poor sulfators of lithocholic acid are more likely to develop chenodiol-induced serum aminotransferase elevations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Obtain baseline liver transaminase (ALT, AST) and total bilirubin levels in all patients prior to treatment initiation with CTEXLI. If liver transaminase levels are elevated > 3 times ULN or total bilirubin level is > 2 times ULN, interrupt treatment with CTEXLI until the levels have returned to baseline values. Monitor liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels yearly and as clinically indicated. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, consider discontinuing CTEXLI.

Inform the patient of the symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., abdominal pain, bruising, dark-colored urine, fatigue, bleeding, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with hepatotoxicity occur, have the patient discontinue CTEXLI immediately.

Bilirubin, the product of heme breakdown from red blood cells, is exclusively eliminated by the liver. Thus, circulating bilirubin is widely used as a diagnostic biomarker for liver function. Large postmarketing studies of patients with drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) show that ∼10% of subjects with hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice die or require a liver transplant. 1, 2, 3 In the setting of a clinical trial of a new drug candidate, elevations in serum bilirubin may also indicate severe liver injury with global hepatic dysfunction. The 2009 US Food and Drug Administration guidance on assessing liver safety in clinical trials defines the "Hy's Law Case" as a trial subject who experiences a hepatocellular injury with concomitant elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum total bilirubin (TB) elevation > 2× ULN when there is no more likely cause than the study drug. The existence of Hy's Law Cases in a clinical trial database is interpreted as indicating that the study drug is capable of causing liver failure, a conclusion that can lead to termination of the development program, requirement of extended clinical trials to assess risk management strategies, or restricted indications. Therefore, the observation of hyperbilirubinemia during clinical trials or postmarketing can raise concern about irreversible liver injury with serious regulatory consequences.

### Bilirubin is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease among HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals in VACS (veterans aging cohort study) [^111nveVK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bilirubin may protect against cardiovascular disease by reducing oxidative stress. Whether elevated bilirubin reduces the risk ofevents among + individuals and if this differs from uninfected individuals remain unclear. We assessed whether bilirubin independently predicted the risk ofevents among + and uninfected participants in(Veterans Aging Cohort Study).

Methods and Results

We conducted a prospective cohort study usingparticipants free of baseline. Total bilirubin was categorized by quartiles.as well as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke events were assessed. Cox regression was used to evaluate hazard ratios of outcomes associated with quartiles of total bilirubin in + and uninfected people after adjusting for multiple risk factors. There were 96 381 participants (30 427 +); mean age was 48 years, 48% were black, and 97% were men. There were 6603 total incidentevents over a mean of 5.7 years. In adjusted models, increasing quartiles of baseline total bilirubin were associated with decreased hazards of all outcomes (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.91). Among + participants, results persisted for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and total, but nonsignificant associations were observed for acute myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

participants (regardless ofstatus) with elevated bilirubin levels had a lower risk of incident total, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke events after adjusting for known risk factors. Future studies should investigate how this apparently protective effect of elevated bilirubin could be harnessed to reducerisk or improve risk estimation among + individuals.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^111SZp2U]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In a clinically relevant population of disease-free neonates referred with prolonged jaundice, we found the 95th centile for direct bilirubin decreased slowly with age but was approximately 25 µmol/L. Failure for direct bilirubin to decrease with time at an individual level is particularly concerning. In contrast, the direct–total bilirubin ratio was highly variable and hence an unreliable indicator of pathology. While we acknowledge our data do not include any patients with liver disease, they nonetheless provide support for the NICE recommendation that well neonates with prolonged jaundice do not require investigation for liver disease if the conjugated bilirubin is ≤ 25 µmol/L. This threshold has the merits of simplicity and a high margin of safety; however, compared with other more stringent criteria, it may result in more neonates being extensively investigated with negligible gain in sensitivity.

Laboratory results include the following: white blood cell count, 21,600/μL (21.6×109/L; reference range, 9,000–30,000/μL [9–30×109/L]); hemoglobin, 18.2 g/dL (182 g/L; reference range, 14.0–24.0 g/dL [140–240 g/L]); platelet count, 111×103/μL (111×109/L; reference range, 150–450×103/μL [150–450×109/L]); blood type, B+; direct antiglobulin test, negative; and reticulocyte count, 4% (reference range, 3%-7%). Comprehensive metabolic panel is significant for hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 132 mEq/L (132 mmol/L; reference range, 135–145 mEq/L [135–145 mmol/L]). Liver enzyme levels are normal (alanine aminotransferase, 41 U/L [0.68 μkat/L]; aspartate aminotransferase, 86 U/L [1.44 μkat/L]), as are total protein (5.4 g/dL [54 g/L]) and albumin (3.0 g/dL [30 g/L]) levels. Repeated bilirubin level is 12.4 mg/dL (212 µmol/L) at 14 hours after birth, with an elevated direct bilirubin level of 2.9 mg/dL (49.6 µmol/L). Direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is defined as a direct bilirubin level greater than 2 mg/dL (34.2 mmol/L) or more than 20% of total bilirubin. γ-Glutamyl transferase level is normal. Coagulation studies show an elevated prothrombin time of 23.4 seconds (reference range, 11–17 seconds), with an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9–1.3); activated partial thromboplastin level is 49.5 seconds (reference range, 30–60 seconds). Fibrinogen level is decreased at 70 mg/dL (0.70 g/L) (reference range, 230–450 mg/dL [230–450 g/L]). Lactate level is 24.3 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L; reference range, 2.0–26.9 mg/dL [0.22–2.98 mmol/L]). Ammonia level is 96.6 µg/dL (69 μmol/L; reference range, 89.6–149.9 µg/dL [64–107 μmol/L]). Cerebrospinal fluid studies are unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and echocardiography are normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows diffuse hepatic echogenicity. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are negative. Further testing reveals the diagnosis.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^112vix3M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and higher serum bilirubin levels have been associated with improved COPD outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the association between serum bilirubin levels and lung function (FEV 1), prevalence/incidence of COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health status, and mortality.

Methods

MEDLINE® and Embase were searched using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019). We included studies that measured serum bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest in adults with or without underlying lung disease. We excluded studies of those with liver disease or drug-induced elevations in bilirubin. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess individual study risk of bias (ROB) and the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-Evidence Based Practice tool to assess overall strength of evidence (SOE). Two authors independently determined eligibility, performed data abstraction, assessed ROB, and determined SOE.

Results

Thirteen studies (5 low risk of bias, 3 moderate and 5 high risk) were included. We found low strength of evidence for the association between higher bilirubin levels and lower risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (2 studies), mortality (3 studies), COPD diagnosis (4 studies), and lung function (FEV 1) (8 studies). We found insufficient evidence on the relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory health status/exercise capacity (1 study) and airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC ratio) (4 studies).

Conclusion

Higher bilirubin levels may be associated with lower mortality and improved COPD outcomes. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of medications that raise serum bilirubin on COPD outcomes. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019145747.

Bilirubin was not significantly altered, confirming previous observations that identify total bilirubin as a marker with rather low sensitivity (Figure 3 A). Mass spectroscopic analysis of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids in liver tissue and plasma from wild-type and knockout mice depicted an early drop of conjugated bile acids followed by an accumulation of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids, which was absent in C5aR −/− mice (Figures 3 B and S4).

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^114cDjMN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

PREHEPATIC CAUSES Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from a derailment of the necessary bilirubin conjugation in the hepatocyte. This problem may occur before bilirubin has entered the hepatocyte or within the liver cell. Excessive heme metabolism, from hemolysis or reabsorption of a large hematoma, results in significant increases in bilirubin, which may overwhelm the conjugation process and lead to a state of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 10 Hemolytic anemias usually result in mild bilirubin elevation, to about 5 mg per dL, with or without clinical jaundice. Hemolytic anemias result from abnormal red blood cell survival times. These anemias may occur because of membrane abnormalities or enzyme abnormalities. Other etiologies of hemolysis include autoimmune disorders, drugs, and defects in hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease and the thalassemias.
11.

INTRAHEPATIC CAUSES Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia Several disorders of enzyme metabolism affect the conjugation process inside the hepatocyte, thereby impeding complete conjugation. There are varying degrees of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, depending on the severity of enzyme inhibition with each disease. 1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits. Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.
1.

Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia The predominant causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are intrahepatic cholestasis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, with the latter preventing bilirubin from moving into the intestines. Viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders are the most common causes of hepatitis. Intrahepatic inflammation disrupts transport of conjugated bilirubin and causes jaundice.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin if the transcutaneous bilirubin exceeds or is within 3 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold or if the transcutaneous bilirubin is ≥ 15 mg/dL.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117C8yTD]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^115K5C5A]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

5.5 Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury has occurred in patients treated with GILENYA in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, have occurred as early as ten days after the first dose and have also been reported after prolonged use. Cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant have been reported.

In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients, elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with GILENYA 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on GILENYA and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, GILENYA was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of GILENYA. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.

Prior to starting treatment with GILENYA (within 6 months), obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Obtain transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels periodically until two months after GILENYA discontinuation.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury. Measure liver transaminase and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range, treatment with GILENYA should be interrupted. Treatment should not be resumed if a plausible alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established, because these patients are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Because GILENYA exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^1152D5wG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

For the primary care provider, cholestatic jaundice in infancy, defined as jaundice caused by an elevated conjugated bilirubin, is an uncommon but potentially serious problem that indicates hepatobiliary dysfunction. Early detection of cholestatic jaundice by the primary care physician and timely, accurate diagnosis by the pediatric gastroenterologist are important for successful treatment and a favorable prognosis. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in the infant. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, a clinical epidemiologist (who also practices primary care pediatrics), and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature integrated with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through the Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests commonly used for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in the infant. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, indications for consultation by a pediatric gastroenterologist, and recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist. The Cholestasis Guideline Committee recommends that any infant noted to be jaundiced at 2 weeks of age be evaluated for cholestasis with measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin. However, breast-fed infants who can be reliably monitored and who have an otherwise normal history (no dark urine or light stools) and physical examination may be asked to return at 3 weeks of age and, if jaundice persists, have measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin at that time. This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics has also endorsed these recommendations. These recommendations are a general guideline and are not intended as a substitute for clinical judgment or as a protocol for the care of all patients with this problem.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (monitoring of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin within 12 hours after starting phototherapy in hospitalized infants. Guide the timing of the initial total serum bilirubin measure after starting phototherapy and the frequency of total serum bilirubin monitoring during phototherapy by the following factors:

- age of the infant

- presence of hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors

- total serum bilirubin concentration

- total serum bilirubin trajectory.

### Prognostic value of bilirubin and drug interactions [^113upVkd]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 infection entails a hyperinflammatory response. The increase in inflammatory activity may impact on indirect bilirubin levels. According to pre-clinical models, inflammation decreases UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT2B5 mRNA expression. This might be related to specific cytokine changes. Glucuronidation was inhibited 51% by IL-6 expression at 24 hours in porcine hepatocytes. As COVID-19 is associated with increased IL-6 levels, glucuronidation in COVID-19 patients is expected to be further dampened. Hence, by logic, indirect bilirubin levels increase with disease severity. There is also evidence of cholangiocyte injury due to higher ACE2 expression - a key target of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to that a substantial proportion of patients experienced GGT elevation, direct bilirubin should also increase. It is therefore interesting why only a small proportion of the cohort experienced total bilirubin elevation. An even more surprising note is that only total bilirubin elevation and hypoalbuminaemia were significantly correlated with COVID-19-related mortality. Total bilirubin elevation was not significantly associated with severe COVID-19.

Such interesting correlations can be explored further by elucidating the changes of direct and indirect bilirubin levels in patients with COVID-19. There is a possibility that the increase of either is compensated by the decrease of the other, via different mechanisms. Another point of interest is the role of drugs. The authors have commented that since at-admission (baseline) parameters were used for prognostication, drug-induced liver injury is unlikely. Adjustment was also made for comorbidities. However, since many patients have chronic diseases (arterial hypertension: 53.0%; diabetes mellitus type II: 23.5%; coronary artery disease: 19.8%), it is likely that chronic medication is taken. Such medications can introduce variations to the study findings by interacting with COVID-19-related medication, and/or causing liver injury. Moreover, drug regimens can lead to fluctuations in bilirubin levels. The importance of investigating direct and indirect bilirubin levels separately is augmented by recent studies showing that direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin/direct bilirubin ratio are predictive of disease severity.

There is thus an attraction to clarify the prognostic value of bilirubin levels in COVID-19 infection, preferably by analysing direct and indirect bilirubin levels separately.

### Serum bilirubin and risk of respiratory disease and death [^1164LyXf]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Serum total bilirubin levels in healthy patients reflect genetic and environmental factors that could influence the risk of developing respiratory disease.

Objective

To examine the relationship between bilirubin levels and respiratory disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study among 504,206 adults from a UK primary care research database (the Health Improvement Network) with serum bilirubin levels recorded but no evidence of hepatobiliary or hemolytic disease. Data were recorded between January 1988 and December 2008.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and all-cause mortality.

Results

Median bilirubin levels were 0.64 mg/dL (interquartile range, 0.47–0.88 mg/dL) in men and 0.53 mg/dL (interquartile range, 0.41–0.70 mg/dL) in women. There were 1341 cases of lung cancer, 5863 cases of COPD, and 23,103 deaths, with incidence rates of 2.5, 11.9, and 42.5 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence of lung cancer per 10,000 person-years in men was 5.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2–6.0) in the first decile category of bilirubin compared with 3.0 (95% CI, 2.3–3.8) in the fifth decile. The corresponding incidences for COPD in men were 19.5 (95% CI,17.7–21.4) and 14.4 (95% CI, 12.7–16.2). The mortality rates per 10,000 person-years in men were 51.3 (95% CI, 48.5–54.2) in the first decile category compared with 38.1 (95% CI, 35.5–40.8) in the fifth decile. The associations were similar for women. After adjusting for other important health indicators, regression estimates for incidence rate of lung cancer per 0.1-mg/dL increase in bilirubin level were an 8% decrease (95% CI, 5%-11%) for men and an 11% decrease (95% CI, 7%-14%) for women. The regression estimate for COPD in men per 0.1-mg/dL increase in bilirubin level was a 6% decrease (95% CI, 5%-7%) and for mortality in men was a 3% decrease (95% CI, 2%-3%) after accounting for other health indicators. The results for COPD and mortality in women were very similar.

Conclusion

Among patients with normal-range bilirubin levels in primary care practices, relatively higher levels of bilirubin were associated with a lower risk of respiratory disease and all-cause mortality.

Bilirubin thresholds and assay considerations in neonatal cholestasis: Jaundice or icterus is clinically evident when the total serum bilirubin level exceeds 2.5 to 3.0 mg/dL (42–51 μmol/L). Because the diazo or van den Bergh method does not specifically measure conjugated bilirubin but rather direct bilirubin, which includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin, and because the higher the total bilirubin the higher the reported direct bilirubin, specific measurement of conjugated bilirubin is preferred when available. In the presence of elevated total bilirubin, direct/conjugated bilirubin levels are considered abnormal when values are > 1.0 mg/dL (17 μmol/L) regardless of the total bilirubin; thus, for this guideline, an abnormal direct/conjugated bilirubin is defined as a serum value > 1.0 mg/dL (17 μmol/L).

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^114SK92t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the 3 total serum bilirubin ranges.

Results

Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the 3 total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < .0001). There was no significant trend in comparable sensitivity values (0.380, 0.417, and 0.241, respectively) with P = .55. The false-positive proportion also increased as a function of total serum bilirubin (17.5%, 17.3%, and 72.0%) with P < .0001. Thus, if a patient's total serum bilirubin was elevated to the point of jaundice (> 3.0 mg/dL), it was approximately 4 times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive" (ie, nitrite-positive/culture-negative) compared with those with normal serum bilirubin levels.

Conclusions

Specificity of the urine nitrite test for urinary tract infection decreases as a function of increasing serum bilirubin. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a positive nitrite test in our sample did not have an associated urinary tract infection.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia [^113RoB3n]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Jaundice, the physical finding associated with hyperbilirubinemia, results when the liver is unable to properly metabolize or excrete bilirubin. The purpose of this review is to examine some of the most common causes of jaundice in adults, provide insight into the diagnostic evaluation of jaundice, and review information on the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Recent Findings

An elevated level of bilirubin almost always indicates the presence of an underlying disease state. The best approach to evaluating a patient with jaundice is to start with a careful history and physical examination, followed by imaging assessment of the biliary tree and liver. There are algorithm models that incorporate bilirubin levels in their predictor models for outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (i.e., the model for end-stage liver disease). However, there are few studies that have examined the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Summary

Evaluation of patients with jaundice starts with a careful history and physical examination, followed by directed imaging of the biliary tree and liver. Although jaundice is generally believed to be a serious medical condition, there is little literature that addresses outcomes in patients with jaundice.

### Classification of neonatal… [^116RBqsN]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Risk Factors for Hyperbilirubinemia Infants without identified risk factors rarely have total serum bilirubin levels above 12 mg per dL. As the number of risk factors increases, the potential to develop markedly elevated bilirubin levels also increases. 2 Common risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia include fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, prematurity, and a previously affected sibling. 2–4 Cephalohematomas, bruising, and trauma from instrumented delivery may increase the risk for serum bilirubin elevation. Delayed meconium passage also increases the risk. Infants with risk factors should be monitored closely during the first days to weeks of life. The precise role of bilirubin in the development of kernicterus is not completely understood. If the serum unconjugated bilirubin level exceeds the binding capacity of albumin, unbound lipid-soluble bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Albumin-bound bilirubin may also cross the blood-brain barrier if damage has occurred because of asphyxia, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hyperosmolality, or sepsis in the newborn. 3, 8 The exact bilirubin concentration associated with kernicterus in the healthy term infant is unpredictable. 1 Toxicity levels may vary among ethnic groups, with maturation of an infant, and in the presence of hemolytic disease. Although the risk of bilirubin toxicity is probably negligible in a healthy term newborn without hemolysis, 9 the physician should become concerned if the bilirubin level is above 25 mg per dL. 1, 3, 10 In the term newborn with hemolysis, a bilirubin level above 20 mg per dL is a concern. 1, 3. Management Studies on the toxic effects of hyperbilirubinemia historically involved infants with hemolytic disease.

An increased incidence of kernicterus was found to be associated with total serum bilirubin levels above 20 mg per dL in the presence of hemolysis. 19, 20 This observation was the basis for aggressive guidelines recommending the use of exchange transfusion in all infants with significant hyperbilirubinemia. More recently, term infants without hemolysis have been found to tolerate higher total serum bilirubin levels, 21 and management guidelines now focus primarily on phototherapy as initial treatment. 1.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF NEW DATA ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PBC

Since the previous document was published, new data have emerged on approved therapies and treatment strategies with approved therapies that may improve disease management. This section will review these new data, analyze their clinical implications, and conclude with a practical treatment algorithm that incorporates these advances.

Definition of an inadequate biochemical response to UDCA

Response to UDCA has historically been assessed after 12 months of treatment according to various binary response criteria and quantitative prognostic scores. Lack of biochemical response is reported in 25%–50% of treated patients and has been associated with a > 5-fold increase in risk of progression to cirrhosis and a 3-fold increase in age-adjusted mortality. At this time, clinicians are encouraged to use 2 liver biochemistries as the anchor for clinical judgment when determining candidates for second-line therapy in PBC: ALP and bilirubin levels. If elevated above the ULN, bilirubin is more important than ALP for prognosis and in identifying advanced stage of PBC in the absence of Gilbert syndrome or another explanation. However, most patients will have elevated ALP levels rather than elevated bilirubin levels. For example, in a patient with a normal ALP, advanced fibrosis stage, and bilirubin > ULN, adding a second-line therapy can be considered. Additional factors to consider include the patient's age and acceptance of additional medications.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Serum bilirubin and risk of respiratory disease and death… [^113okhnX]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Serum total bilirubin is routinely measured in the primary care setting to identify hepatobiliary and hemolytic diseases. After excluding disease, moderately increased levels generally indicate benign hereditary hyperbilirubinemia. This common condition is caused by a deficiency in the liver enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronosyltransferase 1, which converts insoluble bilirubin to a form suitable for renal and biliary excretion.
1. Although bilirubin levels are highly heritable and genetic variation of UGT1A1 explains a large proportion of the variability, 2 enzymes involved with bilirubin production from heme, including heme oxygenase, may also exert an influence. 3 Elevated heme oxygenase activity, caused by genetic variation or environmental factors. Exposure. Serum total bilirubin level in patients without evidence of liver or hemolytic disease was the exposure variable.

Based on the observed frequency distributions, published reference ranges, and levels observed in healthy individuals with the genotype underlying Gilbert syndrome, 10 patients with bilirubin values below 0. 18 mg/dL for both sexes and exceeding
2. 34 mg/dL for men and 1. 75 mg/dL for women were excluded. Factors significantly associated with higher bilirubin levels in men were younger age, nonsmoking status, moderate or high alcohol consumption, lower BMI, higher systolic blood pressure, and lower levels of social deprivation. Similar associations were observed for women. In the subset of patients who were current smokers during follow-up, both intensity and duration of smoking were inversely associated with bilirubin levels.

Based on our findings, bilirubin levels within the normal range appear to capture information about patients that may reflect a combination of environmental and genetically determined susceptibility to respiratory diseases. 5 The strength of the associations seemed to weaken above 1 mg/dL for all outcomes, although significantly so only for mortality, which could reflect a real dose-response relationship with only a marginal physiological benefit beyond levels typically associated with Gilbert syndrome. However, the slight increase in mortality rates for women beyond 1 mg/dL could also indicate inclusion of some hepatobiliary disease cases.

### Are unexpected positive dipstick urine bilirubin results clinically significant? A retrospective review [^113PVjaR]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urine-bilirubin measurement is common in urinalysis dipsticks, which are known to yield a high rate of false positive results. We evaluated the usefulness of this test after multiple physicians in our system reported that they do not act on positive dipstick urine bilirubin findings.

Methods

We queried past records to determine how many samples with positive urine bilirubin results had associated abnormal results for liver function tests (LFTs) within 2 weeks before the positive urine bilirubin result. (LFTs included aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and total bilirubin.) We labeled positive results on these test as expected positives. We labeled the positive test results for samples from patients who had not had abnormal LFT results within 2 weeks before the current testing as unexpected positives.

Results

During a 20-month period, we performed 241,929 urine-bilirubin tests. Of these, 831 (0.3%) yielded positive results. Of these positives, 60% were from patients who had abnormal LFT results in the previous 2 weeks. The remaining 40% of positive results were deemed to be unexpected positives. Of these, 80% had had LFTs ordered within 2 weeks after the positive urine bilirubin results. A total of 85% of those LFTs yielded an abnormal result.

Conclusion

In patients with an unexpected positive urine bilirubin test result, 85% had abnormal LFT results after their positive urine bilirubin result. However, these unexpected positives amounted to only 0.13% of all test results. Urine bilirubin does not appear to add significant information toward the diagnosis of most patients.
