## Question

3. How many five-digit natural numbers have the sum of the quotient and remainder when divided by 100 divisible by 11?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many five-digit natural numbers have the sum of the quotient and remainder when divided by 100 divisible by 11. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the range of five-digit numbers and how division by 100 decomposes them into quotient and remainder. Then, I should verify the divisibility condition and translate it into a modular constraint on the original number. Next, I will count how many numbers in the five-digit range satisfy that constraint, being careful with endpoints. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the scope: five-digit natural numbers range from 10000 to 99999, inclusive, so there are 90000 such numbers. I should keep that total in mind as a sanity check for the final answer [^notfound].

> Now, for any five-digit number N, dividing by 100 gives a quotient q and a remainder r such that N = 100q + r, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 99 and q is an integer. Wait, let me verify the bounds on q: since 10000 ≤ N ≤ 99999, we have 100 ≤ q ≤ 999, which gives 900 possible quotients, matching the 900 hundreds-blocks in the five-digit range [^notfound].

> The condition is that q + r is divisible by 11. Substituting r = N − 100q, I get q + (N − 100q) = N − 99q ≡ 0 (mod 11). Simplifying, N ≡ 99q (mod 11). But 99 ≡ 0 (mod 11), so this reduces to N ≡ 0 (mod 11). Hold on, I should verify that simplification: yes, 99 is a multiple of 11, so 99q ≡ 0 (mod 11), and thus N ≡ 0 (mod 11) is the correct constraint [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how many five-digit numbers are divisible by 11. The smallest five-digit multiple of 11 is 10010 and the largest is 99990. The count is given by (last − first)/11 + 1, which equals (99990 − 10010)/11 + 1 = 89980/11 + 1 = 8180 + 1 = 8181. Wait, let me double-check the division: 89980 ÷ 11 is indeed 8180, so adding 1 gives 8181 multiples of 11 in the five-digit range [^notfound].

> I should confirm that this aligns with the total range. With 90000 five-digit numbers, the expected density of multiples of 11 is about 1/11, and 90000/11 ≈ 8181.82, so 8181 is consistent with that expectation, which reassures me the calculation is correct [^notfound].

> Therefore, the number of five-digit natural numbers for which the sum of the quotient and remainder when divided by 100 is divisible by 11 is 8181 [^notfound].

---

The answer is **8181** five-digit numbers satisfy the condition that the sum of the quotient and remainder when divided by 100 is divisible by 11. This follows because the condition simplifies to the number itself being divisible by 11, and there are 8181 five-digit multiples of 11.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let (N) be a five-digit natural number. When (N) is divided by 100, we can express it as:

[
N = 100q + r
]

where:

- (q) is the quotient (an integer),
- (r) is the remainder, with (0 \\leq r < 100).

The condition given is that the sum of the quotient and remainder is divisible by 11:

[
q + r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}
]

---

## Substitution and simplification

Substitute (r = N - 100q) into the condition:

[
q + (N - 100q) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}
]

Simplify the expression:

[
N - 99q \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}
]

Since (99 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}), the equation reduces to:

[
N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}
]

This means that (N) itself must be divisible by 11.

## Counting five-digit numbers divisible by 11

Five-digit numbers range from 10000 to 99999. We need to count how many numbers in this range are divisible by 11.

- The smallest five-digit multiple of 11 is 10010 (since (10000 \\div 11 \\approx 909.09), so the next integer is 910, and (910 \\times 11 = 10010)).
- The largest five-digit multiple of 11 is 99990 (since (99999 \\div 11 \\approx 9090.81), so the largest integer is 9090, and (9090 \\times 11 = 99990)).

The number of multiples of 11 in this range is given by:

[
\\text{Number of multiples} = \\frac{99990–10010}{11} + 1 = \\frac{89980}{11} + 1 = 8180 + 1 = 8181
]

---

## Conclusion

Therefore, there are **8181** five-digit natural numbers for which the sum of the quotient and remainder when divided by 100 is divisible by 11.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^21ae0208]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The “Sufficiency” Requirement and the Issue of Redundancy

The actual difficulty of each item is only roughly estimated with TTT. Could we better know this difficulty level, we might predict, given the total score achieved by a subject, which is the score expected in each item (see the ideal Guttmann pattern on Table 1 A) and vice versa. This property is called “sufficiency.” Suppose two or more items share the same difficulty level. In that case, they indicate the same overall ability level: if their scores are summed anyway, as in the case of TTT, then an illusion of a greater ability is by fault considered.

Take the following simplistic example of a 6-item math test. A score of 1 is given to each correct answer; 0 is assigned to wrong responses.

A) 3 + 2 =?; B) 5–4 =?; C) 4*5 =?; D) 9/3 =?; E) 6/2 =?; F) 4/1 =?

It is clear that once the respondent can answer correctly to item D, the first of the three divisions, he/she will likely answer correctly also to items E and F, the other two divisions (all with 1-digit factors and an integer quotient). The respondent will get three score points for the same ability level (“ability to solve this kind of division”). His/her score will artificially jump from 3 to 6. This “jackpot” passes easily undetected in many questionnaires but makes it hazardous to compare changes within and between subjects. Rasch analysis solves this problem elegantly.

### Children's arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics [^d69103fa]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Maths curricula taught in primary school ought to provide children with the concepts and skills that they need both for their daily lives and as a foundation for learning the higher maths required to succeed in school at more advanced levels. Too often, however, formal schooling fails to achieve either of these goals. In India, in 2023, only half of the children enrolled in grades 11 and 12 (16–18 years of age) could divide a three-digit number by a single-digit number. Globally, learning outcomes remain poor despite large increases in school enrolment in many low-to-middle-income countries,.

Moreover, children seem even less likely to be able to use basic arithmetic skills in everyday life. A recent study in India, for example, found that only half of the children enrolled in grades 11 and 12 could calculate how many purifying tablets to use in a large pot after they were given the number they needed for a smaller pot. Notably, 35% of the children who were able to solve an abstract division problem failed this verbal exercise.

However, many children in low-to-middle-income countries, for instance, those who work in markets, seem to routinely perform more involved calculations as part of their daily jobs. For example, a study in the 1980s of five children who worked as street vendors (mean age of 11 years) in Brazil found that these children ably and flexibly used maths in their work. These findings are in line with ethnographic studies of adults with minimal formal education who also exhibit these abilities –. Moreover, decades of research –, mostly in Western countries, have shown that children can adeptly combine small sets to create exact larger numbers well before schooling beginsand that their facility of learning maths in primary school is associated with their sensitivity to approximate number in later years of schooling. A prominent theory in cognitive psychology suggests that learning maths in meaningful real-world contexts can complement maths learnt in the classroom and provide children with more generalizable and flexible arithmetic skills,. By learning and practising maths through relevant contexts, children may be better equipped to acquire the flexible cognitive skills they need to transfer maths knowledge across domains.

### The history of risk: a review [^4d04ae48]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fibonacci’s solution to the “rabbit breeding theory” set the foundation of a historic mathematical miracle (Fig. 3). In brief, there is one pair of rabbits in 1 month, one additional pair of rabbits as first offspring from the original pair, three in 3 months (an additional couple from the original pair), five in 4 months (with the first offspring now breeding as well), followed by eight, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and a total of 233 pairs of rabbits at the end of the first year. This sequence of numbers represents the essence of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number represents the sum of the two preceding numbers. The mathematical magic about this simple series of numbers is that the “divine proportion” (golden ratio) sought by Aristotle in ancient Greece as a philosophical concept of a “desirable middle between two extremes, one of excess and the other of deficiency” is calculated by dividing any number in the Fibonacci sequence, after number 144, by its preceding number. The result will always be 1.618—the mathematical constant PHI (Fig. 2). In general terms, the golden mean implies a perfect moderate position that avoids extremes, e.g. as a ratio between the two divisions of a line such that the ratio of the smaller to the larger is identical to the ratio of the larger to the sum of both lines. We encounter the golden ratio every day in arts, culture, religion (for example in the cross of Christ), and in multiplicity of phenomena in mathematics, science, and nature, including in plants and animals.

### How 15 hundred is like 15 cherries: effect of progressive alignment on representational changes in numerical cognition [^ca3b60f3]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

How does understanding the decimal system change with age and experience? Second, third, sixth graders, and adults (Experiment 1: N = 96, mean ages = 7.9, 9.23, 12.06, and 19.96 years, respectively) made number line estimates across 3 scales (0-1,000, 0-10,000, and 0-100,000). Generation of linear estimates increased with age but decreased with numerical scale. Therefore, the authors hypothesized highlighting commonalities between small and large scales (15:100::1500:10000) might prompt children to generalize their linear representations to ever-larger scales. Experiment 2 assigned second graders (N = 46, mean age = 7.78 years) to experimental groups differing in how commonalities of small and large numerical scales were highlighted. Only children experiencing progressive alignment of small and large scales successfully produced linear estimates on increasingly larger scales, suggesting analogies between numeric scales elicit broad generalization of linear representations.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four,works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9.Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t=30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t=−0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule,whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41-75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Could driving help us to "see better"? A comparative assessment of saccadic efficiency, visual speed, and attention [^6defead6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

ADEMd

The Adult Developmental Eye Movement test with distractors (ADEMd) consists of four sheets of size 11 Times New Roman font numbers presented in DIN-A4, equivalent to a Snellen resolution of 20/80 when presented at 40 cm. Two of the sheets contain 40 numbers (two digits) vertically aligned and distributed across two columns widely separated (20 number spaces separation) and twenty rows (two numbers per row), and the other two sheets contain the same 80 numbers horizontally aligned and distributed across ten columns and sixteen rows (five numbers per row unevenly distributed). The numbers of the horizontal sheets are presented in a different order compared to the vertical sheets; both horizontal sheets include the same numbers distributed in the same order.

The extremes of the numbers of the columns of the vertical sheets subtend an angle of 20.9º vertically and 17.3º horizontally when viewed at 45 centimeters. The vertical angular separation between numbers is 1.2º, which is an area that falls within the central retina. The extremes of the numbers of the lines of the horizontal sheets subtend an angle of 17.1º vertically and 17.4º horizontally when viewed at 45 centimeters. The horizontal angular separation between characters varies from 1.91º to 9.78º, with a mean value of 4.39 ± 1.93º. One of both horizontal sheets includes the letters “H”, “M”, “T”, “V”, and “X” between the numbers filling all the free spaces (five letters per row). All four sheets can be seen in Fig. 1.

### The fibonacci sequence: relationship to the human hand [^a387acdc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The motion path of the digits follows the path of an equiangular spiral in which a constant angle is formed by all radial vectors along the curve. This implies that the lengths of the metacarpals, proximal, middle, and distal phalanges approximate a Fibonacci sequence in which the ratio of any 2 consecutive numbers approaches the number 1.61803 (phi). This study tested the hypothesis that the metacarpal and phalangeal bone lengths follow the Fibonacci relationship.

Methods

Standardized x-rays were taken of the hands of 100 healthy volunteers. The proximal phalanx length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and distal phalanges and the metacarpal length was subtracted from the sum of the lengths of the middle and proximal phalanges. Confidence intervals for the quotients of the measured lengths of the adjacent bones of the hand also were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Only 1 of 12 bone length ratios contained the ratio phi in the 95% confidence interval, that of the small finger metacarpal and proximal phalanx. The largest variability was seen in the small finger phalangeal relationships.

Conclusion

The application of the Fibonacci sequence to the anatomy of the human hand, although previously accepted, is a relationship that is not supported mathematically. The difference between individual bone lengths as measured at the joint line and the center of rotation of the joints may explain our finding.

### Long-term effects of compulsory schooling on physical, mental and cognitive ageing: a natural experiment [^9042a05c]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

In Constances, mental health was measured using the 20-item version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D),a validated depressive symptoms scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms and a cut-off of 16 for men and 20 for women was used to define elevated levels of depressive symptoms.

Cognitive function was assessed by trained neuropsychologists using five tests.The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a general test of cognitive function consisting of 30 questions assessing five areas of cognition: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The Digit-Symbol Substitution Task of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale IV assesses psychomotor speed. The respondents were presented with nine digit-symbol pairs, followed by a list of numerical digits. They were asked to write the corresponding symbol under each digit as fast as possible. We retain the number of symbols correctly associated in 90 s.The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) measures verbal episodic memory. Respondents were first asked to read and memorise 16 words, then asked to recall as many words as possible in 2 min. The neuropsychologist provided a cue for each word that has not been retrieved. For this study, we include the FCSRT free immediate recall score. Finally, two verbal fluency tasks were included to assess language abilities: number of words related to the ‘animals’ category named in 1 min for the semantic fluency task and number of words starting with the letter ‘R’ named in 1 min for the phonemic fluency task. As the scale of each individual cognitive test differs, each score is converted to a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD. A global cognitive score is obtained by summing the standardised tests. High cognitive performance is defined as the top quartile of the global score’s distribution.

Physical functioning is assessed based on three objective health measures. Hand grip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Participants were asked to sit and squeeze the dynamometer for a few seconds with their dominant hand. The exercise was repeated three times and grip strength was determined as the average of the three results. Finger tapping, a measure of motor performance, was assessed by the number of taps respondents could do with the index finger of their dominant hand for 15 s. Walking speed was measured as the time taken by respondents to walk 3 m at a rapid pace. For each physical health outcome, high levels of physical functioning are defined based on the top quartile of the distribution.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

### A magnitude code common to numerosities and number symbols in human intraparietal cortex [^f299ca27]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Activation of the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) has been observed in various number-processing tasks, whether numbers were conveyed by symbolic numerals (digits, number words) or by nonsymbolic displays (dot patterns). This suggests an abstract coding of numerical magnitude. Here, we critically tested this hypothesis using fMRI adaptation to demonstrate notation-independent coding of numerical quantity in the hIPS. Once subjects were adapted either to dot patterns or to Arabic digits, activation in the hIPS and in frontal regions recovered in a distance-dependent fashion whenever a new number was presented, irrespective of notation changes. This remained unchanged when analyzing the hIPS peaks from an independent localizer scan of mental calculation. These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities.

### Symbolic arithmetic knowledge without instruction [^d0ca42f7]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is fundamental to science, technology and economics, but its acquisition by children typically requires years of effort, instruction and drill. When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.

### Aging and numerosity estimation [^297d038c]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

In two experiments, young and older participants were asked to find the approximate number of dots in collections including between 40 and 460 dots. Experiment 1 showed that both age groups had comparable performance and no age-related differences in the power-function exponents for numerosity. Experiment 2 found that these age-related similarities were not due to speed-accuracy trade-offs or to compensation by older adults for potential age-related decline in numerosity estimation processes. Furthermore, young and older participants' estimation performance was influenced by physical features of stimuli only for very large numerosities, presumably because these are poorly represented in long-term memory. Implications of these findings for the further understanding of how participants accomplish numerosity estimation tasks and effects of aging in this domain are discussed.

Reference space definition for quantitative imaging states that “It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space … as the starting point for analysis and endpoint for data reporting.” Ratio-only expressions are vulnerable to the “reference trap,” where changes can stem from numerator, denominator, or both. “An efficient way of measuring volume, point counting, is used to quantify acinar components by micro-CT and extrapulmonary organ volume by CT,” a forerunner of voxel-by-voxel volume summation by computed tomography (CT).

### Calculation impairment in neurodegenerative diseases [^54dd331e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2003). Low credibility.

We examined oral calculation in patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD; N=17), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; N=17), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; N=20), as well as 17 healthy seniors matched for age and education. Our calculation model involves at least three components: numerosity, combinatorial processes, and executive resources such as working memory. We assessed addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division involving small numbers (small, single-digit answers) and large numbers (larger, single- and double-digit answers). We also assessed dot counting for small numbers (2-5) and large numbers (6-9), as well as a measure of working memory. All patient groups differed from healthy seniors in oral calculation. CBD (36% correct) and FTD (65% correct) demonstrated a significant overall impairment in oral calculation relative to AD (76% correct). CBD (66% correct) had more difficulty counting dots overall relative to AD (94% correct) and FTD (86% correct), consistent with our hypothesis that the calculation deficit in CBD is due in large part to a numerosity deficit. FTD had more difficulty relative to AD in their performance of reverse digit span, consistent with our hypothesis that FTD patients' executive resource limitation contributes to their pattern of calculation impairment.

### An amplitude code transmits information at a visual synapse [^6861f2f4]. Nature Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Most neurons transmit information digitally using spikes that trigger the release of synaptic vesicles with low probability. The first stages of vision and hearing are distinct in that they operate with analog signals, but it is unclear how these are recoded for synaptic transmission. By imaging the release of glutamate in live zebrafish, we demonstrate that ribbon synapses of retinal bipolar cells encode contrast through changes in both the frequency and amplitude of release events. Higher contrasts caused multiple vesicles to be released within an event, and such coding by amplitude often continued after the rate code had reached a maximum frequency. Glutamate packets equivalent to five vesicles transmitted four times as many bits of information per vesicle compared with those released individually. By discretizing analog signals into sequences of numbers up to about 11, ribbon synapses can increase the dynamic range, temporal precision and efficiency with which visual information is transmitted.

### Number representations drive number-line estimates [^6bf63201]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The number-line task has been extensively used to study the mental representation of numbers in children. However, studies suggest that proportional reasoning provides a better account of children's performance. Ninety 4- to 6-year-olds were given a number-line task with symbolic numbers, with clustered dot arrays that resembled a perceptual scaling task, or with spread-out dot arrays that involved numerical estimation. Children performed well with clustered dot arrays, but poorly with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays. Performances with symbolic numbers and spread-out dot arrays were highly correlated and were related to counting skill; neither was true for clustered dot arrays. Overall, results provide evidence for the role of mental representation of numbers in the symbolic number-line task.

### Phase-encoded fMRI tracks down brainstorms of natural language processing with subsecond precision [^4c36edac]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Similar to the monolingual sessions, stimuli for the translation session were either visually or auditorily presented. Subjects would read silently or listen to a sentence in one language (Phase 1), and then orally translate it into the other language (Phase 2) when a mouth cue appeared. This was followed by a 6‐s blank screen between 10 and 16 s (Phase R; Figure 2e,f).

The translation session consisted of twelve 256‐s functional scans, two scans for each of the six different tasks:
Scan #1: Reading the visually presented Chinese sentence silently, memorizing it, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #2: Listening to the auditorily presented Chinese sentence, memorizing it, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #3: Listening to five‐digit number in Chinese, memorizing it, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #4: Reading the visually presented Chinese sentence silently, memorizing, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #5: Listening to the auditorily presented Chinese sentence, memorizing it, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #6: Listening to five‐digit number in Chinese, memorizing it, then orally translating it into English (L1‐to‐L2);
Scan #7: Reading the visually presented English sentence silently, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1);
Scan #8: Listening to the auditorily presented English sentence, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1);
Scan #9: Listening to the five‐digit number in English, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1);
Scan #10: Reading the visually presented English sentence silently, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1);
Scan #11: Listening to the auditorily presented English sentence, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1);
Scan #12: Listening to the five‐digit number in English, memorizing it, then orally translating it into Chinese (L2‐to‐L1).

### Representational format determines numerical competence in monkeys [^840aefc5]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

A range of animal species possess an evolutionarily ancient system for representing number, which provides the foundation for simple arithmetical operations such as addition and numerical comparisons. Surprisingly, non-human primates tested in ecologically, highly valid quantity discrimination tasks using edible items often show a relatively low performance, suggesting that stimulus salience interferes with rational decision making. Here we show that quantity discrimination was indeed significantly enhanced when monkeys were tested with inedible items compared with food items (84 versus 69% correct). More importantly, when monkeys were tested with food, but rewarded with other food items, the accuracy was equally high (86%). The results indicate that the internal representation of the stimuli, not their physical quality, determined performance. Reward replacement apparently facilitated representation of the food items as signifiers for other foods, which in turn supported a higher acuity in decision making.

### Numerical magnitude representations influence arithmetic learning [^8f04dd6c]. Child Development (2008). Low credibility.

This study examined whether the quality of first graders' (mean age = 7.2 years) numerical magnitude representations is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to their arithmetic learning. The children's pretest numerical magnitude representations were found to be correlated with their pretest arithmetic knowledge and to be predictive of their learning of answers to unfamiliar arithmetic problems. The relation to learning of unfamiliar problems remained after controlling for prior arithmetic knowledge, short-term memory for numbers, and math achievement test scores. Moreover, presenting randomly chosen children with accurate visual representations of the magnitudes of addends and sums improved their learning of the answers to the problems. Thus, representations of numerical magnitude are both correlationally and causally related to arithmetic learning.

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled “index scores” gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the “total scale score”. Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### Increased intra-individual variability among individuals with ADHD: first evidence from numerosity judgment and verbal and quantitative reasoning [^5a80e075]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials

The PET is a high-stakes standardized test administered in a pencil-and-paper format. It comprises approximately 130 multiple-choice questions and lasts about three hours. The test assesses cognitive abilities in verbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning, together with proficiency in English as a Foreign Language. Each of the three domains is assessed by means of two different but equivalent chapters, each having a similar structure. The quantitative reasoning domain consists of quantitative problems and graphical inference (20 items in total in each chapter). The verbal reasoning domain consists of analogies, inference items, and reading comprehension (23 items in total in each chapter). The English Language domain consists of sentence completions, analogous restatements, and reading comprehension (22 items in total in each chapter). The online Supplementary Materials display several examples of items used in the PET.

ADHD diagnosis

The present study examined the data of 3243 examinees with a diagnosis of ADHD who had applied for, and received, test accommodations when sitting the PET. The ADHD diagnosis was confirmed (by NITE's experts at the point at which examinees had applied for accommodations) on the basis of a previously obtained diagnosis made by a licensed professional, in accordance with the Israeli Ministry of Health's current guidelines for assessing ADHD in adults. The assessment involved adherence to DSM-5 (APA,) criteria, administrating ADHD rating scales and supplemental tests, conducting a physical examination, and excluding other potential (differential) diagnoses.

To be eligible for test accommodations, individuals had had to meet strict criteria and provide extensive documentation confirming the following: (a) the onset of ADHD symptoms before the age of 12; and (b) significant impairment in academic, social, occupational, or other areas of performance due to these symptoms. Examinees who received accommodations were allowed a five-minute break after every two chapters. Some of them were also provided with an enlarged answer sheet and basic calculators.

### Distinct roles of delta-and theta-band neural tracking for sharpening and predictive coding of multi-level speech features during spoken language processing [^296c0f7e]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.5.2 Cross‐validation and testing

Artefact‐free trials were first divided into training sets and testing sets. Here, for each stimulus type, we partitioned the trials into five subsets with each subset having the same or similar number of trials (same number of trials was not always guaranteed because the total number of artefact‐free trials may not be divisible by five). A training–testing procedure was then run for five times, each of which used one subset as the testing set with the remaining trials as the training set (hence the ratio of trial numbers of training:testing was 4:1). On average, there were 48.6 (12.15), 47.96 (11.99) and 48.28 (12.07) trials for the training (testing in the brackets) for real‐words, pseudo‐words and time‐reversed speech, respectively. EEG reconstruction accuracies were obtained via such procedure and the final accuracy was taken as the average over the five times. This thus made sure that all trials had the equal opportunity to be both training and testing trials, so that biases between individual trials were minimised. Concerns may also be raised that these trial numbers for training may not result in robust neural tracking. To relieve this concern, we conducted additional analyses using different percentages of the number of training trials (60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%) to see how many trials are needed to obtain stable and consistent tracking. Subsequently, we found that the overall patterns (i.e. how reconstruction accuracies differ between stimulus types) are fairly consistent with the current findings even when the number of training trials is as low as 60% of the total number. Stable statistical patterns can be obtained based on >80% of the training trials (i.e. ~40 trials) with accuracies comparable to previous reports that used lengthy audiobooks as stimuli (Di Liberto et al.; Di Liberto & Lalor,; see Supplementary Materials S1). This therefore in part validates the result robustness based on the current number of training trials (please see Section 4.4 for further explanations and discussions).

### Preschool children's mapping of number words to nonsymbolic numerosities [^72dde74c]. Child Development (2005). Low credibility.

Five-year-old children categorized as skilled versus unskilled counters were given verbal estimation and number word comprehension tasks with numerosities 20-120. Skilled counters showed a linear relation between number words and nonsymbolic numerosities. Unskilled counters showed the same linear relation for smaller numbers to which they could count, but not for larger number words. Further tasks indicated that unskilled counters failed even to correctly order large number words differing by a 2 : 1 ratio, whereas they performed well on this task with smaller numbers, and performed well on a nonsymbolic ordering task with the same numerosities. These findings provide evidence that large, approximate numerosity representations become linked to number words around the time that children learn to count to those words reliably.

### Convergent and discriminative validity of the frail-VIG index with the EQ-5D-3L in people cared for in primary health care [^e806e1a5]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Variables and data measurements

We used the EQ-5D-3L to measure HRQoL which is one of the most widely used measurement instruments. It is a generic measurement instrument because it measures HRQoL in a way that can be used across different types of patients, health conditions, and treatments. This instrument comprises two parts. The first part consists of five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. Unique health status is defined by combining a level of each of the five dimensions resulting in a five-digit number, with 11,111 reflecting the best possible health status and 33,333 the worst. The second part of the instrument is the EQ VAS which comprises a visual analogue scale from 0 (the worst health imaginable) to 100 (the best health imaginable). EQ-5D-3L is designed for self-completion by respondents, but several other modes of administration (interview administered, face-to-face interview, or telephone interview) are also possible. Existing research has established that self-completion and assisted completion produce equivalent scores overall and therefore both methods can be used. For the present study we used the Spanish face-to-face interview version as a large majority of the participants were unable to read and write.

Frailty was measured using the original Spanish version of Frail-VIG index. It is composed of 22 items that evaluate 25 deficits based on the comprehensive geriatric assessment. It is constructed using only variables recorded during the usual clinical evaluation process. The value of the index is obtained from the sum of the identified deficits divided by 25, the total number of potential deficits, so the higher the presence of deficits the higher the score in the index. Likewise, different index cut-off points have been established that distinguish between four degrees of frailty: non-frailty, < 0.20; mild, 0.20 to 0.35; moderate, 0.36 to 0.50 and severe > 0.50.

Researchers developed an instruction manual for the administration of instruments. Trained PHC nurses administered both instruments during face-to-face assessments in a participant’s home during usual care. These interviews had an average duration of 30 min. A pilot test with 20 participants was also carried out to detect possible problems and to introduce improvement strategies. After this pilot test, no changes in the procedure were necessary.

### Neuropsychological test performance of cognitively healthy centenarians: normative data from the Dutch 100-plus study [^20e141ec]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Normative Data and Cognitive Test Performance In Centenarians

Per test, the number of centenarians whose test performance was used to generate normative data is shown in Table 2. Centenarians with poor to very poor vision (21%) and hearing (11%) were excluded for tests for which these faculties were required.

We present percentiles and means of all test scores stratified by education level to define the normative data (Table 3). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the performances on each test. Overall, most test scores showed wide distributions, while the VAT, Number Location, and the CDT had strong ceiling effects (Table 3). Correlations between the test scores are displayed in the supplement.

Multiple Linear Regression Analyses With Sex, Age, and Education as Independent Variables and Cognitive Test Outcome as Dependent Variable

Association of Education, Sex, and Age With Cognitive Test Performance

Across all tests, education level was positively associated with test performance when adjusted for age and sex. Exceptions to this are the RBMT delayed recall and TMT A and B. Males obtained higher scores on the Digit Span Forward (mean ± SD = 7.7 ± 1.8 vs 6.9 ± 1.8) and the Key Search (mean ± SD = 8.1 ± 4.1 vs 6.1 ± 3.3) relative to females. On the other hand, males performed worse on the Letter Fluency (mean ± SD = 22.9 ± 10.6 vs 25.0 ± 10.4). Age was only associated with the performance on the TMT A when adjusted for sex and education. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 4.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Digit loss in archosaur evolution and the interplay between selection and constraints [^97190fc1]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Evolution involves interplay between natural selection and developmental constraints. This is seen, for example, when digits are lost from the limbs during evolution. Extant archosaurs (crocodiles and birds) show several instances of digit loss under different selective regimes, and show limbs with one, two, three, four or the ancestral number of five digits. The 'lost' digits sometimes persist for millions of years as developmental vestiges. Here we examine digit loss in the Nile crocodile and five birds, using markers of three successive stages of digit development. In two independent lineages under different selection, wing digit I and all its markers disappear. In contrast, hindlimb digit V persists in all species sampled, both as cartilage, and as Sox9- expressing precartilage domains, 250million years after the adult digit disappeared. There is therefore a mismatch between evolution of the embryonic and adult phenotypes. All limbs, regardless of digit number, showed similar expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Even in the one-fingered emu wing, expression of posterior genes Hoxd11 and Hoxd12 was conserved, whereas expression of anterior genes Gli3 and Alx4 was not. We suggest that the persistence of digit V in the embryo may reflect constraints, particularly the conserved posterior gene networks associated with the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The more rapid and complete disappearance of digit I may reflect its ZPA-independent specification, and hence, weaker developmental constraints. Interacting with these constraints are selection pressures for limb functions such as flying and perching. This model may help to explain the diverse patterns of digit loss in tetrapods. Our study may also help to understand how selection on adults leads to changes in development.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### Development of numerical estimation in young children [^944be78f]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

Two experiments examined kindergartners', first graders', and second graders' numerical estimation, the internal representations that gave rise to the estimates, and the general hypothesis that developmental sequences within a domain tend to repeat themselves in new contexts. Development of estimation in this age range on 0-to-100 number lines followed the pattern observed previously with older children on 0-to-1,000 lines. Between kindergarten and second grade (6 and 8 years), patterns of estimates progressed from consistently logarithmic to a mixture of logarithmic and linear to a primarily linear pattern. Individual differences in number-line estimation correlated strongly with math achievement test scores, improved estimation accuracy proved attributable to increased linearity of estimates, and exposure to relevant experience tended to improve estimation accuracy.

### Methane from microbial hydrogenolysis of sediment organic matter before the great oxidation event [^8d178690]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Reaction equation Eq. 8 is expanded to the scheme in Fig. 3a to quantify the five most abundant isotopologues in methane (three or more substitutions such as 13 CH 2 D 2 or 12 CHD 3 are ignored due to their low abundances). For the subscripts in Fig. 3a (m, i, and j in r amij or r bmij), the first digit (m = 0 or 1) is the number of 13 C atoms involved in the reaction, the second digit (i = 0, 1, or 2) is the number of deuterium atoms connected in the methylene or methyl group, and the third digit (j = 0 or 1) is the number of deuterium atoms in the hydrogen donor.

Clumped isotopic compositions of methylene and methane are defined as the following:

Note that the isotopic compositions here are expressed in decimals; they should be multiplied by 1000 to give per mil values.

The deuterium isotope ratio between the hydrogen donor (denoted with subscript B) and the methylene group (subscript A) is expressed as:

For each reaction step in Fig. 3a, the corresponding rate constants are denoted as k amij for step a or k bmij for step b. Kinetic fractionation factors α k amij = k amij / k a 000 and α ﻿kbmij = k bmij / k b 000 define KIEs. Note that a DKIE is often expressed as k H / k D, which is the reciprocal of the α k nomenclature here. A DKIE may be primary or secondary; a primary DKIE results in α k a 001 ≠ 1 and α k b 001 ≠ 1, and a secondary one results in α k a 010 ≠ 1 and α k b 010 ≠ 1. Kinetic clumped isotope fractionation factors γ amij = α k amij /(α k a 100 m α k a 010 i α k a 001 j) and γ bmij = α k bmij / (α k b 100 m α k b 010 i α k b 001 j) define the excessive KIE due to isotope clumping in steps a and b, respectively.

Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score

The ATRS has been developed to evaluate patient-reported outcome after the treatment of acute total Achilles tendon rupture. The score consists of ten items focusing on one dimension related to symptoms and physical activity. Each item can be graded on a scale of 0 to 10. A summation of the grades gives a total score, ranging from 0 to 100, where a lower score represents greater physical limitation.

EuroQoL-5 Dimension Questionnaire

The EQ-5D covers five dimensions, including mobility, self-care, everyday activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and each dimension has one item. Each item is rated by the patient according to a three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale presenting a five-digit number to reflect health state and the level in each dimension. In this study, the EQ-5D-3L was used; there are 3 5 = 243 different possible health states from which a preference-based single index (utility value) can be derived. The single index is obtained by comparing the five-digit number with the average health state valuation of a population sample generated with the time trade-off (TTO) method or visual analogue scale (VAS) method. The EQ-5D single index ranges from 0 to 1 (although negative values are possible), with 0 regarded as “equal to death” and 1 as “the best imaginable health state”.

### Numerical magnitude in the human parietal lobe ; tests of representational generality and domain specificity [^c0d597a7]. Neuron (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral evidence suggests that human adults have a single system for representing the numerical magnitude of both symbolic numbers (e.g., Arabic digits) and nonsymbolic number stimuli (e.g., dot arrays). Brain imaging studies have implicated a specific parietal region in symbolic number processing, leading to the influential hypothesis that this region is the locus of a dedicated, domain-specific number system. Here we evaluated a prediction of this hypothesis, that this region should be activated not only by symbolic but also nonsymbolic number processing. Using nonsymbolic stimuli, we tested for higher parietal activations for number than for nonnumber comparison tasks (experiment 1), fMRI adaptation for numerosity repetition (experiment 2), and greater fMRI increases with increasing task difficulty for number than nonnumber tasks (experiment 3). None of these predictions were supported by the data, posing a serious challenge to the hypothesis that a single, domain-specific parietal region underlies both symbolic and nonsymbolic number representation.

### First and second graders successfully reason about ratios with both dot arrays and Arabic numerals [^50c54e29]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Children struggle with exact, symbolic ratio reasoning, but prior research demonstrates children show surprising intuition when making approximate, nonsymbolic ratio judgments. In the current experiment, eighty-five 6- to 8-year-old children made approximate ratio judgments with dot arrays and numerals. Children were adept at approximate ratio reasoning in both formats and improved with age. Children who engaged in the nonsymbolic task first performed better on the symbolic task compared to children tested in the reverse order, suggesting that nonsymbolic ratio reasoning may function as a scaffold for symbolic ratio reasoning. Nonsymbolic ratio reasoning mediated the relation between children's numerosity comparison performance and symbolic mathematics performance in the domain of probabilities, but numerosity comparison performance explained significant unique variance in general numeration skills.

### End-digit preference in blood pressure recordings of patients with ischaemic heart disease in primary care [^c6f80220]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

End-digit preference describes the disproportionate selection of specific end digits. The rounding of figures might lead to either an under- or over-recording of blood pressure (BP) and a lack of accuracy and reliability in treatment decisions. A total of 85 000 BP values taken from computerised general practice records of ischaemic heart disease patients in England between 2001 and 2003 were examined. Zero preference accounts for 64% of systolic and 59% of diastolic readings, compared with an expected frequency of 10% (P<0.000001). Even numbers are more frequently seen than odd numbers. In all, 64% of nonzero systolic recordings and 65% of diastolic recordings ended in even numbers, compared with expected proportions of 44% (P<0.0001). Among the nonzero even numbers, eight is the most frequently observed: 28% of systolic and 31% of diastolic recordings compared with an expected proportion of 25% (P<0.0001). Among the five nonzero odd numbers, five is the most frequently observed end digit, representing 59% systolic and 62% of diastolic compared with an expected level of 20% (P<0.00001). English general practice displays marked end-digit preference. This is strongly for the end-digit zero. However, there is more use of other end-digits, notably 8 and 5. This bias potentially carries important treatment consequences for this high-risk population.

### Social participation is an important health behaviour for health and quality of life among chronically ill older Chinese people [^d29b5bae]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Quality of life

Quality of life was measured using the 8-item World Health Organization quality of life measure (WHOQoL) (Additional file 2). Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with life in general and in different domains (e.g. finances, health and relationships) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (‘not at all/very poor’) to 5 (‘completely/very good’). Total scores were calculated by summing the item scores and rescaling the result to 0–100. According to previous research, the 8-item WHOQoL is useful for the assessment of quality of life in older populations. The Cronbach’s alpha value of the instrument in this study was 0.86.

Cognitive function

Cognitive function was measured by administering five cognitive performance tests (forward and backward digit spans, immediate and delayed verbal recall, and verbal fluency). Forward digit span was tested by asking participants to repeat progressively longer number series in the exact order in which they had been presented. Backward digit span was tested by asking participants to repeat such series backwards. Scores (longest spans repeated) for the forward and backward digit spans ranged from 0 to 9 and 0 to 8, respectively (total possible scores, 1–17). Immediate and delayed verbal recall was measured by asking participants to read 10 words aloud and soon thereafter to recall as many words as possible in 1 min. The same test was repeated three times. Scores ranged from 0 to 10. Verbal fluency was assessed by asking respondents to name as many animals as they could in 1 min. Scores were based on the number of correctly named animals, with repeated names counted only once (range, 2–38). Z scores were calculated for the five test scores, and final cognitive function scores (range, 0–100) were generated by summing these scores.

### Age-related differences in plausibility-checking strategies during arithmetic problem verification tasks [^7c4b1968]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined whether older adults use plausibility-checking strategies while verifying arithmetic problems. We also tested trial-to-trial modulations of plausibility-checking strategies, and aging effects on these sequential modulations.

Method

We asked young and older adults to verify arithmetic problems that violated or respected arithmetic rules (i.e., 5×16 = 87. True/False?).

Results

Both young and older adults solved problems violating parity rule and five rule more quickly than problems violating no rule. We also found that both age groups had better performance when both five rule and parity rule are violated than when only one or no rules are violated. These results suggest age invariance in using rule-violation checking strategies and a smaller, but still efficient, strategy combination in older adults. Finally, for young adults only, strategy combination was larger following problems violating rules than after problems respecting rules.

Discussion

These findings have important implications regarding mechanisms underlying age-related differences in using rule-violation checking strategies to verify arithmetic problems and in combining two strategies into a single, more efficient one.

### Case-mix-adjusted mean number of polyps per 100 procedures: a new candidate gold standard colonoscopy key performance indicator [^c792776d]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Defining and calculating aMNP

Observed MNP was defined as the number of polyps detected by an endoscopist divided by the number of colonoscopies performed. A cap of five polyps per procedure was applied to reduce the skewing effect of polyposis, given evidence that the correlation of MNP with ADR plateaus at five or more polyps.

To enable the new KPI to be adjusted for case-mix, multiple negative binomial regression was undertaken at the procedure level to estimate the effects of patient age, sex and procedure indication on MNP. Variables were chosen as preprocedure objective factors with known associations with polyp detection.

Coefficients (table 1) from the multivariable model were used to compute an expected number of polyps for each procedure using the sum of these coefficients to the power of the natural log ‘e’ using the following formula:

Expected number of polyps for a procedure=e (constant + age coefficient + sex coefficient + indication coefficient)

Table 1 
Multivariable analysis of the number of polyps detected at a procedure level with incidence rate ratios (IRRs), coefficients and respective 95% CI for patient age by decade, sex and procedure indication, and Wald test p values for contribution of variable to model

The total expected MNP for any number of procedures was calculated by the sum of the expected number of polyps for each procedure divided by the number of colonoscopies performed:

In turn, observed MNP, expected MNP and a national average MNP were used to generate the aMNP using the Department for Health’s suggested statistical adjustment methodology.This divides the observed performance by expected performance and then multiplies this by a national average. Thus, aMNP for an individual endoscopist was calculated using the below formula, with a worked example and spreadsheet calculator provided in onlinesupplemental materials 1 2 :

### An iterative approach for estimating domain-specific cognitive abilities from large scale online cognitive data [^07189726]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Digits Span is a cognitive task designed to measure working memory capacity. Participants are presented with a sequence of numbers that they must recall. The first sequence is always 2 numbers long, and at each trial, if the participant replies correctly, the length of the next sequence increases by one. If the participant incorrectly recalls the sequence of numbers, then another string of the same length is presented. This is repeated until the participant replies incorrectly 3 times consecutively, when the task terminates. Spatial Span has a similar design to Digits Span, but instead of digits participants recall the location of sequences of flashes on a 4 × 4 grid of squares, testing their spatial working memory capacity. As shown in Fig. 3c for Digits Span, the derived DS measure suggested that the more numbers participants must remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.92). Similarly for Spatial Span, the more squares participants have to remember, the harder is the trial (correlation between sequence length and DS is r = 0.84) (Fig. 3d).

Words Definitions is designed to measure crystallised intelligence. Participants are presented with a word and four alternative definitions. They must select the definition that corresponds to the meaning of the word as quickly as possible. The task has multiple trials and at each trial a different word is shown. The words are characterised by different frequency of occurrence in the English language. To assess the word difficulty scale predicted by IDoCT for the Words Definitions task, the correlation between the obtained measure of difficulty DS and the frequency of occurrence in the English language of the words included in the cognitive assessment was calculated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the most frequently used words in English were assigned a lower D and DS compared to the least frequently used ones. A Spearman correlation of −0.66 and −0.64 between respectively DS and D with the log frequency measures of the words was found.

Motor Control is designed to measure motor abilities. Participants are shown a moving target, which is represented as a circular red button, and are expected to press on the target as quickly as possible, as soon as it appears, and before it changes location in the screen. According to IDoCT, the further the location of the current target from the previous location, the higher the difficulty estimate DS (Spearman correlation between the distance and D and DS was 0.91 and 0.87, respectively—Fig. 3b).

### The eighty five percent rule for optimal learning [^85cf0442]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Two-layer network with MNIST stimuli

As a more demanding test of the Eighty Five Percent Rule, we consider the case of a two-layer neural network applied to more realistic stimuli from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is a labeled dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) that has been widely used as a test of image classification algorithms (see ref.for a list). The dataset is broken down into a training set consistent of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. To create binary classification tasks based on these images, we trained the network to classify the images according to either the parity (odd or even) or magnitude (less than 5 or not) of the number.

The network itself consisted of 1 input layer, with 400 units corresponding to the pixel values in the images, 1 hidden layer, with 50 neurons, and one output unit. Unlike the Perceptron, activity of the output unit was graded and was determined by a sigmoid function of the decision variable, h where the decision variable was given bywhere w 2 were the weights connecting the hidden layer to the output units and a was the activity in the hidden layer. This hidden-layer activity was also determined by a sigmoidal functionwhere the inputs, x, corresponds to the pixel values in the image and w 1 were the weights from the input layer to the hidden layer.

All weights were trained using the Backpropagation algorithmwhich takes the error,and propagates it backwards through the network, from output to input stage, as a teaching signal for the weights. This algorithm implements stochastic gradient descent and, if our assumptions are met, should optimize learning at a training accuracy of 85%.

### Automatic extraction of meaning from visual number symbols detected by frequency-tagged EEG in children [^cb60d70e]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

Acquiring robust semantic representations of numbers is crucial for math achievement. However, the learning stage where magnitude becomes automatically elicited by number symbols (i.e., digits from 1 to 9) remains unknown due to the difficulty to measure automatic semantic processing. We used a frequency-tagging EEG paradigm targeting automatic magnitude processing in children (N=33, 5-10-year-old, predominantly of White or Mixed ethnicity). A stream of digits (1-9) was presented at 10Hz with small digits as standards, and large digits as deviants at 1.25Hz (and the reverse). Frequency-tagged responses to the deviants show that magnitude is a salient semantic feature associated with digits in long-term memory. Automatic access to magnitude can be measured with EEG in children at the end of preschool.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^fa40728e]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

CIFOR performance indicator—outbreak clinical specimen collections—defines the metric as the “Number and % of outbreak investigations with clinical specimens collected and submitted to PHL from two or more people” and defines a foodborne illness outbreak as “The occurrence of two or more similar illnesses resulting from ingestion of a common food.” Measurement methods state to “Determine the number of foodborne illness outbreaks that were investigated” for the denominator and to “Determine the number of outbreaks for which clinical specimens were collected and submitted to the PHL from two or more people” for the numerator, then “Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100.” The performance fields label “Denominator (No. outbreaks) =”, “Numerator (No. outbreaks with clinical specimens collected) =” and compute “Rate (Num./Denom. x 100) =”. Feasibility notes that “This metric is associated with CIFOR Indicator 8.2.4 “Foodborne outbreaks investigated.” It extends FoodCORE metrics to investigations for all pathogens.”

2.3.1 ADNI memory and executive composite scores

The ADNI memory composite (ADNI‐MEM) 10 includes sum of z‐scores from the following tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (word list learning trials, recall, and recognition), memory scores from the modified the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Acales (word list learning, recall and recognition), Mini‐Mental State Examination (word recall), and Wechsler Memory Scale–Revised Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall trials). Higher ADNI‐MEM scores indicate better performances. The ADNI executive composite (ADNI‐EF) 11 is composed of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS‐R) Digit Symbol Substitution and Digit Span Backwards subtetsts, Trail Making Tests A and B, Category Fluency, and Clock Drawing scores. Higher scores on this measure indicate better performances. For more details on the psychometric protocols for both the ADNI‐MEM and ADNI‐EF composite scores, see.

2.3.2 ADAS‐Cog‐13

ADAS‐Cog‐13 14 is a version of the ADAS‐Cog modified with the addition of a number cancellation task and a delayed free recall task. The ADAS‐Cog‐13 is scored from 0 to 85, with lower scores indicating better performance.

2.3.3 Clinical Dementia Rating 15

The CDR is another assessment of everyday function and is a semi‐structured informant and patient interview. The CDR global score classifies the severity of the patient's impairment into one of five stages: 0 (normal), 0.5 (mildly impaired/MCI), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), 3 (severe dementia), though only participants with a CDR Global Score of 0 or 0.5 were included at baseline. The CDR‐SB provides a more granular score for patient functioning that ranges from 0 to 18, with low scores indicating better functional status. 16 CDR‐SB ranges generally correspond with global score functional groups as 0 = “normal,” 0.5–4.0 = MCI, and > 4.0 = “dementia.” 16

2.3.4 Functional outcomes

The FAQ 17 is an informant‐based measure of the study participant's everyday functioning scored from 0 to 30 with lower scores indicating less difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living functioning.

### Is the h-index enough? A comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 871 academic plastic surgeons and their departments / divisions [^f2dd9a16]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In plastic surgery academia, research output is heavily used as a metric of accreditation, from assessing residency applicants to evaluating faculty for promotion. The h index, defined as an author's h papers with at least h citations, is commonly used as a measure of academic success. However, the index itself disfavors junior researchers, favors publication quantity, and discounts highly cited works. Given the importance of bibliometrics within plastic surgery, there is a paramount need to adopt additional metrics to measure research productivity. The authors sought to validate the use of time-independent bibliometrics to complement the h index in measuring citation impact.

Methods

The genders and academic titles of plastic surgeons affiliated with US plastic surgery programs were recorded. Author publications were retrieved from Scopus. Bibliometrics software was used to calculate the following metrics per surgeon: h index, e index, and g index. Time-adjusted versions of these indices were used to correct for the number of years since first publication. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) are reported. Departmental ranks were determined using the cumulative sum of time-corrected indices and compared with Doximity departmental research rankings. P < 0.05 was deemed significant.

Results

Indices were calculated for 871 academic plastic surgeons in 85 departments/divisions. Men had statistically greater h index (median, 13.0 [IQR, 7.0-21.0] vs 6.0 [IQR, 3.0-13]; P < 0.001), e index (18.3 [IQR, 10.0-28.7] vs 11.1 [IQR, 5.5-18.4]; P < 0.001), and g index (23.0 [IQR, 11.0-39.0] vs 11.0 [IQR, 5.0-22.0]; P < 0.001) than women. Professors had the highest median time-uncorrected indices. After adjusting for the number of years since an author's first publication, there were no significant differences in m quotient (men: 0.66 [IQR, 0.40-0.98] vs women: 0.57 [IQR, 0.33-0.90]; P = 0.05) and ec index (men: 0.93 [IQR, 0.62-1.3] vs women: 0.87 [IQR, 0.50-1.3]; P = 0.08) between genders. Departmental chairs had significantly higher indices than other faculty after correcting for time. The calculated program rankings were low to moderately correlated with that of Doximity (correlation coefficient τ = 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.59; P < 0.001]).

Conclusions

Men and women have statistically similar citation patterns after correcting for the time. Citation differences between academic levels are less pronounced when controlling for time, suggesting comparable research quality between academic roles.

### Neural association between non-verbal number sense and arithmetic fluency [^3b9765a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the “Q” (left candidate) and “P” (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the “Q” (left candidate) and “P” (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

CIFOR performance measure—cluster source identification defines the metric as the “Number and % of clusters with more than five cases in which a source was identified.” A cluster is defined as “Two or more isolates with a matching molecular subtype pattern identified in a period of two weeks.” “Cluster source identification” is “The number of identified clusters for which a specific food transmission setting, meal, food item or ingredient was identified, leading the cluster to be considered an outbreak.” Measurement methods state to “Determine the number of clusters that include five or more cases. This will be the denominator for the metric,” and to “Determine the number of clusters for which a source was identified that include five or more cases. This will be the numerator for the metric,” then “Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100.” The performance section specifies Denominator “No. clusters with ≥ 5 cases,” Numerator “No. clusters with ≥ 5 cases with source identified,” and Rate “Num./Denom. x 100.” This metric is linked to “CIFOR Indicator 8.2.5 ‘Case clusters investigated.’”

### Quality of life is not affected by thyroid surgery in nontoxic benign goitre in long-term surveillance – A prospective observational study [^1e4bed90]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study design

At least 24 hours prior to operation, each patient completed the EuroQoL‐5D (EQ‐5D) questionnaire. The EQ‐5D‐3L essentially consists of two parts: the EQ‐5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).

The EQ VAS records the patient's self‐rated health on a vertical VAS where the end‐points are labelled ‘Best imaginable health state (100)’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state (0)’.

The EQ‐5D system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems. The patients' statement was converted into a 1‐digit number that expressed the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions have been combined into a 5‐digit number that described the patient's health state and were converted by the time trade‐off (TTO) valuation technique for inter‐ and intra‐individual comparison. The EQ‐5D index was thus calculated in accordance with the appropriate instructions and calculated pre‐operatively and 1 year postoperatively for each patient. 30, 31

A positive difference indicates a positive change in QoL 1 year after surgery in comparison with QoL before surgery; a negative difference is indicative for a deterioration of QoL. In this way, the change in QoL for each patient was detected.

In addition, a second self‐developed questionnaire for assessment of the socio‐economic status was collected. It included annual salary income, family status, school education and employment status. One year after the operation, the patients were asked to answer the same questionnaires in writing again.

### A comes before B, like 1 comes before 2. is the parietal cortex sensitive to ordinal relationships in both numbers and letters? An fMRI-adaptation study [^aef577ed]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

The letter ordinality task was performed more slowly than the number ordinality. One explanation for this finding could be that in order to complete the letter ordinality task, participants were mapping the letter stimuli onto their respective numerical counterparts (e.g. assigning B to a magnitude of 2), as this would involve an extra step of processing in comparison to the number ordinality task. To ensure that participants were not just using a number magnitude strategy in the letter ordinality task, we compared performance on the letter arithmetic task between the letter and number groups. For the letter arithmetic task, we calculated the average accuracy, reaction time for correct trials and performance for each group (see Table 10). The performance measure was calculated using a formula to combine reaction time and error rate: Performance = Reaction time (1 + 2[Error rate]), where reaction time referred to average response time of both correct and incorrect trials (Goffin & Ansari, 2016 ; Lyons, Price, Vaessen, Blomert, & Ansari, 2014). We carried out an independent samples t test as well as an independent samples Bayesian t test for reaction time, accuracy, and performance on the letter arithmetic task. For these analyses, we predicted that the letter and number groups would perform similarly on the letter arithmetic task. Better performance on the letter arithmetic task in the letter training group would imply that participants are using a strategy involving assigning numerical magnitudes to letters (e.g. C = 3) during the ordinality training. This would indicate a use of a numerical cardinality strategy, as opposed to a symbolic ordinality strategy. Similar behavioral performance on the letter arithmetic task in the letter and number groups however, could indicate that the letter group performed the letter ordinality by activating their representations of the ordinal relationships between letters. In other words, we expected to find support for the null hypothesis, and continued data collection until a BF in support of the null indicated strong evidence for no difference between‐groups (BF H 01 = 6). The use of a BF stopping rule allows the researcher to continue collecting data until a cutoff BF is achieved that signifies the evidence in favor of an alternative or null hypothesis is strong (Marsman & Wagenmakers, 2017). This means that excess data will not be collected, and the strength of the confidence in favor of the hypothesis can be quantified. In the current study, data collection continued until the data were six times more likely under the null hypothesis (no significant difference between the letter and number groups on the letter arithmetic task) than the alternative. This stopping rule was pre‐registered on the Open Science Framework. Results from the independent t‐tests indicated that the number and letter groups did not differ significantly in reaction time, accuracy or performance on the letter arithmetic task, t (177) = 0.11, p =.92, BF 01 = 6.14; t (177) = −0.17, p =.86, BF 01 = 6.09; t (177) = 0.31, p =.756, BF 01 = 5.90, respectively. From the results of the Bayesian t tests, we can surmise that there is strong evidence for the null hypothesis that the letter and number groups did not differ on the letter arithmetic task (Jeffreys, 1961). More specifically, finding support for the null hypothesis suggests that participants did not assign numerical values to letters in the letter ordinality task, and instead, likely relied on their representations of the ordinal relationships between the letter stimuli to complete the task.

### Efficient probabilistic inference in generic neural networks trained with non-probabilistic feedback [^2a5fb9af]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

For tasks with categorical outputs, the output layer of a multilayer neural network is asymptotically guaranteed to converge to the posterior probabilities of the classes under a broad class of loss functions, including cross-entropy and mean squared error (Supplementary Fig. 5b). For the particular problems we studied, our results again show empirically that this convergence can be achieved relatively fast and does not require large networks.

Random networks with only trainable read-out weights performed poorly in our tasks. This can be understood as a consequence of the poor approximation properties of such networks. On the other hand, making our networks biologically more plausible by making them fully recurrent and introducing separate excitatory and inhibitory populations throughout the network that respect Dale’s law in their connectivity pattern did not significantly impair the performance of the networks.

Our work is consistent with the PPC framework according to which, by virtue of the variability of their responses, neural populations encode probability distributions rather than single estimates and computations with probability distributions can be carried out by suitable operations on the corresponding neural responses,. However, our work disagrees with the existing literature on the implementation of such computations. We show that these computations do not require any special neural operations or network architectures than the very generic ones that researchers have been using for decades in the neural network community –.

The recent literature on PPC respects the principle that Poisson-like neural variability, i.e. exponential-family variability with linear sufficient statistics, be preserved between the input and output of a network, because this leads to a fully modular code that can be decoded with the same type of decoder throughout the network. To obtain actual networks, these studies then postulate a literal, one-to-one correspondence between the required neural computations that must be computed at the population level and the computations individual neurons perform. This literal interpretation leads to inefficient neural architectures containing intermediate neurons that are artificially restricted to summing or multiplying the activities of at most two input neurons and that perform substantially different operations in different tasks (for example, linear summation, multiplication, or different forms of divisive normalization),–.

### Neuropsychological test performance of cognitively healthy centenarians: normative data from the Dutch 100-plus study [^20228cd9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological Tests

The neuropsychological test battery consisted of 15 tests measuring global cognition, premorbid intelligence, attention and/or concentration, language, memory, executive function, and visuospatial function. See supplementary data for more detailed information on properties of these tests. At the start of the study, the test battery was limited to the MMSE and CDT but expanded gradually over the course of the study with tests that allow the evaluation of specific cognitive domains. For this reason, not all centenarians were presented with the same battery or the same number of tests.

The MMSE was used to evaluate global cognition. 21 We addressed premorbid intelligence using the DART, 22, 23, 24 in which subjects are asked to read out loud 50 words with atypical phonemic pronunciation. These words were presented in an enlarged font size to take into account possible visual difficulties. The Digit Span was used to evaluate attention/concentration (forward condition) and working memory (backward condition). 25 The forward condition requires subjects to repeat sequences of digits that increase in length, whereas in the backward condition, sequences of digits have to be repeated in reverse order. We evaluated processing speed and attention using the TMT A, and mental flexibility using the TMT B, which respectively requires subjects to connect dots of numbers in numerical order and alternate between numbers and letters in numerical and alphabetical sequence. 26 If the centenarians were not determined to proceed after 180 seconds (TMT A) and 300 seconds (TMT B), the test was aborted and scores were extrapolated based on the last finished item (number or letter) and the time spent on the test. The Dutch version of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (naming words from initial letters) and Category fluency (naming animals) were administered to evaluate executive functioning and language, the latter also assessing semantic memory. 27, 28 To evaluate executive functioning, we administered the Key Search subtest of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Test Battery 29 involving a problem‐solving task instructing subjects to think of a strategy to find a lost key. Memory was measured with the story recall subtest of the Dutch version of the RBMT and the VAT. 30, 31, 32 The RBMT requires subjects to immediately repeat all items they remember from two stories read out loud, and again after a 15‐minute interval. When necessary, a cue was given for helping them recall the story line, which was considered when calculating the total score. We made two adaptations to the test procedure: (1) two stories were read instead of one to improve reliability; (2) during recall, all remembered items were scored, whether they belonged to the appropriate story line or not. The VAT involves subjects to name two visual items shown in one picture (eg, a hedgehog on a chair), of which one item (hedgehog) needs to be recalled afterwards while the other (the chair without the hedgehog) is used as a cue. We used naming of the items as an additional measure of language functioning. Visuospatial orientation was assessed with the Number Location subtest of the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, 33 which required subjects to indicate a specific number that corresponded with the exact location of a dot. For evaluating visuospatial construction, subjects were instructed to draw a clock with the hands at 10 past 11 (CDT). Because of common tremors in centenarians, the CDT was offered with a predrawn circle and was scored according to a method that does not consider the drawing of the circle. 34, 35

### Brain systems involved in arithmetic with positive versus negative numbers [^ba404315]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Positive number arithmetic is based on combining and separating sets of items, with systematic differences in brain activity in specific regions depending on operation. In contrast, arithmetic with negative numbers involves manipulating abstract values worth less than zero, possibly involving different operation-activity relationships in these regions. Use of procedural arithmetic knowledge, including transformative rules like "minus a negative is plus a positive," may also differ by operand sign. Here, we examined whether the activity evoked in negative number arithmetic was similar to that seen in positive problems, using region of interest analyses (ROIs) to examine a specific set of brain regions. Negative-operand problems demonstrated a positive-like effect of operation in the inferior parietal lobule with more activity for subtraction than addition, as well as increased activity across operation. Interestingly, while positive-operand problems demonstrated the expected addition > subtraction activity difference in the angular gyrus, negative problems showed a reversed effect, with relatively more activity for subtraction than addition. Negative subtraction problems may be understood after translation to addition via rule, thereby invoking more addition-like activity. Whole-brain analyses showed increased right caudate activity for negative-operand problems across operation, indicating a possible overall increase in usage of procedural rules. Arithmetic with negative numbers may thus shows some operation-activity relationships similar to positive numbers, but may also be affected by strategy. This study examines the flexibility of the mental number system by exploring to what degree the processing of an applied usage of a difficult, abstract mathematical concept is similar to that for positive numbers.

### Proteomics-based aging clocks in midlife or late-life and their associated risk of dementia [^4e86d4c9]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive function assessment

All participants completed a 60-min comprehensive neuropsychological assessment administered by trained and certified psychometrists at Visit 5 (late-life). The measures are well-validated and standardized instruments, which assess multiple domains of cognition, including memory, executive function/processing speed, and global cognitive function. The test battery includes: Memory domain: Delayed Word Recall Test: a test of verbal memory requiring recall of a word list after a short delay (score range 0–10). Logical Memory I and II: from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) is a test of immediate (Logical Memory I) and delayed (Logical Memory II) memory. Executive function/processing speed domain: Trail Making Test Part A: In Trail Making A, participants are asked to draw a line connecting circles numbered 1 to 25 that are randomly distributed on the page as fast as possible. Digit Span Backwards: a test of attention in which participants state a series of digits backward. Digit Symbol Substitution Test: a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised involving timed translation of numbers to symbols in 90 seconds using a key, which measures psychomotor performance (score range 0–93). Word Fluency Test: combined total of correct words produced beginning with F, A, and S. Category Fluency Test: participant is asked to spontaneously generate words from a specific category (in this test, animals),. For global cognitive function assessment, we included all the aforementioned tests as well as the Boston Naming Test: a test of language in which participants name common objects from pictures. To create scores for each cognitive domain and global cognitive function, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to derive three cognitive function scores for memory, executive function/processing speed, and global cognition (combination of all cognitive domains). Before PCA analysis, cognitive function test scores were checked for normal distribution. Trails A test scores were inverted so that low test scores indicate poorer cognitive function and higher test scores indicate better cognitive function for all tests. Participants with no cognitive function scores were excluded (N = 60). Imputation via mean was used to impute any missing values for cognitive tests (total number of missing in any test = 439). Next, Z-scores were calculated for all cognitive test scores, and PCA was conducted to create three distinct factor scores for memory, executive function/processing speed, and global cognition. Percentages of variance explained by PCA factors for each cognitive domain are compiled in Table S1.

### Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement [^dbafba86]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational systems. Competence in some domains of mathematics, such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching. More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults, infants and non-human animals-these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development, it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non-verbal 'number sense' than others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non-verbal approximation abilities of 14-year-old children, and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children's past scores on standardized maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors. Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned approximate number sense. Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity, and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both.

### Number development and developmental dyscalculia [^e45e7f45]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings of developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder of 'number sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate numerical magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However, this spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school and requires additional cognitive components including working memory and number symbolization (language). Thus, there may be children with familial-genetic DD with deficits limited to number sense and others with DD and comorbidities such as language delay, dyslexia, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is supported by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with DD have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically, they differ according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties. fMRI studies indicate that parietal areas (important for number functions), and frontal regions (dominant for executive working memory and attention functions), are under-activated in children with DD. A four-step developmental model that allows prediction of different pathways for DD is presented. The core-system representation of numerical magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number', a precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step 3) number symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic development of an expanding mental number line during school years (step 4). Therapeutic and educational interventions can be drawn from this model.

### Neural representation precision of distance predicts children's arithmetic performance [^87c900f6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1 
Illustration of the task design and decoding procedure. (A) The illustration of the dot pattern comparison procedure. Subjects needed to compare the two numerical stimuli and decide which one was larger. (B) We first divided the data into a training set with 4/5 trials and a test set with the remaining 1/5 trials. In the training phase, the pattern from 4/5 training trials and their actual labels (distance or magnitude) were used to fit a model (set of weights on each voxel). During the testing phase, the test patterns were multiplied by the weight vector to generate predicted labels (which could take on any real value). A 5‐fold cross‐validation was conducted which iteratively left out 1/5 trials. Performance was assessed by computing the correlation between the actual and predicted labels (aggregated across iterations).

During the fMRI scanning, participants viewed centrally presented dot arrays in succession. Participants were instructed to respond with one of the two buttons depending on whether the first or second number was larger; if the first number was larger, then press the leftmost button with the thumb of the left hand, and if the second number was larger, then press the rightmost one with the thumb of the right hand. The button pressed was balanced across trials. The presentation details for each trial were shown in Figure 1.

2.3 Weber Fraction Estimation

The Weber fraction estimated each participant's minimum distinguishable difference between the number of dots and which was also known as the ANS (Approximate number system) acuity. The Weber Fraction score was assessed for 29 subjects using the accuracy (ACC) of the dot comparison task. The percentage correct was modeled for each individual subject as 1—error rate (Halberda et al.), where the error rate is defined as:where erfc (x) is the complementary error function, which is associated with the integral of the normalized Gaussian distribution. This model describes the percentage of correct responses as a function of the Gaussian approximation of number representations for the two dot sets presented in each trial, namely n 1 and n 2 (i.e. n 1 is the numerosity of the larger set, n 2 is the numerosity of the smaller set), with a single adjustable parameter, the Weber fraction (w).

### Neurostructural correlate of math anxiety in the brain of children [^06365619]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Mathematical performance

Two different age-appropriate test batteries were used to assess numerical and mathematical performance in children younger or older than 12 years, respectively:

Numerical achievement in children younger than 12 years were assessed using the standardized Neuropsychological Test Battery for Number Processing and Calculation in Children (ZAREKI-R). This neuropsychological battery examines basic skills in calculation and arithmetic and aims to identify and characterize the profile of mathematical abilities in children with DD from the 1st to 4th grade level. It is composed of 11 subtests, such as reverse counting, subtraction, number reading, dictating, visual estimation of quantities, and digit span forward and backward. Criteria for DD were met if a child’s performance in the ZAREKI-R was below the 10th percentile on average in three subtests or in the total reached percentile rank.

Numerical abilities of children older than 12 years were assessed using the German test battery Basic Diagnosis in Mathematics Education for Grades 4–8 (BASIS-MATH 4–8). The test battery measures different numerical abilities at three difficulty levels such as counting, arithmetic, decimal system, text problems and part-whole-relationships. Criteria for DD are met if the performance falls under a total threshold score of 67 points (out of a total of 83 points), which indicates that mastery of basic mathematical concepts has not been reached.

Number line performance

The spatial representation of numbers was measured by a paper-and-pencil number line task in children younger than 12 years a computerized version for children older than 12 years:

Children below 12 years had to indicate with a pencil on a left-to-right oriented number line from 0 to 100 the location of 20 Arabic digits, results of 20 additions and 20 subtractions, or the estimated number of 10 different dot arrays. The error rate of the paper-and-pencil number line task was evaluated by measuring the distance in percent (% distance) relative to the position of the correct number for each trial. Mean percentage distance was then calculated over all trials (Arabic digits, additions, subtractions, dots), but only correctly calculated addition and subtraction problems were included. A detailed description of the task is described in a previous publication of our group.

Children older than 12 years solved a computerized number line task 0–100 including 20 Arabic digits that had to be located on the number line by mouse-click. Again, the mean distance between the correct and indicated location in percent was calculated.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^d6d8fcbc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Spirometry reporting specifies that numerical values are given for the FEV1, the FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio; the latter should be reported as a decimal fraction and the space for percent predicted value left blank, and if bronchodilators are given the LLN column need not be repeated with absolute and percent change given only for FEV1 and FVC. Other numerical values such as the forced inspiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75%) and FEF25–75% are not recommended for routine use. Graph requirements include that for the volume–time curve the volume scale should be at least 10 mm/L, the time scale at least 20 mm/s, and 1 second prior to the start of expiration should be displayed; on the flow–volume plot the flow display should be at least 5 l/min/L/s, and the ratio of flow to volume should be 2 L/s to 1 L, and linear and log scales where values are plotted as z-scores relative to the predicted value (z = 0) give an intuitive sense of severity.

### Multi-indicator sustainability assessment of global food systems [^eba172fc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Estimating national nutrient intake amounts

Finally, by multiplying the calories and nutrient values per gram of all 94 food items by their intake amounts (in g) and summing up, we obtained the total daily caloric intake (E k in kcal per capita per day) and daily intake of each of the 25 qualifying nutrient q (a q, k in g per capita per day), and each of four disqualifying nutrient d (a d, k in g per capita per day) for each country k.

Nutrient Balance Score

We calculate the NBS (0 < NB < 100) of each country’s daily diet as:where QI q, k is the value for the Qualifying Index (QI) of an individual nutrient q in the country k and N q is the number of qualifying nutrients considered (=25). The QI is defined as the ratio of a particular nutrient’s amount contained in 2000 kcal of a given food/meal/diet relative to the Reference Daily Intakesfor those nutrients:

Here, E k is the total daily caloric intake for country k (in kcal per capita per day) and a q, k is the daily intake amount of a qualifying food nutrient q in country k (in g per capita per day). If the QI for a given nutrient is > 1, then the value is truncated to 1 on the rationale that once the requirement for a specific qualifying nutrient is met (QI q, k = 1.0) any further provision of that nutrient does not serve additional nutrition function. It also guards against obtaining high nutrition balance (NB) score for diets containing abnormally high amounts of few individual nutrients and very low amounts of other. An NB score of 100 is achieved a diet satisfies at least 100% of the daily dietary requirement for every qualifying nutrient. Conversely, a value of 0 implies that none of the qualifying nutrients are contained in the diet.

It is noteworthy that we chose 2000 kcal in the numerator in Eq. 2 above, in order to be consistent with formula proposed by Fern et al. although other values based on country-specific guidelines can also be chosen. Although suggested by Fern et al.we could not include “Water” as a qualifying nutrient here because its amount in national food supply (e.g. tap and bottled water intake per capita per day) is not available from FAO’s FBS.

### Intellectual engagement and cognitive ability in later life (the "use it or lose it" conjecture): longitudinal, prospective study [^8d8495d0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Participants

The sample of older adults with retained childhood intelligence scores or data was drawn from the archives of the Scottish Council for Research in Education, which had maintained population based records of the Scottish Mental Surveys of 1947. All children born in 1936 and who were at school in Scotland on 4 June 1947 when aged 11 (±0.5) years took part in a group administered intelligence test (the Moray house test). More than 95% of eligible Scottish children were surveyed and scores retained.A subset of these participants were recruited into a longitudinal study of ageing at around 64 years of age and were recalled for testing on up to five occasions over a 15 year period. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of study recruitment and retention.

Fig 1

Cognitive tests

Current adult ability was assessed by a trained psychologist following standard procedures using the digit symbol substitution test and the auditory-verbal learning test.The digit symbol substitution test requires participants to match symbols with a corresponding digit; the total number of correct answers provided the test score. The auditory-verbal learning test is widely used to evaluate verbal memory and reliably identifies older adults with age related memory impairments.This test was administered to the study participants on the first occasion at about age 64 years and repeated on up to five occasions over the next 14 years. Results from the national adult reading test were recorded on study entry, and provide an estimate of crystallised intelligence.

Education

Demographic data were obtained from participants on recruitment in a structured interview at age 64 (±1) years by a trained research nurse. Education was recorded as the total number of years spent in formal education before age 25 years.

### Parallel photonic information processing at gigabyte per second data rates using transient States [^fe8c41f5]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Spoken digit recognition

The spoken digit data set consists of five female speakers, uttering the numbers zero to nine with a tenfold repetition for statistics. Before injecting the information into the laser, we performed standard preprocessing creating a cochleagram of each digit via the Lyon ear model. For simplicity, mask M and connectivity matrixwere merged into a single matrix. In this matrix, 98% of the elements were set to zero in order to realize a sparse connectivity between cochleagram channels and transients. The remaining values were randomly selected among (0.41,0.59). The preprocessing following the digit's chocleagram is illustrated in Fig. 5. After preprocessing, each cycle of length T 2 data of the cochleagram's 86 frequency channels were injected into the system with 8 bit resolution, corresponding to a rate of 1.1 Gbyte/s. One Byte here refers a unit of injected information, which can comprise different numbers of bits. Out of the entire body of spoken digits, we chose 20 random partitions of 25 samples each, using 475 samples for training the readout weights, keeping the remaining 25 for testing. Each random partition and each sample are used exactly once for testing (20-fold cross-validation). Statistical information is provided by repeating this procedure five times, creating different random combinations of testing and training. At the two data points, where the system approaches 0% error, the cross-validation procedure was repeated 100 times.

### The patterns of family genetic risk scores for eleven major psychiatric and substance use disorders in a Swedish national sample [^424c1cbd]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Descriptive features of our population cohort and case samples.

Fig. 1 
The mean Genetic Risk Score for 11 disorders in individuals diagnosed with those 11 disorders grouped by Disorder.

The y -axis is the mean z -score for the genetic risk scores. The disorders are: major depression (MD), anxiety disorders (AD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ), bulimia (BUL), anorexia nervosa (AN), alcohol use disorder (AUD), drug use disorder (DUD), ADHD, and autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). For clarity, we provide different color codes for the disorders divided into five categories of internalizing disorders (MD, AD, and OCD), psychotic disorders (BD and SZ), eating disorders (BUL and AN), substance use disorders (AUD and DUD), and neurodevelopmental disorders (ADHD and ASD).

Within each type of relative, we then had two components—the sum of the z -score and the total weighted number of relatives. These two components were weighted according to the genetic resemblance to the proband. For each proband, we summed the two components across all groups of relatives and used the quotient between the two components. Finally, to obtain the individual FGRS, we multiplied the quotient with a shrinkage factor based on the variance of the z -score across all relatives, the variance in the mean z -score across all probands, and the number of weighted number of relatives for each proband. So that the FGRSs would be more comparable across traits and to reduce the effect of register coverage, we standardized the FGRS by year of birth into a z -score with mean = 0 and SD = 1.

For our first and second aims, we calculated the mean individual FGRSs for the 11 disorders among individuals affected, individually, with each of the 11 conditions. As a validation effort, we also examined the mean individual FGRSs for BMI, CAD, and YOE among individuals affected with our 11 disorders. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4.

### Quantity over quality: how the rise in quality measures is not producing quality results [^cdd7f19e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The translation of guidelines into performance measures requires a discriminating approach. Guidelines are a series of expert recommendations based on scientific evidence, and QMs are the next step in the evolutionary process of influencing care. Much more than a recommendation, a performance measure is a mandate that affects fiscal compensation and public reputational standing. QMs influence patient care, institutional compliance, and organizational financial well-being. In order to bolster the validity of performance measures and reinforce their impact, attention needs to be focused not only on developing guidelines, but also on the conversion of these guidelines to QMs. This evolution must be based on the best and most clinically relevant evidence available.

Clinical practice guidelines represent the consensus of experts, ideally based on evidence. However, the transformation of guidelines into QMs and pay-for-performance measures may antedate and even preempt the collection of high-quality evidence. In an analysis of class I ACC/AHA guideline recommendations over a period of several years, revisions in recommendations were found most commonly among those not verified by multiple RCTs.Clinicians may prematurely endorse and propagate new guidelines based on “consensus validity,” when the consensus process itself—sometimes at the expense of other, more relevant criteria—determines the content and/or adoption of new guidelines.Guidelines can also be influenced by panel members and their societies’ interests, and are not always just the result of evidence or good clinical judgment. The recent scandal involving a member of the National Quality Forum, who was allegedly paid over $11 million to endorse measures that would be financially favorable to his sponsor, serves to reinforce this serious concern.

Future QMs need to be evaluated in a more rigorous and evidence-based manner. With the initiation of value-based purchasing as part of the new ACA standards, a greater number of QMs will now be proposed and marketed on a national platform and will require constant vigilant examination. To reduce the burden of unsafe practice, QMs must be subject to stringent scientific scrutiny, and hence must allow for peer-reviewed pay-for-performance (PR-P4P). A process such as PR-P4P is a directive with the goal of optimal fusion of economic incentives and patient-centered care. Although the past decade will undoubtedly be remembered for the gains made in patient safety and quality of care, continued improvement will require greater attention to the principles of scientific rigor in assessing measures of patient care quality and safety.

### Bayesian association scan reveals loci associated with human lifespan and linked biomarkers [^7d788180]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

While many of the obtained causal effect estimates seem plausible and in line with literature evidence, we do not claim that these causal effect estimates are unbiased, neither that no instruments violated MR assumptions. This step was necessary only to obtain sensible priors for the downstream analysis. If these estimates are wrong, our prior is less informative, yielding fewer discoveries.

Computing prior effect estimates

In total 77,963 SNPs had association P value <10 −5 with at least one of the 11 traits identified in the previous step to be causally linked to lifespan. For each of these SNPs we calculated the product of its effect on a given trait (set to zero if the association P value >10 −5) and the estimated causal effect of the trait on lifespan. These products were then summed up for all the 11 traits and used as prior effect estimate of the SNP on lifespan. For illustration we show how the effect sizes of these 78 K SNPs for four important traits compare to their effect on lifespan (Supplementary Fig. 4). Note that the agreement is far from perfect, but when combined together into a prior it correlates well with the estimated effect on lifespan in the UK Biobank study (Supplementary Fig. 5). We also computed priors for the remainder of the 2.3 million HapMap SNPs for which we imputed lifespan-association Z-statistics and effect estimates—their prior distribution was set to have zero mean as none of them were significant at 10 −5 for any of the 11 traits.

### Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution [^219e4f50]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Assembly theory

The concept of an object in AT is simple and rigorously defined. An object is finite, is distinguishable, persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable. This definition is, in some sense, opposite to standard physics, which treats objects of interest as fundamental and unbreakable (for example, the concept of ‘atoms’ as indivisible, which now applies to elementary particles). In AT, we recognize that the smallest unit of matter is typically defined by the limits of observational measurements and may not itself be fundamental. A more universal concept is to treat objects as anything that can be broken and built. This allows us to naturally account for the emergent objects produced by evolution and selection as fundamental to the theory. The concept of copy number is of foundational importance in defining a theory that accounts for selection. The more complex a given object, the less likely an identical copy can exist without selection of some information-driven mechanism that generates that object. An object that exists in multiple copies allows the signatures describing the set of constraints that built it to be measured experimentally. For example, mass spectrometry can be used to measure assembly for molecules, because it can measure how molecules are built by making bonds.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Participants

A total of 32 healthy voluntary children were initially recruited for this study. Three participants were excluded due to either incomplete imaging data (N = 1) or the presence of structural image anomalies (N = 2). The ART toolbox was employed to detect artifact points with two criteria: (1) frame‐to‐frame displacement > 0.5 * voxel size; (2) signal amplitude surpassing three standard deviations above the average whole‐brain signal. Subjects were eliminated when more than one‐third of the time points exhibited artifacts. Ultimately, no subject was eliminated due to measurement artifacts. Consequently, 29 participants (16 males, mean age = 8.61 ± 0.92) were included in the analyses. All participants were right‐handed, had normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, and had no history of neurological diseases. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all child participants, and the children themselves also gave their assent to participate in the study. Ethical approval of the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute.

2.2 Stimuli and Experimental Design

Each participant completed the dot number comparison task in the scanner and the basic arithmetic fluency test outside the scanner.

In the dot comparison task, all stimuli consisted of arrays of black dots presented on a gray circular area against a black background (Figure 1A). The number of dots ranged from 1 to 9. The total area and density were kept constant across all stimuli, while the element size of each dot and its presentation location were randomized. The numerical distance between stimuli ranged from 1 to 6, and the magnitude of the dot pairs and their numerical distances were orthogonalized. So, 12 basic dot pairs were used: 5–6, 4–6, 5–7, 2–5, 3–6, 4–7, 1–5, 4–8, 2–7, 3–8, 2–8, and 3–9. The order in which the two dot patterns within each pair were presented was counterbalanced, resulting in 24 pairs in total. Each pair was repeated three times, yielding a total of 72 trials. These trials were randomly distributed across three runs, each consisting of four mini‐blocks of six trials. Four rest blocks were interspersed between the task blocks in each run. The stimuli were presented in a pseudo‐random sequence, ensuring that no more than four consecutive trials required the same response side, and the same pair of stimuli was not presented consecutively.

Remaining questions

Limitations of indirect calorimetry.

As implied by its name, indirect calorimetry (the most common method employed to measure EE in both animal models and humans) does not measure EE directly. Rather, this method mathematically converts the measured rates of oxygen consumption (V 2) and/or carbon dioxide production (V 2) into EE data based on equations derived decades ago from studies in which indirect calorimetry was performed concurrently with direct calorimetry, the gold standard method for quantifying EE in animals. Direct calorimetry measures heat loss to assess heat production, which will equal EE unless net external work is being performed (heat loss equates with heat production under defined, steady-state conditions [rev. in {}]).

Although direct calorimetry has been largely supplanted by user-friendly commercial systems that measure EE via indirect calorimetry, it is informative to consider the assumptions that underlie the use of the latter approach to generate EE data. Indirect calorimetry estimates EE based on mathematical relationships that specify the amounts of energy and carbon dioxide that are produced given the amounts of carbohydrate, fat, and protein that are consumed. Indirect calorimetry also provides information on the mix of metabolic fuels being combusted in the form of the respiratory quotient, which is computed from the ratio of V 2 to V 2.

### Hierarchical composition of reliable recombinase logic devices [^57c4a95f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Recombinase logic gates present different arrangements of recombination sites and regulatory elements. Such architectures can produce devices having highly variable behavior,. Device complexity increases with the numbers of inputs to be computed, and engineering recombinase logic gates is still a trial-and-error process. Scaling-up recombinase logic circuits and extending their applications therefore requires simple and accessible engineering frameworks.

One approach to simplify logic design is to use Distributed Multicellular Computation (DMC),,. As in natural ecosystems, the computational labor is divided between various strains that perform specific tasks. In addition to reducing metabolic burden and supporting the reuse of biological parts, DMC is highly modular by nature and permits the implementation of all combinatorial logic functions by mixing different strains chosen from a reduced strain library,.

We recently devised a strategy for distributed multicellular recombinase logic. In our approach, the logic equation is written as a sum of product of literals corresponding to the Canonical Disjunctive Normal Form (CDNF) obtained using the Quine McCluskey algorithm. Each term of the CDNF implements a portion of the whole function, termed a subfunction, and is performed by a particular strain within a multicellular system (Fig. 1a). Each subfunction (i.e. a product of NOT and IDENTITY functions) is executed by a particular recombinase logic device. For a given number of inputs, a fixed, small number of recombinase devices can be differentially combined to obtain all combinatorial logic functions. The advantages conferred by this modular design are well exemplified by the number of functions that can be implemented using a reduced number of devices. For instance, all 65536 4-input logic functions can be implemented using only 14 standardized recombinase logic devices.

### Thermodynamics of quantum systems with multiple conserved quantities [^9299e804]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Recently, there has been much progress in understanding the thermodynamics of quantum systems, even for small individual systems. Most of this work has focused on the standard case where energy is the only conserved quantity. Here we consider a generalization of this work to deal with multiple conserved quantities. Each conserved quantity, which, importantly, need not commute with the rest, can be extracted and stored in its own battery. Unlike the standard case, in which the amount of extractable energy is constrained, here there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them. We present explicit protocols that allow us to perform arbitrarily good trade-offs and extract arbitrarily good combinations of conserved quantities from individual quantum systems.

Working memory

Working memory is the ability to hold information in mind and actively manipulate this information. 10 Working memory comprises a verbal and a visual–spatial subsystem. For both subsystems, tasks were reported in at least five papers. Both the visual–spatial and verbal working memory tasks reported below have been shown to activate brain areas that are important for working memory. 37, 38, 39

Visual–spatial working memory

In the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Spatial Working Memory task, 40 a number of coloured boxes are shown on a screen. Children were asked to find a yellow token in these boxes without selecting boxes that have already been found to be empty or revisiting boxes that have already been found to contain a token. Raw scores were used in the analyses.

Verbal working memory

In the Digit Span Task (DST), 41, 42, 43 children are asked to repeat a number of digits, first in the same order and then in reverse order. The reverse part measures verbal working memory. When the DST reverse score was not available, the DST total score was used instead. For the reversed DST, either raw scores or scaled scores (mean 10 [SD 3]) were used (as indicated in Table SI, online supporting information). For the DST total, scaled scores were used (mean 100 [SD 15]).

In the Letter Number Sequencing task, 42, 43 the test administrator reads a sequence of numbers and letters out loud and asks the child to repeat the numbers in ascending order, followed by the letters in alphabetical order. For Letter Number Sequencing, scaled scores were used (mean 10 [SD 3]).

When DST and Letter Number Sequencing scores were not available but the Working Memory Index (i.e. DST, Letter Number Sequencing, and Arithmetic subtests of the fourth and fifth editions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children) 42, 43 was, the Working Memory Index was used instead (scaled scores, mean 100 [SD 15]).

### NGLY1 deficiency: a prospective natural history study [^22761f55]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary objectives

There were two primary outcome measures for the NGLY1 deficiency NHS: (i) developmental assessment at baseline and longitudinally, as measured by the established scales and (ii) disease course over time as measured by standardized medical histories.

The following established scales were used for the primary outcome capturing development assessment: MSEL, Vineland-3, PDMS-2 and Beery–Buktenica Test of Visual Motor Integration (Beery VMI).

The MSEL is a direct assessment and provides a broad global assessment of development in children from birth to 68 months by examining five key subscales: gross motor, fine motor, visual reception, expressive language and receptive language. The DQ, which is calculated by averaging the five areas of the Mullen scale and dividing the developmental age by the chronological age × 100 (a DQ of 100 corresponds to an exact match between the developmental and chronological age), provides an overall approximation of the affected individual’s ability to function.

The Vineland-3 is a parent/caregiver-reported measure that uses a semi-structured interview to assess adaptive behavior across four domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills. It is used to support the diagnosis of intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Vineland ABC is derived from the communication, daily living skills and socialization domains.

The PDMS-2 includes five subscales used to calculate two quotients: grasping and visual–motor integration (which are used to calculate the fine motor quotient [FMQ]); and stationary, locomotion and object manipulation, replaced by the reflexes subtest for children up to 11 months old (which are used to calculate the gross motor quotient [GMQ)]). FMQ and GMQ can also be combined to yield a total motor quotient (TMQ). FMQ, GMQ and TMQ are scored similarly to the DQ. They compare developmental age to chronological age; a score of 100 represents an exact match between developmental age and chronological age. Scores that are lower or higher than 100 represent a developmental age that is less or more than the chronological age, respectively.

### The genetic relationship between educational attainment and cognitive performance in major psychiatric disorders [^fc60a14a]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Trail-Making-Test (TMT)

The TMT is a measure of visual attention and task switching and is one of several executive functioning measures. The test consists of two parts, part A assesses psychomotor speed of the participant, and part B assesses switching between two automated tasks (counting and reciting the alphabet). The time taken to complete each part of the test was measured and the difference in time needed (part B-part A) was used, as it is considered a more accurate measure of the divided attention and alternating sequencing tasks tested in part B –. In this case, a higher score meant worse cognitive performance.

Verbal digit span

The verbal digit span, from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, assesses short-term (forward digit-span) and working memory capacity (backward digit-span). Briefly, participants were asked to recall verbally a sequence of digits, with increasingly longer sequences in each trial. For each correctly recalled string of digits, one point was given. The test was ended when the participant was unable to correctly repeat two presented strings of the same length. The difference between the forward and backward task is that the latter involves mental manipulation as the participant is required to repeat the digits in backward order. A score for each task was considered.

Digit-Symbol-Test (DST)

The DST is a subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scaleand measures processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention. In this test, the participant was asked to use a key of numbers 1–9 with coinciding symbols to draw the appropriate symbol that matched the number given. The participant was given 120 s to fill in as many corresponding symbols as possible. In the end, the correct number of symbols drawn was totaled to get an overall score.

Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT)

The VLMT is the German version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. This word-list learning paradigm assesses several memory parameters through serial list learning with subsequent distraction, retrieval after distraction and half-hour time delay, and through a recognition task. The test consists of two different word lists which are each 15 independent words and a recognition list which includes 30 words from the two lists and 20 similar distractor words. Four VLMT scores were rated, the first for the number of correctly recalled words from the first list, a second score for the number of words lost after distraction, a third score of words lost after a time interval, and a fourth score of correctly recalled words from the recognition list.

### Efficient probabilistic inference in generic neural networks trained with non-probabilistic feedback [^f0e4f0ec]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When faced with noisy and incomplete sensory information, humans and other animals often behave near-optimally –. In many tasks, optimal behavior requires that the brain compute posterior distributions over task-relevant variables, which often involves complex operations such as multiplying probability distributions or marginalizing over latent variables. How do neural circuits implement such operations? A prominent framework addressing this question is the probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework, according to which the population activity on a single trial encodes a probability distribution rather than a single estimate and computations with probability distributions can be carried out by suitable operations on the corresponding neural responses,. For example, Ma et al.showed that if neural variability belongs to a particular class of probability distributions, the posterior distribution in cue combination tasks can be computed with a linear combination of the input responses. Moreover, in this scheme, the form of neural variability is preserved between the input and the output, leading to an elegantly modular code. In more complex tasks, linear operations are insufficient and it has been argued that multiplication and division of neural responses are necessary for optimal inference –.

Upon closer look, however, these previous implementations of PPC suffer from several shortcomings. First, the networks in these studies were either fully manually designed, or partially manually designed and partially trained with large amounts of probabilistic data to optimize explicitly probabilistic objectives, for example, minimization of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Therefore, this literature does not address the important question of learning: how can probabilistic inference be learned from a realistic amount and type of data with minimal manual design of the networks? Second, although there are some commonalities between the neural operations required to implement probabilistic inference in different tasks, these operations generally differ from task to task. For instance, it has been argued that some form of divisive normalization of neural responses is necessary in tasks that involve marginalization. However, the specific form of divisive normalization that individual neurons have to perform differs substantially from task to task. Therefore, it is unclear if probabilistic inference can be implemented in generic neural networks, whose neurons all perform the same type of neurally plausible operation. Third, in these studies, the number of neurons used for performing probabilistic inference scales unfavorably with the size of the input population (linearly in the case of cue combination, but at least quadratically in all other tasks). Therefore, the question of whether these tasks can be implemented more efficiently remains open.

### Online dynamical learning and sequence memory with neuromorphic nanowire networks [^846b95bc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Table 1 
MNIST digit classification using an NWN device with one and five readout channels for online and batch (offline) linear classifiers

Each classification accuracy is calculated for 10,000 testing samples and averaged across 5 iterations. The online classifier is trained for a single epoch of 50,000 training samples, while the batch-based classifier is trained and optimised using gradient descent for 100 epochs with 500 mini-batches of size 100.

To better understand how learning is achieved with the NWN device, we investigated further the dependence of classification accuracy on the number of training samples and the device readouts. Figure 3 a shows classification accuracy as a function of the number of digits presented to the classifier during training (See Supplementary Fig. S7 for classification results using different electrode combinations for input/drain/readouts and different voltage ranges). The classification accuracy consistently increases as more readout samples are presented to the classifier to update W and plateaus at ≃92% after ≃10,000 samples. Classification accuracy also increases with the number of readout channels, corresponding to an increase in the number of dynamical features (i.e. 5 × 784 features per digit for 5 channel readouts, the channels are added following the order 1,2,13,15,12) that become sufficiently distinguishable to improve classification. However, as shown in Fig. 3 b, this increase is not linear, with the largest improvements observed from 1 to 2 channels. Figure 3 c shows the confusion matrix for the classification result using 5 readout channels after learning from 50,000 digit samples. The classification results for 8 digits lie within 1.5 σ (where s.d. is σ = 3%) from the average (93.4%). Digit ‘1’ demonstrates significantly higher accuracy since it has a simpler structure, and ‘5’ is an outlier because of the irregular variances of handwriting and low pixel resolution (See Supplementary Fig. S8 for examples of misclassified digits).

2.3 Cognitive function

Five standardized cognitive tests were administered to participants at both baseline and follow‐up. These tests covered different domains of cognitive function, including verbal learning and recall (immediate and delayed verbal recall), attention and working memory (forward and backward digit span), and executive function (verbal fluency). A summary variable representing overall cognitive performance was created based on the results of these tests for each participant.

In the immediate verbal recall test, the interviewer read a list of words, then the respondents were given 1 minute to repeat as many words as possible. This test was repeated three times. Upon completing the third trial, other cognitive tests were conducted. A delayed verbal recall test followed, in which respondents recalled words again without the interviewer repeating the list. Each correctly recalled word was recorded as one point. For the forward and backward digit span test, the respondents were asked to repeat a string of numbers forward and backward, respectively, with the number of the longest error‐free series repeated recorded as the total score. To assess verbal fluency, the respondents were given 1 minute to name as many animals as possible, with one point scored for each correct answer.

Composite z scores were calculated to represent overall cognitive performance, allowing for comparison between participants.Each test score was standardized based on the mean and standard deviation of the baseline test scores, and the composite z score was calculated by averaging the z scores from the five tests.Finally, composite z scores were converted to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive performance for each participant.
