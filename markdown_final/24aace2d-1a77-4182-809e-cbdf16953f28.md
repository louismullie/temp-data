## Question

Symptoms of hypercalcemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of hypercalcemia, organized by organ system and severity, with attention to special populations and diagnostic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how severity is defined and how that maps to symptom prevalence. Then, I should verify the classic organ-system manifestations and the "stones, bones, moans, and groans" mnemonic. Next, I will examine severity-specific neurological and renal features, including hypercalcemic crisis. After that, I should review special populations such as children, older adults, and patients with malignancy. Finally, I will consider diagnostic implications and synthesize a practical, severity-based symptom profile with caveats about variability and overlap.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework, because symptom expression tracks with both the absolute calcium level and the acuity of rise. Mild hypercalcemia is typically total calcium less than 12 mg/dL, moderate 12–14 mg/dL, and severe greater than 14 mg/dL, with severe or rapidly rising calcium more likely to produce overt symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. I should double-check that these thresholds align with high-quality sources, and yes, JAMA and related reviews consistently use this schema [^117NS27X] [^113sascd]. Hold on, I should verify the malignancy-specific severity bands too; the Endocrine Society defines mild HCM as less than 12 mg/dL, moderate 12–14 mg/dL, and severe greater than 14 mg/dL, which matches this clinical convention and supports the symptom-severity correlation in oncology settings [^116iNEwN].

> Next, I will organize symptoms by organ system, starting with neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular manifestations, since these are often the earliest to appear. Fatigue, weakness, and cognitive complaints like impaired concentration are common even with mild hypercalcemia, while confusion, somnolence, and coma track with severe or rapidly rising calcium; I need to ensure I capture the full spectrum, including depression, anxiety, and rarely seizures, which are reported in severe cases and in pediatric literature, so I will include those with appropriate caveats [^117NS27X] [^113sascd] [^116nvi1z]. Wait, let me verify the mnemonic; "psychic groans" indeed refers to neuropsychiatric symptoms, which fits the classic teaching and aligns with contemporary reviews of PHPT and hypercalcemia presentations [^1154kG31] [^1176xNEt].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal symptoms, which tend to emerge as calcium rises and are classically summarized as "abdominal moans". Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, and abdominal pain are common, with constipation being particularly frequent; pancreatitis and peptic ulcer disease are less common but recognized complications in more severe or prolonged hypercalcemia, so I should flag those as red flags for severity and chronicity [^117NS27X] [^113sascd] [^1154kG31]. Hold on, I should verify that pancreatitis is indeed linked mechanistically to calcium-mediated pancreatic injury; while the exact mechanism is complex, case series and reviews document this association, supporting its inclusion in severe presentations [^1154kG31].

> Now, renal and genitourinary manifestations, the "stones" and "polyuria/polydipsia" cluster, deserve careful attention because they often drive presentation. Polyuria and polydipsia reflect nephrogenic diabetes insipidus from impaired concentrating ability, and nephrolithiasis results from hypercalciuria; nephrocalcinosis and reduced glomerular filtration can occur in chronic or severe disease, and oliguria or anuria signal hypercalcemic crisis requiring urgent intervention, so I should emphasize these as severity markers [^117NS27X] [^113sascd] [^1158y4CC]. Wait, let me verify the crisis features; classic descriptions highlight oliguria/anuria alongside altered mentation, reinforcing the need for emergent hemodialysis in select refractory cases, which I will note with appropriate caution about indications and setting [^1158y4CC].

> Turning to skeletal manifestations, I need to distinguish acute pain from chronic skeletal complications. Bone pain and osteopenia/osteoporosis are common in chronic hypercalcemia, particularly in PHPT, and osteitis fibrosa cystica is a more dramatic, now-rare manifestation of longstanding disease. Fractures, especially cortical bone sites like the wrist, can occur, and bone pain may also reflect malignancy-related osteolysis, so I should frame these as both symptom and complication signals [^1176xNEt] [^117NS27X] [^113sascd]. Hold on, I should verify that the "bones" in the mnemonic primarily reflects pain and structural disease rather than acute events; yes, that interpretation is consistent with modern PHPT phenotypes and reviews [^1176xNEt].

> Cardiovascular features are less specific but can be life-threatening at extreme calcium levels. Hypertension is common, and ECG changes include shortened QT at moderate elevations and potential conduction abnormalities, bradyarrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest at very high calcium; I should confirm that these severe cardiac manifestations are typically reported when total calcium exceeds about 3.75–5 mmol/L, which is supported by pediatric emergency literature and case-based reviews [^116nvi1z] [^1154kG31]. But wait, what if the patient is on digoxin? Hypercalcemia can potentiate digitalis toxicity, so I need to flag medication history as it modulates arrhythmic risk and management urgency [^116nvi1z].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children, where the symptom profile and thresholds differ. Infants and young children may present with hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, lethargy, polyuria, dehydration, failure to thrive, and seizures; older children and adolescents can develop psychiatric symptoms, and severe cases may show renal failure or pancreatitis, so I should adjust the index of suspicion downward for subtle neurocognitive or growth-related complaints [^113MgFui] [^113ioQi5] [^116nvi1z]. Hold on, I should verify that pediatric severity bands align with adult conventions; many sources use similar total calcium cut points, but clinical expression often occurs at lower thresholds in children, reinforcing the need for early intervention when symptomatic [^116nvi1z].

> Next, I should review older adults, in whom neurocognitive and functional decline may dominate. Delirium and cognitive impairment are more prominent, and hypercalcemia is a reversible contributor in advanced cancer; polyuria and dehydration can precipitate falls and acute kidney injury, so I need to ensure that symptom assessment includes mental status, volume status, and medication contributors like thiazides or calcium/vitamin D supplements [^1142VF6w] [^117NS27X] [^113sascd]. Wait, let me verify that delirium workups in palliative and oncology contexts routinely include calcium; interdisciplinary case literature supports screening for metabolic causes, including hypercalcemia, to guide reversal strategies [^1142VF6w].

> Patients with malignancy warrant a dedicated lens because hypercalcemia of malignancy often presents with moderate-to-severe symptoms and confers high morbidity. Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, confusion, and bone pain are common, and severe cases can progress to renal failure, coma, or arrhythmias. I should also note that hypercalcemia in cancer is frequently mediated by PTHrP, local osteolysis, or calcitriol excess, which explains the aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis if untreated [^116YydmG] [^111MYbw6] [^111diyfJ]. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence and severity bands in oncology guidelines; the Endocrine Society confirms that HCM is common and stratifies severity as mild less than 12 mg/dL, moderate 12–14 mg/dL, and severe greater than 14 mg/dL, aligning with the symptom escalation pattern seen in practice [^116iNEwN].

> I should also consider primary hyperparathyroidism, where the modern phenotype is often mild and asymptomatic. Many patients are discovered incidentally, yet subtle neurocognitive complaints, fatigue, constipation, and bone or kidney complications may be present. Nephrolithiasis and reduced bone mineral density are key end-organ signals even when calcium is only modestly elevated, so I need to ask targeted questions about stones, bone pain, and mood or memory changes [^1176xNEt] [^117NS27X] [^113sascd]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that all PHPT is asymptomatic; that would be inaccurate, as a meaningful minority have symptoms even with mild biochemical disease, and delays in diagnosis are associated with more sequelae, underscoring the importance of screening and timely referral [^1176xNEt] [^113vgyQn].

> Let me synthesize a severity-based symptom profile, while reminding myself that individual susceptibility and acuity of rise modulate presentation. Mild hypercalcemia is often asymptomatic but may show fatigue, weakness, constipation, cognitive slowing, and polyuria/polydipsia. Moderate disease adds more pronounced nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, and bone pain. Severe hypercalcemia brings vomiting, oliguria or anuria, marked confusion or somnolence, and coma, with potential arrhythmias or cardiac arrest at extreme levels, particularly when calcium rises rapidly over days to weeks [^117NS27X] [^113sascd] [^116nvi1z]. I should double-check that this progression is consistent with both general reviews and oncology guidance, and yes, the Endocrine Society's HCM guidance mirrors this escalation and supports early aggressive therapy when symptoms are significant or calcium is severely elevated [^116YydmG] [^116iNEwN].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic implications are explicit. Because symptoms are nonspecific, a high index of suspicion is warranted in at-risk groups such as patients with cancer, older adults with cognitive changes, or children with failure to thrive. Checking corrected total calcium or ionized calcium and following with intact PTH rapidly separates PTH-mediated from non–PTH-mediated causes and guides urgency and therapy, so I should emphasize that symptom appraisal and biochemical testing must proceed in parallel to avoid delays in care [^117NS27X] [^113sascd] [^116YydmG]. Hold on, I should verify that delays in PHPT diagnosis worsen outcomes; large cohort data show increased sequelae with prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment, reinforcing the need to measure PTH in unexplained hypercalcemia even when symptoms are subtle [^113vgyQn] [^111H9AXb].

Hypercalcemia presents with **neurologic symptoms** (fatigue, confusion, lethargy, coma) [^117NS27X], **gastrointestinal symptoms** (nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, pancreatitis) [^1154kG31], **renal symptoms** (polyuria, polydipsia, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency) [^1154kG31], and **cardiovascular symptoms** (hypertension, arrhythmias, shortened QT) [^116nvi1z]. Severity correlates with calcium level and acuity: mild cases are often asymptomatic, whereas severe or rapidly rising calcium (> 14 mg/dL) [^117NS27X] can cause life-threatening complications such as coma, renal failure, and cardiac arrest [^111diyfJ]. The classic mnemonic "stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric overtones" summarizes renal, skeletal, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric manifestations [^1154kG31].

---

## Neurologic symptoms

Neurologic manifestations reflect neuronal hyperexcitability and **range from subtle to severe**:

- **Fatigue and weakness**: Common even in mild hypercalcemia [^117NS27X].
- **Confusion and cognitive impairment**: Difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and disorientation [^1154kG31].
- **Lethargy and somnolence**: Progressive drowsiness and reduced alertness [^113sascd].
- **Coma**: Severe hypercalcemia (> 14 mg/dL) can cause coma [^117NS27X].
- **Seizures**: Rare, typically in severe cases [^116nvi1z].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and often **nonspecific**:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent in moderate to severe hypercalcemia [^117NS27X].
- **Constipation**: Very common due to reduced intestinal motility [^1154kG31].
- **Abdominal pain**: Nonspecific and may mimic other conditions [^1154kG31].
- **Pancreatitis**: Rare but serious complication [^1154kG31].
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Rare, associated with severe hypercalcemia [^1154kG31].

---

## Renal symptoms

Hypercalcemia impairs renal function through nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and calcium deposition, causing **polyuria and polydipsia** from impaired concentrating ability, **nephrolithiasis** from calcium oxalate/phosphate stones, and **renal insufficiency** from calcium-induced nephropathy [^1154kG31].

---

## Cardiovascular symptoms

Cardiovascular effects include **hypertension** — common due to vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance — and **arrhythmias**, including bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and ventricular fibrillation in severe cases [^116nvi1z]. A **shortened QT interval** is a classic ECG finding [^1154kG31].

---

## Skeletal symptoms

Skeletal manifestations reflect increased bone resorption and include **bone pain** from demineralization and osteoporosis, and **osteitis fibrosa cystica** — a classic feature of chronic hyperparathyroidism with cystic bone lesions [^1176xNEt].

---

## Severity-based symptom summary

| **Severity** | **Calcium level (mg/dl)** | **Common symptoms** | **Severe symptoms** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | 10.5–12 | - Fatigue <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Polyuria <br/> - Polydipsia | ∅ |
| Moderate | 12–14 | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Bone pain | ∅ |

### Managing primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care [^114qisRa]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with calcium concentrations above 3 mmol/L typically start to develop symptoms of hypercalcaemia, which can include nausea, vomiting, thirst and polyuria, malaise, confusion, lowered pain threshold and coma. Milder hypercalcaemia (calcium concentrations < 3 mmol/L) is often asymptomatic, and the problem is therefore usually discovered as an incidental finding on routine biochemical screening. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcaemia. Here, we consider the recognition and further management of patients presenting with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in the patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

### Calcium gluconate [^113fRp4f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of Calcium Gluconate Injection may result in hypercalcemia. Symptoms of hypercalcemia typically develop when the total serum calcium concentration is ≥ 12 mg/dL. Neurologic symptoms include depression, weakness, fatigue, and confusion at lower levels, with patients experiencing hallucinations, disorientation, hypotonicity, seizures, and coma. Effects on the kidney include diminished ability to concentrate urine and diuresis.

If overdose of Calcium Gluconate Injection occurs immediately discontinue administration and provide supportive treatments to restore intravascular volume as well as promote calcium excretion in the urine if necessary.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^1176xNEt]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism resulting from an abnormal increase in the secretion of PTH from one or more of the parathyroid glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary hyperparathyroidism is primarily caused by solitary parathyroid adenoma (80%), four-gland hyperplasia (10–15%), multiple adenomas (5%), and parathyroid cancer (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The average incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in men and women in the US is 24.7 and 65.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The age-adjusted prevalence in men and women is 85.2 and 232.7 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Primary hyperparathyroidism can present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities to overt end-organ complications. In developed countries, approximately 85% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, identified incidentally through routine biochemical screening, while around 20% present with renal manifestations (such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), skeletal complications (including fractures, osteitis fibrosa cystica, or bone pain), or symptomatic hypercalcemia. In contrast, the majority of patients in developing countries present with symptomatic disease. Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with overt skeletal and renal complications and may also include cardiovascular and neurocognitive symptoms. Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is further classified based on the presence or absence of target organ involvement, such as reduced bone mineral density or kidney stones. Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, defined by elevated PTH levels in the setting of normal serum calcium, may also present with or without end-organ involvement.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Parathyroidectomies have > 98% cure rates. The recurrence rates of double parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, and single adenoma are 4.0%, 2.2%, and 1.3%, respectively.

### Rare causes of hypercalcemia: 2021 update [^116b7eai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the etiology of hypercalcemia, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis of rare causes of hypercalcemia, extending the observations of the original article.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive extensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology", as well as examining the references in the identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults vs pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definitive assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanism with discussion of likely etiology.

Evidence Synthesis

There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause of hypercalcemia is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology.

Conclusions

The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.

### Clinical heterogeneity and therapeutic options for idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia caused bypathogenic variant [^112DyGo1]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Infantile hypercalcemia-1 (HCINF1) is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in the inability to metabolize active vitamin D. This leads to hypercalcemia and severe complications.

Content

On December 8th, 2022, a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Wanfang, and CNKI using the keywords "hypercalcemia" and " CYP24A1 ". Data extraction included patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment medications, and outcomes. The findings were synthesized to identify common patterns and variations among cases and to assess the efficacy of different therapies in reducing serum calcium. Our findings revealed two distinct peaks in the incidence of HCINF1 caused by CYP24A1 pathogenic variant. Kidney stones or renal calcifications were the most common clinical manifestations of the disease, followed by polyuria and developmental delay. Laboratory investigations showed hypercalcemia, elevated vitamin D levels, hypercalciuria, and low parathyroid hormone. Genetic analysis remains the only reliable diagnostic tool. Although there is no definitive cure for HCINF1, multiple drugs, including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and rifampicin, have been used to control its symptoms. Blocking the production and intake of vitamin D is the preferred treatment option.

Summary and Outlook

Our review highlights the basic clinical and biochemical features of HCINF1 and suggests that targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are needed to address the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. The insights gained from this study may facilitate the development of innovative treatments for HCINF1.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^117Stq8F]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypercalcemia in a patient with malignancy [^111wsekJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy and portends a worse prognosis. It causes a variety of symptoms in patients, which can range from confusion and polyuria to coma and death. There are 4 broad mechanistic categories to classify hypercalcemia of malignancy: local osteolysis secondary to metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, excess parathyroid-related hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, and ectopic parathyroid hormone production. Volume expansion with normal saline solution and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone destruction are effective initial therapies. Calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids can serve as adjunctive therapies. Denosumab is an attractive therapeutic option for refractory cases of hypercalcemia, although more data are required before this therapy can be recommended.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^116PPaUD]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. The condition is most common in postmenopausal women, although it can occur in persons of all ages, including pregnant women. If symptoms are present, they are attributable to hypercalcemia and may include weakness, easy fatigability, anorexia, or anxiety. However, most persons have no symptoms, and primary hyperparathyroidism usually is diagnosed after an elevated serum calcium level is found incidentally on multiphasic chemistry panel testing. Persistent hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone level are the diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism. Other causes of hypercalcemia are rare, and usually are associated with low (or sometimes normal) parathyroid hormone levels. Malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients. Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, the procedure has success rates of 90 to 95 percent and a low rate of complications. Asymptomatic patients who decline surgery and meet criteria for medical management must commit to conscientious long-term monitoring. Any unexplained elevation of the serum calcium level should be evaluated promptly to prevent complications from hypercalcemia.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^111Q1kNX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia: relationships and clinical implications [^111oqC4C]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the unusual occurrence of both familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and primary hyperparathyroidism in the same patient and to explore potential mechanisms of association and issues related to clinical management.

Methods

We discuss the diagnosis, compare the clinical presentations of FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism, review the literature regarding patients who have presented with both disorders, and discuss management considerations. We also describe 2 patients who have both FHH (confirmed by genetic testing for a mutation in the gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor [CASR]) and primary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

The occurrence of both FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism in the same patient has been reported in a few cases, including 2 patients described here, one of whom was documented to have a novel CASR mutation. In those with clinical sequelae of hyperparathyroidism, parathyroidectomy has led to reduction, but not normalization, of serum calcium levels.

Conclusions

The coexistence of FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism should be considered in patients with hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, frankly elevated parathyroid hormone levels, and low urinary calcium excretion. Genetic testing for inactivating CASR gene mutations can confirm the diagnosis of FHH. Although surgical intervention does not resolve hypercalcemia, it may be beneficial by reducing the degree of hypercalcemia, alleviating the symptoms, and preventing potential complications of hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, and this contributes to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild pHPT. However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation, if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcaemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, current medications and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT. This suggests that some patients with biochemically determined pHPT have not been evaluated by a specialist in endocrine surgery or endocrinology. Because of the lack of guidelines, these patients risk being incorrectly evaluated and followed up. If these patients do exist, their characteristics and symptoms, as well as the best way to handle these patients, have not yet been studied in a Swedish setting.

To conclude, the aim of this study was to investigate how patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with pHPT are managed in respect to referral to specialists and follow-up in a setting without firm local guidelines.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part one: evaluation [^114DPBUM]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder characterized by the autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) that leads to hypercalcemia, multiple clinical sequelae, and heterogenous presentation. Whether PHPT is caused by a single benign adenoma (85%), multiglandular disease (15%), or parathyroid carcinoma (1%), surgery is the definitive treatment.

### Severe hypercalcemia in a postpartum patient [^117RrSvu]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are multiple clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia and several causes of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome is increasing in frequency.

Case Report

A 26-year-old woman presented after having undergone caesarian section. She complained of severe myalgias, arthralgias, an inability to ambulate, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and marked depression. Each of these symptoms has a broad differential diagnosis, but when considered together the theme "stones, bones, moans, and groans", seen in patients with hypercalcemia, is evident. This patient was found to have hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome related to the ingestion of calcium carbonate. Her symptoms and hypercalcemia resolved with treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of the many different symptoms of hypercalcemia. This case emphasizes the need for a careful medication history for any patient presenting with hypercalcemia, including over the counter medications. Physicians should have a high level of suspicion for milk-alkali syndrome in patients with hypercalcemia because milk-alkali syndrome is no longer a rare etiology but rather one of the most common causes of hypercalcemia.

### The risk of cancer in primary care patients with hypercalcaemia: a cohort study using electronic records [^1174sbgM]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

This study should help GPs investigate hypercalcaemia appropriately. Although there have been many reports on the causes and prognosis of hypercalcaemia in secondary care, there is little evidence from primary care.

The risk of malignancy correlated with the degree of hypercalcaemia, with significant differences between men and women (OR 2.14, P < 0.001). In men, even mild hypercalcaemia (2.6–2.8 mmol l −1) conferred a risk of cancer in 1 year of 11.5%. If the calcium was above 2.8 mmol l −1, the risk increased to 28%. In women, the risks were much less, with the corresponding figures being 4.1% and 8.7%. This disparity in risk has not previously been documented in hypercalcaemia, although men in the United Kingdom have a greater risk of cancer in general. It is important to note that malignancy was still uncommon, as most cases of hypercalcaemia in this study were mild.

In men, 81% of the cancer associated with hypercalcaemia was caused by lung, prostate, myeloma, colorectal and other haematological cancers. In hypercalcaemic men, clinicians should consider the above malignancies, and investigate appropriately. We did not study symptom reporting in our hypercalcaemic participants, although it is likely that many of the patients harbouring malignancy would have had additional diagnostic pointers towards their diagnosis. In primary care, simple investigations for all of these cancers (except for colorectal cancer) are available, so initial cancer investigation may not require specialist referral.

In women, cancer was much less common. This may reflect the lower cancer incidence in general (2.4% vs 4.6%, in all participants in this study); alternatively, primary hyperparathyroidism is much more common in women, and is therefore likely to account for some of the benign hypercalcaemia in this study.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^1162YY3B]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy

The most effective therapy for patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy is treatment of the underlying cancer in order to reduce tumour production of factors that promote bone resorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption; however, this may not be possible or effective in patients with advanced cancer. Therapies that inhibit bone resorption and promote renal calcium excretion therefore become important. Most patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy are dehydrated at presentation and rehydration is often the first step of treatment. Saline should be given at a maximal initial rate of 200–300 mL/h, then adjusted to maintain a urine output of 100–150 mL/h. This, however, relieves the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying disease, and therefore, rehydration alone rarely resolves hypercalcaemia. Nearly all patients with hypercalcaemia of malignancy have increased osteoclastic bone resorption; hence, inhibition of bone resorption is a key target for management of the condition.

### Can biochemical abnormalities predict symptomatology in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism? [^11682eWj]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with a myriad of symptoms, which range in severity. The cause of these symptoms is not well understood. We sought to determine if the severity of preoperative biochemical abnormalities (calcium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D levels) correlated with symptomatology in patients undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism.

Study Design

Over 15 months, 229 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism completed a symptom questionnaire before parathyroidectomy. The symptom profiles of patients with significant hypercalcemia at initial presentation (≥ 11.2 mg/dL) and those with baseline calcium levels (< 11.2 mg/dL) were compared. The patients were also categorized based on parathyroid hormone (< or ≥ 130 pg/mL) and vitamin D (< or ≥ 30 ng/mL) and analyzed in a similar manner.

Results

Seventy-eight patients (34%) had a baseline calcium ≥ 11.2 mg/dL, but compared with patients with calcium < 11.2 mg/dL, only the incidence of nephrolithiasis was more common in those patients with significant hypercalcemia (18% vs 9%, p = 0.04). Conversely, depression, bone or joint pain, and constipation were all significantly more common in patients with calcium < 11.2mg/dL (p = 0.006, 0.001, and 0.031, respectively). Patients analyzed based on parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels showed no significant difference in symptom presentation.

Conclusions

These data indicate that the degree of parathyroid hormone elevation and the presence of vitamin D deficiency do not correlate with the presence of symptoms in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Significant hypercalcemia was associated with nephrolithiasis, but interestingly, patients with milder hypercalcemia had significantly more depression, bone or joint pain, and constipation, suggesting that these symptoms are likely not mediated by hypercalcemia.

### Investigation and management of hypercalcaemia in children [^113ioQi5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcaemia is a far less common finding in children than in adults. It may present with characteristic symptoms or may be identified as a coincidental finding in children investigated for a variety of complaints. Assessment of hypercalcaemia requires an understanding of the normal physiological regulation of plasma calcium by the combined actions of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the calcium sensing receptor. Hypercalcaemia will usually require treatment using a number of different modalities but occasionally it can be due to a benign asymptomatic condition that requires no intervention. This article presents a logical approach to the investigation and subsequent management of this condition.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116DmzkM]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The source of the increase in serum Ca ++ varies depending on the severity of the hypercalcemia. In mild‐to‐moderate disease, both an increase in bone resorption and postprandial calcitriol‐mediated intestinal calcium hyperabsorption contribute to the hypercalcemia (Table 2). Intestinal calcium transport, which largely takes place in the proximal intestine, occurs by both transcellular and paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway is a tightly regulated pathway and is increased by 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. The paracellular pathway can also be regulated by modulation of tight junction proteins such as claudin 2 and claudin12. Expression of both claudins is increased by 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D thereby augmenting paracellular calcium transport. The increase in distal tubular calcium reabsorption plays a greater role in sustaining the hypercalcemia than intestinal calcium absorption. In the typical patient with mild to moderate PHPT, plasma calcium and PTH levels can remain stable for years and when the hypercalcemia is mild (ie, less than 11.0 mg/dL [2.75 mmol/L]) patients often have relatively few symptoms. When the hypercalcemia is more severe, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, muscle weakness, and impaired mentation can occur. Rarely a patient may experience sudden worsening of PHPT, so called parathyroid storm or acute hyperparathyroidism. Although PTH lowers the renal phosphate threshold, frank hypophosphatemia is uncommon in most cases of PHPT. Low‐normal phosphate values are commonly seen in PHPT, although it is not as reliable a finding as hypercalcemia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is elevated in patients with PHPT and correlates positively with serum calcium and PTH and negatively with levels of serum phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. However, in a multiple regression analysis only serum calcium and creatinine clearance were predictors of FGF23, and serum levels of FGF23 did not change after curative surgery, suggesting that this hormone is not likely to play a major role in mediating the hypophosphatemia seen in PHPT. Vitamin D deficiency is also frequently seen in PHPT and can exacerbate its severity.

Because, as just noted, the more well‐established consequences of dysregulated parathyroid function are covered elsewhere in this series, the remainder of this section is devoted to selected new and emerging aspects of the pathophysiology of PHPT as well as to areas of uncertainty.

Adults with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma — agent selection and sequencing: In adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, we suggest treatment with either a calcimimetic or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab). Depending on the clinical situation and severity of hypercalcemia, an IV BP or Dmab may be useful prior to calcimimetic initiation. In adults with mild hypercalcemia and related symptoms, we suggest starting therapy with calcimimetics; conversely, for adults with moderate to severe hypercalcemia and related symptoms, an IV BP or Dmab should be the initial therapy. This recommendation considers the more rapid onset of action of an IV BP or Dmab, and generally better tolerability profile than a calcimimetic (as adverse events are common with increasing calcimimetic doses). Surgery should be considered when feasible, once control of severe hypercalcemia has been achieved.

### Clinical review: rare causes of hypercalcemia [^114AsAaU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Although hypercalcemia is usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, a number of other conditions can be important to consider. This review considers unusual causes of hypercalcemia that are generally not found in reviews on this subject.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles describing rarely reported associations between hypercalcemia and unusual causes were identified through a computer search of the terms hypercalcemia/etiology and through the references listed in those articles. We grouped the 58 different reports into categories defined by a presumed etiology: increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or PTHrP, occult milk-alkali syndrome, and undefined mechanisms. Reports in infants and children are listed separately, as are reports of pseudohypercalcemia, situations that are not truly hypercalcemic because the ionized calcium is normal.

Evidence Synthesis

In some situations, as this review points out, a number of unusual causes of hypercalcemia are important to consider. The search for an elusive cause of hypercalcemia is best accomplished by the most likely potential mechanism. An orderly search in this manner is likely to reveal the underlying cause.

Conclusions

That so many patients have been described with rare and usually poorly understood causes of hypercalcemia highlights our incomplete understanding of calcium metabolism in humans and suggests additional areas in which directed clinical investigation might improve our knowledge of the normal metabolism of calcium.

### The diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112J6QyU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Classical primary hyperparathyroidism — a disease of 'bones, stones, and psychic groans' — is a rarity in the US, although it is still seen in some parts of the world. Today, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. This change in clinical profile is not merely because of improved detection techniques, and patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who lack symptoms, if left untreated, rarely develop the 'classical' features that were common previously. Indeed, currently available data suggest that there is, today, a disorder with different, yet characteristic, effects on the end-organs of the hyperparathyroid process. In this review, the features of the skeletal, renal, neuropsychologic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations of 'asymptomatic' primary hyperparathyroidism will be discussed. The considerable body of data that has emerged since the recognition of the new clinical profile of primary hyperparathyroidism has allowed a reconsideration of standards of care for this disease. These data were reviewed and incorporated into new clinical guidelines at the 2002 NIH workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. These recommendations highlight both what is known about the disease, and important areas that need investigation. Continued interest in the skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease, and therapeutic trials of medical approaches for its management, will further refine our current understanding, and could lead to additional modifications in the approach to patients with this common endocrine disorder.

### Etiology and pathophysiology of hypoparathyroidism: a narrative review [^116qwvag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Future directions, unanswered questions, and research agenda

There are several unanswered questions, and further studies are necessary.

For example, hypocalcemia has been reported in patients with viral infection with such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Ebola-virus. However, the mechanism and the natural course of this hypocalcemia has not been well characterized.

The mechanism underlying the profound increase in bone mass in hypoparathyroidism is not clearly understood.

PTH treatment improves several symptoms and QOL in patients with hypoparathyroidism. However, it is not completely understood whether this improvement is caused by direct actions of PTH on various tissues or by a better control of s-Ca levels. It is not clear what the optimal s-Ca levels are for a given patient, because some patients complain of symptoms even when s-Ca is normal. It is possible that the lack of PTH accounts for such problems.

Many etiologies for hypoparathyroidism have been identified, but the pathogenesis is unexplained in a large number of patients. The term idiopathic or primary hypoparathyroidism is still used in the literature because it is difficult to determine the etiologies in all cases of hypoparathyroidism. Future research should address as yet unknown causes of this disease.

The value of emerging technologies and intraoperative assessment of parathyroid viability on the functionality of the parathyroid glands after surgical manipulation merits further assessment.

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems. Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol) replacement.

### Calcimimetic use in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia – A perspective in endocrinology [^1157LtGr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) causes lifelong hypercalcemia that even persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. Symptoms are usually mild. Past recommendations have often been for monitoring and against surgical or pharmacologic treatments.

Methods

Review of publications about FHH, calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs), and calcimimetics.

Results

FHH reflects heterozygous germline mutation of CASR, GNA11, or AP2S1. These mutations inactivate the CaSRs in the parathyroid cell. Thereby, they shift the serum calcium set point to higher values and cause hypercalcemia. Calcimimetic drugs enhance the effects of calcium on the CaSRs and thereby inhibit the parathyroid cell. Calcimimetic drugs are indicated in adults with primary hyperparathyroidism without a good surgical option. Calcimimetic safety and efficacy are not established in children younger than age 18 years. Recent case reports have described treatment of FHH with calcimimetics. Success was classified as combinations of subjective improvements and decreases of serum calcium levels, but not necessarily into the normal range. Treatment was successful in 14 of 16 cases (88%).

Conclusion

Deductions based on these case reports have limitations. For example, failures of therapy may not have been reported. Cost of the drug might be rate limiting. Calcimimetics can be offered to adults with FHH and those in whom the serum calcium level is > 0.25 mM (1 mg/dL) beyond the upper limit of normal or with possible symptoms of hypercalcemia. Calcimimetics can now be offered to more adults with FHH.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^115tWxh6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia. It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer. On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents. Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Further to this, physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### Analysis of time to diagnosis and outcomes among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^116T5Ftk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

It is unclear why patients with unexplained hypercalcemia did not undergo measurement of PTH. Although this group experienced increased rates of symptoms and diagnoses associated with PHP, their symptoms were considerably less severe compared with those with PTH measurements. It may be that they were considered to be asymptomatic and therefore did not undergo further workup. Diagnostic evaluation should not be restricted to the most symptomatic patients; therefore, this represents an opportunity for improvement. Furthermore, research indicates that patients who are labeled asymptomatic may still report symptoms when prompted or after undergoing cognitive testing. Our review only reported the rates of those symptoms that were coded, which likely underrepresented the true incidence of symptomatic patients. This suggests that there should be a strong suspicion for hyperparathyroidism in patients with hypercalcemia.

A possible explanation for missed diagnoses in patients with hypercalcemia and inappropriately nonsuppressed PTH between 50 and 65 pg/mL could be they were not identified because their PTH levels were within the reference range. Patients without a diagnosis with frankly elevated PTH greater than or equal to 65 pg/mL may be explained by the fact that clinicians often attribute hypercalcemia to other causes, even in patients with elevated PTH.

Another contributing factor for missed diagnoses may be that high-risk patients had lower calcium and PTH levels vs those whose PHP was diagnosed. Similarly, patients who experienced delayed diagnosis or time to treatment also had lower calcium and PTH compared with the timely diagnosis and treatment groups. Although greater PTH levels increased the likelihood of diagnosis and treatment, they did not correlate with disease burden in our study, a finding consistent with prior literature.

Among patients with a PHP diagnosis, those whose workup took over a year had significantly increased rates of disease sequelae over time, as seen at 2 to 3 years after hypercalcemia. Our study found that 40.2% of patients underwent surgical management after diagnosis, which is within the reported range of 16.8% to 67.2%. Patients who waited longer than 1 year from diagnosis to surgery also had increased rates of serious complications such as osteoporosis and HTN over time. Therefore, efforts to reduce diagnostic and treatment delays are worthwhile endeavors. Raising awareness about the diagnosis of PHP is important because it will lead to the evaluation of those associated conditions that should prompt referral to surgery as per the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated hypercalcaemia [^1113vsdj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have recently become a cornerstone for the treatment of different advanced cancers. These drugs have the ability to reactivate the immune system against tumour cells but can also trigger a myriad of side effects, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Although there are numerous reports of CPI-related endocrinopathies, hypercalcaemia as a suspected irAE is not well documented. The mechanisms of CPI hypercalcaemia are not clearly established. However, in our review, four distinct causes emerged: endocrine disease-related, sarcoid-like granuloma, humoral hypercalcaemia due to parathyroid-related hormone and hyperprogressive disease following CPI initiation. Prompt recognition of hypercalcaemia and the institution of therapy can be lifesaving, affording the opportunity to address the underlying aetiology. In this review we discuss the incidence, diagnosis and management of immune-related hypercalcaemia in oncological patients receiving CPI agents.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^112taDcv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111wk6QT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Once considered rare, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease of mineral metabolism. The most recent increase in the incidence was driven mainly by routine serum calcium determination or by calcium and parathyroid hormone measurements in the setting of investigations for osteoporosis. The Fourth International Workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism did not specifically focus on the global epidemiology of PHPT. Therefore, this narrative review fills this knowledge gap in the context of hypercalcemic PHPT. It is based on the literature review period between 1980 and 2020, utilizing available databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane). This section also highlights recent advances on pathophysiological aspects and genetics of PHPT.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia… [^1154kG31]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Normal ionized calcium levels are 4 to 5. 6 mg per dL. Hypercalcemia is considered mild if the total serum calcium level is between 10. 5 and 12 mg per dL. 5 Levels higher than 14 mg per dL can be life threatening. PTH is an 84-amino acid hormone produced by the four pea-sized parathyroid glands posterior to the thyroid gland. In response to low serum calcium levels, PTH raises calcium levels by accelerating osteoclastic bone resorption and increasing renal tubular resorption of calcium. It also increases calcitriol, which indirectly raises serum calcium levels. PTH causes phosphate loss through the kidneys. Thus, in patients with PTH-mediated hypercalcemia, serum phosphate levels tend to be low. Clinical Manifestations of Hypercalcemia The optimal concentration of serum ionized calcium is essential for normal cellular function. Hypercalcemia leads to hyperpolarization of cell membranes.

Patients with levels of calcium between 10. 5 and 12 mg per dL can be asymptomatic. 7 When the serum calcium level rises above this stage, multisystem manifestations become apparent. This constellation of symptoms has led to the mnemonic "Stones, bones, abdominal moans, and psychic groans, " which is used to recall the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, particularly as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism. Neuromuscular effects include impaired concentration, confusion, corneal calcification, fatigue, and muscle weakness. 8 Nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, and, rarely, peptic ulcer disease or pancreatitis are among the gastrointestinal manifestations. The most important renal effects are polydipsia and polyuria resulting from nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and nephrolithiasis resulting from hypercalciuria. Other renal effects include dehydration and nephrocalcinosis.

Cardiovascular effects include hypertension, vascular calcification, and a shortened QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Cardiac arrhythmias are rare. Bone pain can occur in patients with hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. Osteoporosis of cortical bone, such as the wrist, is mainly associated with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: effects on bone health [^114hAtxo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the most common cause of chronic hypercalcemia. With the advent of routine calcium screening, the classic presentation of renal and osseous symptoms has been largely replaced with mild, asymptomatic disease. In hypercalcemia caused by PHPT, serum parathyroid hormone levels are either high, or inappropriately normal. A single-gland adenoma is responsible for 80% of PHPT cases. Less frequent causes include 4-gland hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. Diminished bone mineral density and nephrolithiasis are the major current clinical sequelae. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for PHPT, and in experienced hands, cure rates approach 98%.

Adults with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma — initial pharmacotherapy and sequencing are suggested as follows: In adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, we suggest treatment with either a calcimimetic or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP) or denosumab (Dmab). (2⊕○○○) Depending on the clinical situation and severity of hypercalcemia, an IV BP or Dmab may be useful prior to calcimimetic initiation. In adults with mild HCM and related symptoms, we suggest starting therapy with calcimimetics; conversely, for adults with moderate to severe HCM and related symptoms, an IV BP or Dmab should be the initial therapy. In adult patients with parathyroid carcinoma, surgery should be considered when feasible, once control of severe HCM has been achieved; however, surgical considerations were outside of the scope of this guideline. This recommendation considers the more rapid onset of action of an IV BP or Dmab, and generally better tolerability profile than a calcimimetic (as adverse events are common with increasing calcimimetic doses).

Purpose Of Review

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

Recent Findings

We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^113biQ3E]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The clinical manifestations of parathyroid carcinoma are primarily caused by the effects of markedly elevated serum PTH levels and hypercalcemia rather than by the local infiltration or distant metastases.

The typical clinical picture is characterized by signs and symptoms of severe hypercalcemia, with renal involvement (nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, impaired renal function) in up to 80% of patients, and bone involvement (osteitis fibrosa cystica, subperiosteal resorption, "salt and pepper" skull, diffuse osteopenia) in up to 90%. On physical examination, up to 76% of patients with parathyroid carcinoma have a palpable neck mass. Renal colic is a frequent presenting complaint. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, fatigue, depression, nausea, polydipsia and polyuria, bone pain, and fractures. Recurrent severe pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and anemia can also occur. None of these features is pathognomonic of malignancy. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma is made only in retrospect when hypercalcemia recurs because of local spread of tumor or distant metastases. In some patients with parathyroid cancer, a PTH moiety, different from intact PTH(1–84), is produced. The clinical implications of this finding in parathyroid carcinoma await additional studies.

Rarely, parathyroid carcinomas are nonfunctional. They can be misdiagnosed as thyroid or thymic carcinoma because of locally advanced disease (palpable neck mass, dysphagia, hoarseness caused by laryngeal nerve palsy). Immunohistochemistry for PTH, thyroglobulin, thyroid transcription factor 1, and calcitonin may help ascertain the correct diagnosis.

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia can be divided based on severity (serum total Ca levels) to mild (< 3 mmol/L), moderate (3 — 3.5 mmol/L) and severe (> 3.5 mmol/L). It may be caused by increased bone resorption, increased gastrointestinal Ca absorption, or decreased renal Ca excretion. Approximately 90% of reported cases stem from primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. In these instances, there is an increased release of calcium from the bones and intestines, typically accompanied by potential impairment in renal clearance. Generally, the causes of hypercalcemia may be divided into two categories- PTH-mediated and non-PTH-mediated. The various causes of hypercalcemia are depicted in Table 10. The onset of hypercalcemia related symptoms typically occurs when the total serum calcium concentration ranges from 3 to 3.75 mmol/L. At lower levels, individuals may experience neurologic symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and confusion. Higher levels can lead to more severe manifestations, including hallucinations, seizures, disorientation, and hypotonicity. Hypercalcemia also disrupts the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, potentially resulting in diuresis and subsequent dehydration. The cardiovascular symptoms associated with hypercalcemia can be variable. Initially, there may be an increase in myocardial contractility until the calcium levels reach around 3.75 mmol/L. Beyond this threshold, myocardial depression occurs which can lead to decreased automaticity and shortened ventricular systole. Arrhythmias may result from a shortened refractory period. Additionally, hypercalcemia has the potential to exacerbate digitalis toxicity and contribute to hypertension. A significant number of individuals with hypercalcemia experience hypokalemia, and these conditions can collectively cause cardiac arrhythmias. As the serum calcium surpasses 3.25 mmol/L, there is a typical shortening of the QT interval, accompanied by prolonged QRS and PR intervals as well. The progression of these abnormalities may lead to the development of atrioventricular block, which can lead to complete heart block. In severe instances, cardiac arrest can occur when the total serum calcium reaches 3.75 to 5 mmol/L. Additionally, hypercalcemia manifests gastrointestinal symptoms such as pancreatitis, constipation, dysphagia, and peptic ulcers. Renal effects involve a reduced capacity to concentrate urine which can result in diuresis and subsequent loss of crucial ions. The clinical manifestations and interpretation of hypercalcemia levels are summarized in Table 11.

### Analysis of time to diagnosis and outcomes among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^113vgyQn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cohort study suggest that many patients at high risk for PHP may not have a diagnosis and may be untreated despite experiencing associated symptoms and diagnoses. These findings were widespread across the US. Patients with prolonged time from hypercalcemia to diagnosis and diagnosis to treatment reported increased disease sequelae over time. Therefore, system-level interventions aimed at ensuring proper diagnoses and reducing duration of workup and time to treatment are necessary for improved outcomes.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is considered an oncologic emergency associated with significant symptom burden and increased comorbid conditions and mortality. Underlying pathologic processes most often stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Although long-term control of HCM depends on effective management of the underlying cancer, temporizing management strategies for acute and/or symptomatic HCM include hydration and antiresorptive bone-modifying agents. Although most patients respond well to the antiresorptive therapies available, further investigation into other agents for those who are refractory to both bisphosphonates and denosumab is needed.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

Research considerations — evidence gaps for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM): Head to head RCTs of IV BPs vs Dmab are needed to assess clinically important outcomes for this intervention, including clinical improvement. Because of the rarity of this condition, RCTs may require global collaboration. Assessing appropriate glucocorticoid dosing and duration in this population and determining continued glucocorticoid need if antiresorptive therapy is administered are needed. Significant gaps in research exist regarding complementary evidence for the treatment of HCM, including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness of treatment, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

Question

What outcomes are associated with delays in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP)?

Findings

In this large database cohort study of 135 034 patients with hypercalcemia, those who were identified as high-risk and without a diagnosis and whose duration of workup or time from diagnosis to treatment exceeded 1 year experienced increased disease sequelae.

Meaning

These findings suggest that missed diagnoses and prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment of PHP are associated with increased disease burden.

### Pathophysiology of hypercalcemia [^115WNjnZ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Extracellular calcium is normally tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as by calcium ion (Ca ++) itself. Dysregulated PTH production leading to hypercalcemia occurs most commonly in sporadic primary hyperparathryoidism (PHPT) but may also result from select genetic mutations in familial disorders. Parathyroid hormone-related protein shares molecular mechanisms of action with PTH and is the most common cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Other cytokines and mediators may also cause resorptive hypercalcemia once bone metastases have occurred. Less commonly, extrarenal production of calcitriol can occur in malignancies and in infectious and noninfectious inflammatory conditions and can cause hypercalcemia.

### Endocrine society hypercalcemia of malignancy guidelines… [^116YydmG]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In adults with severe HCM, combination therapy with calcitonin and an IV BP or Dmab is suggested. For refractory or recurrent HCM despite treatment with IV BP, Dmab is suggested. For hypercalcemia due to high calcitriol levels with symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia despite glucocorticoid therapy, the addition of IV BP or Dmab is suggested. Patients with parathyroid carcinoma can be treated with calcimimetic and/or antiresorptive therapy depending on the severity and results from initial treatment. Hypercalcemia of malignancy affects 2% to 30% of patients with cancer and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Symptoms range from fatigue, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia with mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia to cognitive. dysfunction, kidney failure, and arrhythmias with rapidly rising calcium levels or severe hypercalcemia. 1 Pathophysiology followed by HCM can include production of parathyroid hormone–related peptides, bone metastases releasing osteoclast activating factors, and excess production of calcitriol. 2 Treatment of HCM begins with intravenous hydration, potent antiresorptive agents, and calcitonin for severe hypercalcemia. Treatment with IV BP and Dmab can lower SCa levels within days and provide durable calcium-lowering effects. Both agents carry the small but significant risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. Treatment with IV BPs is associated with kidney failure, acute phase reactions, and hypocalcemia. While Dmab is safe for those with kidney insufficiency, higher rates of hypocalcemia have been observed.

Additionally, Dmab carries the risk of rebound bone loss and fractures with discontinuation. 3.

### Hypercalcemia in the ED: prevalence, etiology, and outcome [^114kKjXg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purposes

The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence, demographic, and clinical characteristics and etiologies of hypercalcemia in emergency department patients.

Basic Procedures

In this retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, all patients admitted between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, to the emergency department of Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, were screened for the presence of hypercalcemia, defined as a serum calcium exceeding 2.55 mmol/L after correction for serum albumin. Demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were gathered. A detailed medical record review was performed to identify causes of hypercalcemia.

Main Findings

During the study period, 14 984 patients (19% of all admitted patients) received a measurement of serum calcium. Of these, 116 patients (0.7%) presented with hypercalcemia. Median serum calcium was 2.72 mmol/L (first quartile, 2.64; third quartile, 2.88), with 4.3 mmol/L being the maximum serum calcium value observed. Underlying malignancy in 44% of patients and hyperparathyroidism in 20% (12% secondary and 8% primary) were the leading causes of hypercalcemia. Twenty-six percent of patients presented with symptomatic hypercalcemia. Weakness was the most common symptom of hypercalcemia, followed by nausea and disorientation.

Principal Conclusions

Hypercalcemia is a rare but harmful electrolyte disorder in emergency department patients. Unspecific symptoms such as a change in mental state, weakness, or gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt physicians to order serum calcium measurements, at least in patients with known malignancy or renal insufficiency.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterised by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

CKD-MBD recommendation 3.2.1 — In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, it is reasonable to perform a bone biopsy in settings including unexplained fractures, persistent bone pain, unexplained hypercalcemia, unexplained hypophosphatemia, possible aluminum toxicity, and before therapy with bisphosphonates in patients with CKD-MBD (not graded). Because biochemical laboratory and imaging tests do not adequately predict the underlying bone histology and bone biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy, bone biopsy should be considered in patients for whom the cause of clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities is not certain and for whom the effect of treatment on bone needs to be assessed; aluminum bone disease also requires bone biopsy for diagnosis.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition, hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria and anuria as well as somnolence and coma. After a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program has to be followed either to prove or to exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In the first case, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours; during this time, serum calcium should be lowered. Treatment of choice is hemodialysis against a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### Onco-nephrology: the pathophysiology and treatment of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^11436HwS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia complicates the course of 10%-30% of all patients with malignancies and can be a sign of very poor prognosis and advanced malignancy. Prompt recognition of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and institution of therapy can be lifesaving, affording the opportunity to address the underlying etiology. The mechanisms of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia generally fall into three categories: humoral hypercalcemia due to secreted factors (such as parathyroid-related hormone), local osteolysis due to tumor invasion of bone, and absorptive hypercalcemia due to excess vitamin D produced by malignancies. The mainstays of therapy for hypercalcemia are aggressive intravenous volume expansion with saline, bisphosphonate therapy, and perhaps loop diuretics. Adjunctive therapy may include calcitonin and corticosteroids. In refractory cases, gallium nitrate and perhaps denosumab are alternatives. In patients presenting with severe AKI, hemodialysis with a low-calcium bath can be effective. In most cases, therapy normalizes calcium levels and allows for palliation or curative therapy of the malignancy.

### Calcitriol [^113dNrym]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Excessive dosage of calcitriol induces hypercalcemia and in some instances hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium should be determined twice weekly. In dialysis patients, a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase levels usually antedates the appearance of hypercalcemia and may be an indication of impending hypercalcemia. An abrupt increase in calcium intake as a result of changes in diet (e.g., increased consumption of dairy products) or uncontrolled intake of calcium preparations may trigger hypercalcemia.

Should hypercalcemia develop, treatment with calcitriol should be stopped immediately. During periods of hypercalcemia, serum calcium and phosphate levels must be determined daily. When normal levels have been attained, treatment with calcitriol can be continued, at a daily dose 0.25 mcg lower than that previously used. An estimate of daily dietary calcium intake should be made and the intake adjusted when indicated. Calcitriol should be given cautiously to patients on digitalis, because hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

Immobilized patients, e.g., those who have undergone surgery, are particularly exposed to the risk of hypercalcemia.

In patients with normal renal function, chronic hypercalcemia may be associated with an increase in serum creatinine. While this is usually reversible, it is important in such patients to pay careful attention to those factors which may lead to hypercalcemia. Calcitriol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of the serum calcium. An estimate of daily dietary calcium intake should be made and the intake adjusted when indicated.

Patients with normal renal function taking calcitriol should avoid dehydration. Adequate fluid intake should be maintained.

Information for Patients

The patient and his or her caregivers should be informed about compliance with dosage instructions, adherence to instructions about diet and calcium supplementation, and avoidance of the use of unapproved nonprescription drugs. Patients and their caregivers should also be carefully informed about the symptoms of hypercalcemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The effectiveness of calcitriol therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guideline on the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults [^1159uBnq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To support development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 8 clinical questions prioritized by a guideline panel from the Endocrine Society. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

We reviewed 1949 citations, from which we included 21 studies. The risk of bias for most of the included studies was moderate. A higher proportion of patients who received bisphosphonate achieved resolution of hypercalcemia when compared to placebo. The incidence rate of adverse events was significantly higher in the bisphosphonate group. Comparing denosumab to bisphosphonate, there was no significant difference in the rate of patients who achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Two-thirds of patients with refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy who received denosumab following bisphosphonate therapy achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Addition of calcitonin to bisphosphonate therapy did not affect the resolution of hypercalcemia, time to normocalcemia, or hypocalcemia. Only indirect evidence was available to address questions on the management of hypercalcemia in tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy following the use of bisphosphonates, and the use of calcimimetics in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma. The certainty of the evidence to address all 8 clinical questions was low to very low.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of treatments of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Additional information about patients' values and preferences, and other important decisional and contextual factors is needed to facilitate the development of clinical recommendations.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Delirium with severe symptom expression related to hypercalcemia in a patient with advanced cancer: an interdisciplinary approach to treatment [^1142VF6w]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

Delirium is considered to be multifactorial, especially in elderly patients and those with advanced cancer, and can cause significant distress. High baseline vulnerability at the end of life, combined with cachexia, hepatic impairment, general comorbidities, and impaired functional status, can make delirium difficult to correct. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of delirium episodes are potentially reversible and reversible causes should be investigated. Hypercalcemia is one of the reversible metabolic causes of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. Here, we present the case of a patient with metastatic small cell prostate carcinoma who presented to our palliative care clinic with uncontrolled symptoms. A thorough evaluation using appropriate assessment tools revealed that he had delirium, and hypercalcemia was found to be the major etiologic factor. An interdisciplinary team approach (including a nutritionist, pharmacist, counselor, social worker, chaplain, and case manager) was provided. With aggressive symptom management and correction of hypercalcemia and other reversible causes of delirium, the delirium was resolved and the symptoms were controlled. This case illustrates the importance of screening for delirium in patients with severe symptom distress and how the interdisciplinary management of reversible causes of delirium, including hypercalcemia, can improve patients' symptoms and quality of life.

Discussion

The reported range of patients with hypercalcemia whose PTH levels are obtained is 23.4% to 33.0%. Approximately 43% of those with hypercalcemia have PHP. However, the condition is diagnosed in just 1.3% to 8.0% of patients. The findings of this cohort study are consistent with historical data, noting a workup including PTH for approximately 2 of 5 patients. We found that 33.3% of patients with hypercalcemia were at high risk for PHP but did not receive a diagnosis. When added to the 9.7% with a diagnosis, the actual prevalence of PHP in patients with hypercalcemia could be over 43%. Patients in the South had the greatest likelihood of being high-risk and not receiving a diagnosis. More than one-quarter may have not received a diagnosis even in the Midwest, which had the lowest rate of undetected PHP. This is indicative of a problem affecting patients throughout the US.

Prior studies, have reported the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of PHP. Because the disease is often asymptomatic, whether it had a clinically meaningful impact on patients was unknown. Our study shows that patients at high risk who did not have a diagnosis experienced significantly increased disease sequelae vs matched controls. Compared with patients with a diagnosis, the high-risk group whose PTH levels were obtained had decreased rates of some, no difference in others, and increased rates of other associated symptoms and diagnoses. Differentiating these groups were patients with a diagnosis who were more likely to have classic PHP manifestations, such as osteoporosis and urolithiasis. Symptoms and diagnoses in patients whose PHP went undiagnosed likely contributed to decreased quality of life and increased use of medical services and associated costs. This is especially noteworthy, considering that parathyroidectomy is a cost-effective cure associated with substantial improvement in symptoms.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^112eMqsT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have evolved since their original description. What was once a debilitating disease has now become one with few symptoms on initial presentation. Complications from these disorders have decreased significantly because of earlier detection. Improved management of patients with chronic renal disease has also limited complications among those with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Appropriate management is essential even in the early phase of the disorder to minimize the morbidities that may result if left untreated.

### Hypercalcemia: a review… [^113sascd]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL or ionized calcium of 5. 6 to
8. 0 mg/dL, is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement.

In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption. Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Pamidronate disodium [^113yhvuY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

Consideration should be given to the severity of as well as the symptoms of hypercalcemia. Vigorous saline hydration alone may be sufficient for treating mild, asymptomatic hypercalcemia.

Overhydration should be avoided in patients who have potential for cardiac failure. In hypercalcemia associated with hematologic malignancies, the use of glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful.

Moderate Hypercalcemia

The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in moderate hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* of approximately 12 to 13.5 mg/dL) is 60 to 90 mg given as a SINGLE DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e., > 2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

Severe Hypercalcemia

The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* > 13.5 mg/dL) is 90 mg given as a SINGLE DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Longer infusions (i.e., > 2 hours) may reduce the risk for renal toxicity, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^113ziSUT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Imaging features of hypercalcemia: a primer for emergency radiologists [^112iS33U]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a marker for a wide variety of underlying etiologies, and its presentation in the emergency setting may be asymptomatic, incidental, or a primary complaint with associated symptoms and physical exam findings. While the workup is initially driven through serum laboratory testing, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and post-treatment follow up. This review covers multiple common and uncommon etiologies of hypercalcemia, details their underlying mechanisms, and identifies the most important associated imaging findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these etiologies and imaging findings, particularly in the emergency setting since hypercalcemia may represent the only significant laboratory abnormality associated with the presenting condition. Furthermore, the radiologist's interpretation of a study may be directly influenced by knowing about a patient's hypercalcemia.

### Hypercalcemic disorders in children [^113MgFui]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is defined as a serum calcium concentration that is greater than two standard deviations above the normal mean, which in children may vary with age and sex, reflecting changes in the normal physiology at each developmental stage. Hypercalcemic disorders in children may present with hypotonia, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, lethargy, polyuria, dehydration, failure to thrive, and seizures. In severe cases renal failure, pancreatitis and reduced consciousness may also occur and older children and adolescents may present with psychiatric symptoms. The causes of hypercalcemia in children can be classified as parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent or PTH-independent, and may be congenital or acquired. PTH-independent hypercalcemia, ie, hypercalcemia associated with a suppressed PTH, is commoner in children than PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. Acquired causes of PTH-independent hypercalcemia in children include hypervitaminosis; granulomatous disorders, and endocrinopathies. Congenital syndromes associated with PTH-independent hypercalcemia include idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), William's syndrome, and inborn errors of metabolism. PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is usually caused by parathyroid tumors, which may give rise to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which usually arises in association with chronic renal failure and in the treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets. Acquired causes of PTH-dependent hypercalcemia in neonates include maternal hypocalcemia and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. PHPT usually occurs as an isolated nonsyndromic and nonhereditary endocrinopathy, but may also occur as a hereditary hypercalcemic disorder such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, and familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism, and less commonly, as part of inherited complex syndromic disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). Advances in identifying the genetic causes have resulted in increased understanding of the underlying biological pathways and improvements in diagnosis. The management of symptomatic hypercalcemia includes interventions such as fluids, antiresorptive medications, and parathyroid surgery.

### Prognosis and phenotypes of advanced head and neck carcinoma associated with hypercalcemia [^111diyfJ]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypercalcemia is the most common life‐threatening metabolic disorder observed in cancer patients, affecting approximately 10%–20% of individuals with advanced‐stage malignancies. While the incidence of hypercalcemia is relatively low at early stages of cancer (1%–5%), it increases significantly in patients with advanced disease, reaching rates of up to 30%–50%. Hypercalcemia in cancer patients mainly results from increased bone resorption, where calcium release from the bone exceeds the kidneys' excretory capacity. Four mechanisms are responsible: Local osteolysis, humoral hypercalcemia driven by parathyroid hormone‐related protein (PTH‐rP), hypercalcemia mediated by 1.25‐dihydroxyvitamin D, and ectopic hyperparathyroidism, though the latter two are rare. Local osteolysis occurs when malignant cells disrupt calcium regulation through osteoclastic bone resorption, further promoted by tumor cells interacting with bone cells and cytokine secretion. PTH‐rP secretion by tumors mimics parathyroid hormone action, increasing bone resorption and calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. It presents a wide range of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia. However, more severe manifestations can occur, such as progressive mental impairment, renal failure, and, in extreme cases, coma or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest. The management of hypercalcemia typically involves aggressive rehydration and the administration of bone resorption inhibitors, primarily bisphosphonates.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer globally and ranks as the seventh leading cause of cancer‐related mortality. Hypercalcemia is a well‐recognized complication in HNSCC, with reported incidences ranging from 3% to 50%. Hypercalcemia in patients with HNSCC is often associated with poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2–6 months following diagnosis. Despite its frequency, the characteristics and clinical outcomes of hypercalcemic patients with HNSCC remain poorly described, and there is a need to investigate strategies to improve both life expectancy and management of hypercalcemia‐related complications in this patient population.

This study aims to evaluate the prognostic impact of hypercalcemia at diagnosis in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Additionally, we seek to explore the clinical characteristics, underlying etiologies, and treatment approaches associated with this condition.

CKD stage 5D — pharmacologic management of increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is guided as follows: In patients with CKD stage 5D and increased or increasing PTH levels, we suggest that calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics, or a combination of calcimimetics and calcitriol or vitamin D analogues be used to decrease PTH levels (2B). It is reasonable that the initial drug selection for the treatment of increased PTH level be based on serum calcium and phosphorus levels and other aspects of CKD-MBD (not graded), and it is reasonable that calcium- or non–calcium-based phosphate binder dosage be adjusted so that treatments to control PTH levels do not compromise phosphorus and calcium levels (not graded). We recommend that in patients with hypercalcemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (1B), and we suggest that in patients with hyperphosphatemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (2D). We suggest that in patients with hypocalcemia, calcimimetics be reduced or stopped depending on severity, concomitant medications, and clinical signs and symptoms (2D), and we suggest that if iPTH levels decrease to less than 2 times the upper reference limit for the assay, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, and/or calcimimetics be reduced or stopped (2C). There are no data supporting the clinical superiority of any vitamin D analogues available in the United States compared with calcitriol or placebo.

Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline — treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) in adults provides a strong recommendation and several conditional recommendations for antiresorptive therapy and adjuncts. The panel recommends (strong recommendation) in adults with HCM treatment with denosumab (Dmab) or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP). The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) (1) in adults with HCM, the use of Dmab rather than an IV BP; (2) in adults with severe HCM, a combination of calcitonin and an IV BP or Dmab therapy as initial treatment; and (3) in adults with refractory/recurrent HCM despite treatment with BP, the use of Dmab. The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) the addition of an IV BP or Dmab in adult patients with hypercalcemia due to tumors associated with high calcitriol levels who are already receiving glucocorticoid therapy but continue to have severe or symptomatic HCM, and the panel suggests (conditional recommendation) in adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, treatment with either a calcimimetic or an antiresorptive (IV BP or Dmab). Treatment of the primary malignancy is instrumental for controlling hypercalcemia and preventing its recurrence, and the development process identified and prioritized 8 clinical questions related to adult HCM management.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.
