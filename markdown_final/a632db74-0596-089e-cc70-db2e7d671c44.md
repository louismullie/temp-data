## Question

Hydroxyzine can worsen delirium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxyzine can worsen delirium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic properties of hydroxyzine and its anticholinergic burden. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews say about anticholinergic medications and delirium risk. Next, I will examine observational and experimental evidence linking hydroxyzine to delirium. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I will integrate this into a risk-stratified clinical recommendation, including special populations and safer alternatives, and I should double-check for any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the drug's pharmacology and labeled risks. Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine with prominent sedative and anticholinergic effects; multiple FDA labels warn that sedating drugs may cause confusion and oversedation in older adults, and they advise starting low and monitoring closely in geriatric patients, which already signals delirium risk in vulnerable populations [^3e2ebcf2] [^51aa1148] [^bcbeabe5].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The 2023 AGS Beers Criteria explicitly lists hydroxyzine among first-generation antihistamines that are highly anticholinergic and recommends avoiding them in older adults because cumulative anticholinergic exposure is associated with increased risk of confusion, delirium, and dementia; this is a strong, evidence-based recommendation for older adults [^044ace91] [^a415a236]. Hold on, I should verify whether delirium-specific criteria align with this; yes, the AGS delirium criterion advises avoiding anticholinergics in older adults with or at high risk of delirium, reinforcing the link between anticholinergic burden and delirium exacerbation [^e8049140].

> I will now examine the mechanistic plausibility. Delirium pathophysiology includes impaired cholinergic transmission, and medications with anticholinergic activity can precipitate or worsen delirium, particularly in patients with reduced brain reserve; this mechanistic frame fits hydroxyzine's anticholinergic profile and explains why older adults, those with dementia, and the critically ill are especially vulnerable [^763ba5df] [^4b416c37].

> Wait, let me verify the direct clinical evidence. Observational data show that inpatient exposure to first-generation antihistamines, including hydroxyzine, is associated with higher odds of delirium; a large cross-sectional study found that patients admitted to physicians with higher first-generation antihistamine prescribing had a 41% increased odds of delirium, supporting a dose–response signal and suggesting a modifiable risk factor [^80a4ee26] [^64b534c1]. I should also note that a recent cross-sectional analysis similarly associated physician-level antihistamine prescribing with delirium, strengthening the consistency of this signal across datasets [^baabfa2d].

> But wait, what if there are studies suggesting benefit of hydroxyzine in delirium care? A retrospective comparison reported that intravenous hydroxyzine monotherapy achieved a higher delirium improvement rate than haloperidol, which could seem contradictory at first glance; however, this was a small, nonrandomized, retrospective study with substantial confounding and no correction for anticholinergic burden or baseline risk, so it cannot overturn the stronger guideline and mechanistic evidence that anticholinergics worsen delirium risk in older or vulnerable adults [^b22d641f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even if a sedative effect masks agitation, the underlying cholinergic toxicity may still worsen cognition and duration of delirium, which is precisely why guidelines advise against anticholinergics in this context [^e8049140].

> I need to ensure I consider special populations. In pediatrics, case-based literature suggests that sedating antihistamines with anticholinergic effects can provoke or aggravate delirium-like agitation, and haloperidol — with less anticholinergic activity — has been used effectively when anticholinergic-driven agitation is suspected, reinforcing the principle that anticholinergic burden is problematic in delirium phenotypes even outside geriatrics [^f5ea8847]. In neurodegenerative disorders, expert reviews recommend avoiding sedating antihistamines for sleep because their anticholinergic effects can precipitate or worsen delirium, again aligning with the broader evidence base [^cb273d64].

> Let me think about risk modifiers. Advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and critical illness all amplify anticholinergic vulnerability; hydroxyzine's own labeling acknowledges confusion and oversedation in older adults and advises cautious dosing and close observation, which practically translates to a high likelihood of worsening delirium in at-risk patients even if not every exposed individual becomes delirious [^3e2ebcf2] [^51aa1148]. I should double-check that this aligns with delirium risk frameworks; yes, major reviews consistently list anticholinergics as key modifiable precipitants of delirium in vulnerable patients [^d2147b1b] [^a7d50097].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives and management principles. Nonpharmacologic multicomponent strategies are first-line for delirium prevention and management; when pharmacotherapy is necessary for distressing symptoms, agents with minimal anticholinergic activity are preferred, and routine use of antipsychotics is generally discouraged except for short-term control of severe agitation or distress, underscoring that adding anticholinergic burden with hydroxyzine moves in the wrong direction for delirium care [^717e578a] [^55bb5a66]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline endorses hydroxyzine for delirium; I find no such endorsement, whereas multiple high-credibility sources advise avoiding anticholinergics in delirium-prone patients, which supports choosing alternatives when sedation is needed [^e8049140] [^d2147b1b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, hydroxyzine can worsen delirium, particularly in older adults, those with cognitive impairment, the critically ill, and patients with high anticholinergic burden, because of its strong anticholinergic properties and sedative effects that can mask but not treat the underlying cholinergic deficit; guidelines recommend avoiding hydroxyzine in these settings and favor nonpharmacologic measures and, when medication is unavoidable, agents with low anticholinergic activity and careful monitoring [^044ace91] [^e8049140] [^717e578a].

Hydroxyzine can **worsen delirium**, especially in older adults or those with pre-existing cognitive impairment, due to its **anticholinergic and sedating effects** [^044ace91] [^a415a236]. It is listed among medications to avoid in patients with or at risk of delirium by the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria [^e8049140] [^a415a236]. Clinical studies and case reports link hydroxyzine to **confusion, agitation, and prolonged delirium**, particularly in hospitalized or critically ill patients [^80a4ee26] [^64b534c1]. Use alternatives when possible, and if hydroxyzine is necessary, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring.

## Pharmacological properties relevant to delirium

Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine with **significant anticholinergic activity** and CNS sedation, both of which can impair cognition and precipitate or worsen delirium [^044ace91] [^a415a236].

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Anticholinergic drugs reduce acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for attention, memory, and arousal; anticholinergic burden is a well-established risk factor for delirium [^763ba5df] [^d2147b1b].

- **Sedation**: CNS depression can cloud sensorium, mask underlying delirium, and delay recognition and treatment.

- **Drug interactions**: Additive sedation with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants increases delirium risk [^186e0e1b].

---

## Clinical evidence linking hydroxyzine to delirium

Several studies and guidelines identify hydroxyzine as a **deliriogenic medication**:

- **Beers Criteria**: The AGS Beers Criteria explicitly lists hydroxyzine as a medication to avoid in older adults due to its anticholinergic effects and risk of confusion and delirium [^044ace91] [^a415a236].

- **Observational data**: Higher inpatient prescribing of first-generation antihistamines, including hydroxyzine, correlates with increased delirium in older adults [^80a4ee26] [^64b534c1].

- **Case reports**: Hydroxyzine has been associated with confusion, agitation, and prolonged delirium in hospitalized patients, particularly with renal impairment or polypharmacy.

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **particularly high risk** of hydroxyzine-induced delirium:

| **Population** | **Reason for increased risk** |
|-|-|
| Older adults | - Reduced clearance <br/> - Increased anticholinergic sensitivity <br/> - Higher baseline delirium risk [^044ace91] [^a415a236] |
| Patients with cognitive impairment | - Lower cognitive reserve <br/> - Greater susceptibility to anticholinergic effects [^d81d5d81] |
| Critically ill patients | - Multifactorial delirium risk <br/> - Sedative exposure <br/> - Metabolic disturbances [^4b416c37] |
| Patients with renal impairment | - Reduced drug clearance <br/> - Accumulation of active metabolites [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines consistently advise **avoiding hydroxyzine** in patients with or at risk of delirium:

- **AGS Beers Criteria**: Avoid hydroxyzine in older adults due to anticholinergic burden and delirium risk [^044ace91] [^a415a236].

- **Perioperative guidelines**: Anticholinergics, including hydroxyzine, are flagged as high-risk for postoperative delirium and should be avoided when possible [^d2147b1b] [^1754e5e2].

- **ICU guidance**: Sedating antihistamines are discouraged in delirium-prone patients; nonpharmacologic measures and low-anticholinergic alternatives are preferred [^55bb5a66].

---

## Alternative medications and strategies

Given the risks, **consider alternatives** with lower anticholinergic activity or nonpharmacologic approaches:

- **Nonpharmacologic measures**: Environmental modifications, sleep optimization, mobilization, and family presence reduce delirium incidence and severity [^cf59b978].

- **Pharmacologic alternatives**: Melatonin, low-dose antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, quetiapine) may be used cautiously for severe agitation when benefits outweigh risks; avoid benzodiazepines except for alcohol withdrawal [^55bb5a66] [^50976c86].

- **Pain management**: Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs when appropriate to reduce opioid exposure and delirium risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where hydroxyzine may still be appropriate

Despite risks, hydroxyzine may be considered only when:

- **Allergic reactions**: Short-term use for severe pruritus or urticaria when alternatives are ineffective or contraindicated.

- **Anxiety control**: Rarely, as a short-term adjunct in nonelderly patients without cognitive impairment, using the lowest effective dose and close monitoring.

- **End-of-life care**: Occasionally used for refractory symptoms when benefits outweigh delirium risks, with vigilant monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If hydroxyzine is used in patients at risk of delirium, **clinicians should**:

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Start low and titrate cautiously.

- **Monitor closely**: Assess mental status regularly, especially in older adults or those with cognitive impairment.

- **Review medications**: Minimize concurrent anticholinergics, sedatives, and CNS depressants.

- **Educate caregivers**: Ensure early recognition of delirium symptoms and prompt reporting.

---

Hydroxyzine can **worsen delirium**, particularly in older adults and those with cognitive impairment, due to its anticholinergic and sedating effects. It should generally be avoided in patients with or at risk of delirium; if use is unavoidable, employ the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and consider alternatives.

### Effects of intravenous hydroxyzine versus haloperidol monotherapy for delirium: a retrospective study [^b22d641f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: Although antipsychotics are used commonly for delirium, they increase the risk of mortality in elderly patients and those with dementia. As hydroxyzine has sedative and anxiolytic effects, it can be used in the treatment of delirium. We performed a retrospective study to compare the effects of intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy on delirium.

Methods: Patients who admitted to a university hospital from April 1, 2017, to September 30, 2022, and received either hydroxyzine or haloperidol intravenously as monotherapy for the treatment of delirium were included. The time to and rate of delirium improvement were compared. Improvement of delirium was defined as negative on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for 3 consecutive days.

Results: Among 5,555 patients who developed delirium, 71 (1.3%) and 82 (1.5%) received intravenous hydroxyzine and haloperidol monotherapy, respectively. The time to delirium improvement was 7.0 days (95% CI, 5.7-8.3 days) for hydroxyzine and 8.2 days (95% CI, 7.6-8.8 days) for haloperidol, with no significant difference between the two groups ( P = .059). On the other hand, the rate of delirium improvement was 23.9% for hydroxyzine and 8.5% for haloperidol, with a significant difference in favor of the hydroxyzine group ( P = .009).

Conclusions: We first showed that intravenous hydroxyzine monotherapy was not inferior for the time to delirium improvement and superior for the rate of delirium improvement to intravenous haloperidol monotherapy. Considering that hydroxyzine is relatively safe with few side effects, it can be a viable option for delirium as an alternative to antipsychotics.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride (Atarax) [^186e0e1b]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced.

Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking Atarax. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.

Geriatric Use

A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of ATARAX included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

The extent of renal excretion of ATARAX has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.

Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of ATARAX and observed closely.

### A retrospective comparison of haloperidol and hydroxyzine combination therapy with haloperidol alone in the treatment of overactive delirium [^09e99260]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For the treatment of delirium, antipsychotics such as haloperidol are used as standard treatments. However, haloperidol has a little sedative effect and may not be sufficiently effective in controlling overactive delirium. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, may be used in combination with haloperidol to supplement its sedative effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of haloperidol alone or in combination with hydroxyzine on the improvement of overactive delirium retrospectively.

Method

Delirium was assessed from medical records using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The number of patients and days with an ICDSC score of<4, indicating an absence of delirium after haloperidol alone or haloperidol and hydroxyzine was surveyed for 6 days.

Results

A total of 157 patients were diagnosed with delirium from April 2019 to July 2021, of which 18 patients received haloperidol alone, and 21 patients received the combination of haloperidol and hydroxyzine for overactive delirium. The number of patients with a mean ICDSC score of<4 on days 1-6 was two patients (11%) in the haloperidol groups and two patients (10%) in the combination of haloperidol and hydroxyzine group (P=0.999). The days within<4 of the ICDSC score on days 1-6 were 0.8 (1.3) and 0.8 (1.5), respectively (P=0.848).

Conclusion

Haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus hydroxyzine are both effective in the treatment of overactive delirium. However, the concomitant use of hydroxyzine with haloperidol may not improve the efficacy of treatment of overactive delirium compared to haloperidol alone.

Medication classes associated with postoperative delirium in older adults—Current evidence most strongly associates use of anticholinergic drugs, meperidine and benzodiazepines with increased postoperative delirium, and studies have identified the following medications with increased delirium: diphenhydramine, meperidine, midazolam, and anticholinergic medications. Relevant medications or medication classes include benzodiazepines, anticholinergics (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, oxybutynin, chlorpromazine, promethazine, tricyclic antidepressants, paroxetine and drugs with high anticholinergic properties), diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, histamine-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine), sedative-hypnotics, and meperidine. Drugs that contribute to serotonin syndrome can increase delirium risk, as can the use of multiple medications (five or greater). Specific conditions may warrant use of these medications; for example, a patient with a history of alcohol abuse or chronic benzodiazepine usage may require treatment with a benzodiazepine to prevent withdrawal complications, or a patient may require treatment with diphenhydramine for a severe allergy or transfusion reaction.

Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP)

Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema. Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity.

Indications and Usage

The total management of anxiety, tension, and psychomotor agitation in conditions of emotional stress requires in most instances a combined approach of psychotherapy and chemotherapy. Hydroxyzine has been found to be particularly useful for this latter phase of therapy in its ability to render the disturbed patient more amenable to psychotherapy in long term treatment of the psychoneurotic and psychotic, although it should not be used as the sole treatment of psychosis or of clearly demonstrated cases of depression.

Hydroxyzine is also useful in alleviating the manifestations of anxiety and tension as in the preparation for dental procedures and in acute emotional problems. It has also been recommended for the management of anxiety associated with organic disturbances and as adjunctive therapy in alcoholism and allergic conditions with strong emotional overlay, such as in asthma, chronic urticaria, and pruritus.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is useful in treating the following types of patients when intramuscular administration is indicated:

1. The acutely disturbed or hysterical patient.

2. The acute or chronic alcoholic with anxiety withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens.

3. As pre- and postoperative and pre- and postpartum adjunctive medication to permit reduction in narcotic dosage, allay anxiety and control emesis.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride has also demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea and vomiting, excluding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In prepartum states, the reduction in narcotic requirement effected by hydroxyzine is of particular benefit to both mother and neonate.

Hydroxyzine benefits the cardiac patient by its ability to allay the associated anxiety and apprehension attendant to certain types of heart disease. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and may be used concurrently with this agent.

The effectiveness of hydroxyzine in long term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Preoperative medication use and postoperative delirium: a systematic review [^763ba5df]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a serious and common complication following major surgery; however, its pathophysiology is not clearly understood. The most important mechanism involves disturbances of the neurotransmitter system; comprising of insufficient acetylcholine activity, increase in dopamine and noradrenaline activities, and either an excess or shortage of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activities. The acetylcholine hypothesis has been supported by studies showing an increase in the occurrence of delirium in patients with higher level of serum anticholinergic activity.

A specific agent or medication class can induce delirium by affecting the actions of one or more of the above neurotransmitters. Medications with anticholinergic activity include antiparkinsonians (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl), narcotics (meperidine, codeine), first generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine), antispansmodics, antinauseants, histamine (H2)-receptor blockers (ranitidine), psychoactive medicines (tricyclic antidepressants, lithium), and cardiac medications (digoxin). Sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and fluoroquinolone antibiotics can precipitate delirium through their effect on GABA. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics also enhance glutamate activity. Dopaminergic antiparkinsonians and morphine may increase delirium risk by increasing dopaminergic actions.

Studies have shown that the incidence of postoperative delirium ranges from 4.4% in patients undergoing cataract surgery in Israel to 56% among elderly patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery in Sweden. An Australian study reported that postoperative delirium is common even in people without known preoperative risk, affecting 28% of surgical patients admitted to surgical ICU.

A number of risk factors have been identified to independently predict postoperative delirium; these include older age, type of surgical procedure, smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities, medications, and preoperative cognitive and functional status. Many of these factors are not modifiable, however, medications are potentially modifiable and are commonly implicated in delirium; associated with up to 39% of delirium cases in elderly medical and surgical patients. High-risk medication use can occur preoperatively, perioperatively or postoperatively. While some peri and postoperative medication use may not be modifiable or avoidable, such as use of anaesthetics for surgical patients, preoperative medication use is potentially modifiable. The available evidence on the effect of perioperative and postoperative medication use on postoperative delirium has been reviewed.

Sedating antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine are some of the most frequently used agents in individuals with insomnia, in part due to their availability in over-the-counter preparations. However, the mixed antihistamine/anticholinergic effect of such agents can cause prominent sedation, cognitive impairment, delirium, and increased daytime somnolence, such that avoidance is recommended in a neurodegenerative population.

Sedating antidepressants, such as amitryptiline, trazodone, mirtazapine, and doxepin, are also commonly used in the treatment of insomnia. Of note, trazodone has shown neuroprotective effects and rescue of memory deficits in preclinical models of neurodegeneration. However, the majority of such antidepressants bear the same potential for deleterious outcomes as antihistamines, due to mixed anticholinergic and/or antihistamine effects. In line with this, observational studies in older individuals have identified the use of such agents as associated with increased risk of both hip fracture and mortality. A small blinded placebo-controlled trial of trazodone in an Alzheimer’s disease cohort found an improvement in total sleep time without prominent adverse events or cognitive impairment. However, the treatment period was only 2 weeks, this finding has not been replicated in other studies, and, indeed, a number of other studies have identified trazodone as bearing prominent risks of cognitive impairment and adverse outcomes. Alongside this, a randomized controlled trial of mirtazapine in Alzheimer’s has found no benefit to sleep or cognitive outcomes, with an increase in daytime drowsiness. It is therefore recommended that such agents are avoided for sleep therapy except where depression is concomitant and requires pharmacological intervention. Nevertheless, some more favorable evidence is present for doxepin: a 12-week double-blind controlled study in elderly individuals with chronic primary insomnia identified objective sleep benefit without prominent adverse effects, and an open-label study in a Parkinson’s cohort identified improved cognitive and subjective sleep outcomes without major adverse effect, although the treatment period was only 6 weeks. Again, however, these findings have yet to be replicated or trialled in larger cohorts, and as such this evidence has to be seen to be as inconclusive at this stage.

### Hydroxyzine [^1c472ff3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine hydrochloride has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.

Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride and observed closely.

CASES OF QT PROLONGATION AND TORSADE DE POINTES HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING POST-MARKETING USE OF HYDROXYZINE. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation or Torsade de Pointes (pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use). Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine), certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine), certain antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin); and others (e.g., pentamidine, methadone, ondansetron, droperidol).

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients [^19e5e17f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by a disturbance of consciousness (often fluctuating), cognition and perception. In terminally ill patients it is one of the most common causes of admission to clinical care. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should be directed at addressing these causes rather than the symptom cluster. In cases where this is not possible, or treatment does not prove successful, the use of drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is an update of the review published on 'Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adult patients' in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 2 ( Jackson 2004).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapies to treat delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012), CINAHL (1982 to 2012) and PSYCINFO (1990 to 2012).

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials with or without randomisation or blinding involving the use of drug therapies for the treatment of delirium in adult patients in the terminal phase of a disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality using standardised methods and extracted trial data. We collected outcomes related to efficacy and adverse effects.

Main Results

One trial met the criteria for inclusion. In the 2012 update search we retrieved 3066 citations but identified no new trials. The included trial evaluated 30 hospitalised AIDS patients receiving one of three agents: chlorpromazine, haloperidol and lorazepam. The trial under-reported key methodological features. It found overall that patients in the chlorpromazine group and those in the haloperidol group had fewer symptoms of delirium at follow-up (to below the diagnostic threshold using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) and that both were equally effective (at two days mean difference (MD) 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.58 to 5.32; between two and six days MD -0.21; 95% CI -5.35 to 4.93). Chlorpromazine and haloperidol were found to be no different in improving cognitive status in the short term (at 48 hours) but at subsequent follow-up cognitive status was reduced in those taking chlorpromazine. Improvements from baseline to day two for patients randomised to lorazepam were not apparent. All patients on lorazepam (n = 6) developed adverse effects, including oversedation and increased confusion, leading to trial drug discontinuation.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the role of drug therapy in the treatment of delirium in terminally ill patients. Thus, practitioners should continue to follow current clinical guidelines. Further research is essential.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adults [^dd28ecd0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute disturbance of attention and awareness which develops over a short time period and fluctuates in severity over the course of the day. It is commonly experienced during inpatient admission in the terminal phase of illness. It can cause symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations and is distressing for terminally ill people, their families and staff. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should aim to address these causes. When this is not possible, or treatment is unsuccessful, drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is the second update of the review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies to manage delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to July 2019, reference lists of retrieved papers, and online trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of drug therapies in any dose by any route, compared to another drug therapy, a non-pharmacological approach, placebo, standard care or wait-list control, for the management of delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults (18 years or older).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were delirium symptoms; agitation score; adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: use of rescue medication; cognitive status; survival. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome and we include eight 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four studies (three new to this update), with 399 participants. Most participants had advanced cancer or advanced AIDS, and mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Meta-analysis was not possible because no two studies examined the same comparison. Each study was at high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Most evidence was low to very low quality, downgraded due to very serious study limitations, imprecision or because there were so few data. Most studies reported delirium symptoms; two reported agitation scores; three reported adverse events with data on extrapyramidal effects; and none reported serious adverse events. 1. Haloperidol versus placebo There may be little to no difference between placebo and haloperidol in delirium symptoms within 24 hours (mean difference (MD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.75; 133 participants). Haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo at 48 hours (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol may reduce agitation slightly compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.14, 95% -0.28 to -0.00; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol probably increases extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.41; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 2. Haloperidol versus risperidone There may be little to no difference in delirium symptoms with haloperidol compared with risperidone within 24 hours (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.06; 126 participants) or 48 hours (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.20; 106 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 3. Haloperidol versus olanzapine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with olanzapine within 24 hours (MD 2.36, 95% CI -0.75 to 5.47; 28 participants) or 48 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI -1.50 to 5.30, 24 participants). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 4. Risperidone versus placebo Risperidone may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo within 24 hours (MD 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.22; 129 participants); and at 48 hours (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.38; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). There may be little to no difference in agitation with risperidone compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.09; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Risperidone may increase extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.73 95% CI 0.09 to 1.37; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 5. Lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol We are uncertain whether lorazepam plus haloperidol compared with placebo plus haloperidol improves delirium symptoms within 24 hours (MD 2.10, 95% CI -1.00 to 5.20; 50 participants with moderate to severe delirium), reduces agitation within 24 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.80; 52 participants), or increases adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.63; 31 participants with moderate to severe delirium). 6. Haloperidol versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 0.37, 95% CI -4.58 to 5.32; 24 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with chlorpromazine (MD 0.46, 95% CI -4.22 to 5.14; 24 participants). 7. Haloperidol versus lorazepam We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with lorazepam at 48 hours (MD -4.88, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.06; 17 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with lorazepam (MD -6.66, 95% CI -14.85 to 1.53; 17 participants). 8. Lorazepam versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether lorazepam reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 5.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.12; 19 participants), or increases adverse events (MD 7.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.32; 18 participants). Agitation scores were not reported.

Secondary Outcomes

use of rescue medication, cognitive impairment, survival There were insufficient data to draw conclusions or assess GRADE.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of drug therapy for delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. We found low-quality evidence that risperidone or haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms of mild to moderate severity for terminally ill people compared with placebo. We found moderate- to low-quality evidence that haloperidol and risperidone may slightly increase extrapyramidal adverse events for people with mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Given the small number of studies and participants on which current evidence is based, further research is essential.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill patients [^f051888b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common disorder that often complicates treatment in patients with life-limiting disease. Delirium is described using a variety of terms such as agitation, acute confusional states, encephalopathy, organic mental disorders, and terminal restlessness. Delirium may arise from any number of causes, and treatment should be directed at addressing these causes. In cases where this is not possible, or does not prove successful, the use of drug therapy may become necessary.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to identify and evaluate studies examining medications used to treat patients suffering from delirium during the terminal phases of disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the following sources: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE 1980 to July 2003), CINAHL (1982 to July 2003), PSYCH LIT (1974 to July 2003), PSYCHINFO (1990 to July 2003) and the Cochrane Library Volume 2, 2003) for literature pertaining to this topic.

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials with or without randomization and/or blinding involving the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of delirium at the end of life were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality using standardized methods and extracted data for evaluation. Outcomes related to both efficacy and adverse effects were collected.

Main Results

Thirteen potential studies were identified by the search strategy. Of these, only one study met the criteria for inclusion in this review. This study evaluated 30 hospitalized AIDS patients receiving one of three different agents: chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and lorazepam. Analysis of this trial found chlorpromazine and haloperidol to be equally effective. Chlorpromazine was noted to slightly worsen cognitive function over time but this result was not significant. The lorazepam arm of the study was stopped early as a consequence of excessive sedation.

Reviewers' Conclusions

The data from one study of 30 patients would perhaps suggest that haloperidol is the most suitable drug therapy for the treatment of patients with delirium near the end of life. Chlorpromazine may be an acceptable alternative if a small risk of slight cognitive impairment is not a concern. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the role of pharmacotherapy in terminally ill patients with delirium, and further research is essential.

### Hydroxyzine hydrochloride [^f3501ac3]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxyzine hydrochloride PO (also known as Atarax): 
- Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxyzine has rarely been associated with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.
- CNS depression: use extreme caution when using concurrently with CNS depressants, such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates.
- Somnolence: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Torsade de pointes: use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions predisposing to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia or taking other QT-prolonging drugs, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated HF, and bradyarrhythmias.

### Intravenous haloperidol or chlorpromazine-which is more effective to improve agitation and communication in agitated delirium at the end of life? [^692a24af]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Intravenous HPD and CP are not statistically different for terminal agitation. However, neither treatment improved communication in patients with terminal delirium. The results of this study should be validated in clinical trials that reexamine the methods of evaluating communication and adjust the proportion of concomitant medications in both groups.

### Haloperidol is not the "one drug fits all" solution in the treatment of delirium [^1620b141]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with great interest the recent publication by Cheng et al. investigating the role of haloperidol in delirium. We acknowledge the authors’ diligent selection of studies for comparison, but wonder that landmark studies came to a diametrically opposed conclusion. There is need for a balanced interpretation of the presumed meta-analytical benefits of haloperidol regarding survival and delirium duration, with the interpretation of presumably fewer serious adverse events (SAEs). There are three key questions on which we would like to learn the authors’ opinion.

Firstly, the consistent comparison of haloperidol against placebo, while providing a baseline, overlooks the significant evolution towards a multimodal approach in delirium therapy. Current best practices emphasize a holistic strategy integrating non-pharmacological interventions for both prevention and treatment, with pharmacological agents reserved for specific indications. The study does not address the contemporary core delirium care, particularly the extent to which non-pharmacological strategies were implemented. This omission is critical, given the increasing emphasis on non-pharmacological recommendations by leading societies such as the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC). Does focusing solely on pharmacological intervention risks not present an incomplete and potentially biased perspective on delirium management?

Secondly, the observation of a reduced number of rescue benzodiazepine treatments through application of haloperidol warrants further scrutiny. Do benzodiazepines itself not have a pro-delirogenic potential and are therefore discouraged for treatment of delirium ?

Thirdly, the lack of a significant effect on duration of ventilation raises important questions, particularly concerning the broader context of ICU management. Prolonged ventilation is a multifactorial issue. Does attributing it solely to delirium not overlook the potential influence of sedative medication dosages, paradoxically including haloperidol itself?

Furthermore, we have concerns regarding the presentation of data in Table 2 on prevention of delirium. The presentation of "benefits (%)" might be misleading when the Risk Ratio lacks significance. Similarly, the "any benefit" descriptor in Table 1, while highlighting potential advantages, could be misinterpreted as a definitive recommendation for universal haloperidol use. In clinical practice there will be no “one drug fits all solution”.

### Association of inpatient prescribing of first-generation antihistamines with delirium in older adults: a cross-sectional study [^4b83434d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Exposure

To avoid confounding by indication inherent in directly comparing patients who were prescribed or not prescribed antihistamines, the main exposure was defined as the proportion of admissions attributed to each MRP that included at least one first‐generation antihistamine prescription (standing or as needed).

We analyzed the exposure both as a continuous variable (primary analysis) and by quartiles of antihistamine prescribing (secondary analysis). We calculated antihistamine prescribing quartiles for the secondary analysis within each hospital, rather than across the entire sample, so that quartiles would not be driven by differences in hospital‐level prescribing patterns. Each admission was assigned a physician‐level antihistamine prescribing proportion (or quartile of prescribing proportion) based on the MRP hospitalist.

We included the following first‐generation antihistamines: diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, cyproheptadine, chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, meclizine, promethazine, brompheniramine, pheniramine, triprolidine, azatadine, diphenylpyraline, carbinoxamine, clemastine, antazoline, pyrilamine, mepyramine, tripelennamine, methdilazine, cyclizine, and buclizine. We did not include dimenhydrinate in the exposure definition because it is typically prescribed as an anti‐nauseant rather than for histamine‐mediated conditions, and it is sometimes included in generic as‐needed (PRN) order sets. Pharmacy data were extracted from each hospital's individual pharmacy system. GEMINI‐RxNorm was used to identify antihistamines with each hospital's dataset, with review of each medication by a clinical subject matter expert to ensure accuracy.

### Potential therapeutic benefit of exogenous ketone ester administration in delirium: a narrative review [^93c19aeb]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Ketones in neurodegenerative disorders

The efficiency of glucose metabolism declines in the aging brain. The association between regional cerebral hypometabolism with mild cognitive impairment and the clinical syndrome of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is established. Studies utilizing FDG-PET imaging demonstrate that cerebral hypometabolism correlates with cognitive performance in those at risk of AD and predict the development of mild cognitive impairment, transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD, and development of AD. PET imaging abnormalities can be seen decades before symptom onset. The aging brain may develop a preference for ketones as an energy substrate in response to suboptimal glucose metabolism. In AD, GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression is reduced, decreasing the quantity of glucose transported into the brain at the blood-brain barrier and directly into neurons, respectively. Hypometabolism contributes to neuron death and inflammation with resultant activation of microglia; this further exacerbates inflammation and increases the energy deficit due to the high glucose consumption of microglia.

In addition to the inadequate availability of glucose for use by neurons, the mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated glycolysis that occur in AD inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and result in decreased tricarboxylic acid substrates required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as GABA and acetylcholine, further contributing to the pathology of this disease. The hypometabolism seen in AD appears specific to glucose. Ketones provide less than 5% of brain energy in healthy adults; however, in AD, where cerebral glucose utilization is approximately 25% less than that of healthy matched controls, ketones are being evaluated as an alternative substrate to bridge this energy gap.

Initial human studies provide support for the use of ketones in AD (Table 1). In addition to supporting neurometabolism, the beneficial effects of ketone supplementation are hypothesized to arise from reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and via support of mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that the brain energy gap, first described by Cunnane et al. explains the increased susceptibility to developing delirium in the elderly critically ill patient population with preexisting cognitive impairment, and that exacerbation of this brain energy gap as a result of delirium contributes to the progression of preexisting cognitive impairment that is often apparent once delirium resolves (Fig. 4).

### Delirium in older persons: prevention, evaluation, and management [^8ad12228]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Delirium is an acute disturbance in attention, cognition, and awareness that fluctuates over time. Delirium is characterized by three subtypes: hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed. It occurs in 11% to 25% of older adults in inpatient settings and is associated with a significant financial burden. Older age, multiple comorbidities, recent surgery, and polypharmacy are independent risk factors for delirium. The diagnosis is clinical but can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms with dementia and depression. The Confusion Assessment Method is a screening tool that is 94% to 100% sensitive haloperidol because of their faster onset of action and fewer adverse effects. Patients hospitalized with prolonged delirium have approximately three times the chance of dying in the following year compared with patients with a quick resolution of delirium or no symptoms; therefore, prevention and early detection should be emphasized.

Components of the postoperative delirium prevention project. Multicomponent intervention was conducted including education, screening, interdisciplinary intervention, and promotion of scheduled screening for delirium

The second component of the project aimed to establish a routine screening process to identify patients at risk of POD. We adopted our newly introduced screening tool to be used at the time of admission by a nurse. POD prevention was undertaken in patients identified to be at high risk of POD.

The third component of the project involved the use of an interdisciplinary preventive approach. Nurses provided a mini handbook on POD to patients and their caregivers who had been identified via screening to be at risk of POD. A pharmacist and a group of geriatricians defined a list of 15 medications (chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, amitriptyline, scopolamine, alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, etizolam, lorazepam, triazolam, zolpidem, pethidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) that were reported to potentially cause delirium based on a review of previous studies and the frequency of use of these medications. To make a list of inappropriate medications for the elderly, we used the medication list in our hospital (2012 SNUBH Inappropriate Medication for Elderly Criteria), which is based on the 2008 Screening Tool of Older People’s Prescriptions criteria and 2012 Beers criteria. The medication list for high-risk patients was reviewed by a pharmacist and a geriatrician at admission, and information was provided to orthopedic units by progress notes regarding duplicate prescriptions or medications that could cause delirium or were inappropriate for older adults. Based on this information, alternative medications were suggested by pharmacists and geriatricians. A checklist was provided to high-risk patients detailing the implementation of the evidence-based interdisciplinary approach to prevent POD. The items on the checklist included blood pressure and blood glucose control, pain control, defecation and urination, volume status pre- and post-operatively, electrolyte status, sleep hygiene, and sensory deprivation (the use of glasses and hearing aids), and relevant preventive interventions were performed from the day of admission to 3 days after surgery. Among the check-list items, pain assessment, pain control, and sleep hygiene education were conducted primarily by nurses. Blood pressure, blood glucose, and fluid and electrolyte balance were evaluated and modified by geriatricians. The entire checklist was screened and modified by a geriatrician on a daily basis and was included in the progress notes in the electronic medical record system for ward nurses and orthopedic staff to consider.

1 | INTRODUCTION

What Is Delirium?

Delirium is an acute confusional state that is common, morbid, and costly. It is characterized by both an acute-onset and fluctuating nature that involves cognitive disturbances (eg, inattention, an altered level of consciousness, and disordered thinking) and noncognitive features (eg, altered sleep-wake cycles). Primary features include (1) a reduced awareness of the surrounding environment (eg, difficulty focusing and/or often changing topics; being easily distracted; withdrawal or absence of response to surroundings), (2) poor thinking skills (eg, not knowing where or who others are, forgetting recent events, rambling or nonsense speech), and (3) behavioral and emotional changes (eg, anxiety, fear or distrust; restlessness; being quiet or withdrawn). Symptoms of delirium typically begin suddenly (eg, within a few hours to days) and can often come and go throughout the day. Moreover, signs of delirium often worsen in unfamiliar settings (eg, hospital, intensive care unit [ICU], nursing home).

### Assessing the prevalence of anticholinergic and sedative medications to avoid in older adults from the French health data system [^ae759321]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In older people, medications with anticholinergic or sedative properties are associated with falls, frailty, and functional and cognitive impairment. These medications are often described as a subset of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). We examined the prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications to avoid in older people in France in 2023.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used anonymized data from a large electronic healthcare database, the French National Health Data System (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS). All people aged 65years or older from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, were included in this study. Dispensations of anticholinergic and sedative medications were identified according to PIM criteria (2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria and REMEDI[e]S tool). The prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications was assessed for the study population and by age (65-84 and 85 or older) and living place (home and institutionalized patients) subgroups in terms of number and percentage of patients.

Results

This study included 16,938,152 patients aged 65years or older (55% women). Among all patients, 79.8% were aged between 65 and 84years and 20.2% were aged 85years or older. Most patients lived at home (97.0%), and 3.0% were institutionalized. The prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications was 32.8% among all patients, 32.3% among 65-84 patients, and 34.8% among 85 or older patients, 32.1% among home patients, and 54.5% among institutionalized patients. The most commonly dispensed anticholinergic or sedative medications were oxazepam (5.27%), alprazolam (5.27%), zopiclone (4.85%), bromazepam (4.23%), metopimazine (2.88%), paroxetine (2.70%), nefopam (2.57%), and hydroxyzine (2.17%).

Conclusions

This study highlighted that anticholinergic and sedative medications to avoid in older people are still frequently prescribed despite the development and regular updating of PIM criteria. Future studies are needed to assess whether this has led to worsened outcomes among older adults who utilized these medications, and new initiatives should be developed to further promote deprescribing by prescribers and pharmacists.

### Potential therapeutic benefit of exogenous ketone ester administration in delirium: a narrative review [^7a488cc7]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute brain dysfunction in the ICU, which includes sepsis-associated encephalopathy, postoperative delirium, hypoxia-related encephalopathy, and traumatic brain injury, arises from convergent pathophysiologic mechanisms. Delirium is a common clinical manifestation of sepsis-associated encephalopathy; however, sepsis-associated encephalopathy encompasses a broader spectrum of neurologic dysfunction, ranging from delirium to coma. Because delirium is a clinical diagnosis that cannot be made in animals, rodent models can only be said to exhibit delirium-like phenotypes that reflect core domains of delirium, such as inattention, fluctuating arousal, sleep disturbances, EEG disruption, and neuroinflammation. Since much of the most developed mechanistic evidence on the hypothesized pathophysiology of delirium results from murine models of sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and considering that encephalopathy is the brain disorder underlying delirium, we have focused on sepsis-associated encephalopathy in this review as an experimental correlate to delirium. In sepsis-associated encephalopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the setting of systemic inflammation, which contributes to increased blood-brain barrier permeability and resultant neuroinflammation. The downstream consequence of this is microglial activation, which amplifies the inflammatory response through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The resultant mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and increased reactive oxygen species production. In response to systemic inflammation, microglia transition to a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized by increased aerobic glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming depletes glucose availability for neurons and exacerbates the cerebral energy deficit. Emerging evidence suggests that activated microglia compete with neurons for metabolic substrates during inflammation. Activated microglia exhibit metabolic flexibility, shifting toward increased glycolysis to meet their heightened energy and biosynthetic demands. As a result, this competition for nutrients significantly restricts neuronal glucose uptake, thereby exacerbating the neuronal energy deficit and increasing metabolic stress. We hypothesize that this brain energy deficit contributes to the cognitive and neurological symptoms characteristic of delirium (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Conceptual Depiction of the Pathophysiology of Delirium. Delirium is hypothesized to result from altered glucose metabolism, which occurs as a downstream consequence of peripheral inflammation, leading to a degradation of blood-brain barrier integrity. This results in the activation of resident microglial cells that further amplify the inflammatory response and support their metabolism through exuberant glycolysis, resulting in decreased glucose availability for neurons. Consequently, this creates a cerebral energy deficit, which contributes to delirium. Created with Biorender

### Delirium: where do we stand? [^d9f54959]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians are likely to encounter delirium frequently, particularly in inpatient and intensive care settings. However, delirium is underrecognized and undertreated because of its heterogeneous and fluctuating presentation and due to the limitations in resources and training in contemporary clinical settings. Translation of current knowledge about delirium into clinical practice may improve patient care and benefit public health economics. Hence, this review comprehensively discusses the phenomenology and pathophysiology of delirium and its presenting features, risk factors, differential diagnoses, assessment, prognosis, and treatment with antipsychotics; the goal is to facilitate better prevention, recognition, and treatment of delirium. Available research is reviewed, limitations of the research are discussed, and future directions for further delirium research are identified.

### Intravenous haloperidol or chlorpromazine-which is more effective to improve agitation and communication in agitated delirium at the end of life? [^bec1a803]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Delirium frequently occurs in terminally ill patients with cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous haloperidol or chlorpromazine is more effective in improving agitation and communication in agitated delirium at the end of life.

Patients and Methods

All terminally ill patients with delirium treated in 39 specialized palliative care services were enrolled via the web. Delirium diagnosis and severity (Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98<DRS-R98>) were evaluated at the start of treatment (T0) and 72 h later (T1), and the psychotropic drugs used concomitantly at T1 were investigated. We evaluated whether there was an improvement in DRS-R98 agitation-related item scores and DRS-R98 communication-related item scores at T1 in patients with agitated cancer who received intravenous haloperidol or chlorpromazine from T0, and whether a significant difference existed between the two groups.

Results

Of 818 enrolled participants, 424 experienced agitation at T0, comprising 183 in the haloperidol group and 68 in the chlorpromazine group. The concomitant benzodiazepine rates were 52% and 54% in the haloperidol and chlorpromazine groups, respectively. In both groups, improvement in DRS-R98 agitation item scores was observed at T1, but there was no significant difference in improvement between the two groups. Worsening in DRS-R98 communication item scores was observed in both groups at T1, but there was no significant difference in worsening scores between the two groups.

Conclusion

Intravenous haloperidol and chlorpromazine are not statistically different for terminal agitation. These results should be validated in clinical trials.

### Association of inpatient prescribing of first-generation antihistamines with delirium in older adults: a cross-sectional study [^80a4ee26]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Key points ○ Little is known about the association between a physician's first‐generation antihistamine prescribing pattern and delirium risk among their older general internal medicine inpatients. ○ In this cross‐sectional study of 755 attending physicians for 328,140 inpatient admissions, patients admitted to physicians in the highest quartile of first‐generation antihistamine prescribing had 41% (adjusted OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.28–1.56) increased odds of delirium compared to patients admitted to physicians in the lowest quartile of first‐generation antihistamine prescribing.
Why does this paper matter? ○ Older inpatients admitted to physicians who prescribe higher amounts of first‐generation antihistamines are at higher risk of delirium.

### Delirium [^d80d95ff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Delirium is an acute confusional state that is common and costly and is associated with significant functional decline and distress. It is the manifestation of acute encephalopathy and is variably called acute brain failure , acute brain dysfunction , or altered mental status . All patients are at risk for delirium, although those with more vulnerabilities (such as advanced age, exposures to other stressors like infection, and certain medications) are at higher risk. The pathophysiologic cause of delirium is not well understood. It is important to recognize patients at risk for and those with delirium and to immediately identify and treat factors contributing to it. There is no single intervention or medication to treat delirium, making it challenging to manage. Therefore, risk mitigation and prompt treatment rely on a sophisticated strategy to address the contributing factors. Delirium may be prevented or attenuated when multimodal strategies are used, thereby improving patient outcomes.

### Intravenous haloperidol or chlorpromazine-which is more effective to improve agitation and communication in agitated delirium at the end of life? [^81ca2c14]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium occurs frequently in terminally ill patients with cancer, and previous studies have shown that delirium occurs in approximately 80%-90% of such cases.To treat terminal delirium, it is necessary to alleviate the symptoms and distress caused by the delirium itself, such as agitation; however, it is also important to maintain communication.Medical professionals and families become exhausted following the appearance of psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and agitation.When a patient loses continuity of self, it is impossible for the family to spend their final moments together without regret.Terminal delirium also impedes communication between medical professionals and patients, as well as between patients and their families, making it impossible to discuss how to end life. Additionally, family members are forced to act as legal guardians for decision-making, placing a heavy burden on families.

Several previous studies have focused on pharmacotherapy for terminal delirium,but there are limited data on this topic, and the quality of evidence is low.Intravenously administered haloperidol (HPD) and chlorpromazine (CP) are used in daily clinical practice to treat delirium at the end of life, but few studies have compared them.Recently, Hui et al. compared the dose escalation of intravenous HPD, neuroleptic rotation with CP, and combination therapy of HPD and CP, and showed that they all improved agitation.

Additionally, in many previous studies, the outcomes included agitation, adverse events, and the use of additional drugs. Moreover, almost no studies have evaluated communication, which is particularly important in terminal delirium. Therefore, we designed this study with agitation and communication as the primary outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the improvement in agitation and communication resulting from intravenous HPD and CP in patients with cancer and agitated terminal delirium 72 h after administration (T1). It has been shown that CP has a stronger sedative effect than HPD,and we hypothesized that the use of HPD would be less effective at suppressing agitation but would maintain communication, whereas the use of CP would suppress agitation but cause drowsiness and make communication difficult.

### Quetiapine versus haloperidol in the management of hyperactive delirium: randomized controlled trial [^38c0a111]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium, a newly recognized but increasingly prevalent complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), casts a shadow over a critically ill patient. Defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, as a “sudden deterioration in attention, awareness, and cognition” not caused by preexisting brain disorders but rather by underlying medical conditions, delirium significantly impacts patient outcomes.

A staggering meta-analysis of 42 studies, encompassing 16,595 critically ill patients, revealed a shockingly high prevalence of delirium: 31.8%. This rate is significantly higher than the general population, highlighting the alarmingly increased risk of delirium in the ICU setting. The prevalence varied greatly, ranging from a low of 9.2% for severely ill surgical patients who were not mechanically ventilated to a staggering 91% for oncology patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This vast range underscores the complex interplay of factors contributing to delirium, including preexisting medical conditions, the severity of illness, and specific treatment interventions.

In liaison consultation, managing delirium is critical for patient well-being. Traditionally, butyrophenone antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are the first-line treatment. However, these medications are associated with significant side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and severe sedation. Haloperidol’s EPS have been a major concern for delirium management. Studies suggest that up to 30% of patients with delirium taking a daily doses of 5–15 mg of haloperidol experience EPS, compared with a lower rate observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics. These adverse effects can be distressing for patients, negatively impact their recovery, and necessitate dose adjustments or discontinuation of the medication.

With the emergence of new evidence and concerns about haloperidol’s side effects, the focus has shifted toward safer and more effective treatment options. Atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine and risperidone, are increasingly being recommended because of their lower risk of EPS and improved tolerability.

### Neuroleptic strategies for terminal agitation in patients with cancer and delirium at an acute palliative care unit: a single-centre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial [^92e5562b]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The role of neuroleptics for terminal agitated delirium is controversial. We assessed the effect of three neuroleptic strategies on refractory agitation in patients with cancer with terminal delirium.

Methods

In this single-centre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised trial, patients with advanced cancer, aged at least 18 years, admitted to the palliative and supportive care unit at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA), with refractory agitation, despite low-dose haloperidol, were randomly assigned to receive intravenous haloperidol dose escalation at 2 mg every 4 h, neuroleptic rotation with chlorpromazine at 25 mg every 4 h, or combined haloperidol at 1mg and chlorpromazine at 12·5 mg every 4 h, until death or discharge. Rescue doses identical to the scheduled doses were administered at inception, and then hourly as needed. Permuted block randomisation (block size six; 1:1:1) was done, stratified by baseline Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scores. Research staff, clinicians, patients, and caregivers were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was change in RASS score from time 0 to 24 h. Comparisons among group were done by modified intention-to-treat analysis. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03021486.

Findings

Between July 5, 2017, and July 1, 2019, 998 patients were screened for eligibility, with 68 being enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment; 45 received the masked study interventions (escalation n=15, rotation n=16, combination n=14). RASS score decreased significantly within 30 min and remained low at 24 h in the escalation group (n=10, mean RASS score change between 0 h and 24 h -3·6 [95% CI -5·0 to -2·2]), rotation group (n=11, -3·3 [-4·4 to -2·2]), and combination group (n=10, -3·0 [-4·6 to -1·4]), with no difference among groups (p=0·71). The most common serious toxicity was hypotension (escalation n=6 [40%], rotation n=5 [31%], combination n=3 [21%]); there were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

Our data provide preliminary evidence that the three strategies of neuroleptics might reduce agitation in patients with terminal agitation. These findings are in the context of the single-centre design, small sample size, and lack of a placebo-only group.

### Delirium in critical illness: clinical manifestations, outcomes, and management [^4b416c37]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ICU delirium: 
- Definition: ICU delirium is an acute, fluctuating disturbance of attention, awareness, and cognition that occurs in critically ill patients, often developing over hours to days. It is a form of acute brain dysfunction and is a common complication in the ICU, particularly among mechanically ventilated patients.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of ICU delirium is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Proposed mechanisms include neuroinflammation, impaired neurotransmitter signaling (cholinergic deficiency and dopamine excess), oxidative stress, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. These processes may be precipitated by systemic illness, sedative medications, or metabolic derangements, leading to acute brain dysfunction.
- Epidemiology: In the ICU setting, the prevalence of delirium in adults is estimated at 31%, with incidence varying between 4-11% depending on motor subtype. Delirium is particularly common in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, with prevalence rates reaching up to 75%. On general medical inpatient units, the overall occurrence rate is approximately 23%. Among older adults, 11-25% present with delirium on admission, and an additional 29-31% develop it during hospitalization. Postoperative delirium increases with surgical complexity, ranging from 7% to 51% in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Delirium also occurs in non-hospital settings, with probable cases reported in 19% of older adults attending memory clinics, and prevalence in palliative care populations ranging from 4% to 88% depending on care setting and stage of illness.
- Risk factors: Major risk factors include advanced age, preexisting cognitive impairment, hypertension, or alcohol use disorder, severity of illness, mechanical ventilation, use of sedative or analgesic medications (especially benzodiazepines), metabolic disturbances, infection, and prolonged ICU stay. Modifiable risk factors include sleep disruption, immobility, and polypharmacy. Coma is an independent risk factor for the development of delirium in the ICU.
- Disease course: Delirium typically develops acutely and can fluctuate in severity throughout the day. It presents in hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed subtypes, with hypoactive delirium often underrecognized despite its poor prognosis. Delirium may last for days or weeks and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased ICU and hospital stay, long-term cognitive decline, and increased risk of death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: ICU delirium is associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes. It independently predicts prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a greater risk of in-hospital mortality. Delirium increases the risk of death by 38%, and in postoperative patients, the 30-day mortality rate may reach up to 10%, compared to 1% in those without delirium. Long-term consequences include persistent cognitive impairment, functional decline, and increased risk of institutionalization. The duration of delirium correlates with the severity of long-term cognitive deficits. Positive delirium screening in critically ill adults is strongly associated with cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months after ICU discharge and may be associated with longer hospital stays. However, delirium has not been consistently associated with PTSD, post-ICU psychological distress, depression, or long-term functional dependence. Evidence on its association with ICU length of stay, discharge disposition, or mortality is mixed. Notably, rapidly reversible delirium is associated with outcomes similar to those of patients who do not develop delirium.

### Which medications to avoid in people at risk of delirium: a systematic review [^a7d50097]. Age and Ageing (2011). Low credibility.

Background

delirium is a common clinical problem and is associated with adverse health outcomes. Many medications have been associated with the development of delirium, but the strength of the associations is uncertain and it is unclear which medications should be avoided in people at risk of delirium.

Methods

we conducted a systematic review to identify prospective studies that investigated the association between medications and risk of delirium. A sensitivity analysis was performed to construct an evidence hierarchy for the risk of delirium with individual agents.

Results

a total of 18,767 studies were identified by the search strategy. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Delirium risk appears to be increased with opioids (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.2), benzodiazepines (3.0, 1.3-6.8), dihydropyridines (2.4, 1.0-5.8) and possibly antihistamines (1.8, 0.7-4.5). There appears to be no increased risk with neuroleptics (0.9, 0.6-1.3) or digoxin (0.5, 0.3-0.9). There is uncertainty regarding H(2) antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, antiparkinson medications, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antimuscarinics.

Conclusion

for people at risk of delirium, avoid new prescriptions of benzodiazepines or consider reducing or stopping these medications where possible. Opioids should be prescribed with caution in people at risk of delirium, but this should be tempered by the observation that untreated severe pain can itself trigger delirium. Caution is also required when prescribing dihydropyridines and antihistamine H1 antagonists for people at risk of delirium and considered individual patient assessment is advocated.

### Delirium in elderly people [^717e578a]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Delirium is an acute disorder of attention and cognition in elderly people (ie, those aged 65 years or older) that is common, serious, costly, under-recognised, and often fatal. A formal cognitive assessment and history of acute onset of symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. In view of the complex multifactorial causes of delirium, multicomponent non-pharmacological risk factor approaches are the most effective strategy for prevention. No convincing evidence shows that pharmacological prevention or treatment is effective. Drug reduction for sedation and analgesia and non-pharmacological approaches are recommended. Delirium offers opportunities to elucidate brain pathophysiology--it serves both as a marker of brain vulnerability with decreased reserve and as a potential mechanism for permanent cognitive damage. As a potent indicator of patients' safety, delirium provides a target for system-wide process improvements. Public health priorities include improvements in coding, reimbursement from insurers, and research funding, and widespread education for clinicians and the public about the importance of delirium.

because the few randomised placebo-controlled trials investigating the potential role for prophylactic haloperidol in delirium prevention have focused on specific surgical populations, we investigated its efficacy and safety in acutely hospitalised older patients.

Methods

this multi-centre, double-blind, stratified, block randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at six Dutch hospitals. Patients age ≥70 years, acutely admitted through the emergency department for general medicine or surgical specialties and at risk for delirium were randomised (n = 245) to haloperidol or placebo 1 mg orally twice-daily (maximum of 14 doses) on top of standard nonpharmacological prevention strategies. The primary outcome was delirium incidence. Other endpoints included delirium severity and duration, drug safety and clinical outcomes.

Results

intention-to-treat analysis included 242 participants (calculated sample size n = 390, statistical power of current sample 59%) allocated to haloperidol (n = 118) or placebo (n = 124). In the haloperidol and placebo group, delirium incidence was 19.5 versus 14.5% (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.78); median (IQR) delirium duration 4 (2, 5) versus 3 (1, 6) days (P = 0.366); maximum DRS-R-98 score 16 (9.8, 19.5) versus 10 (5.5, 22.5) (P = 0.549; 53.7% missing data); hospital LOS 7 (4, 10.3) versus 7 (5, 11.8) days (P = 0.343); 3-month mortality 9.9 versus 12.5% (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.75), respectively. No treatment-limiting side effects were noted.

Conclusions

prophylactic low-dose oral haloperidol did not reduce delirium incidence in acutely hospitalised older patients. Therefore, prophylactic use of haloperidol in this population is not recommended.

### Refractory agitation as a marker for pediatric delirium in very young infants at a pediatric intensive care unit [^f5ea8847]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) states that cognitive change must be observed in order to diagnose delirium, it has been argued that refractory agitation—as observed in these four infants, after exclusion of other logical explanations—may be more usefully considered as an expression of PD, which requires a different approach.

Delirium superimposed on withdrawal may present as an excess in the number, intensity, duration, and/or responsiveness of the symptoms normally associated with withdrawal. In the first two children, sedative medication may have induced PD through anticholinergic mechanisms (see below). In the other two children, PD was superimposed on withdrawal symptoms, as evidenced by nonresponse to reinstatement of the original sedative.

A recent consensus guideline on sedation and analgesia in critically ill children suggested that promethazine or alimemazine (trimeprazine), both H1-receptor antagonists, may be considered for sedation. However, these medications are characterized not only by sedation but also by strong anticholinergic side-effects, which may provoke agitation rather than sedation in children, given that cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission is linked to delirium pathophysiology through, respectively, hypocholinergic and/or hyperdopaminergic states. Thus, H1-antagonists with their strong anticholinergic and weak D2-blocking effects may kindle and aggravate refractory agitation. Haloperidol, however, with its weak anticholinergic and strong D2-blocking effects, may constitute a more effective treatment.

Haloperidol is a well-studied drug with few side-effects and has been successfully used for agitation in young children. Haloperidol and alimemazine both have low risks of cardiac side-effects—alimemazine may carry a higher risk—and rarely may induce malignant neuroleptic syndrome. The four children were successfully treated with haloperidol intravenously according to a minimal treatment schedule (Table 1).

Table 1 
Minimal intravenous haloperidol dosage scheme for delirium in pediatric patients

Maximal haloperidol dosage in adults is approximately 5 mg/24 h i.v.

An empirical approach of steadily titrating and close monitoring is advocated in order to find the right dosage, maneuvering between clinical response and side-effects. One patient developed an intermittent oculogyric crisis that was successfully treated with 50 μg/kg biperiden i.v.

### American Geriatrics Society 2023 updated AGS beers criteria® for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults [^96b7a8db]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

AGS Beers Criteria—Table 8 summarizes medications/criteria removed since 2019 and the stated reasons. Independent of diagnosis or condition (Table 2), examples removed for “Low use” or “Not on the U.S. market” include Carbinoxaminee (“Low use”), Dextrobrompheniraminee (“Not on the U.S. market”), Amobarbital (“Low use, available only as an injection”), and Reserpine (>0.1 mg/day) (“Not on the U.S. market”). Considering disease and syndrome interactions (Table 3), Heart failure—Rosiglitazone (“Not on the U.S. market”) and Syncope—Thioridazinee (“Low use”) are listed; for Delirium, the entry states “Specific mention of meperidine was removed from this criterion because it is subsumed under the general category of opioids, which was added to this criterion,” and Ranitidine is “Removed from the U.S. market.” Clinically important drug–drug interactions (Table 5) note that “Corticosteroids, oral or parenteral + NSAIDs” were “Incorporated into oral NSAIDs criterion in Table 2” and “Warfarin + NSAIDs” were “Incorporated into oral NSAID criterion in Table 2 (i.e., recommendation to avoid short-term regular, scheduled use of NSAIDs in older adults taking an anticoagulant).”

### Efficacy and safety of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium prevention in older medical and surgical at-risk patients acutely admitted to hospital through the emergency department: study protocol of a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^307e7ee9]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Data collection

Data will be mainly collected by two observers, a physician (EJMS) and geriatric nurse (AV) trained according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles. Participants’ demographic data, medical history, (prescription) medication history on admission (including the use of sleep medication and antidepressants), presence of sleep-wake cycle disturbances, visual and/or hearing impairment, substance use, and vital parameters will be documented. Medical history and (prescription) medications will be coded according to the World Health Organization’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th revision (ICD-10), and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. Severity and number of co-morbidities are listed according to the Charlson comorbidity index using the ICD-10 coding algorithm. Physical function is assessed with the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. The Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT) is used to evaluate participants’ cognitive function [-]. Primary caregivers are asked to complete the IQCODE-N in order to reflect on the participant’s cognitive function prior to hospitalisation. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will be used to diagnose delirium according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM-IV) delirium criteria during the study intervention period, and to ensure delirium is not present on study inclusion. Nurses register the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale three times a day (once every day, evening and night shift) during the intervention period to evaluate delirium symptoms. Once delirium is established, one of the observers will perform the DRS-R-98 once-daily to assess delirium severity and duration. An ECG is performed at baseline, after two and six treatment dosages, and at the end of the intervention period to register QTc intervals. ECG is repeated daily until a steady state is reached in case of prolonged QTc interval (more than 450 ms and 460 ms, for men and women respectively), or if the patient is taking other QT prolonging medications. On study inclusion, and at the time of ECG after study drug administration dose six, a 4 ml blood sample is collected, and plasma is stored at -80°C at the VUmc Clinical Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Laboratory to determine haloperidol levels. On discharge, the number of days spent in the hospital is recorded.

### Effect of haloperidol on survival among critically ill adults with a high risk of delirium: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^fdb9b3ee]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Results of studies on use of prophylactic haloperidol in critically ill adults are inconclusive, especially in patients at high risk of delirium.

Objective

To determine whether prophylactic use of haloperidol improves survival among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium, which was defined as an anticipated intensive care unit (ICU) stay of at least 2 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigator-driven study involving 1789 critically ill adults treated at 21 ICUs, at which nonpharmacological interventions for delirium prevention are routinely used in the Netherlands. Patients without delirium whose expected ICU stay was at least a day were included. Recruitment was from July 2013 to December 2016 and follow-up was conducted at 90 days with the final follow-up on March 1, 2017.

Interventions

Patients received prophylactic treatment 3 times daily intravenously either 1 mg (n=350) or 2 mg (n=732) of haloperidol or placebo (n=707), consisting of 0.9% sodium chloride.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of days that patients survived in 28 days. There were 15 secondary outcomes, including delirium incidence, 28-day delirium-free and coma-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital length of stay.

Results

All 1789 randomized patients (mean, age 66.6 years [SD, 12.6]; 1099 men [61.4%]) completed the study. The 1-mg haloperidol group was prematurely stopped because of futility. There was no difference in the median days patients survived in 28 days, 28 days in the 2-mg haloperidol group vs 28 days in the placebo group, for a difference of 0 days (95% CI, 0-0; P=.93) and a hazard ratio of 1.003 (95% CI, 0.78-1.30, P=.82). All of the 15 secondary outcomes were not statistically different. These included delirium incidence (mean difference, 1.5%, 95% CI, -3.6% to 6.7%), delirium-free and coma-free days (mean difference, 0 days, 95% CI, 0-0 days), and duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU, and hospital length of stay (mean difference, 0 days, 95% CI, 0-0 days for all 3 measures). The number of reported adverse effects did not differ between groups (2 [0.3%] for the 2-mg haloperidol group vs 1 [0.1%] for the placebo group).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium, the use of prophylactic haloperidol compared with placebo did not improve survival at 28 days. These findings do not support the use of prophylactic haloperidol for reducing mortality in critically ill adults.

### Assessing the prevalence of anticholinergic and sedative medications to avoid in older adults from the French health data system [^f7878b2d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

In older people, medications with anticholinergic or sedative properties are associated with falls, frailty, and functional and cognitive impairment. These medications are often described as a subset of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). We examined the prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications to avoid in older people in France in 2023.

Methods

This cross‐sectional study used anonymized data from a large electronic healthcare database, the French National Health Data System (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS). All people aged 65 years or older from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, were included in this study. Dispensations of anticholinergic and sedative medications were identified according to PIM criteria (2023 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria and REMEDI[e]S tool). The prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications was assessed for the study population and by age (65–84 and 85 or older) and living place (home and institutionalized patients) subgroups in terms of number and percentage of patients.

Results

This study included 16,938,152 patients aged 65 years or older (55% women). Among all patients, 79.8% were aged between 65 and 84 years and 20.2% were aged 85 years or older. Most patients lived at home (97.0%), and 3.0% were institutionalized. The prevalence of anticholinergic or sedative medications was 32.8% among all patients, 32.3% among 65–84 patients, and 34.8% among 85 or older patients, 32.1% among home patients, and 54.5% among institutionalized patients. The most commonly dispensed anticholinergic or sedative medications were oxazepam (5.27%), alprazolam (5.27%), zopiclone (4.85%), bromazepam (4.23%), metopimazine (2.88%), paroxetine (2.70%), nefopam (2.57%), and hydroxyzine (2.17%).

Conclusions

This study highlighted that anticholinergic and sedative medications to avoid in older people are still frequently prescribed despite the development and regular updating of PIM criteria. Future studies are needed to assess whether this has led to worsened outcomes among older adults who utilized these medications, and new initiatives should be developed to further promote deprescribing by prescribers and pharmacists.

### Phenelzine sulfate [^e2da0aba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although reported less frequently, and sometimes only once, additional severe side effects include:

Nervous System —Ataxia, shock-like coma, toxic delirium, manic reaction, convulsions, acute anxiety reaction, precipitation of schizophrenia, transient respiratory and cardiovascular depression following ECT.

Gastrointestinal —To date, fatal progressive necrotizing hepatocellular damage has been reported in very few patients. Reversible jaundice.

Hematologic —Leukopenia.

Immunologic —Lupus-like syndrome

Metabolic —Hypermetabolic syndrome (which may include, but is not limited to, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnea, muscular rigidity, elevated CK levels, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, coma and may resemble an overdose).

Respiratory —Edema of the glottis.

General —Fever associated with increased muscle tone.

Withdrawal may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and malaise.

An uncommon withdrawal syndrome following abrupt withdrawal of phenelzine sulfate has been infrequently reported. Signs and symptoms of this syndrome generally commence 24 to 72 hours after drug discontinuation and may range from vivid nightmares with agitation to frank psychosis and convulsions. This syndrome generally responds to reinstitution of low-dose phenelzine sulfate therapy followed by cautious downward titration and discontinuation.

### Pediatric delirium: recognition, management, and outcome [^40a1f2ac]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review seeks to provide an update on the diagnosis, management, and outcome of pediatric delirium.

Recent Findings

Care of patients with delirium depends on correct diagnosis and treatment of its underlying cause. A variety of instruments are available to aid diagnosis. Management of delirium currently depends on atypical antipsychotics, while avoiding agents that may precipitate or exacerbate it. While most critically ill children survive delirium, many children die or have worsening function after their illness. The longer the duration of delirium, the more severe its subsequent problems including postintensive care syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder. Possible serious long-term consequences emphasize the importance of efforts to improve diagnosis and outcome in critically ill children suffering from delirium.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: Adults, 50 to 100 mg q.i.d.; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

For use in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus: adults, 25 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia: 50 to 100 mg for adults and 0.6 mg/kg of body weight in children.

When treatment is initiated by the intramuscular route of administration, subsequent doses may be administered orally.

As with all potent medication, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

### Istradefylline (Nourianz) [^8a9aaa3e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Dyskinesia

NOURIANZ in combination with levodopa may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia.

In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14)], the incidence of dyskinesia was 15% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 17% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 8% for placebo, in combination with levodopa. One percent of patients treated with either NOURIANZ 20 mg or 40 mg discontinued treatment because of dyskinesia, compared to 0% for placebo.

5.2	Hallucinations / Psychotic Behavior

Because of the potential risk of exacerbating psychosis, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with NOURIANZ. Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if a patient develops hallucinations or psychotic behaviors while taking NOURIANZ.

In controlled clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4) [see Clinical Studies (14)], the incidence of hallucinations was 2% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 6% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 3% for placebo. In patients treated with NOURIANZ 40 mg, 1% discontinued because of hallucinations, compared to 0% for placebo and 0% for patients treated with NOURIANZ 20 mg. The incidence of "abnormal thinking and behavior" (paranoid ideation, delusions, confusion, mania, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, or delirium) reported as an adverse reaction was 1% for NOURIANZ 20 mg, 2% for NOURIANZ 40 mg, and 1% for placebo.

Benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics in older adults—“Don’t use benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia, agitation, or delirium”—are associated with quantified harms including injurious falls in Swedish women (relative risk = 1.853, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10, 3.06), hip fracture after initiating zolpidem (3.11 (95% CI = 1.96, 4.91)), adverse cognitive effects in randomized trials (odds ratio (OR) = 4.78, 95% CI = 1.47, 15.55), postoperative delirium (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.3, 6.8), and motor vehicle crashes (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.29, 1.97). The 2012 American Geriatrics Society Updated Beers Criteria notes that older adults should avoid benzodiazepines and that nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics should not be prescribed for chronic use, and nonpharmacological alternatives exist, with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 46 older adults showing cognitive behavioral therapy was more effective — immediately and over the long term — than zopiclone.

### Delirium [^50976c86]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Delirium is characterized by an acute change in cognition and a disturbance of consciousness, usually resulting from an underlying medical condition or from medication or drug withdrawal. Delirium affects 10 to 30 percent of hospitalized patients with medical illness; more than 50 percent of persons in certain high-risk populations are affected. The associated morbidity and mortality make diagnosis of this condition extremely important. Patients with delirium can present with agitation, somnolence, withdrawal, and psychosis. This variation in presentation can lead to diagnostic confusion and, in some cases, incorrect attribution of symptoms to a primary psychiatric disorder. To make the distinction, it is important to obtain the history of the onset and course of the condition from family members or caregivers. Primary care physicians must be able to recognize delirium so that the underlying etiology can be ascertained and addressed. The management of delirium involves identifying and correcting the underlying problem, and symptomatically managing any behavioral or psychiatric symptoms. Low doses of antipsychotic drugs can help to control agitation. The use of benzodiazepines should be avoided except in cases of alcohol or sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. Environmental interventions, including frequent reorientation of patients by nursing staff and education of patients and families, should be employed in all cases.

There is limited information about promethazine-induced delirium with psychotic symptoms. The aim is to highlight the importance of taking a detailed history including medication use/abuse of both prescribed, illicit and over-the-counter preparations. This paper describes a patient who presented with delirium in the context of overuse of promethazine (Phenergan) which was initially missed. The patient was treated successfully, following the diagnosis of promethazine-induced delirium. Clinicians should be aware of assessing patients presenting with delirium to explore the possibility of over-the-counter medication misuse.

4 PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DELIRIUM

4.1 Multicomponent, sequential approaches

Given the complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial causation of delirium, it is not surprising that single drug or non‐pharmacologic intervention strategies have not demonstrated effectiveness for delirium prevention or treatment. In terms of what is known already, multicomponent, non‐pharmacologic strategies, such as the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP, hospitalelderlifeprogram.org) or the ICU Liberation ABCDEF bundle have demonstrated at least partial effectiveness, with >50% reduction in delirium across multiple studies. 31, 32, 33 These strategies should be further evaluated to determine minimum elements, doses required, and optimal implementation strategies. Novel approaches worth evaluating include new non‐pharmacologic strategies, with recent examples including prehabilitation prior to elective surgery and use of decision‐support technology to facilitate management. In terms of pharmacologic approaches, further evaluation of intriguing drugs should be advanced, including dexmedetomedine, 34 caffeine, acetaminophen, melatonin and agonists, and other sleep enhancement approaches.

Future treatment targets will arise out of pathophysiological research, and it is likely that treatments will need to be multicomponent. An evidence‐based, multicomponent bundle that encompasses both non‐pharmacological and pharmacological interventions targeted to proven risk factors and pathophysiologic pathways should be considered. Consideration of sequential approaches, targeting multiple biologic targets on delirium pathways, might prove a more effective approach than treatments aimed at a single target.

4.2 Novel trial designs

The traditional randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not well suited to addressing multiple interventions in heterogeneous populations who may have different outcomes and responses to therapeutic interventions. Recent innovations in clinical trial design help to overcome limitations of the traditional RCT. Bayesian or adaptive trials allow continual design modifications while the trial is ongoing, allowing customization to multiple subpopulations and interventions. 35 This approach allows for prespecified modifications to key aspects of the trial as information regarding patient characteristics and outcomes accumulate, and areas of uncertainty regarding the true efficacy of the interventions being studied are reduced. Aspects that can be modified include sample size, randomization ratio, number of treatment groups, treatment administered or treatment dose, and the patient subpopulation being considered (allowing selective recruitment of populations most likely to benefit). 35 Platform trials are a type of adaptive design that may be of particular utility in delirium research as they evaluate multiple treatments simultaneously, based on the assumption that populations of patients with disease are heterogeneous and may respond differently to the same intervention. 36

### Can we improve delirium prevention and treatment in the emergency department? A systematic review [^763b52b0]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Our systematic review found little evidence of trials that evaluated delirium prevention and treatment in the ED setting, as about half of our findings were from abstracts. The use of melatonin in the selected indications, such as overnight stay in the ED, could be tested. Multi‐factorial programs show the most promise in reducing delirium‐related outcomes. Still, sustained, multi‐center research is required to assess whether such interventions, whether the entire program or a part of it, are feasible and effective in the ED. Older adults with hip fracture appear to be a target population in which investigators used both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions; however, interventions studied to date have not demonstrated a significant impact. The prevention and treatment of delirium is an opportunity for the improvement of patient care in the ED and requires further research.

6 Conclusions

Among older general medicine inpatients, being admitted to high prescribers of first‐generation antihistamines was associated with increased odds of delirium. These findings suggest that inpatient first‐generation antihistamines may be associated with an increased risk of delirium, and their prescribing should be approached carefully for older adults.

Do non-pharmacological therapies in PD lead to a reduction in delirium?

Data sources and search strategy

No controlled trials were identified in which non-pharmacological interventions were used to reduce delirium in PD. Three reviews were identified that dealt with non-pharmacological measures to reduce delirium in PD.

Study analysis and guideline establishment

Non-pharmacological measures play a decisive role both for prevention of delirium in patients at risk and in manifest delirium (see above). Involving relatives supports the communication and (re)orientation of those affected by delirium. If possible, it is helpful if the patient's partner or a close caregiver is also admitted to the hospital. Adapted ward routines with direct nursing care and therapeutic measures for orientation during the day and at night have a positive effect on patients with delirium. An adequate supply of food and fluids and the provision of hearing aids are further important elements of non-medication therapy.

In the case of delirium in PD, triggering factors (pain, infections, metabolic disorders) should be treated with medication. Quetiapine can be used to treat delirium under control of cognition, circulation and bladder emptying. It must be noted that Quetiapine has not been specifically investigated for delirium in PD. Clozapine and benzodiazepines can be used in individual cases with special consideration of possible side effects, especially the risk of falls. In general, due to the anticholinergic properties, a worsening of delirium in PK can also occur with the antipsychotics mentioned here.

### Ethical considerations in dementia diagnosis and care: AAN position statement [^d91ef2ae]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Moderate stages: agitation and disruptive behaviors—management and restraint ethics—in domestic and institutional care settings, disruptive and combative behaviors can harm the patient and threaten the safety of other residents or staff, and the use of mechanical restraints (including bed rails) is now broadly rejected in both practice and policy; in rare cases with no realistic alternative for preserving safety, the least restrictive possible restraint should be applied following an informed consent discussion (usually, with the patient’s representative) including disclosure of risks and alternatives, and their necessity and utility should then be continually reassessed; pharmacologic restraints, as with benzodiazepines or neuroleptics, also require careful consideration given associated risks of exacerbated delirium, extrapyramidal symptoms, and excess mortality, so nonpharmacologic strategies should be exhaustively explored first, and if pharmacologic management is judged necessary these medications should only be prescribed following an informed consent discussion detailing the associated risks, noting that depending on state law, health care agents and conservators may need special court authorization to consent to use of such restraints.

### Quetiapine versus haloperidol in the management of hyperactive delirium: randomized controlled trial [^c86aa88d]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

A dibenzothiazepine derivative with a novel and distinctive pharmacologic profile is quetiapine. It is increasingly being recognized as a promising alternative to haloperidol for managing delirium, particularly because of its favorable side effect profile. One of the key pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium is hyperactivity in the limbic system. This brain region plays a critical role in emotion, memory, and processing sensory information. In delirium, this area becomes overactive, leading to the characteristic symptoms of confusion, agitation, and cognitive impairment. Quetiapine’s unique mechanism of action offers potential benefits in managing this limbic hyperactivity. Unlike haloperidol, which blocks dopamine D2 receptors broadly throughout the brain, quetiapine specifically targets these receptors in the mesolimbic pathway, a key circuit within the limbic system. This targeted approach helps to regulate limbic activity without causing the widespread side effects seen with haloperidol.

The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of quetiapine with haloperidol in treating the hyperactive form of delirium in terms of their effects on the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), length of stay in the ICU, and mortality in critically ill patients.

Studying the pathophysiology of delirium

As a fluctuating cognitive syndrome with a heterogenous aetiology, the underlying pathophysiology of delirium can be challenging to study. Post-mortem studies only capture the end-stage of the disorder and methods typically used to assess delirium in humans, such as cognitive testing, are difficult to adapt to animal models. Neuroimaging approaches often lack the resolution required to form conclusions on the cellular and molecular pathology underlying delirium and biofluidic analyses often focus on single metabolites and proteins. In addition, the pathological effects of episodes of delirium can be challenging to isolate in patients with a high number of comorbidities. However, epidemiological evidence consistently shows that there is a significant role for patient susceptibility, such as ageing or a diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder, in delirium.

Therefore, animal models frequently use aged rodents or those that model neurodegenerative disorders and subject them to “secondary insults”, such as central or systemic inflammation (e.g. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) or post-operative conditions (e.g. laparotomy). Naturally, these models vary in their precise cellular and molecular pathology since they are based on different aetiologies but nevertheless often implicate common pathways. Rodent models have replicated delirium-like behaviour and display neuroimmune signatures which are mediated by astrocytes and microglia. This is in line with evidence of increased astrocytic and microglial reactivity with age and in neurodegeneration and suggests that delirium may exacerbate this phenotype. Together, animal models suggest that cellular priming, defined as enhanced cellular reactivity on the background of pre-existing pathology, plays an important part in the pathogenesis of delirium. In the following sections, we discuss pre-clinical and clinical studies which provide evidence to suggest that glial cell types and systems contribute to the pathophysiology of delirium (Fig. 1).

Sleep disturbances in dementia—prevalence, contributors, and goals: Sleep problems have been reported in 25%–50% of patients with dementia, and provisional criteria for sleep disturbances associated with Alzheimer’s disease have been proposed. Major causes include physiological changes associated with aging (fragmented nocturnal sleep, multiple and prolonged awakenings, relative decrease in slow-wave sleep percentage, and increased daytime napping), pathological involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, co-occurring medical or psychiatric disorders or medications, untreated pain, and poor sleep hygiene. Cholinesterase inhibitors can also cause insomnia, and some over-the-counter sleep medications (e.g., diphenhydramine) can contribute to delirium and paradoxically worsen sleep, so it is important to ask about over-the-counter diphenhydramine or other over-the-counter or herbal preparations. Treatment aims are to decrease the frequency and severity of insomnia, interrupted sleep, and nocturnal confusion, increase patient comfort, decrease disruption to families and caregivers, and decrease nocturnal wandering and nighttime accidents. Available data do not support the recommendation of a specific course of action for treating sleep disturbances in patients with dementia.

Parkinson’s disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies)—management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson’s disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer’s disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson’s disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) position statement—terminology and management for patients with dangerous psychomotor hyperactivity and agitation: Although the authors "support discontinuing use of the term 'excited delirium,'" they state that terminology is still needed during evaluation and "prefer the term 'hyperactive delirium with agitation' to describe this initial undifferentiated presentation of patients with altered mental status who are aggressive or have vital signs suggestive of excessive adrenergic activity," noting that "'Hyperactivity,' 'delirium,' and 'agitation' are clear and established medical terms." For classification, "'Delirium' describes an acute decline in cognition, fluctuating over hours to days, characterized by a deficit of attention" and "Hyperactive delirium is already recognized as a subtype of delirium, distinguishing the presentation from hypoactive delirium with psychomotor slowing [21]," and the term "hyperactive delirium with agitation" "does not have the problematic history of 'excited delirium.'" Management guidance is explicit: "The management of patients with hyperactive delirium with agitation should include behavioral de-escalation techniques and will often require the use of sedative medications with the goals of protection of both patient and caregivers, and for the facilitation of further diagnosis" and "The use of physical restraints should be minimized and discontinued as early as possible."

Dementia—assessment and pre-intervention evaluation emphasizes that these regular assessments of recent cognitive and functional status provide a baseline for assessing the effect of any intervention, and they improve the recognition and treatment of acute problems, such as delirium; when there is an acute worsening of cognition, functioning, behavior, mood, or psychosis, the clinician should bear in mind that elderly persons in general and patients with dementia in particular are at high risk for delirium associated with medications, general medical problems, and surgery. A thoughtful assessment of the patient’s overall status and a general medical evaluation must precede any intervention with psychotropic medications or physical restraint, except in an emergency, and assessments should also include examination of the patient’s sensory function, since sensory deficits can precipitate or worsen psychiatric and cognitive symptoms and increase the risk that patients will make medication errors. Before undertaking an intervention, the psychiatrist should enlist the help of caregivers in carefully characterizing the target symptoms, and their nature, intensity, frequency, precipitants, and consequences should be reviewed and documented.

Discussion

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify predisposing and precipitating factors associated with delirium. Across 315 included studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, with 101 144 patients (of whom 24 015 patients had delirium), we identified 33 predisposing and 112 precipitating factors associated with delirium. Unlike many recent systematic reviews of risk factors associated with delirium, ours was agnostic to setting and identified predisposing and precipitating factors using a methodology for distinguishing between them. This review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive library of delirium etiologies, which may be used to inform more precise study of delirium pathophysiology and its treatment. Our findings differ from those of prior reviews in that they reflect the delirium literature in its entirety, across all populations and settings.

Acute delirium evaluation—The following criteria can be helpful to diagnose an acute delirium: onset acute versus insidious, course fluctuating versus constant, attention disordered versus generally preserved*, consciousness disordered versus generally preserved*, and hallucinations often present versus generally absent*, with '* = Variable in Advanced Dementia'. As mental status changes may wax and wane, delirium screening will be reevaluated on a regular basis, and upon diagnosis of an acute delirium, attention will be paid to underlying causes including, but not limited to, infections (UTI, pneumonia most commonly) and medications such as anti-cholinergic medications, sedative/hypnotics, narcotics, and any new medication, especially if multiple medications have been recently added.

### Antipsychotics in the treatment of delirium: a systematic review [^4aca9f6d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Antipsychotics are frequently used in the management of delirium, although there is limited information regarding the safety and efficacy of antipsychotics in treating delirium. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence for the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics in treating delirium.

Sources

MEDLINE (July 1980 to July 2005) and Cochrane databases were searched for English language articles using keywords.

Study Selection

Prospective studies with standardized criteria for diagnosing delirium and evaluating its severity.

Data Synthesis

In total, 14 studies (9 single agent studies and 5 comparison trials) met inclusion criteria. Study medications included haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine. Improvements in delirium severity were reported with all of these antipsychotic medications. No study included a placebo comparison to account for spontaneous improvements in delirium. Other methodological limitations included inadequate blinding, randomization, and handling of participant withdrawals. The improvements in delirium tended to occur soon after initiation of treatment, and most of the studies examined used relatively low doses of antipsychotic medication. Serious adverse events attributable to antipsychotic medication were uncommon in studies, although side effects were not evaluated systematically in most studies.

Conclusion

To date, there are no published double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials to establish the efficacy or safety of any antipsychotic medication in the management of delirium. There is limited evidence from uncontrolled studies that supports the use of low-dose, short-term treatment of delirium with some antipsychotics. Further study with well-designed clinical trials is required in this area.

Implementation of pharmacological treatments in elderly patients with dementia states that low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between dose increases are necessary, although some patients may ultimately need doses as high as would be appropriate for younger patients. Anticholinergic side effects may also lead to worsening cognitive impairment, confusion, or even delirium, orthostasis is common in elderly patients, and medications associated with central nervous system sedation may worsen cognition, increase the risk of falls, and put patients with sleep apnea at risk for additional respiratory depression; elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies are especially susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects. For all these reasons, medications should be used with considerable care, and polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible, and in nonemergency situations or when neuropsychiatric symptoms are not severe, nonpharmacological approaches should be attempted first to avoid the very significant morbidities associated with psychotropic medication use in elderly patients.

### Association of inpatient prescribing of first-generation antihistamines with delirium in older adults: a cross-sectional study [^baabfa2d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this study of 328,140 hospitalist inpatient admissions of older adults in Ontario, being admitted to a physician who more commonly prescribes first‐generation antihistamines was associated with increased occurrence of delirium. Results were consistent when adjusting for patient characteristics, applying different definitions of delirium, and across strata of important patient characteristics. Our findings suggest that first‐generation antihistamine prescribing may be a modifiable risk factor for delirium among older inpatients.

Delirium is a highly morbid and costly medical condition that has been associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and long‐term cognitive impairment in older adults. The ideal method to study first‐generation antihistamines as a modifiable risk factor for delirium would be a prospective trial randomizing inpatients to receive or not receive a first‐generation antihistamine. Given the known harms associated with first‐generation antihistamines, that approach would be considered unethical, so observational studies are useful. A recent systematic review found only two small single‐centre studies on inpatient antihistamine use and the risk of delirium: a cohort study of 426 older medical inpatients and a case–control study of 245 postoperative patients. That systematic review concluded there was only enough evidence to suggest a possible association—our findings, which are consistent in direction with prior studies, add to the literature supporting first‐generation antihistamines as deliriogenic. Since patients admitted to hospitalist wards are quasirandomized to admitting MRPs, our approach may reduce confounding by indication, allowing us to evaluate the association between physician‐level variation in antihistamine prescribing and inpatient delirium. While we are unable to establish temporality, it is unlikely that a hospitalist physician would knowingly prescribe first‐generation antihistamines to a patient who is already delirious; however, there is evidence to suggest that inpatient providers often miss the diagnosis of delirium.

We found significant variability in first‐generation antihistamine prescribing practices among inpatient hospitalist physicians. Physician‐level practice variation in the inpatient setting has been described in domains such as opioid prescribing, resource use, and mortality. Future research is needed to understand variations in first‐generation antihistamine prescribing and to promote quality improvement initiatives to encourage appropriate prescribing and reduce variation. Attending physicians should be cautious when prescribing first‐generation antihistamines to older inpatients.

### Quetiapine in refractory hyperactive and mixed intensive care delirium: a case series [^c593fc43]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute, reversible and fluctuating alteration in consciousness and mentation. It is reported in up to 33% of acutely hospitalised patients and in 20% to 80% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [-]. Delirium may manifest as a reduction in the level of consciousness with increased somnolence, decreased cognition and responsiveness or as a state of hypervigilance, agitation and confusion. Delirium may also fluctuate between these two extremes. Delirium has a significant impact upon patients within the ICU, and its presence has been associated with increased mortality, increased length of ICU and hospital stay, increased length of ventilator dependence and increased sedation use [,-]. Delirium is also a significant risk factor for the development of post-ICU cognitive dysfunction, including posttraumatic stress disorder. Multiple factors contribute to the development of delirium, including preexisting cognitive dysfunction, alcohol and/or drug withdrawal, sedative use, altered or inadequate sleep, painful procedures, lack of a focal point, infection, shock states and disordered physiology (for example, hypercapnoea or hypoxia).

Managing patients with delirium can be extremely challenging. The optimal management of delirium requires a calm environment, sleep, good hygiene, correction of any underlying contributing factors and minimising sedative use. These can be challenging in the ICU, given the environment and the patient acuity. Agitated patients may cause harm to themselves by inadvertently removing endotracheal tubes, venous access or invasive monitoring. Hence, to preserve patient safety, drug therapy including haloperidol, clonidine, benzodiazepines or propofol is commonly used.

Haloperidol has remained the gold standard of drug therapy for ICU delirium, despite significant limitations due to adverse events, including QTc prolongation (with the potential to trigger ventricular tachycardia, especially Torsades de Pointes), hypotension and extrapyramidal side effects. Haloperidol's status as the gold standard for delirium therapy is predominantly a result of historical precedent. However, some investigators have reported that haloperidol may prolong delirium in the ICU population [-]. To ensure maximum effect and minimise adverse events, it has been advised that haloperidol should be administered in small, frequent doses (0.5 to 1 mg every two to four hours). This can be difficult to achieve in clinical practice, and thus it is possible that poor administration contributes to delirium and agitation or results in an increase in adverse events as a result of this treatment.

Cholinesterase inhibitors for perioperative prevention or treatment—In older adults not currently taking cholinesterase inhibitors, the prescribing practitioner should not newly prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors perioperatively to older adults to prevent or treat delirium (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Newly prescribing prophylactic cholinesterase inhibitors in the perioperative setting has been found by four randomized controlled trials not to be effective in reducing incidence of postoperative delirium; they may also be associated with more adverse effects and increased mortality risk, and two other studies found no differences in duration of delirium with cholinesterase inhibitors with one reporting a higher trend toward mortality in critically ill patients. Adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors include diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, bradycardia, and potential to exacerbate ulcer disease and conduction disorders, and withholding cholinesterase inhibitors in patients on chronic treatment may cause worsening symptoms.
