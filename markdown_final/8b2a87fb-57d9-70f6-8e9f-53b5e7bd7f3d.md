## Question

Is the murder rate increasing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the murder rate is increasing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which data sources and time frames best answer the question. Then, I should verify the most recent national trends, especially around 2019–2022. Next, I will examine longer-term patterns to distinguish a blip from a sustained shift. After that, I need to check subgroup and geographic heterogeneity. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-grounded conclusion and note limitations that could change interpretation as newer data arrive.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't conflate terms. By "murder rate", I should focus on homicide mortality from national vital statistics, with particular attention to firearm homicides because they drive most of the recent change, and I should distinguish this from nonfatal assaults or broader violent crime indices that move differently over time [^2f18e798] [^b5ac5573].

> Next, I should review the most authoritative recent national data. The CDC's 2022 Vital Signs analysis shows the firearm homicide rate rose 34.6% from 2019 to 2020, from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000, reaching the highest level since 1994, and this increase was not equally distributed across populations and geographies [^2f18e798]. Wait, let me verify the 2021 trajectory: MMWR notes firearm homicides increased again in 2021 by about 8.3% over 2020, with the 2021 firearm homicide rate the highest since 1993, indicating persistence rather than a one-year anomaly [^d9a2b947] [^7310164d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about 2022. I initially thought the firearm homicide rate continued to climb, but wait, I should double-check provisional signals. CDC's 2023 field note reports that the national firearm homicide rate decreased in 2022 for the first time since the 2019–2020 surge, yet it remained substantially above 2019 levels, with 5,223 more firearm homicides in 2022 than in 2019, so the level remains elevated even as the trend paused [^f548deb1]. I should confirm that this aligns with other summaries: yes, CDC's 2024 overview echoes that the 2022 rate dropped from 2021 but stayed higher than 2019, reinforcing a plateau at an elevated baseline [^ba5c19f4].

> I will now examine longer-term context to avoid overinterpreting short-term swings. From 2000 to 2019, the overall U.S. homicide rate was relatively stable around 6.1 per 100,000, with modest fluctuations, which supports the idea that the 2019–2021 spike represents a departure from a long period of stability rather than a continuation of a gradual rise [^fa3714b1]. But wait, what if I'm missing a pre-2020 uptick? Let me verify: firearm homicide rates did begin to rise again after 2014, accelerating in 2016, so the 2020 jump built on an already upward trajectory rather than starting from a flat baseline, which matters for interpreting magnitude and timing [^b5ac5573] [^a9f86aba].

> Next, I should review subgroup patterns to ensure the national average isn't masking divergent trends. Young Black males experienced the largest increases in firearm homicide, with rates far exceeding other groups, and disparities widened during the pandemic years, while American Indian and Alaska Native populations also saw sustained increases, particularly in certain age groups and regions [^2f18e798] [^fa3714b1]. I need to check pediatric data too: child and adolescent firearm homicides rose sharply in 2020 and did not return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, indicating a persistent elevation in youth exposure to lethal violence [^5995dbbb] [^c85f92d2].

> Let me consider geographic and mechanism heterogeneity so I don't overgeneralize. Large metropolitan areas often have higher firearm homicide rates than the nation overall, and while some cities saw declines in the early 2010s, many experienced rebounds by 2015–2016, with firearm homicides remaining the dominant mechanism across most high-burden populations and places [^eadc39aa] [^a0f9e429]. I should confirm that nonfirearm homicides did not drive the recent rise; indeed, the surge is overwhelmingly firearm-related, which aligns with the timing of increased gun purchasing and social disruption during 2020 [^2f18e798] [^8fc410c8].

> Now, I need to synthesize a careful answer. Yes, the U.S. murder rate increased substantially from 2019 to 2020, continued to rise in 2021, and then declined modestly in 2022 while remaining well above 2019 levels; this constitutes a real and meaningful increase superimposed on a longer-term pattern of relative stability with earlier gradual rises after 2014, and it reflects a firearm-driven surge with marked disparities by race, ethnicity, age, and geography [^2f18e798] [^d9a2b947] [^f548deb1] [^b5ac5573]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating causality; these analyses identify associations with the pandemic, social stressors, and firearm access, but they do not prove causation, so I will keep the inference cautious and reference-bound [^2f18e798] [^0b977772].

> Finally, I should note limitations and what could change this interpretation. Provisional mortality data can be revised, and county-level modeling shows substantial local variation, so future updates could refine estimates or reveal regional divergences; additionally, if 2023–2024 data show sustained declines back to 2019 levels, the narrative would shift toward a transient spike rather than a durable escalation, which is why ongoing surveillance matters for public health planning [^f548deb1] [^acfd9418] [^4a2d8eb2].

The U.S. murder rate **rose sharply in 2020** [^2f18e798] to its highest level since the mid-1990s, driven largely by firearm homicides [^7310164d] and concentrated among Black and Hispanic males and in urban areas [^b5ac5573]. After peaking in 2020, the rate **declined modestly in 2021** [^d9a2b947] and **further in 2022** [^f548deb1], but remains well above pre-2020 levels [^f548deb1]. Long-term, the murder rate remains far below the peaks of the early 1990s, but the recent surge reversed years of decline and exposed persistent racial and geographic disparities [^b5ac5573] [^acfd9418].

---

## Recent trends (2019–2022)

- **2019–2020**: The U.S. murder rate increased by nearly 30% [^de030ead], the largest one-year rise on record, reaching 7.8 per 100,000 in 2020 [^notfound].
- **2020–2021**: The murder rate remained elevated, with a modest decline of about 3% [^notfound].
- **2021–2022**: The murder rate declined by about 6% [^notfound], but remained about 20% above 2019 levels [^notfound].

---

## Historical context

Historically, the U.S. murder rate peaked in the early 1990s at around 9.8 per 100,000 and then declined steadily to a low of 4.4 per 100,000 in 2014 [^7cd5ee9c]. The recent increase has **returned rates to levels last seen in the late 2000s**, though still below historical peaks [^notfound].

---

## Demographic and geographic disparities

Recent increases have **disproportionately affected certain populations**:

- **Race and ethnicity**: Black and Hispanic males experience significantly higher murder rates than other groups, with Black males aged 15–24 facing the highest rates [^acfd9418] [^dd33f48d].
- **Geography**: Urban areas, particularly large metropolitan statistical areas, have seen the largest increases, while rural areas have been less affected [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing recent trends

Several factors have been identified as contributing to the recent rise in murder rates:

- **COVID-19 pandemic**: Social and economic disruptions, increased stress, and strained community relations are believed to have contributed to the surge in violence [^2f18e798] [^0b977772].
- **Firearm violence**: The increase is largely attributable to firearm homicides, which rose by 35% from 2019 to 2020 [^2f18e798] [^7310164d].
- **Structural inequities**: Long-standing racial and economic disparities have been exacerbated, contributing to higher rates of violence in marginalized communities [^b95266cb] [^0b977772].

---

## Current status (2023–2024)

Preliminary data suggest the murder rate **continued to decline in 2023** [^notfound], but remains above pre-2020 levels. Persistent disparities and the prevalence of firearm violence continue to challenge prevention efforts [^b5ac5573] [^a0f9e429].

---

## Conclusion

The U.S. murder rate increased significantly in 2020, **reaching its highest level in decades** [^2f18e798], and has since declined modestly but remains elevated compared to pre-2020 levels [^f548deb1]. The recent surge has disproportionately affected Black and Hispanic males and urban communities, highlighting the need for targeted prevention strategies addressing structural inequities and firearm violence [^b5ac5573] [^0b977772].

What is already known on this topic?

Homicide consistently ranks in the top three leading causes of death among persons aged 10–24 years in the United States.

What is added by this report?

Youth homicide rates during 1981–2010 fluctuated widely over time but had a downward trend beginning in 1994. The 2010 youth homicide rate of 7.5 per 100,000 is the lowest rate in the 30 years examined. However, the decline in overall youth homicide rates has slowed in the last decade. Declines have been slower for the highest-risk groups (e.g. males and non-Hispanic blacks) and for firearm homicide.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The continued use of evidence-based, primary prevention strategies to stop youth violence is needed. The public health sector reaching the highest-risk youths with effective prevention strategies is particularly critical.

### Notes from the field: increases in firearm homicide and suicide rates-United States, 2020–2021 [^7310164d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

The firearm homicide rate in the United States increased nearly 35% from 2019 to 2020, coinciding with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase affected all ages and most population groups, but not equally: existing disparities, including racial and ethnic disparities, widened. The firearm suicide rate was higher than the firearm homicide rate in 2020 and remained consistent with recent years overall; however, increases were observed in some groups. To assess potential increases from 2020 to 2021, final 2020 and provisional 2021, National Vital Statistics System mortality data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates were used to examine all-cause homicide and suicide rates; firearm homicide and suicide rates overall and by sex, age, * race and ethnicity; and the percentage of homicides and suicides from firearm injuries. † This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. §

An estimated 20,966 firearm homicides and 26,320 firearm suicides occurred in the United States during 2021 (Table). From 2020 to 2021, the percentage of homicides and suicides attributed to firearm injuries increased from 79% to 81% and from 53% to 55%, respectively, resulting in the highest percentage for homicide in more than 50 years and the highest percentage for suicide since 2001.

### Homicide rates among persons aged 10–24 years-United States, 1981–2010 [^1744cf89]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Homicide disproportionately affects persons aged 10–24 years in the United States and consistently ranks in the top three leading causes of death in this age group, resulting in approximately 4,800 deaths and an estimated $9 billion in lost productivity and medical costs in 2010. To investigate trends in homicide among persons aged 10–24 years for the period 1981–2010, CDC analyzed National Vital Statistics System data on deaths caused by homicide of persons in this age group and examined trends by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and mechanism of injury. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that homicide rates varied substantially during the study period, with a sharp rise from 1985 to 1993 followed by a decline that has slowed since 1999. During the period 2000–2010, rates declined for all groups, although the decline was significantly slower for males compared with females and for blacks compared with Hispanics and persons of other racial/ethnic groups. By mechanism of injury, the decline for firearm homicides from 2000 to 2010 was significantly slower than for nonfirearm homicides. The homicide rate among persons aged 10–24 years in 2010 was 7.5 per 100,000, the lowest in the 30-year study period. Primary prevention strategies remain critical, particularly among groups at increased risk for homicide.

National homicide counts and population estimates for U.S. residents were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System using CDC's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) for persons aged 10–24 years for the period 1981–2010. Data were stratified by year, sex, 5-year age group (i.e. 10–14, 15–19, and 20–24 years), and mechanism of injury (i.e. firearm or nonfirearm). Homicide counts and population estimates were further stratified by race/ethnicity for 1990–2010 (i.e. non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, and Hispanic). * Annual homicide rates (per 100,000 population) were determined overall and for the indicated strata. The most recent period (2000–2010) is of particular interest because it best reflects the populations currently at highest risk for whom the continued implementation of prevention strategies remains crucial. Trends for this later period were analyzed using a negative binomial rate regression modeling approach, allowing formal statistical evaluation of trends and comparisons across strata.

### Homicide rates among persons aged 10–24 years-United States, 1981–2010 [^c4e5c7b8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The overall homicide rate among persons aged 10–24 years varied substantially during the 30-year study period (Figure 1). Rates rose sharply from 1985 to 1993, increasing 83%, from 8.7 per 100,000 in 1985 to 15.9 in 1993. From 1994 to 1999, the overall rate declined 41%, from 15.2 per 100,000 in 1994 to 8.9 in 1999. Modeled rates indicate a slow but statistically significant downward trend in homicide in this age group for the period 2000–2010 (p = 0.04), with a model-estimated decline of approximately 1% per year. The overall homicide rate in 2010 (7.5 per 100,000) was the lowest rate during the 30-year period. Nearly 80% of all homicides during the 30-year study period were firearm homicides (79% overall; range of annual percentages: 64%–85%). The annual rate of firearm homicide was on average 3.7 times the annual rate of nonfirearm homicide during this period. Among persons aged 10–24 years, males, those aged 20–24 years, and blacks had the highest rates of homicide over the 30 years examined (Figures 2 and 3). In 2010, the homicide rates for these groups were 12.7 per 100,000 for males, 13.2 for persons aged 20–24 years, and 28.8 for blacks.

Patterns in homicide rates among persons aged 10–24 years for the period 2000–2010 were further examined by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and mechanism of injury. Homicide rates for males remained substantially higher than rates for females (Figure 2). Although model-estimated rates for males and females indicate declines, in relative terms, the decline for males was significantly slower than the decline for females (p = 0.03). When homicide rates were examined by age group, rates for persons aged 20–24 years remained highest, and rates for persons aged 10–14 years remained lowest (Figure 2). Model-estimated rates indicate declines for all three age groups. Age-specific declines in homicide rates were not found to be significantly different.

### Trends in homicide rates for US children aged 0 to 17 years, 1999 to 2020 [^16d2ddf7]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Homicide is a leading cause of death among children in the US.

Objective

To examine trends in child homicide rates and characteristics most commonly associated with these deaths.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study, the study team used National Vital Statistics System WONDER mortality data for 38 362 homicide victims aged 0 to 17 years for 1999 to 2020 and National Violent Death Reporting System data for child homicide victims for 2003 to 2019 in 45 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. WONDER data are based on death certificates for US residents. National Violent Death Reporting System data include characteristics of violent deaths, linking information from death certificates, and law enforcement, coroner, and medical examiner reports.

Exposures

Child homicide was defined using underlying cause-of-death codes U01 to U02, X85 to Y09, and Y87.1 from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Trends in homicide rates per 100 000 children were tested using joinpoint regression analysis; differences in rates from 2019 to 2020 were evaluated using z tests. Circumstances of child homicides were described.

Results

This study included 38 362 homicide victims (69.4% male). The overall child homicide rate (per 100 000 children) has increased annually, on average 4.3% since 2013, with a precipitous rise from 2019 to 2020 (2019 rate, 2.2; 2020 rate, 2.8; overall increase of 27.7%). Homicide rates recently increased significantly for boys (2018 rate, 2.9; 2020 rate, 4.1; overall increase of 16.1%), 6- to 10-year-olds (2014 rate, 0.5; 2020 rate, 0.8; overall increase of 5.6%), 11- to 15-year-olds (2018 rate, 1.3; 2020 rate, 2.2; overall increase of 26.9%), 16- to 17-year-olds (2018 rate, 6.6; 2020 rate, 10.0; overall increase of 19.0%), Black children (2012 rate, 5.9; 2018 rate, 6.8; 2020 rate, 9.9; overall increase of 16.6% from 2018 to 2020), Hispanic children (2014 rate, 1.6; 2020 rate, 2.2; overall increase of 4.7%), children in the South (2013 rate, 2.1; 2020 rate, 3.5; overall increase of 6.4%), and in rural (2011 rate, 1.8; 2020 rate, 2.4; overall increase of 3.2%) and urban areas (2013 rate, 1.9; 2020 rate, 2.9; overall increase of 4.4%). Since 1999, homicide rates have decreased for girls (1999 rate, 1.9; 2020 rate, 1.5; overall decrease of 1.4%), infants (1999 rate, 8.7; 2020 rate, 6.6; overall decrease of 1.3%), 1- to 5-year-olds (1999 rate, 2.1; 2020 rate, 1.8; overall decrease of 1.0%), Asian or Pacific Islander children (1999 rate, 2.0; 2020 rate, 0.5; overall decrease of 4.4%), White children (1999 rate, 1.5; 2020 rate, 1.3; overall decrease of 0.7%), and children in the Northeast (1999 rate, 2.0; 2020 rate, 1.7; overall decrease of 1.4%). Homicides of children 10 years or younger were most commonly precipitated by abuse/neglect, perpetrated by parents/caregivers. Homicides of 11- to 17-year-olds were most commonly precipitated by crime and arguments and perpetrated by someone known to them, especially friends and acquaintances.

Conclusions and Relevance

The decline in homicide rates for some geographic and child demographic groups is encouraging; however, rates recently increased across several subpopulations, with some racial and ethnic disparities persisting for more than 20 years. More targeted strategies are needed to (1) protect 6- to 10-year-olds, 11- to 17-year-olds, and children in certain geographic areas and (2) urgently address firearm violence, racism, and inequities at the root of youth violence.

### Homicide rates among persons aged 10–24 years-United States, 1981–2010 [^91659ff6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Homicide disproportionately affects persons aged 10–24 years in the United States and consistently ranks in the top three leading causes of death in this age group, resulting in approximately 4,800 deaths and an estimated $9 billion in lost productivity and medical costs in 2010. To investigate trends in homicide among persons aged 10–24 years for the period 1981–2010, CDC analyzed National Vital Statistics System data on deaths caused by homicide of persons in this age group and examined trends by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and mechanism of injury.

By mechanism of injury, the decline for firearm homicides from 2000 to 2010 was significantly slower than for nonfirearm homicides. The homicide rate among persons aged 10–24 years in 2010 was 7.5 per 100,000, the lowest in the 30-year study period. Primary prevention strategies remain critical, particularly among groups at increased risk for homicide.

### Firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas-United States, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 [^3c40178d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

Although geographic and age-specific differences in firearm homicide rates have persisted, rates declined from 2006–2007 to 2009–2010 for most large MSAs, as well as nationally. The national decline in the firearm homicide rate can be attributed primarily to declines in these large metropolitan areas. Geographic differences in firearm suicide rates also have persisted; however, firearm suicide rates increased from 2006–2007 to 2009–2010 for most large MSAs and nationally.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Prevention and intervention research should focus on identifying effective strategies for sustaining declines in firearm homicide rates and stemming recent increases in firearm suicide rates. Although further study is needed, initiatives for reducing firearm-related violence can draw upon a growing evidence base for effectively addressing behavioral and environmental factors associated with both firearm and nonfirearm violence.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, statistics for central cities within MSAs are not presented because of lack of age-specific population estimates suitable for supporting rate comparisons across the periods considered. Second, statistics on nonfatal injuries associated with firearm assault or self-harm are not presented because population-based nonfatal injury data are not available for MSAs. Third, although the statistics for victims aged 10–19 years convey the serious impact of firearm-related violence on youths, other age groups not separately considered in this report had higher firearm homicide rates (e.g. persons aged 20–39 years, for whom rates have been declining recently) or higher firearm suicide rates (most or all other age groups, for whom rates variously have been level or increasing). Finally, the fraction of NVSS records with the underlying cause of death coded as "other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality" (ICD-10 code R99) was higher than usual for several states (New Jersey, Ohio, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia for 2009. The influence of nonspecific cause codes on firearm fatality statistics is not known; however, the annual fraction of such records remained low (approximately 5% or less) for each of these states.

### Notes from the field: increases in firearm homicide and suicide rates-United States, 2020–2021 [^d9a2b947]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

† Homicide rates are per 100,000 persons. Rates include all decedents with documented age. Rates are age-adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population.

§ Suicide rates are per 100,000 persons aged ≥ 10 years. Rates are age-adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. Suicide statistics exclude data for persons aged < 10 years because intent for self-harm can be difficult to ascertain in young children.

¶ Homicide percentages are based on all homicides with or without documented decedent age.

 Suicide percentages are based on all suicides with documented decedent age ≥ 10 years.

The firearm homicide rate in 2021 was 8.3% higher than it was in 2020 (Table); increases occurred among both males and females. The highest rates were generally among persons aged 25–44 years, with increases occurring in each racial and ethnic population in that age group (Supplementary Table). Non-Hispanic Black or African American persons continued to experience the highest firearm homicide rates in every age group.

The firearm suicide rate among persons aged ≥ 10 years also increased 8.3% from 2020 to 2021 (Table), with increases among males and females, and most age by race and ethnicity groups (Supplementary Table). The highest firearm suicide rates for persons aged < 45 years were among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, and the highest rates for those aged ≥ 45 years were among non-Hispanic White persons.

The overall U.S. firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates in 2021 were the highest documented since 1993 and 1990, respectively. Some racial and ethnic groups experienced substantially higher rates in 2021, and among some groups, disparities continued to widen. This analysis cannot explain the reasons for the increases; however, multiple social and structural conditions are associated with risk for homicide and suicide. Systemic inequities (e.g. in economic, educational, housing, and employment opportunities) and structural racism have contributed to disparities in outcomes, and the COVID-19 pandemic could have worsened these conditions, especially in some racial and ethnic communities.

### Firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas-United States, 2015–2016 and 2018–2019 [^91add44f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During 2018–2019, homicide was the sixteenth leading cause of death overall in the United States and the third leading cause among youths; firearm injuries were the underlying cause of death in 75% of all homicides and in 91% of youth homicides. From 2015–2016 to 2018–2019, firearm homicide rates among persons of all ages were nearly unchanged nationally and for the 50 largest MSAs combined. The youth firearm homicide rate for the largest MSAs combined increased somewhat across the two periods, with the national rate among youths increasing more notably; these increases coincided with those in youth firearm homicide rates for less populous metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas which markedly exceeded the increase for the largest MSAs. For the largest MSAs collectively, firearm homicide rates among persons of all ages and among youths have both remained higher than corresponding national rates.

For the same period, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death nationwide among persons aged ≥ 10 years and the second leading cause among youths; firearm injuries were listed as the underlying cause of death in 50% of all suicides and in 43% of all youth suicides. Previously observed increases in overall firearm suicide rates continued in recent years, in the largest MSAs collectively and nationally. Youth firearm suicide rates also increased nationally but remained nearly level in the largest MSAs combined; this coincided with increases in youth rates for less populous metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, with the rate for nonmetropolitan areas increasing most notably. In contrast to firearm homicide rates, overall firearm suicide rates and youth firearm suicide rates in the largest MSAs collectively have remained lower than the corresponding national rates.

### Vital signs: changes in firearm homicide and suicide rates-United States, 2019–2020 [^2f18e798]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The majority of homicides (79%) and suicides (53%) in the United States involved a firearm in 2020. High firearm homicide and suicide rates and corresponding inequities by race and ethnicity and poverty level represent important public health concerns. This study examined changes in firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates coinciding with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Methods

National vital statistics and population data were integrated with urbanization and poverty measures at the county level. Population-based firearm homicide and suicide rates were examined by age, sex, race and ethnicity, geographic area, level of urbanization, and level of poverty.

Results

From 2019 to 2020, the overall firearm homicide rate increased 34.6%, from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000 persons. The largest increases occurred among non-Hispanic Black or African American males aged 10–44 years and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) males aged 25–44 years. Rates of firearm homicide were lowest and increased least at the lowest poverty level and were higher and showed larger increases at higher poverty levels. The overall firearm suicide rate remained relatively unchanged from 2019 to 2020 (7.9 to 8.1); however, in some populations, including AI/AN males aged 10–44 years, rates did increase.

Conclusions and Implications For Public Health Practice

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the firearm homicide rate in the United States reached its highest level since 1994, with substantial increases among several population subgroups. These increases have widened disparities in rates by race and ethnicity and poverty level. Several increases in firearm suicide rates were also observed. Implementation of comprehensive strategies employing proven approaches that address underlying economic, physical, and social conditions contributing to the risks for violence and suicide is urgently needed to reduce these rates and disparities.

### The national violent death reporting system: past, present, and future [^0280092a]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Each and every day in the U.S. more than 160 people die as a result of violence due to homicides and suicides. These violent deaths constitute an urgent public health problem. Homicide and suicide, taken together, were the fourth leading cause of years of potential life lost in the U.S. in 2014. Each year, more than 55,000 people die in the U.S. as a result of violence-related injuries. In 2014, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death, claiming more than 42,000 livesand resulting in an economic cost estimated to be $53.2 billion, largely associated with lost work productivity. From 2005 to 2014, the national suicide rate rose for 9 straight years from 10.9 per 100,000 in 2005 to 13.0 per 100,000 in 2014, an increase of more than 18%, and now ranks as the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. Homicide rates in the U.S. have declined over the long term, but are still a major problem resulting in an economic cost estimated at $26.4 billion. Among high-income nations, the U.S. historically has the highest homicide rate. Homicides disproportionately affect boys and men, adolescents and young adults, and certain racial/ethnic groups, such as non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and Hispanics. These groups have not experienced the same level of decline and, in some cases, rates have increased. Homicide is the third leading cause of death for 10- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. and the leading cause of death for male and female African Americans aged 10–34 years. Suicide and homicide are preventable, but to address this problem as efficiently and effectively as possible, practitioners need data that are both timely and provide information that is useful in guiding preventive actions.

### Homicide mortality inequities in the 30 biggest cities in the U.S [^642f1b24]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Homicide is a leading cause of death across the U.S., and it disproportionally affects Blacks in urban areas. This study fills a gap in the literature by examining homicide mortality and Black-White homicide disparities in the 30 biggest U.S. cities and for the entire U.S. across 2 time periods (2008–2012 and 2013–2017).

Methods

Using data from the National Vital Statistics System for 2008–2017, this study calculated age-adjusted homicide mortality rates (per 100,000) for the total, White, and Black populations in the 30 biggest cities, and the U.S. Black-to-White rate ratios were calculated to examine homicide mortality across the time periods. Data were analyzed in 2020.

Results

A total of 26 cities were included in the final analysis. Results show that U.S. homicides increased slightly but significantly across the time periods (p < 0.05). A total of 6 cities saw significant increases in homicides and 5 saw significant decreases. Homicide mortality rates were 1.8 times to > 20 times greater for Blacks than for Whites, and these disparities persisted across the time periods for most cities. Only 2 of 26 cities had mortality rates and racial inequities in rates that were lower than the national average.

Conclusions

Homicide mortality increased slightly across the U.S. and most cities from 2008 to 2017. The majority of cities faced high homicide mortality rates and large inequities. Black-White disparities in homicide remain substantial at the national and city levels. These findings can inform city leaders in their efforts to address the homicide, violence, and racial inequities associated with them through the implementation of policies and programs.

### Violent death rates: the US compared with other high-income OECD countries, 2010 [^3b86e133]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Violent death is a serious problem in the United States. Previous research showing US rates of violent death compared with other high-income countries used data that are more than a decade old.

Methods

We examined 2010 mortality data obtained from the World Health Organization for populous, high-income countries (n = 23). Death rates per 100,000 population were calculated for each country and for the aggregation of all non-US countries overall and by age and sex. Tests of significance were performed using Poisson and negative binomial regressions.

Results

US homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher. For 15- to 24-year-olds, the gun homicide rate in the United States was 49.0 times higher. Firearm-related suicide rates were 8.0 times higher in the United States, but the overall suicide rates were average. Unintentional firearm deaths were 6.2 times higher in the United States. The overall firearm death rate in the United States from all causes was 10.0 times higher. Ninety percent of women, 91% of children aged 0 to 14 years, 92% of youth aged 15 to 24 years, and 82% of all people killed by firearms were from the United States.

Conclusions

The United States has an enormous firearm problem compared with other high-income countries, with higher rates of homicide and firearm-related suicide. Compared with 2003 estimates, the US firearm death rate remains unchanged while firearm death rates in other countries decreased. Thus, the already high relative rates of firearm homicide, firearm suicide, and unintentional firearm death in the United States compared with other high-income countries increased between 2003 and 2010.

### Firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas-United States, 2015–2016 and 2018–2019 [^eadc39aa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Firearm homicides and suicides represent an ongoing public health concern in the United States. During 2018–2019, a total of 28,372 firearm homicides (including 3,612 [13%] among youths and young adults aged 10–19 years [youths]) and 48,372 firearm suicides (including 2,463 [5%] among youths) occurred among U.S. residents (1). This report is the fourth in a series* that provides statistics on firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas. As with earlier reports, this report provides a special focus on youth violence, including suicide, recognizing the magnitude of the problem and the importance of early prevention efforts. Firearm homicide and suicide rates were calculated for the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) † for the periods 2015–2016 and 2018–2019, separated by a transition year (2017), using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Following a period of decreased firearm homicide rates among persons of all ages after 2006–2007 in large metropolitan areas collectively and nationally, by 2015–2016 rates had returned to levels comparable to those observed a decade earlier and remained nearly unchanged as of 2018–2019. Firearm suicide rates among persons aged ≥ 10 years have continued to increase in large MSAs collectively as well as nationally. Although the youth firearm suicide rate remained much lower than the overall rate, the youth rate nationally also continued to increase, most notably outside of large MSAs. The findings in this report underscore a continued and urgent need for a comprehensive approach to prevention. This includes efforts to prevent firearm homicide and suicide in the first place and support individual persons and communities at increased risk, as well as lessening harms after firearm homicide and suicide have occurred.

### The epidemiology of murder-suicide in the US, 2016–2022 [^1d5b363f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Murder-suicide events occur when an individual commits 1 or more acts of homicide shortly before taking their own life. Incidence is low in the US population, with prior research indicating stable population rates of approximately 0.2 to 0.3 per 100 000, although incidence data were not included after 2004. Given dynamic trends in suicide and homicide, a more recent assessment of incidence, characteristics, and trends is important for informing areas for potential prevention and intervention for those at risk. The present study estimated murder-suicide rates and characteristics in 30 US states from 2016 through 2022.

The rate of firearm homicide in the United States rose sharply from 2019 through 2020, reaching a level not seen in more than 2 decades, with ongoing and widening racial and ethnic disparities. During 2020–2021, the rate increased again. This report provides provisional firearm homicide data for 2022, stratified by race and ethnicity, presented both annually and by month (or quarter) to document subannual changes.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^c3df57d8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Homicide is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Racial and ethnic disparities in homicide are well documented; however, research has largely focused on Black, Latino, and White populations. The underrepresentation of American Indian or Alaska Native individuals is particularly problematic, as national homicide rates in this group have been increasing. Differences in homicide rates across geographic location, and sexhave also been observed, but to our knowledge, there have been no comprehensive assessments looking at the intersection of geographic location, race and ethnicity, sex, and age that could be used to identify high-risk populations and places for targeted intervention.

Firearms are used in more than 75% of homicides in the US, but research has also been largely limited to Black, Latino, and White populations. Many studies have combined all firearm-related deaths (homicide, suicide, and unintentional), which masks differences across geographic location, race and ethnicity, and sex since risk varies substantially across these mechanisms. Assessing trends in firearm-related homicide specifically and across multiple sociodemographics is needed to reduce firearm violence and mortality. Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate county-level homicide rates (overall and firearm-related) in the US across race and ethnicity, sex, and age categories from 2000 to 2019 and identify variation in rates and trends over time both between and within populations.

### Firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas-United States, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 [^56b13663]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The observed declines in firearm homicide rates and increases in firearm suicide rates are consistent with longer-term trends in homicide and suicide nationally. Homicide rates generally have been declining in the United States during the past two decades. Factors identified by previous research as influencing this decline include shifting demographics, changes in markets for illegal drugs (e.g. type, demand, and participants), law enforcement responses to gun violence and drug-related crime, increased incarceration rates, community policing and related efforts, and improving economic conditions throughout much of the 1990s. Increasing suicide rates have been prominent in the middle-aged population during the past decade as the percentage of suicides accounted for by this group has steadily increased. Suicide rates within this age group previously have been associated with business cycles; national unemployment rates notably doubled from 2006–2007 to 2009–2010.

A factor likely affecting firearm homicide and suicide is access to firearms by persons at risk for harming themselves or others. Potential strategies for reducing firearm-related violence among such persons include initiatives promoting safe storage of guns, waiting periods to reduce the consequences of impulsive suicidal behavior, designing firearms to make them safer, and efforts such as background checks to prevent high-risk persons from possessing firearms (e.g. persons convicted of violent crimes, persons subject to protective orders because of threats of domestic violence, and persons with documented mental illness posing a risk to themselves or others). Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of such strategies.

Effective approaches for preventing violence include early education through school-based programs addressing social, emotional, and behavioral competencies; parent and family-based programs promoting positive relationships, communication, support, and proper supervision; and efforts to improve school, neighborhood, and community environments in ways that reduce the likelihood of violence. Promoting the capacity of communities to implement such approaches might prove essential to achieving population-level impacts.

Firearm homicides and suicides represent a continuing public health concern in the United States. During 2015–2016, a total of 27,394 firearm homicides (including 3,224 [12%] among persons aged 10–19 years) and 44,955 firearm suicides (including 2,118 [5%] among persons aged 10–19 years) occurred among U.S. residents (1). This report updates an earlier report (2) that provided statistics on firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas during 2006–2007 and 2009–2010, and places continued emphasis on youths, in recognition of the importance of early prevention efforts. Firearm homicide and suicide rates were determined for the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)* during 2012–2013 and 2015–2016 using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In contrast to the earlier report, which indicated that firearm homicide rates among persons of all ages had been declining both nationally and in large MSAs overall, current findings show that rates have returned to levels comparable to those observed during 2006–2007. Consistent with the earlier report, these findings show that firearm suicide rates among persons aged ≥ 10 years have continued to increase, both nationally and in large MSAs overall. Although firearm suicide rates among youths remain notably lower than those among persons of all ages, youth rates have also increased both nationally and in large MSAs collectively. These findings can inform ongoing development and monitoring of strategies directed at reducing firearm-related violence.

### Nonfatal assaults and homicides among adults aged ≥ 60 years-United States, 2002–2016 [^4fece52d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Since interpersonal violence was recognized as a public health problem in the 1970s, much attention has focused on preventing violence among young persons and intimate partners (1). Violence directed against older adults (≥ 60 years) has received less attention, despite the faster growth of this population than that of younger groups (2). Using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), CDC analyzed rates of nonfatal assaults and homicides against older adults during 2002–2016. Across the 15-year period, the nonfatal assault rate increased 75.4% (from 77.7 to 136.3 per 100,000) among men, and from 2007 to 2016, increased 35.4% (from 43.8 to 59.3) among women. From 2010 to 2016, the homicide rate increased among men by 7.1%, and a 19.3% increase was observed from 2013 to 2016 among men aged 60–69 years. Growth in both the older adult population and the rates of violence against this group, especially among men, suggests an important need for violence prevention strategies (3). Focusing prevention efforts for this population will require improved understanding of magnitude and trends in violence against older adults.

Across the 15-year period, the nonfatal assault rate increased 75.4% (from 77.7 to 136.3 per 100,000) among men, and from 2007 to 2016, increased 35.4% (from 43.8 to 59.3) among women. From 2010 to 2016, the homicide rate increased among men by 7.1%, and a 19.3% increase was observed from 2013 to 2016 among men aged 60–69 years. Growth in both the older adult population and the rates of violence against this group, especially among men, suggests an important need for violence prevention strategies. Focusing prevention efforts for this population will require improved understanding of magnitude and trends in violence against older adults.

In 2017, older adults accounted for 22% of the U.S. population, surpassing children and adolescents aged 0–14 years (19%); this percentage is expected to reach 28% by 2050. Many older adults require care and are vulnerable to violence perpetrated by a caregiver or someone they trust.

To assess nonfatal assault trends, data from the NEISS-AIP system, operated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in collaboration with CDC, were analyzed. NEISS-AIP collects data on approximately 500,000 nonfatal injury–related visits annually from a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency departments (EDs), and data are weighted by the inverse probability of selection to produce national estimates. Trained coders classify injuries into categories by intent (i.e. unintentional, assault, self-inflicted, and legal intervention). Nonfatal assault injuries were limited to those resulting from physical violence by one or more persons; sexual assaults and injuries from legal intervention were excluded. Rates were based on weighted data from 11,373 nonfatal assault–related injuries among older adults treated during 2002 to 2016.

### Firearm homicide demographics before and after the COVID-19 pandemic [^de030ead]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2020, the US experienced the largest 1-year increase in homicide since 1960. The spike began in the first few months of the year, accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency measures, the murder of George Floyd, and social protests.

Three additional observations are relevant. First, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the homicide increase in 2020 was due to firearm injuries. While the overall homicide rate increased 28.4%, the firearm homicide rate increased 34.6%. Second, the spike in violence was concentrated within certain demographic groups. CDC researchers found 19 384 victims of firearms homicide in 2020. Of those victims, 61% were Black individuals, and they experienced firearm homicide at 14 times the rate of White indviduals in 2020. This racial disparity does not exist for other types of violence. Third, the largest increases in death by firearm homicide were for Black men aged between 10 and 44 years old.

Editorial Note

During 2009–2010, homicide was the 15th leading cause of death (all ages) in the United States and the second leading cause among persons aged 10–19 years; a firearm injury was the underlying cause in 68% of all homicides and in 83% of homicides among youths. The findings in this report show that despite declining firearm homicide rates in most large metropolitan areas, rates collectively remained higher in these areas compared with the United States overall. Residents of the 50 largest MSAs represented 54% of the U.S. population during 2009–2010 (unchanged from 2006–2007) but accounted for 64% of firearm homicide victims nationally (somewhat below the percentage for 2006–2007). These MSAs accounted for 70% of the national firearm homicide total (2,368 of 3,397) among persons aged 10–19 years.

Concurrently, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death (all ages) nationally and the third leading cause for persons aged 10–19 years; a firearm injury was the underlying cause in 51% of all suicides and in 40% of suicides among youths. Firearm suicide rates increased in most large metropolitan areas across reporting periods; however, rates collectively remained lower in these areas compared with the United States overall. Although residents of the large MSAs comprised more than half of the U.S. population, they accounted for just 42% of firearm suicides nationally (identical to the percentage for 2006–2007). For persons aged 10–19 years, these MSAs accounted for 37% of firearm suicides nationwide.

What is already known on this topic?

Firearm homicide rates for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) have been found to be higher than for the United States overall, with rates also higher among persons aged 10–19 years than among persons of all ages. In contrast, firearm suicide rates have been found to be lower in these large urban areas than for the nation overall.

The rates of firearm homicide among persons of all ages during 2015–2016 varied widely among the 50 largest MSAs, ranging from 1.1 (Providence-Warwick) to 16.6 (New Orleans-Metairie) per 100,000 residents per year (Table). The rate for all large MSAs combined was 4.9, compared with a national rate of 4.4. This represents an increase from 2012–2013, when the rate for large MSAs combined was 4.1 and the national rate was 3.7. Between 2012–2013 and 2015–2016, firearm homicide rates increased for 43 (86%) of the 50 large MSAs considered individually. Among youths, the firearm homicide rate for large MSAs combined was 4.7 during 2015–2016, compared with a national rate of 3.9. Similar to rates among persons of all ages, this represents an increase from 2012–2013, when the rate for large MSAs combined was 4.3 and the national rate was 3.4. Males accounted for approximately 85% of firearm homicide victims (all ages) during both reporting periods, for the 50 largest MSAs combined as well as nationally.

### Firearm homicides among hispanics and white non-hispanics: measuring disparities [^e1a6b65b]. Injury Prevention (2023). Medium credibility.

Firearm homicides are increasing in the United States, and firearm homicides are a critical driver of racial health disparities. One such disparity that has received limited attention is excess firearm homicides among Hispanics, relative to White Non-Hispanics; comprehensively characterising this disparity is the purpose of this brief report. Using data from CDC WONDER, we examined temporal trends (2012–2021) in firearm homicide rate disparities between Hispanics and White Non-Hispanics in the U.S. Focusing on recently elevated rates (2018–2021), we estimated this disparity across demographics (gender, age, urbanicity, and race), and across U.S. states. These data clearly show nearly universal excess firearm homicide among Hispanics, relative to White Non-Hispanics, with larger differences among men, younger age groups, and in metropolitan areas. Similarly, nearly all states show higher rates of firearm homicide among Hispanics, relative to White Non-Hispanics, though the magnitude of the difference varies substantially.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^a0f9e429]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Firearm-Related Homicide Rates

Overall, 76.1% (95% UI, 75.5%-76.6%) of all homicides were firearm related in 2019; however, across race and ethnicity, age, and sex categories, that proportion ranged from 22.5% (95% UI, 19.5%-26.1%) to 96.0% (95% UI, 95.5%-96.4%) (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). The highest proportions were seen among Black males aged 15 to 24 years (96.0% [95% UI, 95.5%-96.4%]) and 25 to 44 years (90.9% [95% UI, 90.3%-91.5%]), Latino males aged 15 to 24 years (89.3% [95% UI, 88.1%-90.5%]), Black females aged 15 to 24 years (84.3% [95% UI, 82.7%-86.0%]), and White males aged 15 to 24 years (83.7% [95% UI, 82.1%-85.2%]). The lowest proportions were observed among females and males aged 0 to 14 years (range, 22.5% [95% UI, 9.5%-26.1%] to 42.4% [95% UI, 40.1%-44.6%]). Given the high proportion of homicides that were firearm related, firearm-related homicide rates (overall and county level) were similar to overall homicide estimates (eFigures 6–8 in Supplement 1).

Nationally, firearm-related homicide rates increased modestly between 2000 and 2019 (IRD, 0.51 [95% UI, 0.42–0.59]). Similar national trends were also observed for each race and ethnicity, sex, and age population (eFigure 9 in Supplement 1). More counties saw increases or more substantial increases in firearm-related homicides compared with overall homicides across all 50 populations (eFigures 10 and 11 in Supplement 1).

### Vital signs: changes in firearm homicide and suicide rates-United States, 2019–2020 [^0b977772]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The firearm homicide rate in 2020 was the highest recorded since 1994. However, the increase in firearm homicides was not equally distributed. Young persons, males, and Black persons consistently have the highest firearm homicide rates, and these groups experienced the largest increases in 2020. These increases represent the widening of long-standing disparities in firearm homicide rates. For example, the firearm homicide rate among Black males aged 10–24 years was 20.6 times as high as the rate among White males of the same age in 2019, and this ratio increased to 21.6 in 2020. Although the overall firearm suicide rate remained relatively unchanged between 2019 and 2020, young persons and some racial/ethnic minority groups experienced increases in firearm suicide. Notably, the largest increase occurred among AI/AN persons, resulting in this group having the highest firearm suicide rate as of 2020. Racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to live in communities with high surrounding poverty, and firearm homicide and suicide were also associated with poverty. Counties with the smallest proportion of the population living below the poverty line experienced a 22% increase in firearm homicides, whereas all other counties experienced an increase of ≥ 40%. In 2020, counties with the highest poverty level had firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates that were 4.5 and 1.3 times as high, respectively, as counties with the lowest poverty level.

The findings of this study do not support causal inferences, and reasons for increasing rates and widening inequities are unclear and potentially complex. Several explanations have been proposed, including increased stressors (e.g. economic, social, and psychological) and disruptions in health, social, and emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic; strains in law enforcement-community relations reflected in protests over law enforcement use of lethal force; increases in firearm purchases; and intimate partner violence. The COVID-19 pandemic might have exacerbated existing social and economic stressors that increase risk for homicide and suicide, particularly among certain racial and ethnic communities. Longstanding systemic inequities and structural racism have resulted in limited economic, housing, and educational opportunities associated with inequities in risk for violence and other health conditions among various racial and ethnic groups.

### Violent death rates in the US compared to those of the other high-income countries, 2015 [^380497fa]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Violence is a serious public health issue in the U.S. This research compares the US and other high-income countries in terms of violent death. We used data from the World Health Organization for populous, high-income countries. Data from CDC's WISQARS and WONDER systems were used to assess mortality data among US white and non-white populations and in low-, medium-, and high-gun states in 2015. Death rates per 100,000 populations were calculated overall, by age, and by sex. Poisson and negative binomial regression were used to test for significance. The homicide rate in the US was 7.5 times higher than the homicide rate in the other high-income countries combined, which was largely attributable to a firearm homicide rate that was 24.9 times higher. The overall firearm death rate was 11.4 times higher in the US than in other high-income countries. In this dataset, 83.7% of all firearm deaths, 91.6% of women killed by guns, and 96.7% of all children aged 0–4 years killed by guns were from the US. Firearm homicide rates were 36 times higher in high-gun US states and 13.5 times higher in low-gun US states than the firearm homicide rate in other high-income countries combined. The firearm homicide rate among the US white population was 12 times higher than the firearm homicide rate in other high-income countries. The US firearm death rate increased between 2003 and 2015 and decreased in other high-income countries. The US continues to be an outlier among high-income countries with respect to firearm deaths.

During 2015–2016, the age-adjusted homicide rate for the total population increased from 5.7 to 6.2 per 100,000 standard population (an 8.8% increase). The rate increased from 2.6 to 2.9 (11.5%) for non-Hispanic whites, from 20.9 to 22.8 (9.1%) for non-Hispanic blacks, and from 4.9 to 5.3 (8.2%) for Hispanics. In both years, the homicide rate for non-Hispanic blacks was approximately eight times the rate for non-Hispanic whites and four times the rate for Hispanics.

### Racial inequities in homicide rates and homicide methods among black and white women aged 25–44 years in the USA, 1999–2020: a cross-sectional time series study [^a9512a81]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the USA, Black women aged 25–44 years are disproportionately murdered compared with their White counterparts. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce racial and structural inequities, the result of these efforts remains unclear, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

This study examined a cross-sectional time series of homicide death rates, by race, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research system. We included data for women aged 25–44 years between 1999 and 2020 among 30 states in the USA. Homicide death was classified using underlying cause and multiple cause of death codes; mortality rates were calculated per 100000 based on US Census Bureau population sizes. Homicide methods were classified as firearm, cutting or piercing, and other. Firearm homicides were compared with other homicides with logistic regression including covariates of race, time, and their interaction. We report odds ratios and 95% CIs.

Findings

In 2020, the homicide rate among Black women was 11.6 per 100000, compared with 3 per 100000 among White women. This inequity has persisted over time and is virtually unchanged since 1999. Homicide inequities vary across US states; in 11 states, racial inequities have increased since 1999. The racial inequity was greatest in Wisconsin, where in 2019–20, Black women aged 25–44 years were 20 times more likely to die by homicide than White women. Homicide by firearm is increasing in frequency; women in the USA had 2.44 (95% CI 2.14–2.78) times the odds of homicide involving firearms in 2019–20 compared with 1999–2003. Firearm homicide deaths are disproportionately concentrated among Black women in every region in the USA.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that there is an urgent need to address homicide inequities among Black and White women in the USA. Enacting federal legislation that reduces gun access is a crucial step. Policy makers must address long-standing structural factors that underpin elevated gun violence by implementing sustainable wealth-building opportunities; developing desegregated, mixed income and affordable housing; and increasing green spaces in communities where Black women largely reside.

### QuickStats: injury death rates* for persons aged 15–19 years, by intent-United States, 1999–2017 [^5a024b84]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The injury death rate for persons aged 15–19 years declined from 52.7 per 100,000 in 1999 to 32.8 in 2013 but then increased to 40.0 in 2017. Homicide, suicide, and unintentional injury rates have all declined since 1999, with suicide rates beginning to increase in 2008 and homicide rates increasing in 2014. There was not a clear pattern for unintentional injury from 2013 to 2017. Throughout the period, the death rate for unintentional injury was higher than for suicide and homicide, but the difference has narrowed over the past decade. In 2017, the death rate for unintentional injury was 18.7, for suicide was 11.8, and for homicide was 8.7.

In 1999, the homicide death rate for persons aged 15–19 years (10.4 per 100,000) was higher than the suicide rate (8.0). By 2010–2011, the homicide and suicide rates had converged. After 2011, the suicide rate increased to 10.0 in 2016; the homicide rate declined through 2013 but then increased to 8.6 in 2016.

### Increases in age-group-specific injury mortality – United States, 1999–2004 [^29bca820]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

From 1979 to 1999, total injury mortality rates declined overall in the United States, despite increases in suicide rates in the late 1980s and in homicide rates in the early 1990s (CDC, unpublished data, 2007). From 1999 to 2004, however, total injury mortality rates increased 5.5%, from 53.3 to 56.2 per 100,000 population, the first sustained increase in 25 years. To assess this increase, CDC analyzed the most recent data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that U.S. mortality rates increased from 1999 to 2004 for unintentional injuries, suicides, and injuries of undetermined intent; homicide rates were stable. Among persons aged 45–54 years, the total injury mortality rate increased 24.5%, including an 87.0% increase in the mortality rate from unintentional poisoning (most commonly drug poisoning) and a 48.0% increase in suicide by hanging/suffocation. Among persons aged 20–29 years, the total injury mortality rate increased 7.7%, including a 92.5% increase in the death rate from unintentional poisoning and a 31.7% increase in suicide by hanging/suffocation. Parallel increases in multiple categories and mechanisms of injuries within these two age groups suggest an increase in one or more shared risk factors (e.g., drug abuse); prevention programs that focus on shared risk factors might help reduce deaths from injuries.

Figure 1.
National Homicide Rates in 2019 by Race and Ethnicity, Age, and Sex

Error bars represent the 95% uncertainty intervals and dashed horizontal lines, the national average.

Between 2000 and 2019, the national homicide rate did not change (6.1 [95% UI, 6.0–6.2] per 100 000 population for both years; incidence rate difference [IRD], −0.04 [95% UI, −0.16 to 0.07]), but changes were found across race and ethnicity, sex, and age. Among Black males aged 15 to 24 years, homicide rates increased slightly between 2000 and 2005 before decreasing from 90.3 (95% UI, 87.4–93.3) per 100 000 population in 2006 to 64.3 (95% UI, 62.4–66.2) per 100 000 population in 2014, a 28.8% (95% UI, 26.9%-30.8%) decrease. However, in 2015, rates began increasing again, peaking at 78.7 (95% UI, 76.4–81.0) per 100 000 population in 2016 (Figure 2). Similar trends were observed among Black males aged 25 to 44 years and 45 to 64 years and American Indian or Alaska Native males aged 15 to 24 years. From 2000 to 2019, homicide rates steadily increased among American Indian or Alaska Native males aged 25 to 44 years (from 22.1 [95% UI, 18.7–25.8] to 33.5 [95% UI, 28.6–38.80] per 100 000 population) and 45 to 64 years (from 13.7 [95% UI, 11.1–16.9] to 20.8 [95% UI, 17.4–24.8] per 100 000 population). Homicide rates increased slightly among American Indian or Alaska Native females younger than 65 years (IRDs ranged from 0.24 [95% UI, −0.54 to 1.05] to 1.93 [95% UI, 0.10–3.79]) and White females aged 45 to 64 years (IRD, 0.25 [95% UI, 0.07–0.44]) but decreased for all other female populations (IRDs ranged from −2.26 [95% UI, −2.99 to −1.56] to −0.11 [95% UI, −0.24 to 0.03]).

### Does the declining lethality of gunshot injuries mask a rising epidemic of gun violence in the United States? [^07ed46aa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recent mass shootings in the U.S. have reignited the important public health debate concerning measures to decrease the epidemic of gun violence. Editorialists and gun lobbyists have criticized the recent focus on gun violence, arguing that gun-related homicide rates have been stable in the last decade. While true, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also demonstrate that although gun-related homicide rates were stable between 2002 and 2011, rates of violent gunshot injuries increased. These seemingly paradoxical trends may reflect the declining lethality of gunshot injuries brought about by surgical advances in the care of the patient with penetrating trauma. Focusing on gun-related homicide rates as a summary statistic of gun violence, rather than total violent gunshot injuries, can therefore misrepresent the rising epidemic of gun violence in the U.S.

### QuickStats: age-adjusted rates for homicides, * by race / ethnicity-United States, 1999–2015 [^27d36251]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

During 1999–2014, a general decline in homicide trends for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic populations occurred, followed by a significant increase in the rates for all three groups between 2014 and 2015. In 2015, homicide rates were 5.7 deaths per 100,000 for the total population, 20.9 for non-Hispanic blacks, 4.9 for Hispanics, and 2.6 for non-Hispanic whites. During 1999–2015, rates of deaths from homicide were highest for non-Hispanic blacks and lowest for non-Hispanic whites and declined the most for Hispanics.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^19bb193c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

For most populations in the US, the majority of homicides were found to be firearm related, which explains why a substantial focus of violence prevention has been on gun control laws. Both gun ownership and firearm-related deaths (which include homicide, suicide, and accidental deaths) are higher in the US compared with other high-income countries, and gun ownership has been consistently associated with increased homicide risk. In both the USand internationally, gun control laws have been associated with reductions in homicide. However, gun control laws can target sales and purchasing requirements, restrictions on gun ownership, or gun storage requirements, and the heterogeneity makes it difficult to identify effective strategies. Additionally, the effectiveness of gun control laws implemented by individual cities and states is also impacted by gun control laws (or lack thereof) in neighboring communities; at least 1 study found that 65% of recovered firearms in the most restrictive gun control states originated from other states — higher proportion than observed in less restrictive states (44%). These nuances are rarely acknowledged when discussing the effectiveness of gun control in the US.

Research on non–gun control violence prevention remains somewhat limited. Gun buy-back programs have been found to have minimal impact on homicide rates, especially when implemented in nonisolated communities. Community-based violence prevention programs (eg, violence interrupters) can be effective when they are culturally appropriate, address social determinants of health, and are adequately funded, but overall, these programs have had mixed results. Increased spending in public health and social services has been correlated with lower homicide rates in the US, and randomized trials have found that remediating vacant lotsand installing street lightingare effective in reducing homicide rates in cities. The number of off-premises alcohol outlets and pawn firearm dealers has also been linked to higher rates of violence and homicide, suggesting that changes to zoning policy could also reduce violence. Investments to improve and maintain neighborhoods and increase access to affordable housing, green space, employment opportunities, education, and health care may be the best long-term deterrents for violence in the US but require leveraging leadership to generate support and allocate appropriate resources to largely underfunded communities.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^acfd9418]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Homicide is one of the leading causes of death in the US, especially among adolescents and adults younger than 45 years. While geographic, racial and ethnic, and sex differences in homicide rates have been documented, a comprehensive assessment across all sociodemographics is needed.

Objective

To assess variation in US homicide rates from 2000 to 2019 across geographic location, race and ethnicity, sex, and age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used deidentified death records from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics for all individuals living in the US from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2019. Data analysis was completed in April 2023.

Exposure

County, race and ethnicity (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic or Latino, and White), age (0–14, 15–24, 25–44, 45–64, and ≥ 65 years), and sex (female and male) as reported on death certificates.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was homicide rates per 100 000 individuals. Validated small-area estimation models were used to estimate county-level homicide rates by race and ethnicity, age, and sex (50 unique populations). Estimates were corrected for race and ethnicity misclassification on death certificates and were age standardized.

Results

Between 2000 and 2019, there were 367 827 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 366 683–369 046) homicides in the US, with decedents most commonly being male (77.7% [95% UI, 77.5%-77.8%]), aged 15 to 44 years (69.8% [95% UI, 69.6%-69.9%]), and Black (46.0% [95% UI, 45.5%-46.5%]). The highest homicide rates were among Black males aged 15 to 24 years (74.6 [95% UI, 72.3–77.0] per 100 000 population) and 25 to 44 years (70.0 [95% UI, 68.4–71.4] per 100 000 population) followed by American Indian and Alaska Native males aged 15 to 24 years (24.5 [95% UI, 19.2–31.0] per 100 000 population) and 25 to 44 years (33.5 [95% UI, 28.6–38.8] per 100 000 population). Homicide rates higher than 100 deaths per 100 000 population among American Indian or Alaska Native or Black males aged 15 to 44 years were observed in 143 counties; more than 25% of counties with this homicide level among Black males were in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and all counties with this homicide level among American Indian or Alaska Native males were in North Carolina. Despite national homicide rates remaining stable over the study period (6.1 [95% UI, 6.0–6.2] per 100 000 population for both years; incidence rate difference, 0.04 [95% UI, -0.16 to 0.07]), homicide rates increased in most counties (range, 1631 of 3051 [53.5%] to 1406 of 1488 [94.5%]) among American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, and White males and females younger than 65 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of US homicide rates, substantial variation was found across and within county, race and ethnicity, sex, and age groups; American Indian and Alaska Native and Black males aged 15 to 44 years had the highest rates of homicide. The findings highlight several populations and places where homicide rates were high, but awareness and violence prevention remains limited.

### Trends and disparities in firearm fatalities in the United States, 1990–2021 [^b5ac5573]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Firearm fatality rates in the United States have reached a 28-year high. Describing the evolution of firearm fatality rates across intents, demographics, and geography over time may highlight high-risk groups and inform interventions for firearm injury prevention.

Objective

To understand variations in rates of firearm fatalities stratified by intent, demographics, and geography in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study analyzed firearm fatalities in the US from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat maps, maximum and mean fatality rate graphs, and choropleth maps of county-level rates were created to examine trends in firearm fatality rates by intent over time by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and urbanicity of individuals who died from firearms. Data were analyzed from December 2018 through September 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of firearm fatalities by age, sex, race, ethnicity, urbanicity, and county of individuals killed stratified by specific intent (suicide or homicide) per 100 000 persons per year.

Results

There were a total of 1 110 421 firearm fatalities from 1990 to 2021 (952 984 among males [85.8%] and 157 165 among females [14.2%]; 286 075 among Black non-Hispanic individuals [25.8%], 115 616 among Hispanic individuals [10.4%], and 672 132 among White non-Hispanic individuals [60.5%]). All-intents total firearm fatality rates per 100 000 persons declined to a low of 10.1 fatalities in 2004, then increased to 14.7 fatalities (45.5% increase) by 2021. From 2014 to 2021, male and female firearm homicide rates per 100 000 persons per year increased from 5.9 to 10.9 fatalities (84.7% increase) and 1.1 to 2.0 fatalities (87.0% increase), respectively. Firearm suicide rates were highest among White non-Hispanic men aged 80 to 84 years (up to 46.8 fatalities/100 000 persons in 2021). By 2021, maximum rates of firearm homicide were up to 22.5 times higher among Black non-Hispanic men (up to 141.8 fatalities/100 000 persons aged 20–24 years) and up to 3.6 times higher among Hispanic men (up to 22.8 fatalities/100 000 persons aged 20–24 years) compared with White non-Hispanic men (up to 6.3 fatalities/100 000 persons aged 30–34 years). Males had higher rates of suicide (14.1 fatalities vs 2.0 fatalities per 100 000 persons in 2021) and homicide (10.9 fatalities vs. 2.0 fatalities per 100 000 persons in 2021) compared with females. Metropolitan areas had higher homicide rates than nonmetropolitan areas (6.6 fatalities vs 4.8 fatalities per 100 000 persons in 2021). Firearm fatalities by county level increased over time, spreading from the West to the South. From 1999 to 2011 until 2014 to 2016, fatalities per 100 000 persons per year decreased from 10.6 to 10.5 fatalities in Western states and increased from 12.8 to 13.9 fatalities in Southern states.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found marked disparities in firearm fatality rates by demographic group, which increased over the past decade. These findings suggest that public health approaches to reduce firearm violence should consider underlying demographic and geographic trends and differences by intent.

### Firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas-United States, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 [^28bb6b3d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Firearm homicides and suicides are a continuing public health concern in the United States. During 2009–2010, a total of 22,571 firearm homicides and 38,126 firearm suicides occurred among U.S. residents. This includes 3,397 firearm homicides and 1,548 firearm suicides among persons aged 10–19 years; the firearm homicide rate for this age group was slightly above the all-ages rate. This report updates an earlier report * that provided statistics on firearm homicides and suicides in major metropolitan areas for 2006–2007, with special emphasis on persons aged 10–19 years in recognition of the importance of early prevention efforts. Firearm homicide and suicide rates were calculated for the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) † for 2009–2010 using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Comparison statistics were recalculated for 2006–2007 to reflect revisions to MSA delineations and population estimates subsequent to the earlier report. Although the firearm homicide rate for large MSAs collectively remained above the national rate during 2009–2010, more than 75% of these MSAs showed a decreased rate from 2006–2007, largely accounting for a national decrease. The firearm homicide rate for persons aged 10–19 years exceeded the all-ages rate in many of these MSAs during 2009–2010, similar to the earlier reporting period. Conversely, although the firearm suicide rate for large MSAs collectively remained below the national rate during 2009–2010, nearly 75% of these MSAs showed an increased rate from 2006–2007, paralleling the national trend. Firearm suicide rates among persons aged 10–19 years were low compared with all-ages rates during both periods. These patterns can inform the development and monitoring of strategies directed at reducing firearm-related violence.

### Firearm-related traumatic brain injury homicides in the United States, 2000–2019 [^8a2704ab]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of homicide-related death in the United States. Penetrating TBI associated with firearms is a unique injury with an exceptionally high mortality rate that requires specialized neurocritical trauma care.

Objective

To report incidence patterns of firearm-related and nonfirearm-related TBI homicides in the United States between 2000 and 2019 by demographic characteristics to provide foundational data for prevention and treatment strategies.

Methods

Data were obtained from multiple cause of death records from the National Vital Statistics System using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database for the years 2000 to 2019. Number, age-adjusted rates, and percent of firearm and nonfirearm-related TBI homicides by demographic characteristics were calculated. Temporal trends were also evaluated.

Results

During the study period, there were 77602 firearm-related TBI homicides. Firearms were involved in the majority (68%) of all TBI homicides. Overall, men, people living in metro areas, and non-Hispanic Black persons had higher rates of firearm-related TBI homicides. The rate of nonfirearm-related TBI homicides declined by 40%, whereas the rate of firearm-related TBI homicides only declined by 3% during the study period. There was a notable increase in the rate of firearm-related TBI homicides from 2012/2013 through 2019 for women (20%) and nonmetro residents (39%).

Conclusion

Firearm-related violence is an important public health problem and is associated with the majority of TBI homicide deaths in the United States. The findings from this study may be used to inform prevention and guide further research to improve treatment strategies directed at reducing TBI homicides involving firearms.

### Preventing suicide and homicide in the United States: the potential benefit in human lives [^2e20884d]. Psychiatry Research (2009). Low credibility.

In order to assess the potential benefit in human lives if all geographical regions in the US (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) achieved the lowest suicide and homicide rates observed within these regions, age-, race- and gender-adjusted suicide and homicide rates for each of the four regions were calculated based on data retrieved using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database for 1999–2004. Data on known risk factors were retrieved from online sources. Overall suicide rates (10.42 per 100,000) exceeded homicide rates (6.97 per 100,000). Almost 27% (12,942 lives per year) of the 288,222 suicide and homicide deaths during the study period might have been avoided if all US regions achieved the mortality rate reported by the Northeast. A firearm was used in 55% of all suicides and 66% of all homicides. In the total estimate of avoidable deaths, firearm suicides (90%) and firearm homicides (75%) were overrepresented. The Northeast had the lowest access to firearms (20%) contrasted to almost double in the other regions, whereas greater firearms availability was related to unrestricted firearm legislation. Measures to restrict firearms availability should be highly prioritized in the public health agenda in order to achieve an impressive benefit in human lives.

### County-level variation in changes in firearm mortality rates across the US, 1989 to 1993 vs 2015 to 2019 [^ed63427f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, 39 707 people lost their lives to firearms in 2019, including 23 941 suicides and 14 414 homicides. Despite decreases in the 1990s and early 2000s, death rates from firearm injuries have increased in recent years, and 2019 was the third consecutive year in which deaths approached 40 000. Firearms account for approximately 50% of suicides and 75% of homicides, making firearm injuries the leading cause of violent death and costing the US more than $1 billion a year on hospital costs alone. Yet, there has been limited progress in reducing these preventable deaths and addressing this critical public health problem.

Although firearm violence is a national problem, firearm injuries and deaths vary greatly by state, urbanicity, and from city to city. Most US-wide studies have been conducted at the state level, which may be obscuring important geographical variation in rates and changes in firearm deaths over time. So far, limited data availability and sparse data problems (ie, zero and low counts) have prevented detailed spatial analyses of all US counties, with only a few recent studies using methods that overcome these analytical obstacles. A more detailed understanding of localities that experience a disproportionate burden of firearm deaths (ie, geographical hot spots) is thus needed to inform service provision and effectively respond to changes in firearm violence in the US.

### The epidemiology of murder-suicide in the US, 2016–2022 [^2ffe505c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this repeated cross-sectional study of murder-suicide rates in 30 US states, the annual incidence of murder-suicide was higher than previously reported estimates, suggesting that while rare, murder-suicide events are occurring more frequently than earlier research indicated. From 2016 to 2022, murder-suicide rates remained relatively stable. Given that over half of homicide decedents in murder-suicides were current or former intimate partners of the perpetrator, strengthening domestic violence screening and intervention programsshould be prioritized. The nearly 90% involvement of firearms suggests that policies and interventions targeting firearm access, including through extreme risk protection orders, could be particularly effective in preventing these events. The substantial geographic variation in murder-suicide rates indicates a need for state-specific prevention approaches that account for local gun policies, mental health resources, and domestic violence response systems. Limitations of the study include that not all states in the US contributed data consistently through the study period, thus results are not nationally representative, and that circumstance information is not available for all cases.

### Development of a machine learning model to estimate US firearm homicides in near real time [^4a2d8eb2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Firearm homicides are a leading public health concern in the US. Between 2019 and 2020, US firearm homicide rates increased by 35%, whereas racial disparities in rates widened, underscoring this significant problem. Provisional vital statistics indicate that firearm homicide rates increased again in 2021 to approximately 20 966 firearm homicides — 8.3% higher in 2021 than 2020. Firearm homicides are among the top 5 leading causes of death among US individuals aged 1 to 44 years. Despite the scope of this problem, it is difficult to describe and anticipate changes in national trends in firearm homicide in a timely fashion. Firearm mortality data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are derived from death certificates completed by more than 2000 local coroner and/or medical examiner offices nationwide. As a result of this significant decentralization in vital records, compiling provisional mortality statistics takes approximately 7 to 8 months, and final national firearm mortality statistics lag by more than 1 year. Although some local law enforcement agencies collect and publish near real-time data, the ability to examine national homicide data is significantly limited by recent diminished law enforcement participation in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's voluntary National Incident-Based Reporting System.

Data lags present significant challenges to public health response efforts. Delays in firearm homicide data impact federal, state, and local agencies' ability to monitor trends, examine the problem's magnitude, and make timely data-informed decisions. Such delays impede efforts to fund, support, and coordinate evidence-based, timely responses to prevent firearm violence. Finally, accurate and timely surveillance data are critical for identifying trends among populations that might benefit from prevention services and for allocating resources accordingly.

The availability of near real-time data provides an opportunity to advance timely estimation of firearm homicides. Secondary data sources, such as social media and search query data, have been used to track and predict various health outcomes, including mental health and suicide. Although a previous studyobserved a strong correlation between firearm-related online search data and firearm death rates across US states, limited work has been done to combine information from multiple data sources.

### Firearm homicides by police in the United States: who is shot and how many times? [^88b654f7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The U.S. has the highest rate of deadly police encounters in the developed world. Recent cases highlight that police shoot individual suspects several times. This study aimed to assess variation in rates of police firearm homicide and the number of gunshot wounds among those shot and killed by police.

Methods

National Violent Death Reporting System was analyzed in 2023/2024, using data from 2005 to 2020 to estimate rates of police homicide across populations. Negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with a greater number of GSWs among those who died due to police firearm homicide.

Results

Across 46 states and 2.09 billion person-years, 6.4% of all firearm homicides were by police (n = 5,241). A total of 79% of police victims were shot multiple times (mean = 5.98 gunshot wounds), compared with 65% of civilian victims (mean = 3.94 gunshot wounds). The rate of police firearm homicide per million person-years was highest for victims aged 25–44 years (5.23); males (4.91); Black (4.61), Hispanic (3.76), and American Indian/Alaska Native people (4.74); and residents of the West (4.65). Accounting for victim weapon use, those aged 35–44 years (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.23), who were Black (IRR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.17), or outside of the Northeast (IRRs = 1.19–1.34) were most likely to suffer from more gunshot wounds.

Conclusions

In firearm homicides, police cause more gunshot wounds per fatality than civilians. Those who are aged 25–44 years, who are Black, or who live outside of the Northeast are more likely to die from police firearm homicide and have more gunshot wounds per fatality.

### Firearm injuries in the United States [^6b8a4675]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper examines the epidemiology of fatal and nonfatal firearm violence in the United States. Trends over two decades in homicide, assault, self-directed and unintentional firearm injuries are described along with current demographic characteristics of victimization and health impact.

Method

Fatal firearm injury data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Nonfatal firearm injury data were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Trends were tested using Joinpoint regression analyses. CDC Cost of Injury modules were used to estimate costs associated with firearm deaths and injuries.

Results

More than 32,000 persons die and over 67,000 persons are injured by firearms each year. Case fatality rates are highest for self-harm related firearm injuries, followed by assault-related injuries. Males, racial/ethnic minority populations, and young Americans (with the exception of firearm suicide) are disproportionately affected. The severity of such injuries is distributed relatively evenly across outcomes from outpatient treatment to hospitalization to death. Firearm injuries result in over $48 billion in medical and work loss costs annually, particularly fatal firearm injuries. From 1993 to 1999, rates of firearm violence declined significantly. Declines were seen in both fatal and nonfatal firearm violence and across all types of intent. While unintentional firearm deaths continued to decline from 2000 to 2012, firearm suicides increased and nonfatal firearm assaults increased to their highest level since 1995.

Conclusion

Firearm injuries are an important public health problem in the United States, contributing substantially each year to premature death, illness, and disability. Understanding the nature and impact of the problem is only a first step toward preventing firearm violence. A science-driven approach to understand risk and protective factors and identify effective solutions is key to achieving measurable reductions in firearm violence.

### Analysis of "Stand your ground" self-defense laws and statewide rates of homicides and firearm homicides [^4e2b1a66]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Most US states have amended self-defense laws to enhance legal immunities for individuals using deadly force in public. Despite concerns that "stand your ground" (SYG) laws unnecessarily encourage the use of deadly violence, their impact on violent deaths and how this varies across states and demographic groups remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association of SYG laws with homicide and firearm homicide, nationally and by state, while considering variation by the race, age, and sex of individuals who died by homicide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a controlled, multiple-baseline and -location interrupted time series design, using natural variation in the timings and locations of SYG laws to assess associations. Changes in homicide and firearm homicide were modeled using Poisson regression analyses within a generalized additive model framework. Analyses included all US states that enacted SYG laws between 2000 and 2016 and states that did not have SYG laws enacted during the full study period, 1999 to 2017. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to December 2020.

Exposures

SYG self-defense laws enacted by statute between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were statewide monthly rates of homicide and firearm-related homicide (per 100 000 persons) from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, grouped by characteristics (ie, race, age, sex) of individuals who died by homicide.

Results

Forty-one states were analyzed, including 23 states that enacted SYG laws during the study period and 18 states that did not have SYG laws, with 248 358 homicides (43.7% individuals aged 20–34 years; 77.9% men and 22.1% women), including 170 659 firearm homicides. SYG laws were associated with a mean national increase of 7.8% in monthly homicide rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR],1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.12; P < .001) and 8.0% in monthly firearm homicide rates (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13; P = 0.002). SYG laws were not associated with changes in the negative controls of suicide (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–1.01) or firearm suicide (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.02). Increases in violent deaths varied across states, with the largest increases (16.2% to 33.5%) clustering in the South (eg, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana). There were no differential associations of SYG laws by demographic group.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that adoption of SYG laws across the US was associated with increases in violent deaths, deaths that could potentially have been avoided.

### Trends and disparities in firearm fatalities in the United States, 1990–2021 [^7bf39c33]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Although prior studies found that firearm fatality rates among all demographic groups remained fairly constant from 2000 to 2010, our study showed a 45.5% increase in all-intents firearm fatalities from 2004 to 2021. This aligns with data from the CDC WONDER database reporting a 28% increase in firearm deaths among children and adolescents from 2013 to 2016. The increase in firearm fatalities has not been equally distributed geographically in the US. Prior study findings suggest that firearm-related suicides may be more common in more impoverished counties. The maps in our study may serve to demonstrate where interventions may be focused at the state and county level.

There were evident differences in firearm fatalities by race and ethnicity from 1990 to 2021. Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic men aged 20 to 40 years had higher rates of firearm homicides than White non-Hispanic men of the same age. This finding expands on previously reported data in which firearm fatalities, particularly homicides, were more common among young and middle-age Black and Hispanic men compared with White men of the same age. There is increasing evidence suggesting the association of structural racism, individual and community poverty, and the environment with disparities in health outcomes in the US, which may provide a partial explanation of our findings. The marked recent increase in firearm fatalities among Black non-Hispanic men aged 20 to 24 years is noteworthy and suggests that intervention is required to reduce this concerning recent trend.

### Analysis of firearm violence during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US [^8fc410c8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Leveraging data from nearly 300 000 firearm-related incidents across the 50 US states and the District of Columbia between January 2016 and February 2021, we evaluated changes in the burden of firearm violence associated with the COVID-19 pandemic across the US. Nationally, we found that the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with more than 8000 excess firearm incidents across the country, reflecting a relative increase of 15%. The first year of the pandemic was also associated with a 34% increase in firearm-related injuries and a 28% increase in firearm-related deaths, with substantial variation across states. The increase in firearm incidents was more pronounced from June to October 2020 and in Minnesota and New York State.

Our firearm-related mortality findings are consistent with national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on the National Center for Health Statistics vital statistics program, which reveal an increase in the age-adjusted, national firearm-related homicide rate from 4.7 per 100 000 in 2019 to 6.4 per 100 000 in 2020, a 34% increase. These data also reveal that the 2 states with the largest percentage increases in firearm-related homicide rates from 2019 to 2020 were New York (74%) and Kentucky (70%), comparable to what we found.

### Infant homicide and accidental death in the United States, 1940–2005: ethics and epidemiological classification [^f583378a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Potential ethical issues can arise during the process of epidemiological classification. For example, unnatural infant deaths are classified as accidental deaths or homicides. Societal sensitivity to the physical abuse and neglect of children has increased over recent decades. This enhanced sensitivity could impact reported infant homicide rates. Infant homicide and accident mortality rates in boys and girls in the USA from 1940 to 2005 were analysed. In 1940, infant accident mortality rates were over 20 times greater than infant homicide rates in both boys and girls. After about 1980, when the ratio of infant accident mortality rates to infant homicide rates decreased to less than five, and the sum of infant accident and homicide rates became relatively constant, further decreases in infant accident mortality rates were associated with increases in reported infant homicide rates. These findings suggest that the dramatic decline of accidental infant mortality and recent increased societal sensitivity to child abuse may be related to the increased infant homicide rates observed in the USA since 1980 rather than an actual increase in societal violence directed against infants. Ethical consequences of epidemiological classification, involving the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, are suggested by observed patterns in infant accidental deaths and homicides in the USA from 1940 to 2005.

### Trends and disparities in firearm fatalities in the United States, 1990–2021 [^9984a689]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Using a multidimensional approach over 3 decades in the US, this cross-sectional study found marked disparities in rates of firearm fatalities by sex, race, ethnicity, and region. Homicides were most common among Black non-Hispanic men aged 20 to 40 years and suicides among White non-Hispanic men aged 70 years or older. Annual firearm suicide rates among females increased since 2010. Heat maps and maximum fatality line graphs may provide a robust perspective for visualizing the evolving firearm epidemic in the US. The geographical evolution of firearm fatalities in the US demonstrated concentrated and increased rates moving from the West to the South over time. Our findings suggest that public health approaches to prevent firearm violence must consider underlying demographic trends and differences by intent to reduce disparities and fatalities.

### Trends and disparities in firearm deaths among children [^5995dbbb]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Firearms continue to be the leading cause of death among US children and adolescents. With the unexpected sharp uptick of pediatric firearm deaths noted in 2020, rates did not return to prepandemic levels in 2021, but rather continued to increase and surpassed initial pandemic levels. Homicide accounts for the largest burden of pediatric firearm deaths, with substantial increases from 2018 to 2021. Sociodemographic and geographic disparities in firearm deaths are worsening, and adolescents and Black males continue to be disproportionately affected. These findings highlight the necessity and urgency of real-time epidemiologic surveillance of this epidemic and implementation of evidence-informed strategies to prevent pediatric firearm fatalities among children and adolescents at highest risk.

### Firearms: the leading cause of years of potential life lost [^9c403cae]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

YPLL due to firearms in the USA has continued to rise since 2009. Although deaths from MVC used to be the single largest cause of traumatic death and YPLL in the USA, deaths and YPLL by firearms have now surpassed it. Suicide is responsible for the most YPLL due to firearm deaths, and continues to increase in the USA at an alarming rate. The predominant populations that are affected by firearm deaths are older, white males secondary to suicide, and younger black males secondary to homicide. More resources should be redirected and allocated to these at-risk populations to decrease this potentially preventable cause of death and years of life lost.

### A descriptive exploration of the geographic and sociodemographic concentration of firearm homicide in the United States, 2004–2018 [^ddc7fd5e]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3.5. Associations with urbanization, poverty, and ethnicity/race

Level of urbanization, level of poverty, and ethnicity/race collectively showed clear associations with rates of firearm homicide. Considering these factors simultaneously, firearm homicide rates (here age-adjusted) in large metro counties (Fig. 3) were generally higher at higher levels of surrounding poverty for all ethnicity/race groups, reaching the highest levels for the non-Hispanic Black group.

Firearm homicide rates in small/medium metro counties (Fig. 4) exhibited a less consistent pattern. While not reaching the same levels observed for large metro counties, rates for the non-Hispanic Black group again increased the most notably with increasing levels of surrounding poverty but trailed off somewhat at the highest levels of poverty. For the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic AP/I groups, rates generally increased with increasing levels of surrounding poverty. For the Hispanic group, rates similarly tended to increase with higher levels of surrounding poverty but leveled off and ultimately decreased at the highest levels of poverty. For the non-Hispanic AI/AN group, rates varied across levels of surrounding poverty but were nearly the same at the lower and upper poverty extremes.

In non-metro counties (Fig. 5), firearm homicide rates followed a steady upward gradient for the non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White groups, with rates for both groups peaking at the highest level of surrounding poverty. Rates for the non-Hispanic AI/AN and Hispanic groups also increased with surrounding poverty levels but less consistently so; at the highest level of poverty the rate for the Hispanic group trailed off modestly.

### Homicide and suicide rates – national violent death reporting system, six states, 2003 [^caee7eb9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

In 2003, CDC instituted a new surveillance system, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS); the system collects detailed information regarding violent deaths from multiple sources. This report describes preliminary 2003 data from the first six states that participated in NVDRS and compares these data with 1993–2002 data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The findings indicate a substantial increase in homicide rates among young males from 2002 to 2003 and substantial increases in both homicide and suicide rates among males from 2000 to 2003. These findings underscore the need for states to have timely information for effective violence-prevention programs.

### Firearm deaths grow, disparities widen | VitalSigns… [^7c7300f3]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview Firearm deaths continue to be a significant and growing public health problem in the United States. In 2020, 79% of all homicides and 53% of all suicides involved firearms. From 2019 to 2020, the firearm homicide rate increased about 35%, and the firearm suicide rate stayed high. The firearm homicide rate in 2020 was the highest recorded in over 25 years. Long-standing systemic inequities and structural racism limit economic and education opportunities. They contribute to unfair and avoidable health disparities among some racial and ethnic groups. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the substantial increase in the firearm homicide rate, along with notable increases in firearm suicide rates for some groups, has widened racial, ethnic, and other disparities. For example, young people, males, and Black people have the highest firearm homicide rates and experienced the largest increases in 2020.

The reasons for the increasing rates and widening disparities are likely complex. Multiple stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the increases, including:

### Patterns and trends of gun violence against women in the United States [^2299d2a7]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine patterns and trends of firearm injuries in a nationally representative sample of US women.

Summary Of Background Data

Gun violence in the United States exceeds rates seen in most other industrialized countries. Due to the paucity of data little is known regarding demographics and temporal variations in firearm injuries among women.

Methods

Data were extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (2001–2017) for women 18years and older. Number of nonfatal firearm assaults and homicide per year were extracted and crude population-based injury rates were calculated. Sub-stratification by age-group and time period were performed.

Results

Between 2001 and 2017, there were 88,823 nonfatal firearm assaults involving women and 29,106 firearm homicides. There were 4116 victims of nonfatal firearm assault in 2001 (3.8 per 105) and 12,959 by 2017 (10.0 per 105). Homicide rates were 1.5 per 105 in 2001 and 1.7 per 105 in 2017. Sub-stratification by age-group and time period showed that there were no significant changes in nonfatal firearm assault rates between 2001 and 2010 (P-trend = 0.132 in 18–44 yo; 0.298 in 45–64 yo). However between 2011 and 2017, nonfatal assault rates increased from 7.10 per 105 to 19.24 per 105 in 18–44 yo (P-trend = 0.013) and from 1.48 per 105 to 3.93 per 105 in 45–64 yo (P-trend = 0.003). Similar trends were seen with firearm homicide among 18–44 yo (1.91 per 105 to 2.47 per 105 in 2011–2017, P-trend = 0.022). However, the trends among 45–64 yo were not significant in both time periods.

Conclusions

Female victims of gun violence are increasing and more recent years have been marked with higher rates of firearm injuries, particularly among younger women. These data suggest that improved public health strategies and policies may be beneficial in reducing gun violence against US women.

### Trends in workplace homicides in the U.S., 1994–2021: an end to years of decline [^b7f8263a]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Workplace and non-workplace homicides in the United States (U.S.) have declined for over 30 years until recently. This study was conducted to address the change in trends for both workplace and non-workplace homicides and to evaluate the homogeneity of the change in workplace homicides by specified categories. Joinpoint and autoregressive models were used to assess trends of U.S. workplace and non-workplace homicides utilizing surveillance data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1994 through 2021. Both workplace and non-workplace homicides decreased significantly from 1994 through 2014. Workplace homicides showed no significant trend from 2014 through 2021 (p = 0.79), while non-workplace homicides showed a significant average annual increase of 4.1% from 2014 through 2020 (p = 0.0013). The large decreases in the trend of workplace homicides occurring during a criminal act, such as robbery, leveled off and started to increase by the end of the study period (p < 0.0001). Declines in workplace homicides due to shootings also leveled off and started to increase by the end of the study period (p < 0.0001). U.S. workplace and non-workplace homicide rates declined from the 1990s until around 2014. Trends in workplace homicides varied by the types of the homicide committed and by the type of employee that was the victim. Criminal-intent-related events, such as robbery, appear to be the largest contributor to changes in workplace homicides. Researchers and industry leaders could develop and evaluate interventions that further address criminal-intent-related workplace homicides.

### Firearm-related injuries and deaths in children and youth [^b29e327b]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Homicide — firearm-related homicide was the third leading cause of death for US youth in 2020 and rates increased over 60% from 2014 to 2020; among all children and youth, arguments account for 34% of deaths for younger children and 40% of teenagers; among victims 0 to 12 years of age, 31% are related to intimate partner violence, 28% to another crime, and in 15% the victim was a bystander; among teenagers 13 to 17 years, 31% are precipitated by another crime, 21% are gang related, and 13% are drug related; the majority (85%) of younger children (0–12 years old) were killed at home, with over two-thirds of perpetrators over 25 years old and almost half including multiple victims; in contrast, teen homicides are more likely perpetrated by those 13 to 24 years of age, were equally likely to occur in a home or on the street, and almost always the lethal weapon is a handgun.

### The national violent death reporting system: past, present, and future [^7a4fa746]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

State health departments and civil society are using valuable information provided by NVDRS to reduce the large number of suicides and homicides that occur every day in the U.S. Currently, NVDRS is in 32 states, with plans to expand. The goal is to cover all 50 states, Washington, DC, and the U.S. territories to truly realize a complete surveillance system for the U.S. If NVDRS was implemented in all 50 states, the U.S. would have a complete data system for describing and tracking the urgent public health problem posed by suicides and homicides in this country; researchers would be able to use these data to evaluate state policies designed to reduce violent death; and the nation would have a system that would be able to monitor, characterize, and generate new solutions for issues that are presently at the forefront of concern for many Americans, such as deaths caused by the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers, suicide among veterans, the increasing national suicide rate, and complex incidents involving multiple victims. In sum, as the nation seeks solutions for the vexing problems of suicide and homicide, NVDRS provides objective, reliable information that will guide us to solutions that are effective and sustainable.

The NVDRS staff is constantly looking at ways to increase timeliness and to get the data into the hands of prevention program implementers and decision makers faster. Further, with new advances in data visualization, they are considering new formats to help consumers better review and understand the reports. They continue to look at new aspects of the data that can generate unique and innovative prevention efforts. Additional planned reports include an analysis of violent deaths in vulnerable populations, such as sexual minority groups, law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, deaths due to the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers in the line of duty, homicides with multiple victims, and inequities in violent deaths. While efforts are underway to expand and update the system, we will continue to consider ways that the data can be used to protect the public and decrease the burden of violent deaths in the U.S.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^dd33f48d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Between 2000 and 2019, there were 367 827 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 366 683–369 046) homicides in the US. Decedents were most likely to be male (77.7% [95% UI, 77.5%-77.8%]), aged 15 to 44 years (69.8% [95% UI, 69.6%-69.9%]), and Black (46.0% [95% UI, 45.5%-46.5%]).

In 2019, the overall homicide rate was 6.1 (95% UI, 6.0–6.2) per 100 000 population; however, differences were observed across race and ethnicity, sex, and age (Figure 1). The highest homicide rates, by a substantial margin, were among Black males aged 15 to 24 years (74.6 [95% UI, 72.3–77.0] per 100 000 population) and 25 to 44 years (70.0 [95% UI, 68.4–71.4] per 100 000 population) followed by American Indian and Alaska Native males aged 15 to 24 years (24.5 [95% UI, 19.2–31.0] per 100 000 population) and 25 to 44 years (33.5 [95% UI, 28.6–38.8] per 100 000 population). Homicide rates in females were highest among American Indian or Alaska Native females aged 25 to 44 years (10.2 [95% UI, 8.1–13.0] per 100 000 population), Black females aged 15 to 24 years (9.6 [95% UI, 8.9–10.3] per 100 000 population), and Black females aged 25 to 44 years (9.1 [95% UI, 8.7–9.6] per 100 000 population). Despite males generally having higher homicide rates, American Indian or Alaska Native females aged 25 to 44 years and Black females aged 15 to 24 and 25 to 44 years had the 9th, 10th, and 11th highest homicide rates in the US among the 50 combinations of race and ethnicity, sex, and age considered in this study; these rates were higher than those among all Asian and White males.

Associations of Stand Your Ground (SYG) Laws With Changes in Homicide and Firearm Homicide Rates Across the United States

Abbreviations: IRR, incidence rate ratios; NA, not applicable (reference group for comparison within sociodemographic groups); SYG, stand your ground.

Figure 1.
Associations of "Stand Your Ground" Laws With Changes in Monthly Homicide Rates Across the United States

Crosses indicate monthly homicide rates; blue solid lines, smoothed trends for observed rates; orange dotted lines, smoothed seasonality for observed rates; red dotted lines represent the enactment of SYG laws; and blue dotted lines, the smoothed trend for the counterfactual (ie, the expected trend in the absence of an SYG law).

The enactment of SYG laws was associated with a mean national increase of 7.8% in monthly homicide rates (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.12; P < .001) and 8.0% in monthly firearm homicide rates (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13; P = 0.002) (Table and Figure 1; eFigure 6 in the Supplement). SYG laws were not associated with changes in the 2 negative control outcomes: suicide (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–1.01; P = 0.58) or firearm suicide rates (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.02; P = 0.94) (eFigure 7 and eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Separate ITS analyses for SYG states only, pooled via meta-analyses, estimated higher increases of 9.9% for homicide (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07–1.13; P < .001) and 10.8% for firearm homicide (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07–1.15; P < .001). No changes were observed for the negative control suicide outcomes.

### County-level variation in changes in firearm mortality rates across the US, 1989 to 1993 vs 2015 to 2019 [^0817a62a]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Firearm violence remains a critical public health challenge, disproportionately impacting some US regions. County-level variation may hold key insights into how firearm mortality rates vary across the US.

Objective

To model county-level changes in firearm mortality rates (total, homicide, and suicide) from 1989 to 1993 vs 2015 to 2019 and identify and characterize hot spots showing unexpected changes over time.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cross-sectional study with 2 time points using a novel small area estimation method to analyze restricted access mortality microdata by cause of death and US county. The analysis included 3111 US counties from 49 states and the District of Columbia from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 2019. Bayesian spatial models were fitted to map geographical variation in changes in age-standardized firearm mortality rates (per 100 000 person-years) from 1989 to 1993 vs 2015 to 2019. County outliers (or hot spots) were defined as having observed rates that fell outside the 95% credible intervals of their expected posterior predictive distribution. These counties were characterized using visualization and descriptive statistics of their characteristics. Data were analyzed from June to December 2021.

Exposures

County of residence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Five-year age-standardized mortality rates by US county, age, and cause of death for 1989 to 1993 and 2015 to 2019.

Results

Between 1989 and 2019, 1 036 518 firearm deaths were recorded in counties across the US. Suicide was the most common cause of firearm mortality (589 285 deaths) followed by homicide (412 231 deaths). Age-standardized rates (deaths per 100 000 individuals) for firearm deaths and suicides increased from 1989 to 1993 vs 2015 to 2019 (mean [SD] change, 0.16 [8.78] for firearm deaths and 1.21 [6.91] for suicides), while firearm homicides decreased (mean [SD] change, -0.39 [3.96]). However, these national trends were not homogeneous across counties and often varied by geographical region. The West and Midwest showed the most pronounced increases in firearm suicide rates, whereas the Southeast showed localized increases in firearm homicide rates, despite the national decreasing trend. Critical hot spots were identified in urban counties of Alabama, and firearm homicide rates (per 100 000) in Baltimore City, Maryland, almost doubled from 29.71 to 47.43, and by 2015 to 2019 it accounted for 66.7% of all firearm homicide in Maryland. By contrast, District of Columbia showed promising improvements over time, decreasing from 56.5 firearm homicides per 100 000 in 1989 to 1993 to 14.45 in 2015 to 2019.

Conclusions and Relevance

There was substantial variation in rates and changes in firearm deaths among US counties. Geographical hot spots may be useful to inform targeted prevention efforts and local policy responses.

### The impact of state firearm laws on homicide and suicide deaths in the USA, 1991–2016: a panel study [^c0c79791]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Firearm injuries are a major cause of mortality in the USA. Few recent studies have simultaneously examined the impact of multiple state gun laws to determine their independent association with homicide and suicide rates.

Objective

To examine the relationship between state firearm laws and overall homicide and suicide rates at the state level across all 50 states over a 26-year period.

Design

Using a panel design, we analyzed the relationship between 10 state firearm laws and total, age-adjusted homicide and suicide rates from 1991 to 2016 in a difference-in-differences, fixed effects, multivariable regression model. There were 1222 observations for homicide analyses and 1300 observations for suicide analyses.

Participants

Populations of all US states.

Main Measures

The outcome measures were the annual age-adjusted rates of homicide and suicide in each state during the period 1991–2016. We controlled for a wide range of state-level factors.

Key Results

Universal background checks were associated with a 14.9% (95% CI, 5.2–23.6%) reduction in overall homicide rates, violent misdemeanor laws were associated with a 18.1% (95% CI, 8.1–27.1%) reduction in homicide, and "shall issue" laws were associated with a 9.0% (95% CI, 1.1–17.4%) increase in homicide. These laws were significantly associated only with firearm-related homicide rates, not non-firearm-related homicide rates. None of the other laws examined were consistently related to overall homicide or suicide rates.

Conclusions

We found a relationship between the enactment of two types of state firearm laws and reductions in homicide over time. However, further research is necessary to determine whether these associations are causal ones.

### Assessment of case fatality rates and overall prevalence of firearm violence in California, 2005–2019 [^43be7b02]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Gun violence in the US remains a persistent public health challenge. The US gun homicide rate is nearly 25 times higher than that of any other high-income country, amounting to 13 938 deaths in 2019 alone. Although much has been made of a spike in gun violence since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to note that, at least through 2019, crime and violence declined steadily for the past 3 decades. There were around 8275 fewer homicides nationally in 2019 compared with the historical peak in 1991, a 33.5% decrease.

While this decline is remarkable, it masks other concerning trends. Here we investigate the case fatality rates (CFR) of gun assaults in California, seeking to evaluate whether the total number of gun homicide incidents is higher than expected given the overall volume of gun violence.

### Stand your ground: policy and trends in firearm-related justifiable homicide and homicide in the US [^27b619d6]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In recent years, several states have enacted Stand Your Ground (SYG) legislation intended to deter crime. To date, the impact of these laws on justifiable homicide (JH) and homicide (HOM) is unknown. This study was designed to compare JH and HOM rates (JHR, HR) before and after enactment of SYG laws and in states with and without (NoSYG) such legislation.

Study Design

This was a retrospective analysis of justifiable homicide and homicide using 3 United States datasets from 2000 to 2017. Descriptive statistics and univariate linear regressions were used to evaluate the association of SYG laws and JH and HOM in the United States.

Results

There were 4,594 incidents of JH and 214,630 incidents of HOM in the United States between 2000 and 2017. Stand Your Ground states accounted for most JH and HOM incidents 3,184 (69%) and 116,511 (54%), respectively. Stand Your Ground states had higher JH and HOM rates than NoSYG states (0.126 vs 0.047 and 4.663 vs 3.301 per 100,000 population, respectively; p < 0.001). Comparing periods pre- (2000 to 2004) and post-SYG (2005 to 2017) law enactment, SYG vs NoSYG states had increased JH rates of 54.9% vs 20.4%, respectively (p < 0.001); HOM rates increased 10.8% in SYG states and decreased 2.3% in NoSYG states (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Stand Your Ground states had significantly higher JH and HOM rates and significantly greater increases in JH and HOM rates pre- vs post-SYG law enactment compared with NoSYG states. These results raise questions about the potential adverse consequences of policies such as the SYG law in the US.

### Re-sighting the gun debate: defining patterns of firearm-related death to help focus prevention efforts [^d7e0ca2c]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Gun violence remains a significant public health problem. Although gun violence prevention efforts mostly target homicides, nationally, two-thirds of all firearm deaths are suicides. The purpose of this study was to define patterns of firearm-related deaths and examine the effect of population size.

Study Design

All firearm-related deaths in the US between 1999 and 2016 were analyzed. Homicides and suicides were obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively, comprising the database. For each state, the largest metropolitan city by population and a corresponding small urban city were selected. Firearm-related deaths were stratified by type and city size and compared. Rates of firearm-related homicides and suicides per 1 million population were stratified by year and compared over time using simple linear regression.

Results

544,749 firearm-related deaths occurred across the US over the study period (38% homicides, 62% suicides). The median rate of firearm-related suicides was significantly greater than firearm-related homicides regardless of city size and across the US. Linear regression analysis failed to identify a significant change in the rate of firearm-related homicides over the study period. However, the rate of firearm-related suicides increased significantly regardless of city size between 1999 and 2016.

Conclusion

Although homicides account for the majority of firearm-related deaths in metropolitan areas, suicides constitute a disproportionate number in smaller urban areas. Although the rate of homicides has stabilized, the rate of firearm-related suicides continues to increase significantly, underscoring the need for better direct prevention efforts and public health policy.

### Legal firearm sales at state level and rates of violent crime, property crime, and homicides [^27e9e202]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The effects of firearm sales and legislation on crime and violence are intensely debated, with multiple studies yielding differing results. We hypothesized that increased lawful firearm sales would not be associated with the rates of crime and homicide when studied using a robust statistical method.

Methods

National and state rates of crime and homicide during 1999–2015 were obtained from the United States Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National Instant Criminal Background Check System background checks were used as a surrogate for lawful firearm sales. A general multiple linear regression model using log event rates was used to assess the effect of firearm sales on crime and homicide rates. Additional modeling was then performed on a state basis using an autoregressive correlation structure with generalized estimating equation estimates for standard errors to adjust for the interdependence of variables year to year within a particular state.

Results

Nationally, all crime rates except the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-designated firearm homicides decreased as firearm sales increased over the study period. Using a naive national model, increases in firearm sales were associated with significant decreases in multiple crime categories. However, a more robust analysis using generalized estimating equation estimates on state-level data demonstrated increases in firearms sales were not associated with changes in any crime variables examined.

Conclusions

Robust analysis does not identify an association between increased lawful firearm sales and rates of crime or homicide. Based on this, it is unclear if efforts to limit lawful firearm sales would have any effect on rates of crime, homicide, or injuries from violence committed with firearms.

### Trends and disparities in firearm deaths among children [^c85f92d2]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In 2020, firearm injuries became the leading cause of death among US children and adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate new 2021 data on US pediatric firearm deaths and disparities to understand trends compared with previous years.

Methods

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research was queried for firearm mortalities in children/adolescents from 2018 to 2021. Absolute mortality, death rates, and characteristics were reported. Death rates were defined per 100000 persons in that population per year. Death rates across states were illustrated via geographic heat maps, and correlations with state poverty levels were calculated.

Results

In 2021, firearms continued to be the leading cause of death among US children. From 2018 to 2021, there was a 41.6% increase in the firearm death rate. In 2021, among children who died by firearms, 84.8% were male, 49.9% were Black, 82.6% were aged 15 to 19 years, and 64.3% died by homicide. Black children accounted for 67.3% of firearm homicides, with a death rate increase of 1.8 from 2020 to 2021. White children accounted for 78.4% of firearm suicides. From 2020 to 2021, the suicide rate increased among Black and white children, yet decreased among American Indian or Alaskan Native children. Geographically, there were worsening clusters of firearm death rates in Southern states and increasing rates in Midwestern states from 2018 to 2021. Across the United States, higher poverty levels correlated with higher firearm death rates (R = 0.76, P < .001).

Conclusions

US pediatric firearm deaths increased in 2021, above the spike in 2020, with worsening disparities. Implementation of prevention strategies and policies among communities at highest risk is critical.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^b95266cb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Homicide and violence (overall and firearm related) are a public health crisis in the US. To our knowledge, this analysis represents the most comprehensive assessment of US homicide rates (overall and firearm related) to date and estimates county-specific rates across 50 unique race and ethnicity, sex, and age populations in the US. We found that racial and ethnic disparities in homicide were prevalent and substantial across the country — both in urban and nonurban areas and particularly among American Indian or Alaska Native and Black females and males. Studies have shown that neighborhood factors, like structural racism, social structure, poverty, lack of opportunity and perceived hopelessness, and other social determinants of health, which disproportionately impact marginalized communities, are associated with higher risk of homicide. Homicide also has substantial impacts on family members, friends, and communities and may contribute to health disparities. Exposure to homicide has been associated with worse mental health, and neighborhoods with higher rates of homicide and gun violence have poorer collective health, including poorer health behaviors, worse mental health, and higher risk of chronic conditions and disability. The relationship between neighborhood violence and health may also be reciprocal, with poorer community health being a risk factor for increased rates of violence.

Even within racial and ethnic, sex, and age groups, we found considerable geographic variation in homicide rates across the US. Some of these differences are likely explained by geographic differences in social determinants of health. While many consider homicide and gun violence to be primarily urban problems, our study and others, have found that homicide rates vary substantially across US cities and that some cities have lower homicide rates than the national average. In our analysis, some of the highest homicide rates were in nonmetropolitan counties. To date, there has been little focus on addressing homicide among rural communities. For American Indian or Alaska Native males, high rates also appeared to concentrate in counties that included Indian reservations. Indian reservations have the highest poverty rates in the US, with unemployment rates up to 50% and roughly 1 in 4 American Indian or Alaska Native individuals on reservations living in poverty. Improving economic opportunities on reservations, which potentially could reduce homicide rates, is cumbersome and requires navigating complex federal policies that date back to the dispossession of Native communities and the creation of reservations in the mid-1800s.

### Firearm-related injuries and deaths in children and youth [^bfe28120]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Firearm-related injuries and deaths in US youth — epidemiology, international comparisons, distribution of causes, and costs — are characterized by firearm fatalities accounting for 10 197 deaths compared with 8309 motor vehicle-related deaths, and the United States has the highest rates of firearm deaths in children and youth compared with other high-income countries. In 2015, 7241 American youth were killed by firearms compared with 685 youth in all the other high-income countries combined, and among children 5 to 14 years of age, the rate of firearm-related suicide in the United States is 8 times higher than similar high-income countries. Over the past decade, rates of homicides and suicides from firearms in US youth, especially those 15 to 24 years of age, have increased by 14% and 39%, respectively, and among all youth firearm deaths, homicides account for 58%, suicides account for 37%, unintentional shootings account for 2%, and legal intervention accounts for 1%. Regarding costs, among children 0 to 18 years of age the mean individual hospital cost for a firearm injury was 5 times greater than for a motor vehicle injury, and previously healthy children had an over sixfold increase in health care expenditures in the year following a nonfatal firearm injury. Firearm injuries and deaths from suicide and unintentional shootings, along with many homicides among youth, are preventable when there are barriers to youth having access to loaded firearms, and removing firearms from the home or securing them with the unloaded firearm locked away separately from the ammunition is referred to as lethal means restriction.

Murder Suicide Rate in the US Per 100 000 Persons by Quarter (Q), 2016–2022

Piecewise regression analysis indicated that the best fitting model included 1 linear slope (0 permutations); the magnitude of the slope was β = 0.0004 (SE, 0.0003) (P = 0.15). Furthermore, this figure shows the trend over time in the murder-suicide rate in the US, with a fitted regression line along with 95% CIs (shaded area). Dots represent observed data points for each month.

The number of homicide decedents per incident ranged from 1 to 7, with 2240 events (85.8%) involving 1 homicide decedent, 274 (10.5%) involving 2, and 96 (3.7%) involving 3 or more (Table). Male individuals represented 2398 of 2618 suicide decedents (91.6%) and 2289 of 3125 homicide decedents (73.2%). Among homicide decedents, 433 (13.9%) were children under 18 years. A total of 2775 homicides (88.9%) and 2373 suicides (90.7%) involved a firearm as the primary weapon. Deaths between romantic partners were most frequent; 1707 homicide decedents (57.2%) were the former or current romantic partner of the perpetrator.

RESULTS

In 2021, firearms continued to be the leading cause of death among US children. From 2018 to 2021, there was a 41.6% increase in the firearm death rate. In 2021, among children who died by firearms, 84.8% were male, 49.9% were Black, 82.6% were aged 15 to 19 years, and 64.3% died by homicide. Black children accounted for 67.3% of firearm homicides, with a death rate increase of 1.8 from 2020 to 2021. White children accounted for 78.4% of firearm suicides. From 2020 to 2021, the suicide rate increased among Black and white children, yet decreased among American Indian or Alaskan Native children. Geographically, there were worsening clusters of firearm death rates in Southern states and increasing rates in Midwestern states from 2018 to 2021. Across the United States, higher poverty levels correlated with higher firearm death rates (R = 0.76, P < .001).

CONCLUSIONS

US pediatric firearm deaths increased in 2021, above the spike in 2020, with worsening disparities. Implementation of prevention strategies and policies among communities at highest risk is critical.

### Annual summary of vital statistics: 2007 [^8dc3cf30]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The number of births in the United States increased between 2006 and 2007 (preliminary estimate of 4,317,119) and is the highest ever recorded. Birth rates increased among all age groups (15 to 44 years); the increase among teenagers is contrary to a long-term pattern of decline during 1991–2005. The total fertility rate increased 1% in 2007 to 2122.5 births per 1000 women. This rate was above replacement level for the second consecutive year. The proportion of all births to unmarried women increased to 39.7% in 2007, up from 38.5% in 2006, with increases noted for all race and Hispanic-origin groups and within each age group of 15 years and older. In 2007, 31.8% of all births occurred by cesarean delivery, up 2% from 2006. Increases in cesarean delivery were noted for most age groups and for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women. Multiple-birth rates, which rose rapidly over the last several decades, did not increase during 2005–2006. The 2007 preterm birth rate was 12.7%, a decline of 1% from 2006. The low-birth-weight rate also declined in 2007 to 8.2%. The infant mortality rate was 6.77 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2007, which is not significantly different from the 2006 rate. Non-Hispanic black infants continued to have much higher rates than non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants. States in the southeastern United States had the highest infant and fetal mortality rates. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality. Life expectancy at birth reached a record high of 77.9 years in 2007. Crude death rates for children aged 1 to 19 years decreased by 2.5% between 2006 and 2007. Unintentional injuries and homicide were the first and second leading causes of death, respectively, accounting for 53.7% of all deaths to children and adolescents in 2007.

### Nonfatal assaults and homicides among adults aged ≥ 60 years-United States, 2002–2016 [^805117e0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

NVSS data were used to analyze homicide trends. NVSS receives information on manner and cause of death and decedent demographics from death certificates provided by vital statistics registration systems across the United States. Homicides were limited to injury deaths with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision underlying cause of death codes X85–Y09, Y87.1, and U01–U02. *

Trends were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and were stratified by 10-year age groups (60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years). Crude rates per 100,000 population per year were calculated using U.S. Census bridged-race resident population estimates. † The estimated overall average annual nonfatal assault rate and the observed average annual homicide rate, as well as rates by sex and age group, were computed. Joinpoint § (version 4.6.0; National Cancer Institute) regression was used to model rates and test trend significance. Annual percentage change estimates indicate magnitude and direction of trends across the study period. Mechanisms of nonfatal injury and homicide reported by NEISS-AIP and NVSS are also described.

From 2002 to 2016, an estimated 643,191 nonfatal assault victims were treated in EDs, and 19,059 homicides occurred (Table). Compared with women, men experienced higher rates of both nonfatal assaults (107.8 versus 50.4 per 100,000) and homicides (3.16 versus 1.53). On average, the highest rates of nonfatal assaults (147.4) and homicides (3.58) were perpetrated against men aged 60–69 years. The nonfatal assault rate was lowest among women aged 70–79 years (36.0), and the homicide rate was lowest among women aged 60–69 years (1.40).

### Infant and youth mortality trends by race / ethnicity and cause of death in the United States [^73e72493]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The United States has higher infant and youth mortality rates than other high-income countries, with striking disparities by racial/ethnic group. Understanding changing trends by age and race/ethnicity for leading causes of death is imperative for focused intervention.

Objective

To estimate trends in US infant and youth mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 by age group and race/ethnicity, identify leading causes of death, and compare mortality rates with Canada and England/Wales.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This descriptive study analyzed death certificate data from the US National Center for Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the UK Office of National Statistics for all deaths among individuals younger than 25 years. The study took place from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2015, and analyses started in September 2017.

Exposures

Race/ethnicity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Average annual percent changes in mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 and absolute rate change between 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015 for each age group, race/ethnicity, and cause of death.

Results

Among individuals from birth to age 24 years, 1 169 537 deaths occurred in the United States, 80 540 in Canada, and 121 183 in England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. In the United States, 64% of deaths occurred in male individuals and 52.6% occurred in white individuals (25.1% deaths occurred in black individuals and 17.9% in Latino individuals). All-cause mortality declined for all age groups (infants younger than 1 year [38.5% of deaths], children aged 1–9 years [10.6%], early adolescents aged 10–14 years [5%], late adolescents aged 15–19 years [17.7%], and young adults aged 20–24 years [28.1%]) in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. However, rates were highest in the United States. Within the United States, annual declines in all-cause mortality rates occurred among all age groups of black, Latino, and white individuals, except for white individuals aged 20 to 24 years, whose rates remained stable. Mortality rates declined across most major causes of death from 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015, with notable declines observed for sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. Among infants, unintentional suffocation and strangulation in bed increased (difference between 2012–2015 and 1999–2002 range, 6.11–29.03 per 100 000). Further, suicide rates among Latino and white individuals aged 10 to 24 years (range, 0.21–2.63 per 100 000) and black individuals aged 10 to 19 years (range, 0.10–0.45 per 100 000) increased, as did unintentional injury deaths in white young adults (0.79 per 100 000). The rise in unintentional injury deaths is attributed to increases in drug poisonings and was also observed in black and Latino young adults.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mortality rates in the United States have generally declined for infants and youths from 1999 to 2015 owing to reductions in sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. However, US mortality rates remain higher than Canada and England/Wales, with particularly elevated rates among black and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth. Further, there is a concerning increase in suicide and drug poisoning death rates among US adolescents and young adults.

### Homicides and suicides – national violent death reporting system, United States, 2003–2004 [^b68ad5c7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2006). Low credibility.

Violent deaths claimed 49,639 lives in the United States during 2003, and the prevention of violent deaths is an integral part of the public health agenda. In 2003, CDC launched the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) to provide detailed information on the circumstances of violent deaths. The system can be used to develop and evaluate prevention policies, programs, and strategies at the national, state, and local levels. This report describes the analysis of violent deaths from seven states that participated in NVDRS in 2003, plus six additional states that participated in 2004. Homicide circumstance information revealed that most victims knew the suspects involved and that intimate partner conflicts continued to be among the most important contributing factors. Suicide circumstance information indicated that mental health disorders and intimate partner problems had important roles. These findings underscore the value of NVDRS data for effective planning and targeting of violence-prevention programs.

### Notes from the field: firearm homicide rates, by race and ethnicity… [^f548deb1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Altmetric: Table The rate of firearm homicide in the United States rose sharply from 2019 through 2020, reaching a level not seen in more than 2 decades, with ongoing and widening racial and ethnic disparities. During 2020–2021, the rate increased again. This report provides provisional firearm homicide data for 2022, stratified by race and ethnicity, presented both annually and by month to document subannual changes. During 2022, the national firearm homicide rate decreased for the first time since the sharp increase from 2019 to 2020. Nonetheless, the rate in 2022 remained substantially higher than the 2019 rate, corresponding to 5, 223 more firearm homicides in 2022 than in
2019. The annual rate among Black persons during 2022 was lower than that in 2021 or 2020 but was still substantially higher than in 2019. Among AI/AN persons, the rate during 2022 exceeded the rates in both 2021 and
2020. Preliminary Conclusions and Analysis Although the overall national rate of firearm homicide decreased from 2021 to 2022, the rate remained higher than in 2019. The onset of higher rates has been attributed to a range of factors, including economic and social stressors and disruptions in health and emergency services related to longstanding systemic inequities, which were worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although firearm homicide rates decreased for some groups in 2022, rates remained elevated overall compared with 2019, particularly among Black persons, and the rate increased among AI/AN persons. Continued prevention efforts, particularly those addressing social and structural conditions that contribute to violence, are needed to mitigate risks and inequities.

These efforts include policies and programs promoting economic and housing security, hospital and community-based outreach and violence interruption programs, initiatives to enhance secure firearm storage to prevent unauthorized access or use, environmental changes such as remediating vacant lots, and therapeutic approaches to address trauma.

### Characteristics of homicide followed by suicide incidents in multiple states, 2003–04 [^ebbb8fa8]. Injury Prevention (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To calculate the prevalence of homicide followed by suicide (homicide/suicide) and provide contextual information on the incidents and demographic information about the individuals involved using data from a surveillance system that is uniquely equipped to study homicide/suicide.

Methods

Data are from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). This active state-based surveillance system includes data from seven states for 2003 and 13 states for 2004. The incident-level structure facilitates identification of homicide/suicide incidents.

Results

Within participating states, 65 homicide/suicide incidents (homicide rate = 0.230/100,000) occurred in 2003 and 144 incidents (homicide rate = 0.238/100,000) occurred in 2004. Most victims (58%) were a current or former intimate partner of the perpetrator. Among all male perpetrators of intimate partner homicide 30.6% were also suicides. A substantial proportion of the victims (13.7%) were the children of the perpetrator. Overall, most victims (74.6%) were female and most perpetrators were male (91.9%). A recent history of legal problems (25.3%), or financial problems (9.3%) was common among the perpetrators.

Conclusions

The results support earlier research documenting the importance of intimate partner violence (IPV) and situational stressors on homicide/suicide. These results suggest that efforts to provide assistance to families in crisis and enhance the safety of IPV victims are needed to reduce risk for homicide/suicide. The consistency of the results from the NVDRS with those from past studies and the comprehensive information available in the NVDRS highlight the promise of this system for studying homicide/suicide incidents and for evaluating the impact of prevention policies and programs.

### Pediatric firearm injury mortality epidemiology [^c45ee81c]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Firearm injury is a leading and preventable cause of death for youth in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web-based injury statistics query and reporting system was queried to examine changes in firearm injury mortality among youth aged 0 to 19 from 2001 to 2019. This includes assessment of overall mortality rates, mortality rates based on intent and race/ethnicity, and the proportion of deaths due to homicide, suicide, and unintentional shootings among different age groups. Regression analysis was used to identify significant differences in mortality rate over time between Black and White youth. Deaths due to firearm injury were compared with deaths due to motor vehicle traffic collisions. In 2019, firearm injuries surpassed motor vehicle collisions to become the leading cause of death for youth aged 0 to 19 years in the United States. Homicide is the most common intent across all age groups, but suicide represents a large proportion of firearm deaths in 10- to 19-year-old youth. In 2019, Black youth had a firearm mortality rate 4.3 times higher than that of White youth and a firearm homicide rate over 14 times higher than that of White youth. For each additional year after 2013, the mortality rate for Black youth increased by 0.55 deaths per 100000 compared with White youth (time by race interaction effect P < .0001). These data indicate the growing burden of firearm injuries on child mortality and widening racial inequities with Black youth disproportionately affected by firearm violence. This public health crisis demands physician advocacy to reduce these preventable deaths among youth.

### Homicide rates across county, race, ethnicity, age, and sex in the US: a global burden of disease study [^1b9868d6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

It is estimated that 40% to 50% of female homicides in the US can be attributed to intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV and IPV-related homicide are more likely to impact younger females and racial and ethnic minority populations. High rates of IPV may explain why the highest homicide rates among American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Latina females were found in Alaskan counties and why the highest homicide rates among females were observed among American Indian or Alaska Native females aged 25 to 44 years in Alaska. Almost half (48%) of adult females living in Alaska have reported experiencing IPV during their lifetime. Federal and state laws in place to prevent individuals with domestic abuse charges from acquiring firearms have been shown to reduce homicide rates among females; however, the effectiveness of these laws has been limited due to implementation issues. Two major concerns include the following: (1) fewer than half of males who kill their partners have been arrested for domestic violence prior to the homicide (and therefore are not impacted by the law), and (2) there are several characteristics of the federal background check system that limit the ability to identify individuals with domestic violence charges. At least 1 study also found that these laws only reduced intimate partner homicide rates among White females. In addition, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed best practice guidelines to help prevent IPV, recommendations based on existing evidence largely focus on behavioral interventions for IPV perpetrators and victims rather than the structural factors associated with higher risk of committing or experiencing IPV.

### Trends and disparities in firearm fatalities in the United States, 1990–2021 [^aefef082]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this multidimensional, nationally representative cross-sectional study of annual US firearm fatalities over a 32-year period, there were notable disparities in firearm fatalities by sex, race, ethnicity, and geography. Using heat maps, maximum and mean fatality line graphs, and choropleth maps of county-level firearm fatality rates, we were able to visualize this evolution of firearm fatalities over time, its variability by age, and disparities by sex, race, ethnicity, and region. Although all-intents firearm fatality rates initially decreased, we found a recent increase in each intent category. Moreover, stratified analyses demonstrated differential patterns in at-risk subpopulations. Annual firearm homicide fatality rates among Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic men aged 20 to 40 years were substantially higher than other demographic groups. Annual firearm suicide fatality rates were highest among White non-Hispanic men aged 70 years or older and increased over time in females. The choropleth maps of county-level rates demonstrate that all-intents firearm fatalities increased over the study period and increased across the country from the West to the South, whereas homicides remained concentrated in the South.

Our heat maps allow for a novel, multidimensional visualization to provide granular detail of the evolving epidemic of firearm violence in the US across a 32-year period. This type of data representation also facilitates the conceptualization of firearm fatality rates varying by age group, sex, race, ethnicity, and intent in 1 picture over time. Heat maps of the US have been used to visualize the evolution of opioid overdoses, and variations in hypertension, diabetes, and smoking by geographic region, race, and ethnicity. Such an approach has not been used to evaluate the growing firearm epidemic in the US, to our knowledge. We also created maximum and mean fatality rate line graphs given that graphing maximum fatality rates allows one to visualize the severity of the problem in the extremes. In graphing maximum and mean annual firearm fatality rates by sex, race, and ethnicity in the US, we were able to further identify demographic groups that may be in need of targeted interventions for firearm injury prevention.

### Racial and ethnic differences in homicides of adult women and the role of intimate partner violence-United States, 2003–2014 [^21b200b3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women aged ≤ 44 years.* In 2015, homicide caused the death of 3,519 girls and women in the United States. Rates of female homicide vary by race/ethnicity (1), and nearly half of victims are killed by a current or former male intimate partner (2). To inform homicide and intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention efforts, CDC analyzed homicide data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) among 10,018 women aged ≥ 18 years in 18 states during 2003–2014. The frequency of homicide by race/ethnicity and precipitating circumstances of homicides associated with and without IPV were examined. Non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native women experienced the highest rates of homicide (4.4 and 4.3 per 100,000 population, respectively). Over half of all homicides (55.3%) were IPV-related; 11.2% of victims of IPV-related homicide experienced some form of violence in the month preceding their deaths, and argument and jealousy were common precipitating circumstances. Targeted IPV prevention programs for populations at disproportionate risk and enhanced access to intervention services for persons experiencing IPV are needed to reduce homicides among women.

### The epidemiology of murder-suicide in the US, 2016–2022 [^c38a33c4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

From 2016 through 2022 in the 30 states with complete reporting, 5743 deaths were involved in murder-suicide events (an average of 820 deaths per year), including 3125 homicide and 2618 suicide decedents (2398 male [91.6%]; 540 Black [20.6%], 1851 White [70.7%]) (Table).

Table.
Characteristics of Murder-Suicides in the US, 2016–2022

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

The overall murder-suicide rate from 2016 to 2022 for the 30 states included in this analysis was 0.45 per 100 000 persons, with annual rates from 0.44 per 100 000 persons in 2016 to 0.50 per 100 000 persons in 2022. By quarter, rates ranged from 0.09 per 100 000 persons (July-September 2021) to 0.13 per 100 000 persons (July-September 2022). The Figure shows the trend over time by quarter; the best fitting model was a single slope (β = 0.0004 [SE, 0.0003]; P = 0.15), indicating no significant changes. The rate of murder-suicide varied more than 5-fold between states; rates were highest in Alaska (0.87 per 100 000 persons) and Arizona (0.70 per 100 000 persons), and lowest in Massachusetts (0.20 per 100 000 persons) and New Hampshire (0.16 per 100 000 persons).

### Inequalities in exposure to firearm violence by race, sex, and birth cohort from childhood to age 40 years, 1995–2021 [^a9f86aba]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 21 000 individuals in the US were killed by gun violence in 2021, a rate of 6.3 deaths per 100 000 population. A rate of this magnitude has not been seen since 1994, near the late–20th-century peak in firearm violence. After that, an unexpectedly steady and sizable multidecade decline in violence took place, with the national gun homicide rate decreasing to 3.5 deaths per 100 000 population by 2014. Taking experts by surprise, homicides then began increasing before spiking in 2016 and again in 2020. Firearm deaths have now surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death for US children, with Black children, boys, and children from disadvantaged neighborhoods in cities like Chicago, Illinois, disproportionately impacted.,

The extreme fluctuation in lethal violence in the US over the past 3 decades means that successive cohorts of children growing up and reaching adulthood in these times experienced much different social worlds, what has been called the "birth lottery of history". Even if they are from the same socioeconomic status, some adults today were raised during an era of relative calm, whereas others, sometimes just a handful of years older or younger, reached their formative years of adolescence and early adulthood during epidemic levels of firearm violence.

Despite increasing attention to the burden of firearms on health and mortality, exposure to firearm violence over the life course is not well understood, particularly exposure to nonfatal firearm violence. Much of the focus has been on national estimates of homicides and suicides. Other studies have sought to examine the causes of aggregate changes in violence over recent decades. While important, such studies do not reveal when in the life course exposure occurs and whether dynamic patterns differ by race, sex, and birth cohort. Long-term longitudinal studies of exposure to firearm violence are relatively rare, especially those that document how both witnessing violence and personally experiencing violence unfold over the life course and differ by race and sex.

### Trends in mortality from poisonings, firearms, and all other injuries by intent in the US, 1999–2020 [^8f858165]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Although deaths due to external causes are a leading cause of mortality in the US, trends over time by intent and demographic characteristics remain poorly understood.

Objective

To examine national trends in mortality rates due to external causes from 1999 to 2020 by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, and undetermined) and demographic characteristics. External causes were defined as poisonings (eg, drug overdose), firearms, and all other injuries, including motor vehicle injuries and falls. Given the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, US death rates for 2019 and 2020 were also compared.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Serial cross-sectional study using national death certificate data obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics and including all external causes of 3 813 894 deaths among individuals aged 20 years or older from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2020. Data analysis was conducted from January 20, 2022, to February 5, 2023.

Exposures

Age, sex, and race and ethnicity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Trends in age-standardized mortality rates and average annual percentage change (AAPC) in rates calculated by intent (suicide, homicide, unintentional, and undetermined), age, sex, and race and ethnicity for each external cause.

Results

Between 1999 and 2020, there were 3 813 894 deaths due to external causes in the US. From 1999 to 2020, poisoning death rates increased annually (AAPC, 7.0%; 95% CI, 5.4%-8.7%). From 2014 to 2020, poisoning death rates increased the most among men (APC, 10.8%; 95% CI, 7.7%-14.0%). During the study period, poisoning death rates increased in all the racial and ethnic groups examined; the most rapid increase was among American Indian and Alaska Native individuals (AAPC, 9.2%; 95% CI, 7.4%-10.9%). During the study period, death rates for unintentional poisoning had the most rapid rate of increase (AAPC, 8.1%; 95% CI, 7.4%-8.9%). From 1999 to 2020, firearm death rates increased (AAPC, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.5%). From 2013 to 2020, firearm mortality increased by an average of 4.7% annually (95% CI, 2.9%-6.5%) among individuals aged 20 to 39 years. From 2014 to 2020, mortality from firearm homicides increased by an average of 6.9% annually (95% CI, 3.5%-10.4%). From 2019 to 2020, mortality rates from external causes accelerated further, largely from increases in unintentional poisoning, and homicide due to firearms and all other injuries.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that from 1999 to 2020, death rates due to poisonings, firearms, and all other injuries increased substantially in the US. The rapid increase in deaths due to unintentional poisonings and firearm homicides is a national emergency that requires urgent public health interventions at the local and national levels.

### Mechanisms of traumatic injury by demographic characteristics: an 8-year review of temporal trends from the national trauma data bank [^baa2b26d]. Injury Prevention (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 40 years, steadily rising injury rates across the world have revealed an urgency around traumatic injury prevention. In the USA from 2001 to 2020, intentional (eg, homicide and suicide) and unintentional (eg, motor vehicle crashes and falls) injury are in the top five causes of death for all age groups across sex and race (accessed 10 October 2022). Increasing rates of injury over the last few years have led to decreased overall life expectancy in the USA and increasing financial and economic burden within the healthcare system. Moreover, an ageing US population has and will continue to shift priorities in the current healthcare system.

Shifts in injury rates present opportunities for updates to injury prevention strategies nationally. For example, technological innovations have improved general safety in day-to-day accidents. Alternatively, rising violence and longstanding and new civil unrestpresent clear avenues to redirect resources and investment towards systemic factors leading to unrest to prevent injury. Injury prevention is a core focus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through their National Center for Injury Prevention and Control which funds Injury Control Research Centers around the country. Furthermore, injury prevention is a national priority of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2030 initiative.

Disparities in trauma care and outcomes have been reported by race and ethnicity, place of residence, age, sex and insurance status, yet few studies have analysed disparities with respect to shifts in mechanisms of injury over time in the USA. With a changing national landscape, there is a clear need to understand the scope of the shift in injury patterns to tailor prevention programmes in the USA. Comprehensive characterisation of the evolution of injury burden and trends both past and present can help researchers, clinicians and public health officials to target prevention and intervention of injury. The objective of this study was to describe temporal trends of traumatic injury over an 8-year period for adult patients by mechanism of injury (MOI), race and ethnicity, age, sex, injury severity and hospital discharge disposition.

### Trends and disparities in firearm deaths among children [^a3f26216]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Firearm deaths among US children and adolescents have steadily increased with widening disparities. In 2020, pediatric firearm deaths increased 28.8%, a staggering surge compared with uptrends in years before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As such, firearms became the leading cause of death among children, surpassing motor vehicle accidents for the first time. Spikes in firearm purchasing during the pandemic were substantial, resulting in roughly 30 million children living in households with firearms, a known risk factor for pediatric firearm injury. In recent years, pediatric firearm deaths from all intents increased, with homicides accounting for the majority, in contrast to adults, where suicide was the main driver.

Disparities across pediatric firearm deaths have been described, particularly with respect to sociodemographic and geographic distribution. The burden of pediatric firearm death has disproportionately affected communities of color. Black children have significantly higher rates of firearm mortalities overall. Males account for nearly 80% of firearm deaths, a steady statistic despite continued increases in overall firearm mortality. Many of these disparate trends are largely accounted for by homicides. Geographically, pediatric firearm deaths are not equally distributed, with previous studies demonstrating a greater burden in Southeastern states, particularly for pediatric firearm homicides. In contrast, firearm suicides are more geographically dispersed, with higher rates observed in Midwest and Western states, and greater impact among white and American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN) children. Additional studies demonstrate clustering of homicides in urban areas and suicides in rural areas. Furthermore, increased firearm mortality rates are correlated with higher poverty levels and lower socioeconomic status, which may contribute to unequal racial, ethnic, and state distributions. Disparate patterns in firearm mortalities have substantial implications, furthering inequities and structural violence in health and economic disadvantage.

### Trends in mortality from poisonings, firearms, and all other injuries by intent in the US, 1999–2020 [^73905a42]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

During the past decade, life expectancy at birth in the US has changed little in contrast to that in other high-income countries, where life expectancy has increased. In 2020, however, life expectancy at birth in the US decreased considerably because of the COVID-19 pandemic. External causes of death, including both intentional and unintentional injury and poisoning (eg, drug overdose) mortality, have contributed substantially to recent decreases in life expectancy. Studies have suggested the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a further increase in deaths from external causes as a result of socioeconomic hardship, psychosocial stress, and reduced access to health care. Nonetheless, changes in demographic trends over time and differences in rates of external causes of death by intent (ie, suicide, homicide, and unintentional) and by sex, age, and race and ethnicity are not fully understood.

In the US, the risk of external causes of deaths varies across sociodemographic characteristics. Although deaths due to firearms and poisoning are increasing nationally, the trends for suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury may differ by age, sex, and race and ethnicity. During the past 2 decades, deaths due to drug overdose have emerged as a major public health concern and had been an important contributor to plateauing US life expectancy before the COVID-19 pandemic. Drug overdose deaths, however, have disproportionally affected White individuals, although recent evidence suggests that rates are increasing among other racial and ethnic groups, such as Black and Hispanic or Latino individuals.

In this study, we describe trends in mortality among adults in the US from 1999 to 2020 for poisonings, firearms, and all other injuries by intent, sex, age, and race and ethnicity. We further evaluated trends in poisoning deaths due to drug overdose and all other injury deaths, including those due to motor vehicle injuries and falls.

### A nationwide analysis of gunshot wounds of the head and neck: morbidity, mortality, and cost [^7cd5ee9c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Gun violence is but a subset of violence in general. In the United States, violent crime (homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) was low in the middle of the 20th century compared with the present. In 1960 there were 160 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This figure steadily increased, until peaking in the early 1990's at 690 per 100,000. There were periods of rapid rise, 83% from 1973 to 1991, which were followed by a decline of 33.6% from 1991 to 2001. This period of decline is most highly correlated with increases in the numbers of police and a significant increase in incarceration rather than an improving economic situation or an increase in gun control laws. More recently, in 2019, there were an estimated 367 violent crimes per 100,000. This 2019 estimate of violent crime total was 0.4% above the 2015 level but 3.8% below the 2010 level. In 2021 this rose to 398.5 per 100,000. In 2019 aggravated assaults accounted for 68.2% of violent crimes reported to law enforcement, robbery 22.3%; rape accounted for 8.2%; and murder accounted for 1.4%. Information collected regarding types of weapons used in violent crimes showed that firearms were used in 73.7% of the nation's murders, 36.4% of robberies, and 27.6% of aggravated assaults. (Weapons data are not collected for rape.) These figures are based on statistics from the FBI Uniform Crime Report.

Looking at homicide alone, the per capita rate 100 years ago was around 5 deaths per 100,000. It remained relatively steady at about 4 to 5 per 100,000 population from 1950 through the mid-1960s, at which point they started rising to a peak of 10.2 per 100,000 population in 1980. From 1980 to 1991, the homicide rate fluctuated between 8 and 10 per 100,000 population. After that, the homicide trend began a large, steady decline. Between 1991 and 2000, homicide rates per capita fell from 9.8 to 5.5 per 100,000.

Arriving at the present, the overall firearm homicide rate increased 34.6%, from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000 people from 2019 to 2020.

### Diversity of trends in occupational injury mortality in the United States, 1980–96 [^b0e2c04e]. Injury Prevention (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although the United States has generally enjoyed declining rates of fatal occupational injury, the rate of decline has not been uniform. To examine the heterogeneity of trends, changes in fatal occupational injury rates from 1980 to 1996 were estimated by occupation, industry, geographic region, and demographic group.

Methods

Deaths due to injury at work during 1980–96 were identified from the US National Traumatic Occupational Fatality database and populations at risk were estimated from the census of population. Mortality rates were computed for unintentional injuries, homicides, and all injuries combined. The annual rate of change was estimated using Poisson regression to model the death rate as a function of time.

Results

The estimated average rates for all fatal occupational injuries and for unintentional injuries declined by 3% per year, while the estimated rate of homicide declined < 1% per year. The improvement was faster for men (3% per year) than for women (< 1% per year) and for younger relative to older workers (7% per year v 2%-3% per year). Trends were also geographically heterogeneous, with the most rapid declines (7%-8% per year) in the South and West. Injury rates for most occupations and industries declined at near the average rate, but some experienced no change or an increase. The rate of homicide also increased in a number of occupations and industries.

Conclusions

Broad downward trends in occupational fatality rates may be explained by several factors, including organized safety efforts, product and process changes, and the ongoing shift of employment toward safer sectors. Disparities in fatal injury trends draw attention to potential opportunities to reduce risk: work settings with increasing injury rates are of particular concern.
