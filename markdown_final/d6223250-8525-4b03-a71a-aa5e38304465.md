## Question

Is methylprednisolone safe in first trimester

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety of methylprednisolone in the first trimester of pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory baseline and what the FDA labeling says. Then, I should verify the specific first-trimester risk signal, especially orofacial clefts, and how strong that evidence is. Next, I will review dose, duration, and formulation nuances, including placental metabolism. After that, I should examine disease-specific contexts where first-trimester use might be justified. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation with monitoring advice and counseling points, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. Methylprednisolone is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category C across oral, parenteral, and depot formulations, indicating that animal studies show fetal risk and there are no adequate and well-controlled human studies; use is acceptable only if benefits outweigh risks, with counseling and neonatal monitoring for adrenal insufficiency if exposure occurs, which sets a conservative default stance in the first trimester [^112mqJCE] [^115dUKfx] [^114nohJ5].

> Wait, let me verify the specific first-trimester concern. The most consistently cited risk is a small increase in orofacial clefts with systemic corticosteroid exposure in early gestation; meta-analytic data suggest roughly a threefold relative increase, translating from about 1 per 1,000 to about 3–5 per 1,000, though estimates are inconsistent across studies and confounded by maternal disease and dose, and more recent large cohorts have not always replicated this signal, so the absolute risk remains low but not negligible [^114Db7wn] [^1117uvoT] [^113Gimjn].

> Hold on, I should verify dose and formulation nuances because they matter. High-dose or prolonged systemic corticosteroids, particularly above about 10–15 mg prednisolone-equivalent daily, are more plausibly associated with cleft risk, whereas short courses at lower doses carry a smaller theoretical risk; importantly, non-fluorinated agents like methylprednisolone and prednisolone undergo placental inactivation by 11β-HSD2, limiting fetal exposure compared with fluorinated agents such as dexamethasone, which are not inactivated and cross the placenta intact, a pharmacologic distinction that supports preferential use of methylprednisolone when systemic steroids are necessary in early pregnancy [^114hNmEy] [^112Xh3AL] [^113CakbL].

> I need to check whether there is direct human data for methylprednisolone in the first trimester. There are no robust, first-trimester-specific randomized trials for methylprednisolone; the most relevant neurodevelopmental data come from children exposed to high-dose methylprednisolone for maternal MS relapses, predominantly in the second trimester, showing no differences in IQ, behavior, or brain structure versus non-exposed controls, which is reassuring but not directly generalizable to first-trimester exposure; thus, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence for early gestation [^115V9osP].

> Next, I should review disease-specific contexts where first-trimester methylprednisolone may be justified despite theoretical risks. For MS relapses, expert guidance supports high-dose methylprednisolone when clinically indicated, even in the first trimester, given maternal morbidity and disability risk, with the understanding that absolute cleft risk appears low and placental metabolism reduces fetal exposure relative to dexamethasone; similarly, in ITP, prednisone or methylprednisolone are first-line in pregnancy, typically at 10–20 mg/day, balancing maternal bleeding risk against low absolute teratogenic risk; for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy refractory to standard therapy, ACOG lists methylprednisolone as a last-resort option with limited duration if effective, acknowledging the cleft signal and the need for shared decision-making [^11373aef] [^112RXoxg] [^117WruYm] [^114nohJ5].

> But wait, what if the indication is not compelling or alternatives exist. I should confirm that routine or elective first-trimester systemic steroid use should be avoided when possible; guidelines for rheumatic diseases recommend tapering to the lowest effective dose, preferably below 20 mg/day prednisone-equivalent, and substituting steroid-sparing agents when feasible; for dermatologic or allergic conditions, topical or local therapy is preferred, and high-potency topical steroids should be minimized; for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, first-line antiemetics should be optimized before considering corticosteroids, reinforcing a hierarchy that reserves systemic steroids for compelling indications [^111w7qrK] [^1126k1za] [^112ibNEi].

> I should double-check neonatal considerations if exposure occurs. Infants exposed to significant maternal corticosteroids should be observed for signs of neonatal adrenal insufficiency and poor weight gain, and mothers should be counseled accordingly; practically, this is more relevant with repeated or high-dose exposures near delivery, but the precaution remains reasonable after any substantial antenatal exposure and should be documented in the delivery plan [^112mqJCE] [^112KJUaw].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Methylprednisolone is not categorically "safe" in the first trimester; there is a small, inconsistent increase in orofacial cleft risk with systemic corticosteroids, likely dose-related, and no definitive first-trimester human safety data for methylprednisolone itself; however, when clinically indicated for specific conditions such as MS relapse, ITP, or refractory hyperemesis, short courses of methylprednisolone at moderate doses can be justified, especially given placental inactivation and the low absolute risk, provided there is informed consent, dose minimization, and avoidance of fluorinated steroids when alternatives suffice [^114Db7wn] [^113Gimjn] [^114hNmEy] [^112Xh3AL].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical guidance is clear. If first-trimester methylprednisolone is used, keep the dose as low as possible, limit duration to the shortest effective course, prefer non-fluorinated formulations, avoid repeat pulses unless absolutely necessary, coordinate obstetric and specialty care, and consider a detailed fetal anatomy ultrasound around 18–20 weeks for reassurance; if the indication is weak or alternatives exist, defer systemic steroids until after the first trimester when feasible, documenting the rationale and counseling the patient about the uncertain but low absolute risk of orofacial clefts and the need for neonatal observation if exposure is significant [^111w7qrK] [^1117uvoT] [^112mqJCE].

Methylprednisolone is **not considered safe in the first trimester** unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. There is a small, inconsistent increase in orofacial clefts with first-trimester systemic corticosteroids, and animal data show fetal harm [^114Db7wn] [^112KJUaw]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, and avoid use for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy unless all other options have failed [^112ibNEi]. If used, discuss risks and monitor the neonate for adrenal insufficiency [^112mqJCE].

---

## Potential risks associated with methylprednisolone use in the first trimester

### Teratogenicity and congenital anomalies

- **Orofacial clefts**: Human studies show a small, inconsistent increase in cleft lip/palate with first-trimester systemic corticosteroids; absolute risk remains low [^114Db7wn] [^113Gimjn].
- **Animal data**: Animal studies report cleft palate, stillbirth, and premature abortion with corticosteroids; human relevance is uncertain but caution is warranted [^114nohJ5] [^112mqJCE].

---

### Maternal and fetal complications

- **Adrenal suppression**: Fetal HPA axis suppression is a concern, especially with prolonged or high-dose use; neonates may require monitoring for adrenal insufficiency [^112mqJCE] [^112KJUaw].
- **Growth restriction**: Intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight have been reported with corticosteroid use, though confounding by maternal disease is possible [^112KJUaw] [^114Db7wn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

### General recommendations

Use methylprednisolone in pregnancy **only if benefits outweigh risks**, employing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112mqJCE] [^111w7qrK]. Avoid routine first-trimester use unless clearly indicated, and use caution in the first trimester because of the possible cleft risk [^112ibNEi] [^114Db7wn].

---

### Specific clinical scenarios

- **Multiple sclerosis relapses**: High-dose methylprednisolone is standard for pregnancy-associated relapses; most exposures occur after the first trimester, and neurodevelopmental outcomes appear reassuring, though first-trimester data are limited [^115V9osP].
- **Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy**: ACOG lists methylprednisolone as a last-line option after failure of other therapies, with limited duration if effective [^114nohJ5].
- **Immune thrombocytopenia**: Prednisone or IVIG are first-line; methylprednisolone may be considered when alternatives are unsuitable, balancing maternal and fetal risks [^117WruYm] [^112RXoxg].

---

## Alternative treatments and precautions

### Alternative corticosteroids

Prednisone and prednisolone are preferred when systemic corticosteroids are needed because of **extensive placental inactivation**, which limits fetal exposure [^116tLsYt] [^112Xh3AL]. Hydrocortisone is preferred for adrenal insufficiency in pregnancy because it is inactivated by the placenta and minimizes fetal exposure [^113CakbL] [^113grpBo].

---

### Precautions and monitoring

- **Dose minimization**: Use the lowest effective dose and taper to < 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent when possible [^111w7qrK] [^114T1Xv8].
- **Neonatal monitoring**: Observe neonates for adrenal insufficiency, especially after prolonged or high-dose maternal corticosteroid use [^112mqJCE] [^112KJUaw].
- **Maternal monitoring**: Monitor for gestational diabetes, hypertension, and infection during therapy [^11762kVa].

## Summary of evidence

| **Risk or outcome** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Orofacial clefts | Small, inconsistent increase with first-trimester systemic corticosteroids; absolute risk low [^112KJUaw] [^113Gimjn] |
| Adrenal suppression | Possible, especially with prolonged/high-dose use; neonatal monitoring recommended [^112mqJCE] [^112KJUaw] |
| Growth restriction | Reported with corticosteroid use, but confounding likely [^112KJUaw] [^114Db7wn] |
| MS relapses | High-dose methylprednisolone is standard; limited first-trimester data [^115V9osP] [^11373aef] |
| Nausea and vomiting | Last-line therapy; avoid routine first-trimester use [^114nohJ5] [^112ibNEi] |

---

Methylprednisolone is **not considered safe in the first trimester** unless clearly indicated; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid routine first-trimester use, and monitor the neonate for adrenal insufficiency.

### Multiple sclerosis relapse treatment during pregnancy and offspring functional and structural neurodevelopment: a cross-sectional study [^115V9osP]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

High-dose methylprednisolone (MP) is the global standard for treating pregnancy-associated relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS). Given that glucocorticoids cross the placenta and may interfere with fetal brain development, concerns remain about their long-term safety. This study assessed whether in utero MP exposure as part of MS relapse therapy affects neurodevelopment in school-aged children.

Methods

In this cross-sectional, 2-center study, term-born children with prenatal exposure to MP due to maternal MS relapse treatment were compared with a nonexposed reference group of children, all born to mothers with MS. Participants were primarily identified using the German MS and Pregnancy Registry and assessed at tertiary MS centers. The primary outcome was global cognitive ability, measured using a standardized intelligence test. Secondary outcomes included attention, behavior, motor performance, and electrocortical activity at rest. Structural brain development was assessed using high-resolution MRI, including voxel-based and surface-based morphometry. Deviations from chronological brain age were quantified using a machine learning–based framework. Statistical associations were examined using linear regression models.

Results

The MP-exposed group (n = 30; mean age 9.6 years; 37% female) and the reference group (n = 30; mean age 10.0 years; 40% female) were comparable with respect to demographic and perinatal characteristics. The median cumulative MP dose was 5 g (Q1–Q3: 3–7.5), predominantly administered during the second trimester. Global IQ did not differ between groups (MP: 103.0; 95% CI: 99.2–106.8 vs reference: 101.5; 95% CI: 97.6–105.3). After correction for multiple comparisons, no group differences emerged in secondary neuropsychological outcomes or electrocortical parameters. MRI analyses revealed no differences in gray matter volume, cortical thickness, gyrification, or chronological brain age.

Discussion

In spite of theoretical concerns that MP exposure during pregnancy might lead to alterations in neurodevelopment, this was not found to be the case in this cohort, with most exposures occurring during the second trimester. However, this study was not powered to detect subtle associations in secondary analyses or to draw definitive conclusions regarding potential dose-response relationships. Given the remaining uncertainties, MP should be used with caution at the lowest effective dose until larger follow-up studies provide further clarity.

### Safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy [^1126k1za]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are topical corticosteroids safe for use in pregnancy?

Bottom Line

The available evidence found no associations of maternal use of topical corticosteroids of any potency with mode of delivery, birth defects, preterm delivery, fetal death, and low Apgar score. However, maternal use of potent to very potent topical corticosteroids, especially when the cumulative dosage of topical corticosteroids throughout the pregnancy is very large, is associated with low birth weight.

### Pharmacokinetics of corticosteroids during pregnancy [^117K3y5X]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids constitute one of the most frequently prescribed medicines during pregnancy. Their use is the mainstay for a variety of maternal and fetal indications, both in acute and chronic settings. The pharmacokinetics of corticosteroids during pregnancy remains poorly understood. Significant pharmacologic alterations occur secondary to the profound changes in the renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems during human gestation. Additional research on this topic is a significant priority to increase therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects for both the mother and fetus when corticosteroids are prescribed during pregnancy. Certain obstetrical conditions such as preeclampsia and multiple gestations are associated with different volumes of distribution and clearance rates of medications, adding further complexity to the therapeutic use of glucocorticoids. This article reviews the available literature, including the most significant physiologic alterations of pregnancy and basic concepts of glucocorticoid pharmacology. Finally, theoretical assumptions about the potential pharmacokinetic changes of glucocorticoids in pregnancy and their application to clinical settings are discussed.

### What we have learned about antenatal corticosteroid regimens [^117F8m9N]. Seminars in Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Administration of antenatal corticosteroids has been standard of care for women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk for preterm delivery for more than 20 years longer in other parts of the world. Although the benefit of steroids in this population has been confirmed, there remain many questions including the frequency of dosing and whether it is possible to expand the gestational age criteria to women likely to deliver before 24 weeks or after 34 weeks. The MFMU Network has played a major role in answering some of these questions.

### Reproductive health after thoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^114Db7wn]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Corticosteroid safety in pregnancy — there is concern for an increased risk of fetal malformations specifically orofacial clefts; a prospective cohort study of prednisone use noted an increased rate of premature delivery and low birth weight but no significant difference in major birth defects between exposed and unexposed groups; a meta-analysis found a 3-fold increased risk of oral clefts with first trimester corticosteroid exposure, though it included studies with any corticosteroids at any dose for any duration. Overall prednisone and prednisolone use during pregnancy appears relatively safe at contemporary dosing in transplantation, recognizing that premature delivery risk with corticosteroids may be dose-related; there is no therapeutic drug monitoring for corticosteroids, dose adjustments are generally not performed due to pregnancy, and there is little evidence of a clinically relevant impact of pregnancy on blood concentration.

### Antenatal corticosteroids: an assessment of anticipated benefits and potential risks [^114dBE2R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Antenatal corticosteroids are standard of care for pregnancies at risk of preterm delivery between 24–34 weeks' gestational age. Recent trials demonstrate modest benefits from antenatal corticosteroids for late preterm and elective cesarean deliveries, and antenatal corticosteroids for periviable deliveries should be considered with family discussion. However, many women with threatened preterm deliveries receive antenatal corticosteroids but do not deliver until > 34 weeks or at term. The net effect is that a substantial fraction of the delivery population will be exposed to antenatal corticosteroids. There are gaps in accurate assessments of benefits of antenatal corticosteroids because the randomized controlled trials were performed prior to about 1990 in pregnancies generally > 28 weeks. The care practices for the mother and infant survival were different than today. The randomized controlled trial data also do not strongly support the optimal interval from antenatal corticosteroid treatment to delivery of 1–7 days. Epidemiology-based studies using large cohorts with > 85% of at-risk pregnancies treated with antenatal corticosteroids probably overestimate the benefits of antenatal corticosteroids. Although most of the prematurity-associated mortality is in low-resource environments, the efficacy and safety of antenatal corticosteroids in those environments remain to be evaluated. The short-term benefits of antenatal corticosteroids for high-risk pregnancies in high-resource environments certainly justify antenatal corticosteroids as few risks have been identified over many years. However, cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities have been identified in large animal models and cohorts of children exposed to antenatal corticosteroids that are consistent with fetal programming for adult diseases. These late effects of antenatal corticosteroids suggest caution for the expanded use of antenatal corticosteroids beyond at-risk pregnancies at 24–34 weeks. A way forward is to develop noninvasive fetal assessments to identify pregnancies across a wider gestational age that could benefit from antenatal corticosteroids.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 475: antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation [^114AZegQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days. A single course of antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to women with premature rupture of membranes before 32 weeks of gestation to reduce the risks of respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal mortality, and other morbidities. The efficacy of corticosteroid use at 32–33 completed weeks of gestation for preterm premature rupture of membranes is unclear, but treatment may be beneficial, particularly if pulmonary immaturity is documented. Sparse data exist on the efficacy of corticosteroid use before fetal age of viability, and such use is not recommended. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids may be considered if the antecedent treatment was given more than 2 weeks prior, the gestational age is less than 32 6/7 weeks, and the women are judged by the clinician to be likely to give birth within the next week. However, regularly scheduled repeat courses or multiple courses (more than two) are not recommended. Further research regarding the risks and benefits, optimal dose, and timing of a single rescue course of steroid treatment is needed.

### Prednisone (Rayos) [^112KJUaw]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Based on findings from human and animal studies, corticosteroids, including RAYOS, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see Data) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. Published epidemiological studies suggest a small but inconsistent increased risk of orofacial clefts with use of corticosteroids during the first trimester. Intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight have also been reported with maternal use of corticosteroids during pregnancy; however, the underlying maternal condition may also contribute to these risks (see Clinical Considerations). Published animal studies show prednisolone to be teratogenic in rats, rabbits, hamsters, and mice with increased incidence of cleft palate in offspring (see Data). Advise a pregnant woman about the potential harm to a fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinical recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Infants born to pregnant women who have received corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypoadrenalism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113CakbL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in pregnancy — monitoring and glucocorticoid recommendations: We suggest that pregnant patients with PAI be monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid over- and under-replacement with at least one review per trimester, and we suggest that, based on the individual clinical course, an increase in hydrocortisone dose should be implemented, in particular during the third trimester. In pregnant women with PAI, we suggest using hydrocortisone over cortisone acetate, prednisolone, or prednisone (2|⊕⊕⊕○) and recommend against using dexamethasone because it is not inactivated in the placenta (1|⊕⊕⊕○). We recommend hydrocortisone stress dosing during the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major surgical stress (1|⊕⊕○○).

### Recurrent miscarriage [^113N449h]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies with the same biological father in the first trimester, and affects 1–2% of women, half of whom have no identifiable cause. Overall, 75% of affected women will have a successful subsequent pregnancy, but this rate falls for older mothers and with increasing number of miscarriages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, with anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant antibodies, is present in 15% of women with recurrent first and second trimester miscarriage.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for unexplained recurrent miscarriage? What are the effects of treatments for recurrent miscarriage caused by antiphospholipid syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aspirin (low dose), bed rest, corticosteroids, early scanning in subsequent pregnancies, heparin plus low-dose aspirin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, lifestyle adaptation, oestrogen, paternal white cell immunisation, progesterone, trophoblastic membrane infusion, and vitamin supplementation.

### Controversies in the use of antenatal steroids for fetal maturation [^111uRH8a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

After decades of caution and reticence, by the early 1990s, the use of antenatal corticosteroids was accepted as a pharmacologic intervention to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with prematurity. Many prospective studies yielded robust evidence to support the use of corticosteroids for fetal maturation. Their use is no longer disputed. Nevertheless, many unanswered questions remain regarding issues such as the ideal dose, drug form, regimen, or timing of treatment. This article explores many of the unanswered questions associated with antenatal corticosteroid use.

Glucocorticoids (budesonide, prednisone) — pregnancy and fertility considerations note potential risks and limited human data. The table includes Prednisone: possible association with oral clefting and Budesonide: may lower fetal exposure. Fertility notes state Budesonide: no effect on fertility in rats; no human data and Prednisone: no increased likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes when used in males of reproductive potential. Supporting text adds that older literature reported a 3.4-fold increased risk of orafacial clefts with first-trimester corticosteroid exposure, but a more recent nationwide cohort study of nearly 52,000 pregnancies with first-trimester exposure showed no increased risk, and advises that the lowest effective dose should be used.

### Corticosteroid guidance for pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic [^112U16Qa]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a necessary, rapid adjustment within the field of obstetrics. Corticosteroid use is a mainstay of therapy for those women delivering prematurely. Unfortunately, corticosteroid use has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. Given this information, it is necessary that obstetricians adjust practice to carefully weigh the fetal benefits with maternal risks. Therefore, our institution has examined the risks and benefits and altered our corticosteroid recommendations. KEY POINTS: · Corticosteroid use is an important part of prematurity treatment because it provides benefit to the fetus. · Corticosteroid use may be related with increased morbidity and mortality in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). · Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an alteration in current corticosteroid practices is necessary to uniquely weigh the maternal risks and fetal benefits.

### Antenatal corticosteroid therapy: current strategies and identifying mediators and markers for response [^114XGc2w]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Landmark early work has led to the nearly universal use of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity with pregnancies complicated by impending preterm birth. Antenatal corticosteroids clearly reduce respiratory morbidity, death, and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Limited pregnant human pharmacokinetic data and some animal data give clinicians some information as to the behavior of the drug in the body. However, there is controversy about the type, amount, and frequency of steroid to use for this therapy. This review article summarizes the history, clinical use, and pharmacology of antenatal steroids. In addition, the review highlights some potential mediators of steroid response and current research strategies aimed at possible optimization of this therapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that systemic corticosteroid use in the first trimester may confer a small increase in the odds of a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate, although data are conflicting, and it is unknown to what extent the underlying maternal disease may contribute. Systemic corticosteroid use in pregnancy does not increase the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, or preeclampsia.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^1167e47b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of prednisolone PO (also known as Orapred ODT, Pediapred) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for signs of hypoadrenalism. Women who become pregnant while using this drug should be apprised of the potential fetal risks. The short-term use of corticosteroids antepartum for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome does not seem to pose a risk to the fetus or newborn infant. Human studies suggest a small but inconsistent increased risk of orofacial clefts with use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy. Intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight have been noted with corticosteroid use, although that may also be attributed to the underlying maternal condition. The drug prednisolone PO (also known as Orapred ODT, Pediapred) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Systematic review of the safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy [^114derDK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnant women may have skin conditions that require topical corticosteroids. However, little is known about their safety in pregnancy.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the available evidence concerning the safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy.

Methods

We systematically searched 17 databases and trial registers, and contacted pharmaceutical companies. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies of topical corticosteroids in pregnant women, and case-control studies comparing maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids between patients and control subjects were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment of included studies.

Results

Seven studies, including two cohort and five case-control studies, were included. Most studies did not find significant associations of topical corticosteroids with congenital abnormality, preterm delivery stillbirth, and mode of delivery. One study found a significant association between first-trimester use of topical corticosteroids and orofacial cleft, and another study found a significant association between very potent topical corticosteroids and low birthweight.

Limitations

The available data were limited and mainly on orofacial cleft. The quality of evidence was generally low.

Conclusions

Currently limited and inconclusive data are unable to detect an association between topical corticosteroids and congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. The current evidence shows no statistically significant difference between pregnant women who use and those who do not use topical corticosteroids. However, there does appear to be an association of very potent topical corticosteroids with low birthweight. Further cohort studies with comprehensive outcome measures, consideration of corticosteroid potency, dosage and indications, and a large sample size are needed.

### ACOG committee opinion. antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [^114ZEVLt]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened consensus conferences in 1994 and 2000 that recommended giving a single course of corticosteroids to all pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days. Because of insufficient scientific evidence, the consensus panel also recommended that repeat corticosteroid courses, including so-called "rescue therapy", should not be routinely used but should be reserved for women enrolled in clinical trials. Betamethasone and dexamethasone have been most widely studied and have generally been the preferred corticosteroids for antenatal treatment to accelerate fetal organ maturation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Obstetric Practice supports the conclusions of the consensus conferences.

### Cancer in pregnancy: FIGO best practice advice and narrative review [^113C9RFw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 Supportive and other treatments

Supportive medical treatment, with or without additional psychological support, is an integral part of cancer management during pregnancy. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and serotonin receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) are commonly used and considered safe during pregnancy. The safety of neurokinin‐1 receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant, has not been established. The use of betamethasone or dexamethasone as premedication is discouraged due to transplacental passage; instead, steroids with minimal placental transfer, such as methylprednisolone, prednisolone, or hydrocortisone, are recommended. Growth factors, including granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor and erythropoietin, are safe during pregnancy. Most analgesics, antacids, antihistamines, and anti‐microbial agents are considered safe and recommended as per non‐pregnancy drug choices, in consultation with the local pharmacy policies. Bone marrow transplant is contraindicated during pregnancy.

4.5 Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Active malignancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of VTE in pregnancy, with the odds of VTE being nearly seven times higher than those in pregnant women without malignancy. Nearly 30% of women who died from cancer in pregnancy in the UK (2000–2022) experienced thrombosis or thromboembolism. All pregnant women with active cancer should be prescribed VTE prophylaxis using LMWH until 6 weeks postpartum, unless contraindicated. Previous studies have recommended initiating prophylaxis in the first trimester if additional risk factors are present. Our recommendations regarding VTE are summarized in the best practice advice table below.

### A growing dilemma: antenatal corticosteroids and long-term consequences [^112vV6B8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

A single course of synthetic antenatal corticosteroids is standard care for women considered to be at risk for preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation. While the intended target is the fetal lung, the fetal brain contains remarkably high levels of glucocorticoid receptors in structures critical in the regulation of behavior and endocrine function. Negative programming signals may occur which can lead to permanent maladaptive changes and predispose the infant/child to an increased risk in physical, mental, and developmental disorders.

Methods

Framed around these areas of concerns for physical, mental, and developmental disorders, this narrative review drew on studies (animal and clinical), evaluating the long-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids to present the case that a more targeted approach to the use of antenatal corticosteroids for the betterment of the fetus urgently needed.

Results

Studies raised concerns about the potential negative long-term consequences, especially for the exposed fetus who was born beyond the period of the greatest benefit from antenatal corticosteroids. The long-term consequences are more subtle in nature and usually manifest later in life, often beyond the scope of most clinical trials.

Conclusion

Continued research is needed to identify sufficient safety data, both short term and long term. Caution in the use of antenatal corticosteroids should be exercised while additional work is undertaken to optimize dosing strategies and better identify women at risk of preterm birth prior to administration of antenatal corticosteroids.

Key Points

· A single-course ACS is a remarkable therapy with substantial benefits. · There is a potential of long-term neurodevelopmental consequences in the ACS-exposed fetus. · There is a need to improve dosing strategies and identification of appropriate at risk women.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^114rMMHE]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

A single course of prenatal corticosteroids given to mothers with anticipated preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation improves survival; reduces RDS, NEC, and IVH; and is not associated with any significant maternal or short-term foetal adverse effects. These favourable results were shown in the 1970s but also in clinical trials performed after 1990, indicating that even with modern neonatal care, prenatal steroids are beneficial. Prenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended in all pregnancies with threatened preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation where active care of the newborn is anticipated. Although there are limited RCT data in babies < 25 weeks of gestation, observational studies suggest that antenatal corticosteroids, together with other active management practices, reduce mortality even down to 22 weeks, and current guidelines have incorporated these data in their recommendations. In pregnancies between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation, prenatal steroids will also reduce risk of short-term respiratory morbidity, but not mortality, and there is increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia; benefits reduce with increasing gestation, whereas the incidence of hypoglycaemia increases. In women in spontaneous preterm labour after 34 weeks, steroid treatment is controversial and not advisable, as exposure is associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse neurocognitive and psychological outcomes. Optimal treatment to delivery interval is more than 24 hours and less than 7 days. Beyond 7–14 days, benefits are diminished. In a cohort study, the beneficial effect of the first dose of antenatal steroids on very preterm infants starts within a day, so advanced dilatation is not a contraindication. There is still debate about whether steroids should be repeated 1 or 2 weeks after the first course for women with threatened preterm labour. A repeat course reduces the risk of needing respiratory support but does not affect mortality or other serious health outcomes and reduces birth weight and head circumference. The WHO recommends that a single repeat course of steroids be considered if preterm birth does not occur within 7 days after the initial course and there is a high risk of preterm birth in the next 7 days. None of the clinical trials showed any improved outcomes when the repeat course had been given after 32 weeks; a single repeat course should therefore be restricted to gestational age < 32 weeks. Most studies showing benefit include mixed populations of singleton and multiple pregnancies, but there are few studies on effects of antenatal corticosteroids focussing exclusively on multiple gestations. Steroids are potent drugs with many unwanted effects. When given appropriately, they improve outcome. If not, then side effects, such as dose-dependent impaired foetal length and head circumference, impaired placental growth, brain apoptosis, and increased infection risk, may prevail. Long-term follow-up of children from trials conducted in the 1970s has been reassuring; however, steroids given after 34 weeks are associated with impaired outcome. Recent data from Finland raise concerns that any prenatal steroid has a negative effect on neurological, cognitive, and behavioural disorders, especially for infants who are born at term. Although these data were obtained from within sib-pair comparisons and logistic regression, they may be biased by the occurrence of preterm contractions, which, in itself, may be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental deficits.

Pregnancy — glucocorticoid use and dosing: Nonfluorinated glucocorticoids should be used when needed, but substitution of steroid-sparing pregnancy-compatible immunosuppressive therapy is desirable when high-dose or prolonged use is required. We conditionally recommend continuing low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (≤ 10 mg daily of prednisone or nonfluorinated equivalent) during pregnancy if clinically indicated. We strongly recommend tapering higher doses of nonfluorinated glucocorticoids to < 20 mg daily of prednisone, adding a pregnancy-compatible glucocorticoid-sparing agent if necessary. Although there are only minimal data regarding prolonged treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids during pregnancy, we conditionally recommend against routine administration of stress-dose glucocorticoids at the time of vaginal delivery, but conditionally do recommend such treatment for surgical (cesarean) delivery.

### Intranasal triamcinolone use during pregnancy and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [^114gH231]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intranasal corticosteroid use during pregnancy has increased over the past decade.

Objective

We aim to estimate the safety of intranasal triamcinolone use during pregnancy, which was introduced for over-the-counter use in October 2013.

Methods

We designed a population-based prospective cohort study. From a cohort of 289,723 pregnancies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from 1998–2008, intranasal triamcinolone-exposed, other intranasal corticosteroid-exposed, and nonexposed women during the first trimester were studied for major congenital malformations (overall and organ specific) and spontaneous abortions and during the second/third trimesters for small-for-gestational age (SGA) newborns. The first trimester is the time window of interest for malformations and spontaneous abortion (organogenesis), and the second/third trimesters are the time windows of interest for SGA (fetal growth). Logistic regression model-based generalized estimating equations were used.

Results

Adjusting for potential confounders, use of intranasal triamcinolone during the first trimester of pregnancy was not significantly associated with the risk of overall congenital malformations (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.60–1.28; 31 exposed cases) compared with nonexposure; however, it was associated with the risk of respiratory defects (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.11–6.64; 5 exposed cases). Pregnancy exposure to intranasal triamcinolone was not significantly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.76–1.43; 50 exposed cases). No association was found between second- or third-trimester exposure to intranasal triamcinolone and the risk of SGA (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79–1.43; 50 exposed cases).

Conclusions

Maternal exposure to intranasal triamcinolone during pregnancy was not associated with the risk of SGA/spontaneous abortions/overall malformations. However, it has been shown to increase the risk of respiratory system defects. Chance finding cannot be ruled out.

### Prednisone (Rayos) [^115QaZsN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.10	Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Prednisone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human studies suggest a small but inconsistent increased risk of orofacial clefts with use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy. Published animal studies show prednisolone to be teratogenic in rats, rabbits, hamsters, and mice with increased incidence of cleft palate in offspring. Intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight have also been reported with corticosteroid use during pregnancy, however, the underlying maternal condition may also contribute to these risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, advise the patient about the potential harm to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11	Neuromuscular Effects

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

5.12	Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.

Reproductive health and liver disease — immunosuppression and monitoring around conception and pregnancy: Delaying conception until liver disease is well controlled on stable doses of immunosuppressants for at least 1 year is suggested. Counseling regarding the potential risks of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is recommended, although these drugs are considered safe in pregnancy and lactation. Prednisone and budesonide are considered low risk in pregnancy and lactation, whereas MPA products are contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. Liver test monitoring during each trimester is suggested, and more frequent monitoring (every 2–4 weeks) is advised for the first 6 months postpartum. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on the use of prenatal corticosteroids to improve outcomes and minimize harm in babies born preterm [^111J7AF2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

For women with a singleton or a multiple pregnancy in situations where active neonatal care is appropriate, and for whom preterm birth is anticipated between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, one course of prenatal corticosteroids should ideally be offered 18 to 72 h before preterm birth is expected to improve outcomes for the baby. However, if preterm birth is expected within 18 h, prenatal corticosteroids should still be administered. One course of corticosteroids includes two doses of betamethasone acetate/phosphate 12 mg IM 24 h apart, or two doses of dexamethasone phosphate 12 mg IM 24 h apart. In women in whom preterm birth is expected within 72 h and who have had one course of corticosteroids more than a week previously, one single additional course of prenatal corticosteroids could be given at risk of imminent delivery. Prenatal corticosteroids should not be offered routinely to women in whom late preterm birth between 34 and 36 weeks is anticipated. In addition, prenatal corticosteroids should not be given routinely before cesarean delivery at term. Neither should prenatal corticosteroids be given "just in case". Instead, prenatal steroid administration should be reserved for women for whom preterm birth is expected within no more than 7 days, based on the woman's symptoms or an accurate predictive test.

### Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes [^1156uipU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) are at risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and need for respiratory support due to lung immaturity. One course of prenatal corticosteroids, administered to women at risk of preterm birth, reduces the risk of respiratory morbidity and improves survival of their infants, but these benefits do not extend beyond seven days. Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids have been used for women at ongoing risk of preterm birth more than seven days after their first course of corticosteroids, with improvements in respiratory outcomes, but uncertainty remains about any long-term benefits and harms. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety, using the best available evidence, of a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids, given to women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with the primary aim of reducing fetal and neonatal mortality and morbidity.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, including cluster-randomised trials, of women who had already received one course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and were still at risk of preterm birth, randomised to further dose(s) or no repeat doses, with or without placebo. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded. Abstracts were accepted if they met specific criteria. All trials had to meet criteria for trustworthiness, including a search of the Retraction Watch database for retractions or expressions of concern about the trials or their publications.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial quality and scientific integrity. We chose primary outcomes based on clinical importance as measures of effectiveness and safety, including serious outcomes, for the women and their fetuses/infants, infants in early childhood (age two to less than five years), the infant in mid- to late childhood (age five to less than 18 years) and the infant as an adult. We assessed risk of bias at the outcome level using the RoB 2 tool and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (4895 women and 5975 babies). High-certainty evidence from these trials indicated that treatment of women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroids, compared with no repeat corticosteroid treatment, reduced the risk of their infants experiencing the primary infant outcome of RDS (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.90; 3540 babies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 16, 95% CI 11 to 29) and had little or no effect on chronic lung disease (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.22; 5661 babies). Moderate-certainty evidence indicated that the composite of serious infant outcomes was probably reduced with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroids (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; 9 trials, 5736 babies; NNTB 39, 95% CI 24 to 158), as was severe lung disease (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; NNTB 45, 95% CI 27 to 256; 4955 babies). Moderate-certainty evidence could not exclude benefit or harm for fetal or neonatal or infant death less than one year of age (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; 5849 babies), severe intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.86; 5066 babies) and necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.22; 5736 babies). In women, moderate-certainty evidence found little or no effect on the likelihood of a caesarean birth (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; 4266 mothers). Benefit or harm could not be excluded for maternal death (RR 0.32, 95% 0.01 to 7.81; 437 women) and maternal sepsis (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.39; 4666 mothers). The evidence was unclear for risk of adverse effects and discontinuation of therapy due to maternal adverse effects. No trials reported breastfeeding status at hospital discharge or risk of admission to the intensive care unit. At early childhood follow-up, moderate- to high-certainty evidence identified little or no effect of exposure to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with no repeat corticosteroids for primary outcomes relating to neurodevelopment (neurodevelopmental impairment: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10; 3616 children), survival without neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 3845 children) and survival without major neurodevelopmental impairment (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.05; 1816 children). An increase or decrease in the risk of death since randomisation could not be excluded (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.40; 5 trials, 4565 babies randomised). At mid-childhood follow-up, moderate-certainty evidence identified little or no effect of exposure to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with no repeat corticosteroids on survival free of neurocognitive impairment (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; 963 children) or survival free of major neurocognitive impairment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.04; 2682 children). Benefit or harm could not be excluded for death since randomisation (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.26; 2874 babies randomised) and any neurocognitive impairment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.29; 897 children). No trials reported data for follow-up into adolescence or adulthood. Risk of bias across outcomes was generally low although there were some concerns of bias. For childhood follow-up, most outcomes had some concerns of risk of bias due to missing data from loss to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefits for babies included less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth with repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm for the women or child in early and mid-childhood, although no benefit. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the baby into adulthood.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^115eh2N7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticosteroids

For severe cases of recalcitrant pruritus, short-term systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids may be considered. Prednisolone 0.5–2 mg/kg/day is the corticosteroid of choice in pregnancy. Oral steroids should be used with caution in the first trimester of pregnancy because of the unclear association with orofacial clefts. Although some studies suggested that the use of glucocorticosteroids in pregnancy might be associated with lower birth body weight, single treatments of medium to high doses of glucocorticosteroids in the third trimester did not affect body size or cardiovascular risk factors of the offspring in long-term follow-up. During pregnancy, long-term use of glucocorticosteroids may also increase the risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and even membrane rupture and preterm delivery.

Other Immunosuppressive Agents

In cases not responding to phototherapy and requiring prolonged courses of systemic glucocorticosteroids, steroid-sparing agents, such as cyclosporine (FDA pregnancy category C) or azathioprine (FDA pregnancy category D) should be considered. When initiating cyclosporine A, the minimal possible dose should be used, and maternal blood pressure and renal function should be monitored closely. Data on the use of cyclosporine in dermatological conditions in pregnancy are sparse and are primarily derived from organ transplant recipients. The teratogenic risk among the offspring appears to be low, even though lower body weight in infants and premature labor have been reported. However, all these events might be associated with the patients' medical conditions rather than with the drug itself. Azathioprine is considered relatively safe in pregnancy and has not been linked with teratogenicity. Data on the usage of azathioprine in pregnancy come mostly from studies of transplant recipients and patients with Crohn disease. In these groups, higher rates of pregnancy complications (low birth weight, prematurity, and jaundice) have been reported. Analysis of the Swedish Medical Birth Register has indicated a possibility of a moderately increased risk of congenital malformations, specifically ventricular/atrial septal defects, and a higher risk of growth restriction and preterm delivery in infants exposed to azathioprine during early pregnancy.

### Committee opinion no.677: antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation [^111u43cb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid administration before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important antenatal therapies available to improve newborn outcomes. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation, including for those with ruptured membranes and multiple gestations. It also may be considered for pregnant women starting at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, based on a family's decision regarding resuscitation, irrespective of membrane rupture status and regardless of fetal number. Administration of betamethasone may be considered in pregnant women between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation at imminent risk of preterm birth within 7 days, and who have not received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids. A single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered in women who are less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation who have an imminent risk of preterm delivery within the next 7 days, and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously. Rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose, if indicated by the clinical scenario. Continued surveillance of long-term outcomes after in utero corticosteroid exposure should be supported. Quality improvement strategies to optimize appropriate and timely antenatal corticosteroid administration are encouraged.

### Safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy [^117CorHP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are the most frequently prescribed dermatological treatment and are frequently used by pregnant women with skin conditions. However, little is known about their safety in pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical corticosteroids on pregnancy outcomes.

Search Strategy

On 5th May 2009 we searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 2003), and EMBASE (from 2005). We searched LILACS, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, SCI-EXPANDED, BIOSIS Previews, Conference Papers Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science from inception to May 2009. We scanned the bibliographies of the included studies, published reviews, and articles that had cited the included studies. Pharmaceutical companies that have introduced an original topical corticosteroid product were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies of topical corticosteroids in pregnant women, and case-control studies comparing maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids between cases and controls were included where outcomes were those we had pre-specified. Outcomes included mode of delivery, congenital abnormality, birthweight, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and low Apgar score.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied selection criteria, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

Main Results

Seven studies, including 2 cohort and 5 case-control studies, of 659,675 participants were included. We did not undertake a meta-analysis due to considerable methodological heterogeneity. The available data was limited and mainly on orofacial cleft. Most studies did not find significant associations between topical corticosteroids and pregnancy outcomes including mode of delivery, congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. One study found a significant association between first trimester topical corticosteroid use and orofacial cleft, and another found a significant association between very potent topical corticosteroids and low birthweight. Nevertheless, all the studies had drawbacks, and the quality of evidence was low to very low.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently limited and inconclusive data are unable to detect an association between topical corticosteroids and congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. The current evidence shows no statistically significant difference between pregnant women who use and those who do not use topical corticosteroids. However, there does appear to be an association of very potent topical corticosteroids with low birthweight. Cohort studies with comprehensive outcome measures, assessment of effects of corticosteroid potency and dose, application methods, and reasons for giving them, and a very large sample size are needed.

### Methylprednisolone acetate (hybrisil) [^111D4NTd]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Pregnancy Category C

Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients in large amounts or for prolonged periods of time.

### Corticosteroids in the management of pregnant patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [^117NCBh2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence supports the use of an early, short course of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation or oxygen support. As the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases continues to increase, the number of pregnant women with the disease is very likely to increase as well. Because pregnant women are at increased risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation support, obstetricians will be facing the dilemma of initiating maternal corticosteroid therapy while weighing its potential adverse effects on the fetus (or neonate if the patient is postpartum and breastfeeding). Our objective is to summarize the current evidence supporting steroid therapy in the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19 and to elaborate on key modifications for the pregnant patient.

### Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes [^113TpUJm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It has been unclear whether repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids are beneficial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 January 2015), searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted authors for further data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of women who had already received a single course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and considered still at risk of preterm birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality and extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included 10 trials (a total of 4733 women and 5700 babies) with low to moderate risk of bias. Treatment of women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with repeat dose(s), compared with no repeat corticosteroid treatment, reduced the risk of their infants experiencing the primary outcomes respiratory distress syndrome (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.91, eight trials, 3206 infants, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 17, 95% CI 11 to 32) and serious infant outcome (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, seven trials, 5094 infants, NNTB 30, 95% CI 19 to 79). Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in mean birthweight (mean difference (MD) -75.79 g, 95% CI -117.63 to -33.96, nine trials, 5626 infants). However, outcomes that adjusted birthweight for gestational age (birthweight Z scores, birthweight multiples of the median and small-for-gestational age) did not differ between treatment groups. At early childhood follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen for infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with unexposed infants for the primary outcomes (total deaths; survival free of any disability or major disability; disability; or serious outcome) or in the secondary outcome growth assessments. In women, for the two primary outcomes, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis, and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged.

Authors' Conclusions

The short-term benefits for babies of less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. These benefits were associated with a small reduction in size at birth. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm in early childhood, although no benefit. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the woman and baby. Individual patient data meta-analysis may clarify how to maximise benefit and minimise harm.

Regarding the use of amcinonide TOP in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on the teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Fetal growth restriction and a significantly increased risk of low birthweight has been reported with use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids during the third trimester, particularly when using more than 300 grams.

### Romiplostim use in pregnant women with immune thrombocytopenia [^113LTaQD]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Two treatments for ITP during pregnancy are widely used and accepted: prednisone and IVIg. The efficacy and limitations of these treatments are well known. When treatment beyond these agents is required in pregnancy, the treatments which have been most commonly employed are rituximab, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. These agents may be considered to have an "acceptable" risk of toxicity, but information on their efficacy is limited and they are characterized by a slow onset of effect. Providing an additional treatment option for pregnant women with ITP would be helpful.

The PSP assessed pregnancy and birth outcomes from 186 cases of maternal romiplostim exposure. Due to the reactive, retrospective nature of pharmacovigilance data, information was incomplete and available only for approximately half of the patients for pregnancy (46%) and birth (49%) outcomes. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes were reported in slightly more than half of women with available data, albeit the majority of abnormal outcomes were caused by maternal thrombocytopenia from the underlying ITP. This was very likely related to the selection of women to receive romiplostim during pregnancy being heavily weighted towards those with difficult‐to‐manage ITP. Overall, approximately one‐third of known birth outcomes were considered abnormal; abnormal pregnancies were associated with approximately 4/5 of reported abnormal birth outcomes. The great majority of these abnormal birth outcomes fell into two categories: spontaneous miscarriages and term and preterm births with neonatal thrombocytopenia.

While timing details of romiplostim administration were not fully available, based on findings from this dataset and knowledge of treating pregnant patients with ITP, we believe that romiplostim exposures fell primarily into three settings: (1) a woman became pregnant while receiving romiplostim for ITP, (2) romiplostim was initiated in the third trimester to manage difficult ITP during pregnancy, and (3) romiplostim was given to allow epidural anesthesia and/or prevent bleeding during delivery. The use of romiplostim in the first trimester only in over 60 women reflects participants who became pregnant while receiving romiplostim and subsequently discontinued romiplostim. Presumably the individual risk–benefit assessment of the patient's hematologist tilted towards romiplostim for the 22 participants receiving romiplostim in the second trimester, eight of whom received romiplostim in the second trimester only. In the other 14, romiplostim exposure could have either been continuous from the first trimester or continued past the end of the second trimester to manage thrombocytopenia in the third trimester.

### Burden of malaria in early pregnancy: a neglected problem? [^114qNN8e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

According to the current World Health Organization guidelines, the drug prevention of malaria during pregnancy does not adequately cover the first trimester of gestation in high-transmission areas. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms of early infections are not completely understood yet, a review of the most recent studies on the topic suggests that their consequences are serious in terms of maternal anemia and low birth weight. Consequently, there is a need to focus on the awareness of women in a period hard to access, to develop safe drugs to be used in the first trimester, and to consider preconceptional interventions in teenage girls, such as a new malaria vaccine to be used in pregnancy.

### Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease [^115XAz6M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is not clear whether there is benefit in repeating the dose of prenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth after an initial course.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1965 to November 2006), EMBASE (1988 to November 2006) and Current Contents (1997 to November 2006).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of women who have already received a single course of corticosteroids seven or more days previously and are still considered to be at risk of preterm birth; outcomes compared for women randomised to receive a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids, with women given no further prenatal corticosteroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed trial quality and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Five trials, involving over 2000 women between 23 and 33 weeks' gestation, are included. Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in occurrence (relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.93, four trials, 2155 infants) and severity of any neonatal lung disease (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75, three trials, 2139 infants) and serious infant morbidity (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.93, four trials, 2157 infants). Mean birthweight was not significantly different between treatment groups (weighted mean difference (WMD) -62.07 g, 95% CI -129.10 to 4.96, four trials, 2273 infants), although in one trial, treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in birthweight Z score (WMD) -0.13, 95% CI -26 to 0.00, 1 trial, 1144 infants), and in two trials, with an increased risk of being small for gestational age at birth (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.37, two trials, 602 infants). No statistically significant differences were seen for any of the other primary outcomes that included other measures of respiratory morbidity, fetal and neonatal mortality, periventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia and maternal infectious morbidity. Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a significantly increased risk of caesarean section (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.22, four trials, 1523 women).

Authors' Conclusions

Repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids reduce the occurrence and severity of neonatal lung disease and the risk of serious health problems in the first few weeks of life. These short-term benefits for babies support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth. However, these benefits are associated with a reduction in some measures of weight, and head circumference at birth, and there is still insufficient evidence on the longer-term benefits and risks.

### COPP-MS: COrticosteroids during the post-partum in relapsing multiple sclerosis patients [^111NavTq]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

No specific treatment has demonstrated its effectiveness to prevent post-partum relapses for multiple sclerosis (MS) women.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of preventive high-dose corticosteroids in the post-partum period by comparing two strategies: (1) no preventive treatment and (2) standardized preventive treatment.

Methods

We selected five French Multiple Sclerosis centers using the same post-partum strategy for their patients-either high-dose steroids (treating centers TC) or no treatment (non-treating centers NTC). We included relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis women who delivered between January 2007 and January 2017. Our primary outcomes were the time from delivery to first relapse, EDSS progression and MRI activity between patients of treating centers and non-treating centers, after propensity-score weighting.

Results

350 patients were included (116 from treating centers, 234 from non-treating centers). For both groups, the annualized relapse rate decreased during pregnancy (0.28 in treating centers and 0.34 in non-treating centers during the third trimester) and increased during the first post-partum trimester (0.45 and 0.69, respectively) with 11% and 14% (NS) of patients facing at least one relapse, respectively. Our primary outcomes were not statistically different between both groups.

Conclusion

This study provides class III evidence that systematic high-dose corticosteroids are not associated with a reduced inflammatory activity during the post-partum period in multiple sclerosis patients.

### Committee opinion no. 713 summary: antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation [^111SXf2S]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid administration before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important antenatal therapies available to improve newborn outcomes. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, including for those with ruptured membranes and multiple gestations. It also may be considered for pregnant women starting at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, based on a family's decision regarding resuscitation, irrespective of membrane rupture status and regardless of fetal number. Administration of betamethasone may be considered in pregnant women between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm birth within 7 days, and who have not received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids. A single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered in women who are less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously. Rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose, if indicated by the clinical scenario. Continued surveillance of long-term outcomes after in utero corticosteroid exposure should be supported. Quality improvement strategies to optimize appropriate and timely antenatal corticosteroid administration are encouraged.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^112Xh3AL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids

After 14 weeks of gestation, administration of a number of chemotherapy drugs is feasible, but some of the most widely used, like platinum derivatives, taxanes and etoposide present considerable incidence of infusion reactions. In order to manage or to avoid such predicaments, glucocorticoids have been instated as an essential component of chemotherapy premedication.

Nonetheless, glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics and pharmakodynamics should be taken into account, as fluorinated agents like betamethasone and dexamethasone readily cross the placenta, while non-fluorinated forms like prednisolone, methylprednisolone and prednisone are converted to inactive metabolites by placental 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, with fetal uptake being limited further by active retrograde transport through P-glycoprotein.

Rheumatic diseases, adrenal insufficiency, asthma and prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome are just a few cases in which glucocorticoids are administered to pregnant women and thus, adequate data about their behavior during pregnancy has been amassed. However, despite the indisputable benefits that these drugs offer, there are some concerns that should be taken into consideration.

There is suspicion about the potential correlation between continuous antenatal exposure to glucocorticoids and adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal morbidity. Evidence from experiments on rodents and an older study suggest that there is a statistically significant increase in orofacial clefts when exposure has occurred during the first trimester, but in stark contrast to them, recent findings do not confirm this link. Moreover, data from pregnant patients with asthma on oral glucocorticoids indicate increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Furthermore, in utero exposure to glucocorticoids has been associated with raised risk of premature rupture of the membranes and fetal growth restriction, while on the mother's side, the chance of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, osteoporosis, and infection seems elevated. In addition, prenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia with dexamethasone may be linked to a negative effect on the executive functions of the offspring, but this effect is not well-established.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116eosMw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in pregnancy — women in their first trimester with PCP still should be treated with TMP-SMX because of its considerable benefit (AIII), and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy should be used for moderate-to-severe disease defined by room air PO2 < 70 mm Hg or PAO2 - PaO2 > 35 mm Hg, with corticosteroids given as early as possible. Folic acid supplementation at 0.4 mg/day is routinely recommended for all pregnant women, and although higher levels (e.g., 4 mg/day) lack trial evidence for reducing first-trimester TMP-SMX–associated risks in women with HIV, a large case-control study reported that among women receiving folic acid 6 mg/day the increased odds of congenital cardiovascular anomalies were not seen (odds ratio [OR] 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94–1.62), and for multiple congenital abnormalities the OR decreased from 6.4 without folic acid to 1.9 with folic acid. Based on these findings, clinicians can consider giving supplemental folic acid (> 0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) to women in their first trimester who are on TMP-SMX (BIII), but adding folinic acid to TMP-SMX treatment for PCP was associated with an increased risk of therapeutic failure and death, with case reports also describing failure of TMP-SMX prophylaxis with concurrent folinic acid. If supplemental folic acid (> 0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) is given, its use should be limited to the first trimester during the teratogenic window (AIII), and a follow-up ultrasound is recommended at 18 weeks to 20 weeks to assess fetal anatomy (BIII). Maternal glucose levels should be monitored closely in the third trimester because the risk of glucose intolerance is increased (AIII), and women receiving 20 mg/day of prednisone for > 3 weeks may have hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression such that use of stress-dose corticosteroids during delivery should be considered (BIII). For mild-to-moderate disease, alternative regimens include dapsone and TMP, primaquine plus clindamycin, atovaquone suspension, and IV pentamidine; dapsone appears to cross the placenta and, although used safely in pregnancy for other indications, long-term therapy is associated with a risk of mild maternal hemolysis and poses a potential risk (albeit extremely low) of acute hemolytic anemia to fetuses with G6PD deficiency, while clindamycin is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category B medication considered safe for use throughout pregnancy.

### Antenatal dexamethasone for late preterm birth: a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial [^113gtrrt]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While this trial is underpowered to detect differences, additional considerations that may impact efficacy include the number of doses administered and duration of fetal exposure prior to birth. The study protocol specified that randomized women were eligible for a maximum of four doses, though more than 40% of randomized women delivered after receiving a single dose. Comparatively, the ALPS trial used a regimen of two IM injections of 12 mg betamethasone or placebo 24 h apart, and reported a reduction in the primary outcome with 59.6% of women receiving a full course (i.e. 2 doses) and 40.2% of women receiving a single dose. The minimum time required for corticosteroids to have a clinically significant effects in late preterm infants is not yet clearly delineated. Animal studies suggest that fetal lung changes are detectable within 12 h of corticosteroid exposure, and a 2020 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of 48 non-pregnant, healthy women reported that 6 mg of IM or oral dexamethasone reached maximum concentration in a median of 3 h with a half-life of 5.2 h. The WHO ACTION-I trial, which demonstrated the clinical benefits of dexamethasone administered in the early preterm period in low-resource countries, also found that increasing time from first dose to birth increased benefit. Additionally, approximately 10% of babies in the current trial were born after 37 weeks – these more mature babies are at considerably lower risk of mortality and respiratory morbidity. These factors may have contributed to the lack of clinical benefit identified. Future efficacy trials of late preterm corticosteroids need to carefully balance the need for enroling women at risk of imminent preterm birth against the time and number of doses required to have clinical effects.

The role of ACS in the late preterm period remains an important clinical and public health question as more than 12 million preterm babies are born after 32 weeks' gestation worldwide, with significantly higher rates of mortality and morbidity than term babies. There is also variation amongst national guidelines on whether to use ACS in the late preterm period, though it is not standard practice in India where the trial was conducted. For example, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology advise that ACS be considered for women in the late preterm period, whereas the Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Canada guidelines indicate that they should not be used routinely, as, the balance of risks and benefits from 35 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 6 days favours their use only in selected clinical situations.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^114L7UUy]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

How should CSU be managed during pregnancy and lactation?

During pregnancy, urticaria should be controlled using the minimum level of medication that is effective. The use of H 1 -antihistamines (preferably second-generation) should be considered as the first therapeutic step. However, no H 1 -antihistamine agent is in category A regarding safety in pregnancy. Category B of safety in pregnancy has been assigned to loratadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine and chlorpheniramine. Hydroxyzine is the only antihistaminic drug that is contraindicated in pregnancy, as specifically mentioned in the product's specifications.

Lactation could also pose a challenge to treat CSU. During lactation, loratadine and cetirizine are the only H 1 -antihistamines recommended for use. The minimum possible dose of H 1 -antihistamines and the shortest duration of treatment should be used, but only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. H 1 -antihistamine is excreted in breast milk. Chlorpheniramine can cause sedation and poor feeding in babies so should be avoided.

As it is the case in rheumatologic diseases or asthma, in CSU systemic corticosteroids may be administered in pregnancy but only at the lowest possible doses and for the minimum period of time due to potential areas of concern, including congenital malformations during the first trimester of pregnancy, neonatal adrenal insufficiency and low birthweight. However, the absolute risk is low. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids have the potential risk of inducing hypertension, gestational diabetes and preterm delivery due to the premature rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids appear to be safe for nursing infants because of low levels in breast milk. The concentrations in breast milk are generally 5–25% of maternal serum levels, with rapid and bi-directional exchange between the serum and breast milk. When high doses are required, it is reasonable to delay breastfeeding for up to 4 h after each dose of steroids. Prolonged treatments and high doses of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.

Key point: During pregnancy and lactation antihistamines, labelled as B category should be used as first-line therapy in urticaria, using the minimum level of medication that is effective.

### Different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for babies at risk of preterm birth [^115aHXgp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the widespread use of antenatal corticosteroids to prevent respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants, there is currently no consensus as to the type of corticosteroid to use, dose, frequency, timing of use or the route of administration. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, on maternal morbidity and mortality, and on the child and adult in later life, of administering different types of corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone), or different corticosteroid dose regimens, including timing, frequency and mode of administration.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (9 May 2022) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all identified published and unpublished randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any two corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone or any other corticosteroid that can cross the placenta), comparing different dose regimens (including frequency and timing of administration) in women at risk of preterm birth. We planned to exclude cross-over trials and cluster-randomised trials. We planned to include studies published as abstracts only along with studies published as full-text manuscripts.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (2494 women and 2762 infants) in this update, all of which recruited women who were at increased risk of preterm birth or had a medical indication for preterm birth. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Dexamethasone versus betamethasone Nine trials (2096 women and 2319 infants) compared dexamethasone versus betamethasone. All trials administered both drugs intramuscularly, and the total dose in the course was consistent (22.8 mg or 24 mg), but the regimen varied. We assessed one new study to have no serious risk of bias concerns for most outcomes, but other studies were at moderate (six trials) or high (two trials) risk of bias due to selection, detection and attrition bias. Our GRADE assessments ranged between high- and low-certainty, with downgrades due to risk of bias and imprecision. Maternal outcomes The only maternal primary outcome reported was chorioamnionitis (death and puerperal sepsis were not reported). Although the rate of chorioamnionitis was lower with dexamethasone, we did not find conclusive evidence of a difference between the two drugs (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 1.06; 1 trial, 1346 women; moderate-certainty evidence). The proportion of women experiencing maternal adverse effects of therapy was lower with dexamethasone; however, there was not conclusive evidence of a difference between interventions (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13; 2 trials, 1705 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Infant outcomes We are unsure whether the choice of drug makes a difference to the risk of any known death after randomisation, because the 95% CI was compatible with both appreciable benefit and harm with dexamethasone (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63; 5 trials, 2105 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). The choice of drug may make little or no difference to the risk of RDS (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22; 5 trials, 2105 infants; high-certainty evidence). While there may be little or no difference in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), there was substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity in this result (average (a) RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.81; 4 trials, 1902 infants; I² = 62%; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference between the two drugs for chronic lung disease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; 1 trial, 1509 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we are unsure of the effects on necrotising enterocolitis, because there were few events in the studies reporting this outcome (RR 5.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.15; 2 studies, 441 infants; low-certainty evidence). Longer-term child outcomes Only one trial consistently followed up children longer term, reporting at two years' adjusted age. There is probably little or no difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone in the risk of neurodevelopmental disability at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.22; 2 trials, 1151 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether the choice of drug makes a difference to the risk of visual impairment (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.15; 1 trial, 1227 children; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the drugs for hearing impairment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.16; 1 trial, 1227 children; moderate-certainty evidence), motor developmental delay (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.20; 1 trial, 1166 children; moderate-certainty evidence) or intellectual impairment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20; 1 trial, 1161 children; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the effect estimate for cerebral palsy is compatible with both an important increase in risk with dexamethasone, and no difference between interventions (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.39; 1 trial, 1223 children; low-certainty evidence). No trials followed the children beyond early childhood. Comparisons of different preparations and regimens of corticosteroids We found three studies that included a comparison of a different regimen or preparation of either dexamethasone or betamethasone (oral dexamethasone 32 mg versus intramuscular dexamethasone 24 mg; betamethasone acetate plus phosphate versus betamethasone phosphate; 12-hourly betamethasone versus 24-hourly betamethasone). The certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes from all three studies was very low, due to small sample size and risk of bias. Therefore, we were limited in our ability to draw conclusions from any of these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, it remains unclear whether there are important differences between dexamethasone and betamethasone, or between one regimen and another. Most trials compared dexamethasone versus betamethasone. While for most infant and early childhood outcomes there may be no difference between these drugs, for several important outcomes for the mother, infant and child the evidence was inconclusive and did not rule out significant benefits or harms. The evidence on different antenatal corticosteroid regimens was sparse, and does not support the use of one particular corticosteroid regimen over another.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^112ArZmf]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

MG in pregnancy.

1. Planning for pregnancy should be instituted well in advance to allow time for optimization of myasthenic clinical status and to minimize risks to the fetus.
2. Multidisciplinary communication among relevant specialists should occur throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and in the postpartum period.
3. Provided that their myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy, the majority of women can be reassured that they will remain stable throughout pregnancy. If worsening occurs, it may be more likely during the first few months after delivery.
4. Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment during pregnancy. IV ChEIs may produce uterine contractions and should not be used during pregnancy.
5. Thymectomy should be postponed until after pregnancy as benefit is unlikely to occur during pregnancy.
6. Chest CT without contrast can be performed safely during pregnancy, although the risks of radiation to the fetus need to be carefully considered. Unless there is a compelling indication, postponement of diagnostic CT until after delivery is preferable.
7. Prednisone is the IS agent of choice during pregnancy.
8. Current information indicates that azathioprine and cyclosporine are relatively safe in expectant mothers who are not satisfactorily controlled with or cannot tolerate corticosteroids. Current evidence indicates that mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate increase the risk of teratogenicity and are contraindicated during pregnancy. (These agents previously carried Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Category C (cyclosporine), D (azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil), and X (methotrexate) ratings. The FDA has recently discontinued this rating system, and replaced it with a summary of the risks of using a drug during pregnancy and breastfeeding, along with supporting data and "relevant information to help health care providers make prescribing and counseling decisions").
Although this statement achieved consensus, there was a strong minority opinion against the use of azathioprine in pregnancy. Azathioprine is the nonsteroidal IS of choice for MG in pregnancy in Europe but is considered high risk in the United States. This difference is based on a small number of animal studies and case reports.
9. PLEX or IVIg are useful when a prompt, although temporary, response is required during pregnancy. Careful consideration of both maternal and fetal issues, weighing the risks of these treatments against the requirement for use during pregnancy and their potential benefits, is required.
10. Spontaneous vaginal delivery should be the objective and is actively encouraged.
11. Magnesium sulfate is not recommended for management of eclampsia in MG because of its neuromuscular blocking effects; barbiturates or phenytoin usually provide adequate treatment.
12. All babies born to myasthenic mothers should be examined for evidence of transient myasthenic weakness, even if the mother's myasthenia is well-controlled, and should have rapid access to neonatal critical care support.

### Multiple sclerosis relapse treatment during pregnancy and offspring functional and structural neurodevelopment: a cross-sectional study [^116E3wMR]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) presents unique clinical challenges that require careful consideration of both maternal and fetal well-being. Choosing an appropriate MS therapy during pregnancy is critical because modern disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) often lack comprehensive pregnancy-related safety data, and some are known to have teratogenic effects. Although growing evidence supports the continued use of certain highly effective DMTs during pregnancy, such as natalizumab, it remains a common clinical practice to discontinue DMTs around conception or to switch to less effective but pregnancy-approved agents, such as glatiramer acetate or interferon β. Although this approach reduces fetal risk, it can increase the likelihood of pregnancy-associated relapses estimated to occur at a rate of 1% per month.

To manage relapses, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy is recommended by MS guidelines and is generally considered safe for the fetus. However, because glucocorticoids can cross the placenta, they may affect fetal brain development by promoting maturation at the expense of cell division. Previous studies have shown that prenatal exposure to synthetic corticosteroids, such as betamethasone used for fetal lung maturation, can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental consequences, including a reduced IQ, behavioral disturbances, altered electrocortical activity, and decreased cortical thickness. Notably, the dosage of corticosteroids for treating MS relapses is up to 50-fold higher than the doses used in obstetric settings.

Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids for MS relapse management during pregnancy, no studies have investigated the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of children prenatally exposed to this treatment. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating neurocognitive and electrocortical outcomes, as well as neuroimaging-derived biomarkers of structural brain development in school-aged children exposed to the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (MP) as part of maternal MS relapse therapy. Our primary hypothesis was that prenatal exposure to MP would be associated with lower IQ scores compared with a nonexposed reference group. Secondary outcomes included additional cognitive performance markers, behavior, motor development, and electrocortical markers of functional brain maturation. Structural brain development was assessed using high-resolution MRI, incorporating voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter volume, surface-based morphometry (SBM) of cortical thickness and gyrification, and deviations from biological brain aging quantified by the machine learning-based BrainAGE score.

### Australasian randomised trial to evaluate the role of maternal intramuscular dexamethasone versus betamethasone prior to preterm birth to increase survival free of childhood neurosensory disability (A*STEROID): study protocol [^111mqZqx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Children born preterm have a higher than average risk of dying in the first weeks of life and survivors experience higher rates of neurosensory disability than children born at term. There is clear evidence that antenatal corticosteroids, both dexamethasone and betamethasone, given to women at risk of preterm birth substantially improve short-term neonatal health, increase the chance of the baby being discharged home alive, and reduce childhood neurosensory disability, remaining safe into adulthood. The type of antenatal corticosteroid to use in clinical practice remains unclear. Dexamethasone and betamethasone are both recommended and widely used.

Is dexamethasone better than betamethasone, or vice versa? Our meta-analysis, using the limited data available from randomised trials that have directly compared the two treatments shows that dexamethasone reduces the risk of the baby developing intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) to a greater extent than betamethasone. While reduced IVH is a very important outcome, achieving a reduction in long-term survival free of any disability is the most important goal. Data regarding the effects on long-term health are sparse.

Preterm birth and antenatal corticosteroids

One of the major advances in maternal fetal medicine over the last 35 years has been the evaluation and implementation into clinical practice of administration of antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth. Corticosteroids remain the 'gold standard' antenatal intervention to reduce the risk of fetal and neonatal mortality related to preterm birth.

Meta-analysis of the 21 randomised trials (14 using betamethasone, six using dexamethasone, one unknown, using a wide range of different treatment regimens, in 3885 women and 4269 infants) included in the Cochrane Systematic Review "Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation" shows that, compared with placebo, both dexamethasone and betamethasone have large and clinically substantial beneficial effects compared with controls on the risk of fetal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and long-term neurological sequelae. Thirty years after antenatal betamethasone treatment, health outcomes are generally good, apart from indirect evidence of possible mild insulin resistance, but there have been no follow-up studies of similar duration for dexamethasone.

Clinical practice guidelines for the use of antenatal corticosteroids have been developed by many colleges and institutions, often based on the NIH Consensus Panel Guidelines that were first released in 1994, and again in 2000. These guidelines state that "All pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days should be considered candidates for antenatal treatment with a single course of corticosteroids".

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: immunomodulatory anti-rheumatic drugs and corticosteroids [^11762kVa]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

UKTIS notes that many of the studies reporting pregnancy outcomes following gestational exposure to systemic corticosteroids are limited by a lack of stratification to account for differing doses, treatment duration and steroid potencies, as well as confounding by maternal disease. It concludes that preterm delivery may be associated with gestational exposure to systemic corticosteroids, and further well-controlled studies are required to address this question. Therefore, an increased risk of adverse foetal effects following use of high-dose/potency corticosteroids, or use for extended periods, cannot be ruled out.

Based on limited evidence, prednisone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone are considered compatible with breastmilk exposure. There remain few breastmilk exposure studies. One study, comprising 19 pregnancy and breastmilk exposures, found that prednisone and prednisolone exhibit dose- and concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics during pregnancy, and infant exposure to these agents via breastmilk is minimal. Another study of 12 patients with multiple sclerosis found the transfer of methylprednisolone into breastmilk to be low even when maternal serum concentration levels were highest at the end of an infusion, and although these levels were not considered to pose a threat to the infant, they state that mothers may choose to wait two to four h to further limit an infant's exposure.

Previously, long-term follow-up studies had not reported any adverse events after prednisolone exposure in pregnancy. Two additional studies did not report any adverse events from 9–12 months of post-partum follow-up of 227 non-rheumatic disease pregnancies exposed to prednisolone.

Recommendations for corticosteroids in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

Prednisolone is compatible with pregnancy and is the preferred corticosteroid in the treatment of maternal rheumatological disease in pregnancy and requires shared care with obstetric teams to monitor maternal blood pressure and blood glucose (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
Where possible, the dose of prednisolone should be < 20 mg/day and tapered to the minimum effective dose to control maternal disease, in conjunction with steroid-sparing drugs compatible with pregnancy (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).
Prednisolone is compatible with breastmilk exposure (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
Methylprednisolone has similar rates of placental transfer to prednisolone and would therefore be expected to be compatible with pregnancy and breastmilk exposure (GRADE 2C, SOA 99%).

Prenatal dexamethasone (Dex) dosing and fetal exposure — virtually all reports of prenatal treatment use Dex, typically at doses of 20 μg/kg prepregnancy maternal body weight, to a maximum of 1.5 mg/d; Dex is not inactivated by placental 11βHSD2 and fetal cortisol levels rise during weeks 8 to 12 while being only ~10% of maternal levels during midgestation, such that a dose of 20 μg/kg maternal body weight could yield glucocorticoid (GC) levels exceeding typical midgestation fetal levels by ~60-fold; no studies have systematically tested reducing the dose in late gestation.

Fetal and neonatal adverse events — For threatened preterm birth, a single course of antenatal corticosteroids (2 doses of 12mg betamethasone 24 hours apart) is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at increased risk of preterm delivery within 7 days and those with ruptured membranes; these should be administered even in those receiving oral or parenteral prednisolone for maintenance immunosuppression or graft rejection, as fetal uptake is extremely limited.

### Triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension (Zilretta) [^111KM3Kx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of triamcinolone acetonide ER intraarticular (also known as Zilretta) in pregnant patients for first trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Infatns should be monitored for adrenal insufficiency. Monitor neonates for poor weight gain. Human and animal studies suggest that use of systemic corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of orofacial clefts, intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight. Most published literature regarding corticosteroid exposure during pregnancy includes oral, topical, and inhaled formulations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. The drug triamcinolone acetonide ER intraarticular (also known as Zilretta) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^11373aef]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

MS subjects can undergo MRI scans while pregnant without risk to the fetus. This might be done for a suspected relapse. Gadolinium based contrast agents are not used unless there is a compelling reason. The agent crosses the placenta, and is believed to accumulate in the fetal urinary tract and liver, before being expelled into the amniotic fluid. In a large population study, fetal contrast exposure was associated with increase in rheumatologic, inflammatory and skin disorders in children.

If an MS subject had a relapse and wished treatment, corticosteroids can be given during pregnancy. You would give high dose methylprednisolone or prednisone, over several days without a taper. These agents provide lower fetal exposure than dexamethasone. If judged of sufficient benefit they could even be used in the first trimester, since more recent studies do not confirm significant risk for cleft lip or palate. A very important decision is whether a DMT will be used during pregnancy. This is discussed in greater detail in the Use of DMT section below.

Postpartum counseling focuses on breastfeeding decisions, and when to resume a DMT. This should be worked out well before delivery. Postpartum the timing of restarting a DMT is influenced by MS severity, prognostic profile, whether the individual is breastfeeding, and personal wishes.

The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months. Exclusive breastfeeding seems to be more protective in MS. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the impact of breastfeeding on postpartum relapses concluded that breastfeeding, particularly when it was exclusive (only breastmilk), was protective and suppressed postpartum disease activity.

The monoclonal antibodies can be used with breastfeeding; there is only minimal transfer into breastmilk. Typically you would delay breastfeeding for 4–8 ​h after the monoclonal was infused. The injection immunomodulators can also be used despite postpartum breastfeeding. The oral DMTs are not used while breastfeeding, since they lack convincing information about breastmilk levels and exposure risk.

The immediate postpartum period is recognized to show increased disease activity. In the original landmark 1998 PRIMS study, 28 ​% of women had a relapse in the 3 months postpartum. More modern series report lower numbers, around 14 ​%. Although relapse number may be lower, the pattern of increase is the same. Preconception DMT exposure, and low pre-pregnancy annualized relapse rate, seem to protect against postpartum relapse. Relapse during pregnancy increases risk for postpartum relapse.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^112RXoxg]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Steroids in pregnancy

The standard treatments for ITP during pregnancy are steroids and IVIG (Table 3) which are the most widely used and felt to be the safest. The prednis(ol)one recommendation for ITP in pregnancy, because of the limited duration of anticipated treatment, is relatively low-dose prednisone (e.g. 10–20 mg daily) based on targeting a platelet threshold of 20–30x10 9 /L. Prednis(ol)one often exacerbates physiological changes of pregnancy e.g. hyperglycemia, hypertension, and fluid retention; dexamethasone is to be avoided because of its fetal effects. If this lower dose of prednisone is successful, it avoids the risks of long-term high-dose steroids for the mother. Little to no prednisone enters the fetus because of placental β-11-hydroxylase.

WIntravenous immunoglobulin in pregnancy

IVIG is effective; however, it must be given often e.g. biweekly so steroids are the recommended treatment. One study suggests that both steroids and IVIG are slightly less effective in pregnant women. Overall, whether the efficacy of IVIG and prednis(ol)one in pregnancy is maintained becomes more important later in pregnancy. Patients who are difficult to treat require higher and higher doses of prednisone and more and more frequent IVIG dosing as pregnancy progresses.

The treatment of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia has provided safety information that may be extrapolated to ITP. 'Aggressive intrapartum treatment' exceeds that of the treatment of ITP by including IVIG 1–2 g/kg/week and prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for many weeks. The apparent safety of these very high doses helps to assuage concerns regarding their use in ITP. Even with less severe ITP, preparing for safe delivery often involves intervention to undergo epidural anesthesia, for which the platelet count is often "required" to be greater than 80x10 9 /L. The requirements for spinal anesthesia may not be as strict and are more variable than they are for epidural anesthesia. Even in a patient who responds well to IVIG and prednis(ol)one combination treatment, a platelet count of 80x10 9 /L or higher is often achieved for only 2–5 days. If these treatments are relied upon, scheduling elective delivery is crucial so that administration of IVIG can be timed to achieve its optimal effect. The patient could either undergo a Caesarian section or have her membranes ruptured so she enters labor at the desired time. An amniocentesis may be required to assess fetal lung maturity.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113grpBo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in hypopituitarism — glucocorticoid guidance and labor management: We suggest using hydrocortisone (HC) as the preferred GC in pregnancy and increasing the dose based on the individual clinical course; higher doses may be required, in particular during the third trimester (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). We suggest that pregnant patients with central AI be closely monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of GC over‑ and under‑replacement (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). We recommend against using dexamethasone in pregnancy because it is not inactivated in the placenta (1|⊕⊕○○), and we recommend HC stress dosing during the active phase of labor, similar to that used in major surgical stress (1|⊕⊕○○). The diagnosis of AI may be missed in the first trimester; a low morning cortisol < 3 μg/dL with typical clinical presentation is diagnostic, plasma cortisol can be falsely "normal" because of increased CBG in the second and third trimesters, HC is preferred because it is degraded by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 and does not cross the placenta, the best regimen is not well defined so we recommend adjusting dose regimens based on clinical judgment, and another approach is to increase HC doses by 20–40% in the third trimester.

### Deliberate use of mycophenolate mofetil in pregnant patients with lupus after the first trimester [^115EPv3S]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As described in figure 1, MMF was started between week 16 and 22 during eight pregnancies in six patients (mean age at the start of pregnancy: 31.9 years). All mothers suffered from severe refractory SLE and had been treated before pregnancy with several immunosuppressants, including MMF, either for lupus nephritis (five cases) or recurrent pericarditis (one case). MMF had been discontinued at least 8 weeks before pregnancy. The reason for restarting MMF after the first trimester was a severe flare during pregnancy (n = 4) or a history of severe flare when MMF had been switched to azathioprine due to pregnancy planning (n = 4). One fetal loss occurred at week 25 due to severe uncontrolled lupus nephritis requiring cyclophosphamide. The fetus did not suffer from MMF-induced embryopathy but from anasarca, and pathological examination of the placenta revealed signs of chronic ischaemia. The seven other pregnancies were successfully delivered (between week 34 and 39) and no MMF-induced embryopathy was observed at delivery. After a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, all living children had normal physical and neurological development.

In conclusion, although MMF is a potent teratogen strictly contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, these few cases suggest that, in highly selected patients, MMF can be safely resumed after completion of organogenesis. Targeted time use of critical medications during pregnancy is standard for other conditions than SLE. Thus, pregnant women with mechanical heart valves are treated with heparin for the first trimester (as warfarin also has an associated embryopathy risk) and transitioned back to warfarin during the second and third trimesters until near term.

### Triamcinolone acetonide [^111ftg5c]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of triamcinolone acetonide IN (also known as Kenalog, Triderm, Nasacort, Xipere, Triesence) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Infatns should be monitored for adrenal insufficiency. Monitor neonates for poor weight gain. Human and animal studies suggest that use of systemic corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of orofacial clefts, intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight. Most published literature regarding corticosteroid exposure during pregnancy includes oral, topical, and inhaled formulations. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. The drug triamcinolone acetonide IN (also known as Kenalog, Triderm, Nasacort, Xipere, Triesence) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth [^113R9EAe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal mortality and disability. Despite early evidence indicating a beneficial effect of antenatal corticosteroids on fetal lung maturation and widespread recommendations to use this treatment in women at risk of preterm delivery, some uncertainty remains about their effectiveness particularly with regard to their use in lower-resource settings, different gestational ages and high-risk obstetric groups such as women with hypertension or multiple pregnancies. This updated review (which supersedes an earlier review Crowley 1996) was first published in 2006 and subsequently updated in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effects of administering a course of corticosteroids to women prior to anticipated preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) on fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, maternal mortality and morbidity, and on the child in later life.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (3 September 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, the databases that contribute to the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 September 2020), and reference lists of the retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled comparisons of antenatal corticosteroid administration with placebo, or with no treatment, given to women with a singleton or multiple pregnancy, prior to anticipated preterm delivery (elective, or following rupture of membranes or spontaneous labour), regardless of other co-morbidity, for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness based on predefined criteria developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth, extracted data and checked them for accuracy, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included perinatal death, neonatal death, RDS, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), birthweight, developmental delay in childhood and maternal death.

Main Results

We included 27 studies (11,272 randomised women and 11,925 neonates) from 20 countries. Ten trials (4422 randomised women) took place in lower- or middle-resource settings. We removed six trials from the analysis that were included in the previous version of the review; this review only includes trials that meet our pre-defined trustworthiness criteria. In 19 trials the women received a single course of steroids. In the remaining eight trials repeated courses may have been prescribed. Fifteen trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, two had a high risk of bias in two or more domains and we ten trials had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (placebo was not used in the control arm. Overall, the certainty of evidence was moderate to high, but it was downgraded for IVH due to indirectness; for developmental delay due to risk of bias and for maternal adverse outcomes (death, chorioamnionitis and endometritis) due to imprecision. Neonatal/child outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids reduce the risk of: - perinatal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.93; 9833 infants; 14 studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.3% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% to 3.6% fewer), - neonatal death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87; 10,609 infants; 22 studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.6% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% to 3.6% fewer), - respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 11,183 infants; studies = 26; high-certainty evidence; 4.3% fewer, 95% CI 3.2% to 5.2% fewer). Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of IVH (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; 8475 infants; 12 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 0.8% to1.8% fewer), and probably have little to no effect on birthweight (mean difference (MD) -14.02 g, 95% CI -33.79 to 5.76; 9551 infants; 19 studies; high-certainty evidence). Antenatal corticosteroids probably lead to a reduction in developmental delay in childhood (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 600 children; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 3.8% fewer, 95% CI 0.2% to 5.7% fewer). Maternal outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids probably result in little to no difference in maternal death (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.89; 6244 women; 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.0% fewer, 95% CI 0.1% fewer to 0.5% more), chorioamnionitis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08; 8374 women; 15 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.5% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% fewer to 0.3% more), and endometritis (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.58; 6764 women; 10 studies; moderate-certainty; 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.3% fewer to 1.1% more) The wide 95% CIs in all of these outcomes include possible benefit and possible harm.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from this updated review supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of perinatal death, neonatal death and RDS and probably reduces the risk of IVH. This evidence is robust, regardless of resource setting (high, middle or low). Further research should focus on variations in the treatment regimen, effectiveness of the intervention in specific understudied subgroups such as multiple pregnancies and other high-risk obstetric groups, and the risks and benefits in the very early or very late preterm periods. Additionally, outcomes from existing trials with follow-up into childhood and adulthood are needed in order to investigate any longer-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids. We encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information which may answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids without the need for further randomised controlled trials. Individual patient data meta-analyses from published trials are likely to provide answers for most of the remaining clinical uncertainties.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C–

Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, use of these drugs in pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.

Corticosteroids appear in breast milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other unwanted effects. Mothers taking pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids should be advised not to nurse.

### Potential risks and benefits of antenatal corticosteroid therapy prior to preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by severe fetal growth restriction [^1175rorC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The antepartum administration of fluorinated corticosteroids for fetal maturation represents the most important clinical contribution in the battle against prematurity. This treatment reduces the risk of neonatal death and handicap. It is also known that on corticosteroid exposure, fetuses are subjected to transiently increased physiologic and metabolic demands. Healthy fetuses are able to cope, although emerging evidence suggests this may not be the case with severely growth-restricted fetuses. This review presents evidence of efficacy and safety pertaining to corticosteroid administration in fetal growth restriction–affected pregnancies, offers guidance to clinicians, and points out questions that still need answers.

Surgical abortion when mifepristone is contraindicated — surgical abortion is preferred when mifepristone is contraindicated, and mifepristone's antiglucocorticoid activity may not be relevant to patients who ingest a single dose of 200 mg; in humans this antiglucocorticoid activity is dose-dependent and expressed at a dose of 400 mg and above (single administration) or 200 mg/day for several consecutive days, with no clinical or laboratory signs of adrenal failure observed during chronic administration among volunteers with normal adrenal function; in most cases of chronic corticosteroid therapy, the glucocorticoid dose can be empirically increased for a few days following mifepristone administration in consultation with the prescribing physician, and readjustment of corticosteroids for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma should be undertaken with caution because severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening.

### High doses of inhaled corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy and congenital malformations [^116juaok]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although reassuring data exist on the use of low-to-moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) during pregnancy, there are inadequate data for women receiving high doses.

Objective

To investigate the association between doses of ICS during the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations among women with asthma.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of 13,280 pregnancies of women with asthma (1990–2002) by linking 3 administrative databases from Quebec (Canada). By using generalized estimation equation models, we compared women taking > 0 to 1000 microg/d ICS (beclomethasone dipropionate-chlorofluorocarbone equivalent) with women taking > 1000 microg/d and those not taking ICSs. The main outcome measures were all and major congenital malformations.

Results

We identified 1257 infants with a congenital malformation (9.5%) and 782 infants with a major malformation (5.9%). We found that women who used > 1000 microg/d ICS (n = 154) were significantly more likely (63%) to have a baby with a malformation than the 4392 women who used > 0 to 1000 microg/d (adjusted risk ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02–2.60). On the other hand, women who used > 0 to 1000 microg/d were not found to be more at risk than women who did not use ICSs during the first trimester (n = 8734). Nonsignificant trends of similar magnitude were found for major malformations.

Conclusions

Our study adds evidence on the safety of low-to-moderate doses of ICS taken during the first trimester but raises concerns about high doses. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding by severity in this association.

### Halcinonide [^1135LcXx]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of halcinonide TOP in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Guidelines recommend mild to moderate potency agents over potent corticosteroids, which should be used in short durations. Fetal growth restriction and a significantly increased risk of low birthweight has been reported with use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids during the third trimester, particularly when using more than 300 grams. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. The drug halcinonide TOP is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Triamcinolone acetonide (Triesence) [^1133pmWY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Effect on Growth and Development

Long-term use of corticosteroids can have negative effects on growth and development in children. Growth and development of pediatric patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully monitored.

5.10 Use in Pregnancy

Triamcinolone acetonide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human and animal studies suggest that use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of orofacial clefts, intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Weight Gain

Systemically administered corticosteroids may increase appetite and cause weight gain.

5.12 Neuromuscular Effects

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

5.13 Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

5.7 Ophthalmic Effects

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses.

The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes.

Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.

Patients with Ocular Herpes Simplex

Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.

5.8 Vaccination

Administration of live or live attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease.

While on corticosteroid therapy, patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response.

5.9 Effect on Growth and Development

Long-term use of corticosteroids can have negative effects on growth and development in children. Growth and development of pediatric patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully monitored.

5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Prednisolone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human studies suggest a small but inconsistent increased risk of orofacial clefts with use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy. Published animal studies show prednisolone to be teratogenic in rats, rabbits, hamsters, and mice with increased incidence of cleft palate in offspring. Intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight have also been reported with corticosteroid use during pregnancy, however, the underlying maternal condition may also contribute to these risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, advise the patient about the potential harm to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Updated CDC recommendations for using artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women in the United States [^111mUStp]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This update of CDC recommendations based on accumulated evidence of the safety of AL in pregnancy is in line with the malaria treatment guidelines of other countries without endemic malaria and WHO. On the basis of the current strength and quality of the first trimester safety and efficacy evidence, the addition of ACTs, including AL, as a first-line treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy is being considered by WHO after the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee's review. Women seeking care in the United States will now have a third treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and during the first trimester of pregnancy when other treatment options are unavailable, that is safe and effective for treating P. falciparum infections acquired in regions with chloroquine resistance. To assess the implementation and impact of these updated recommendations in the United States, data from the National Malaria Surveillance System will be used to examine how antimalarials are used to treat uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women, as well as population-specific disease burden; in addition, the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System maintains adverse event and medication error data, which can be used to monitor adverse events associated with AL use during pregnancy.

### Triamcinolone acetonide (Triesence) [^116f9FHJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D [See Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]

Multiple cohort and case controlled studies in humans suggest that maternal corticosteroid use during the first trimester increases the rate of cleft lip with or without cleft palate from about 1/1000 infants to 3–5/1000 infants. Two prospective case control studies showed decreased birth weight in infants exposed to maternal corticosteroids in utero.

Triamcinolone acetonide was teratogenic in rats, rabbits, and monkeys. In rats and rabbits, triamcinolone acetonide was teratogenic at inhalation doses of 0.02 mg/kg and above and in monkeys, triamcinolone acetonide was teratogenic at an inhalation dose of 0.5 mg/kg (1/4 and 7 times the recommended human dose). Dose-related teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits included cleft palate and/or internal hydrocephaly and axial skeletal defects, whereas the effects observed in monkeys were cranial malformations. These effects are similar to those noted with other corticosteroids.

Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who received corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Corticosteroids are secreted in human milk. Reports suggest that steroid concentrations in human milk are 5% to 25% of maternal serum levels, and that total infant daily doses are small, less than 0.2% of the maternal daily dose. The risk of infant exposure to steroids through breast milk should be weighed against the known benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby.

### The proportions of term or late preterm births after exposure to early antenatal corticosteroids, and outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis of 1.6 million infants [^1146bniU]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our systematic review, we found that approximately 40% of infants with early exposure to antenatal corticosteroids were born at term (low/very low certainty), with increased risks of neonatal intensive care admission, intubation, hypoglycaemia requiring treatment, smaller head circumference, and adverse long term neurodevelopmental outcomes (low/very low certainty). Similar outcomes were noted for the more than half of infants with early exposure to antenatal corticosteroids who were born at term/late preterm combined. For infants born very prematurely, antenatal steroids save potentially lives and severe morbidity but as pregnancy progresses to term, the benefits shift to risks. Furthermore, no studies reported on prespecified outcomes in pregnant people.

### Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for the management of rheumatoid arthritis before and during pregnancy [^111nQGyU]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the recent literature on the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids and traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs before and during pregnancy.

Recent Findings

Recent data suggest that the risk of cleft palate formation after in-utero glucocorticoid exposure is lower than previously reported. Two studies of inadvertent leflunomide exposure during early pregnancy suggest that this medication may be less teratogenic than previously thought.

Summary

Although NSAIDs are well tolerated for use during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, they should be avoided during a conception cycle so as not to impede implantation. After gestational week 30, these medications should be discontinued as they may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. The nonfluorinated glucocorticoids, prednisone and prednisolone, can be used throughout pregnancy, although use during the first trimester may increase the risk of cleft palate formation. Protracted glucocorticoids exposure during pregnancy can cause maternal preterm premature rupture of the membranes, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy. The immunosuppressive agents, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and cyclosporine A, are compatible with pregnancy.

### The effects of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory medications on fertility, pregnancy, and lactation… [^114R4DfY]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

(The FDA risk categories are: controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester, and the possibility of fetal harm seems remote; either animal reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but. Recommendations. Patients using azathioprine should use adequate contraception. Because of the potential for carcinogenesis and the unknown long-term effects of fetal immunosuppression, use of azathioprine should be reserved for pregnant women whose rheumatic diseases are severe or life-threatening. Reduction of the azathioprine dose at 32 weeks' gestation may prevent serious neonatal leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 51 Close prenatal monitoring for growth and long-term evaluation of the offspring are essential. However, low doses of methotrexate have been reported elsewhere to cause human malformations. 62, 63 Lactation.

Breastfeeding during methotrexate treatment is not recommended because the drug is excreted into breast milk in low concentrations and may accumulate in neonatal tissues. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers methotrexate to be contraindicated during breastfeeding because of several potential problems, including immune suppression, neutropenia, adverse effects on growth, and carcinogenesis.
14. Recommendations. During treatment with methotrexate, patients should receive supplemental folic acid. Strict attention to contraception is advised. Should the patient desire pregnancy, both she and the potential father should discontinue treatment with the drug at least 3 months before conception because of its prolonged retention in the tissues after discontinuation. Despite reports of some successful outcomes after exposure to methotrexate during early pregnancy, the numbers are too small to draw significant conclusions on the safe use of this drug.

Further, the abnormalities that are seen are difficult to detect antenatally. Therefore, methotrexate is contraindicated in a patient who desires to conceive as well as during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Recommendations. Hydroxychloroquine does not seem to pose a significant risk to the fetus, especially with lower doses. It may be most prudent to avoid its use during pregnancy in patients with RA, since these patients can be managed safely with corticosteroids. However, for patients with SLE already taking hydroxychloroquine, the benefits of continuing treatment with this medication throughout pregnancy seem to outweigh the risks associated with its use.

### First trimester bleeding: evaluation and management | AAFP… [^111d9Gh1]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Threatened abortion should be managed expectantly. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of progestin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss. 3, 18 Bed rest does not improve outcomes and may cause psychological harm in patients with subsequent early pregnancy loss. 19 Patients should be reassured that nothing they did caused the bleeding. 22 In contrast, medical management is more effective than expectant management for the treatment of anembryonic gestation or embryonic demise. 25 The most effective regimen for medical management is 200 mg of oral mifepristone followed 24 hours later by 800 mcg of vaginally administered misoprostol. 26 Success rates at two days with this regimen are 84% vs. 67% in those treated with misoprostol alone. Many regimens for using misoprostol alone have been studied, and none has been proven optimal. 22 One common regimen is 800 mcg vaginally, with a repeat dose in 24 to 48 hours if the first dose is unsuccessful.

27 Besides the expected cramping and vaginal bleeding, common adverse effects include nausea and diarrhea.
22. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT Medical management is safe and effective in carefully selected patients. There are different treatment protocols, but the single-dose regimen is most common. 15 This includes an intramuscular injection of 50 mg of methotrexate per m 2, followed by close monitoring of symptoms and measurement of β-hCG levels four and seven days after injection. β-hCG levels should decrease by at least 15% from days 4 to 7; once this occurs, levels should be monitored weekly until undetectable, which may take five to seven weeks. Treatment failure is assumed if the β-hCG level plateaus or increases from days 4 to 7. In this case, a repeat dose of methotrexate may be given, although surgery may be required if the patient is symptomatic.

EXPECTANT MANAGEMENT Patients undergoing expectant management must receive extensive counseling on the risk of tubal rupture and the importance of close surveillance. β-hCG levels should be obtained every 48 hours to confirm that they are decreasing, then weekly until they reach zero. No specific range of decrease is considered normal as long as the patient is asymptomatic and the decrease continues. 39 Surgical management is indicated if the patient experiences increased abdominal pain or if β-hCG levels increase. 38.
