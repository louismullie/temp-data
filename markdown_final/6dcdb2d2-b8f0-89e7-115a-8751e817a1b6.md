## Question

Abdominal aortic aneurysm acute management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the acute management of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and permissive hypotension. Then, I should verify the diagnostic pathway and imaging strategy. Next, I will consider transfer and systems-of-care targets. After that, I need to decide on repair modality based on anatomy and stability. Then, I will outline perioperative management priorities. Finally, I should review special scenarios and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities in suspected ruptured AAA: secure the airway, breathing, and circulation while avoiding interventions that worsen hemorrhage, and immediately establish two large-bore peripheral IVs because central access can delay care; I should double-check that this aligns with SVS guidance emphasizing rapid ABCs and large-bore access without early central lines, and that permissive hypotension is recommended in conscious patients to limit bleeding, typically targeting systolic blood pressure around 70–90 mmHg while restricting crystalloids and using blood products if needed [^d498f6c4] [^7b8c8b7a] [^737ea676].

> Wait, let me verify the permissive hypotension details so I don't overgeneralize: the concept is to maintain just enough perfusion to preserve consciousness and end-organ function while avoiding aggressive fluid loading that can disrupt clot formation; IMPROVE-era analyses reinforce that very low systolic pressures, especially below 70 mmHg, are independently associated with markedly higher 30-day mortality, which supports careful titration rather than abandoning the strategy, and ACC/AHA endorses permissive hypotension in ruptured AAA when feasible [^6b03ad79] [^737ea676].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic pathway; in unstable patients, I need to ensure we do not delay definitive care for imaging, whereas in stable patients, contrast-enhanced CT angiography is the gold standard to confirm rupture, define anatomy for EVAR candidacy, and guide operative planning; I should confirm that SVS and radiology sources consistently endorse CTA as the primary modality in stable presentations and that ultrasound can be a rapid bedside screen when rupture is not suspected or to identify the aneurysm quickly [^35b40342] [^9cf16d75] [^27e276aa].

> Hold on, I should verify transfer and systems-of-care targets because delays here drive mortality; SVS recommends a door-to-intervention time under 90 minutes using a 30–30–30 framework (recognition/decision, transfer if needed, and operative readiness), and emphasizes transferring to centers with established rupture protocols and endovascular capability; IMPROVE and related analyses show that organized regional systems with high-volume centers can achieve survival near two-thirds in some series, underscoring the need for prearranged pathways and direct physician-to-physician handoffs with image transmission [^8056f619] [^3af10b56] [^94e57e19] [^b615e134].

> I will now examine repair modality; let me think about anatomy and hemodynamics before jumping to conclusions: if the patient is unstable or anatomy is unsuitable, open repair remains appropriate, but when the patient is stable and anatomy is favorable, EVAR is preferred and associated with lower perioperative mortality and morbidity; randomized and observational data, including IMPROVE and meta-analyses, show no consistent 30-day survival advantage for EVAR versus open in all-comers, but EVAR confers lower early morbidity and may have particular benefit in older adults and women, while long-term outcomes converge and EVAR requires vigilant surveillance for endoleaks and reinterventions [^7cae81f9] [^e6a2df26] [^049b686c] [^b5ed4fed] [^50f6be3c].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with symptomatic, nonruptured AAA; I should confirm that this is a high-risk scenario requiring urgent management: ACC/AHA advises ICU admission, strict blood pressure control, and repair ideally within 24–48 hours to mitigate imminent rupture risk, and SVS supports urgent repair with ICU monitoring if repair must be delayed for optimization; I need to ensure I don't conflate this with elective thresholds, which are higher and size-based [^c24412e9] [^17c2ba31] [^eb1efa65].

> Next, I should review perioperative management priorities; let me verify the key elements: maintain permissive hypotension until proximal control or endograft deployment, avoid elective intubation that can precipitate hemodynamic collapse, actively warm to prevent coagulopathy, ensure immediate availability of blood products, and monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome with bladder pressures in rupture cases; for EVAR, ultrasound-guided percutaneous access and closure can reduce operative time and complications when anatomy allows [^d498f6c4] [^d3bf6473] [^0b39a746].

> I need to check special scenarios so I don't miss nuances: in patients with concomitant atheroma or penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, low-dose aspirin is reasonable unless contraindicated; in those with aortic atherosclerosis, high-intensity statins are recommended; for small AAAs under surveillance, blood pressure control and statins are advised even though no pharmacologic therapy has proven to slow growth consistently; and in women, lower intervention thresholds are justified by higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, which should influence both surveillance intensity and treatment decisions [^faa7b734] [^f1beacaf] [^c148c860] [^fa1a4898] [^e887dc20].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency: suspect ruptured AAA with hypotension and pain, stabilize with permissive hypotension and large-bore access, obtain CTA if stable to assess anatomy and rupture, activate a 30–30–30 pathway to reach a center with rupture protocol and EVAR capability, choose EVAR when feasible and open repair when unstable or anatomically unsuitable, and execute with rapid proximal control, warming, blood products, and compartment surveillance; for symptomatic nonruptured AAA, admit to ICU, control blood pressure, and proceed to urgent repair within 24–48 hours whenever possible [^8056f619] [^7cae81f9] [^c24412e9].

> Finally, I should double-check the key takeaways and make sure they are evidence-linked: permissive hypotension reduces hemorrhage without compromising perfusion when carefully titrated, CTA in stable patients enables timely EVAR and improves logistics, systems-of-care with sub-90-minute door-to-intervention targets reduce mortality, EVAR is preferred when anatomy and stability allow but open repair remains essential for unsuitable anatomy or instability, and symptomatic nonruptured AAA warrants urgent repair rather than elective scheduling; these principles are consistently supported by SVS, ACC/AHA, and contemporary European guidance [^737ea676] [^35b40342] [^8056f619] [^7cae81f9] [^c24412e9].

---

In acute AAA management, **immediate stabilization** with permissive hypotension (target SBP 70–90 mmHg) [^737ea676] and rapid CT angiography [^56b36411] are essential to confirm diagnosis and plan intervention [^35b40342]. For ruptured AAA, **endovascular repair (EVAR) is preferred** when anatomy is suitable [^7cae81f9], as it reduces 30-day mortality compared to open repair [^b5ed4fed]; open repair is reserved for unstable patients or unsuitable anatomy [^e6a2df26]. Symptomatic but unruptured AAAs require urgent repair within 24–48 hours [^c24412e9] to prevent rupture. Multidisciplinary care and a 30–30–30 minute protocol [^8056f619] improve outcomes [^94e57e19].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 95%.

- **Circulation**: Establish two large-bore IV lines [^d498f6c4] and initiate permissive hypotension (target SBP 70–90 mmHg) [^737ea676] to limit bleeding; avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation unless the patient is unconscious or SBP < 70 mmHg [^d2d8fb9c].

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain CBC, electrolytes, renal function, coagulation profile, and type and crossmatch for 6–10 units of blood.

---

## Diagnostic imaging

CT angiography (CTA) is the **gold standard** [^9cf16d75] for stable patients, providing rapid, detailed anatomy to guide EVAR versus open repair [^27e276aa]. Ultrasound is useful for unstable patients or when CTA is contraindicated, but it is limited by operator dependence and incomplete visualization of the aneurysm neck and iliac vessels [^notfound].

---

## Indications for intervention

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for intervention** |
|-|-|
| Ruptured AAA | Immediate emergency repair (EVAR or open) [^0e100edd] |
| Symptomatic, non-ruptured AAA | Urgent repair within 24–48 hours [^c24412e9] |
| Asymptomatic AAA | Elective repair if diameter ≥ 5.5 cm in men or ≥ 5.0 cm in women, or if rapid growth ≥ 0.5 cm in 6 months [^e887dc20] [^c8070061] |

---

## Choice of intervention

- **Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)**: Preferred for ruptured AAA when anatomy is suitable [^7cae81f9]; lower 30-day mortality and fewer complications than open repair [^b5ed4fed].

- **Open surgical repair**: Reserved for unstable patients, unsuitable anatomy, or when EVAR is unavailable [^e6a2df26].

- **Symptomatic non-ruptured AAA**: Urgent EVAR or open repair within 24–48 hours [^c24412e9] to prevent rupture.

---

## Perioperative management

- **Blood pressure control**: Maintain permissive hypotension (SBP 70–90 mmHg) [^737ea676] until proximal control is achieved.

- **Temperature management**: Actively warm to prevent hypothermia and coagulopathy [^d498f6c4].

- **Blood products**: Transfuse PRBCs, FFP, and platelets as needed; consider massive transfusion protocol.

- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Monitor intra-abdominal pressure [^d3bf6473] and decompress if indicated.

---

## Postoperative care and surveillance

Postoperative care includes ICU monitoring for hemodynamics, respiration, and renal function, with **lifelong surveillance** after EVAR (CTA or ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually) [^f0629fc1] to detect endoleaks or graft complications. Encourage smoking cessation, statin therapy, and blood pressure control to reduce cardiovascular risk and aneurysm progression [^f1beacaf] [^c148c860].

---

## Special considerations

Women have a **lower intervention threshold** (≥ 5.0 cm) due to higher rupture risk at smaller diameters [^e887dc20] [^fa1a4898]. Elderly patients may benefit from EVAR given lower perioperative risk, though long-term outcomes must be weighed [^50f6be3c]. Comorbidities should be optimized preoperatively whenever possible to reduce perioperative risk [^c24412e9].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Permissive hypotension**: Target SBP 70–90 mmHg [^737ea676] to limit bleeding.

- **CT angiography**: Gold standard for stable patients [^9cf16d75] to guide intervention [^56b36411].

- **EVAR**: Preferred for ruptured AAA when anatomy is suitable [^7cae81f9].

- **Urgent repair**: Within 24–48 hours for symptomatic non-ruptured AAA [^c24412e9].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Improves outcomes [^notfound].

---

Acute AAA management hinges on **rapid stabilization**, accurate imaging, and timely intervention. EVAR is preferred for suitable ruptured cases, while open repair remains vital for unstable patients or complex anatomy. Urgent repair for symptomatic AAAs and structured postoperative surveillance are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms: which risk factors play a role in decision-making? [^a818463f]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

There are three choices for management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), ie, endovascular repair (EVAR), open repair (OR), and continuing surveillance (OBS). The treating physician must weigh the risk of no intervention, in terms of ultimate death from rupture, against the more immediate risk associated with either form of repair, considering in the process those risk factors that directly or indirectly relate to outcome. These risk factors include AAA size and the patient's comorbidities, age, gender, and AAA anatomy, as well as the skills and experience of the treating physicians and the health care environment in which the patient is treated. While individualization is clearly required, a generalizable platform for decision-making derived from past trials and other pertinent observational studies is also useful. This article attempts to present pertinent background information and develop it into generally applicable guidelines.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred." In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU." For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter." Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter," while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter."

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management recommendations include timing, protocols, resuscitation strategy, referral, and repair modality. We suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. An established protocol for the management of ruptured AAA is essential for optimal outcomes. We recommend implementing hypotensive hemostasis with restriction of fluid resuscitation in the conscious patient. We suggest that patients with ruptured AAA who require transfer for repair be referred to a facility with an established rupture protocol and suitable endovascular resources. If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open repair for treatment of a ruptured AAA.

Background

Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.

Methods

The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.

Results

Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions

Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.

### The acute abdominal aorta [^9cf16d75]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute disorders of the abdominal aorta are potentially lethal conditions that require prompt evaluation and treatment. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging method for evaluating these conditions because of its availability and speed. Volumetric CT acquisition with multiplanar reconstruction and three-dimensional analysis is now the standard technique for evaluating the aorta. MR imaging may be useful for select applications in stable patients in whom rupture has been excluded. Imaging is indispensable for diagnosis and treatment planning, because management has shifted toward endoluminal repair. Acute abdominal aortic conditions most commonly are complications of aneurysms and atherosclerosis.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^ced71e1d]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — definition, epidemiology, rupture risk and intervention thresholds are summarized as follows: An aneurysm is defined as at least a 50% increase in local aortic diameter or > 30 mm absolute diameter, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are up to 4 times more common in men. In men, rupture risk per year ranges from 0.3% to 0.8%, and surveillance of AAA < 55 mm is supported; in women, the risk of rupture may be up to 4 times higher, justifying intervention at 50 mm. Growth usually occurs initially at a smaller diameter (< 42.5 mm), and in patients with high-risk AAA, earlier intervention may be reasonable. For symptomatic, unruptured AAA, urgent repair is indicated to reduce the risk of rupture, and for ruptured AAA, emergency surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated.

### Screening and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^06b59e77]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

1 What sets AAA apart from more common causes of death is that it is a preventable problem. Ultrasonographic screening for aortic aneurysms is rapid, accurate, and relatively inexpensive. A single normal ultrasound examination in men 65 years or older virtually excludes future risk of AAA-related death. 2 More than 50 years of experience has shown that open surgical repair nearly eliminates the risk of AAA-related death. 3 A recent meta-analysis 4 found that aneurysm screening reduced AAA-related deaths by 43 percent over four to five years in men 65 years and older. 6 For 4. 0- to
5. 4-cm AAAs, two clinical trials 7, 8 have demonstrated that immediate surgical repair does not improve overall survival compared with periodic surveillance. Based on these trial outcomes, it is generally safe to refer patients with AAAs of 5. 0 cm or larger. For patients with aortic aneurysms 5.

5 cm or larger in diameter, the risk of rupture increases progressively with size, and mortality with aneurysm rupture is about 80 percent. 9 Elective open surgical repair in those fit for surgery is the accepted standard of care. In coming years, the more unsettled issue will be the role of endovascular repair in the management of AAA. The impetus for developing this technique was the expectation that for aneurysms 5. 5 cm or larger, endovascular repair would reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality, speed recovery, and improve long-term survival compared with open surgical repair. Early results from two European clinical trials. 10, 11 showed that 30-day mortality with endovascular repair in patients with an AAA of 5. 5 cm or larger was substantially lower than for surgical repair. However, in follow-up studies 12–14 from both trials, these early survival advantages disappeared after one to one and one half years.

Because endovascular aneurysm repair has risks of late complications, results after four to five years of follow-up will be needed to determine the long-term outcomes with endovascular repair. Trials are underway in the United States and Europe to examine this question. How will physicians, given what is and is not known about interventions for AAA, provide the patient with informed advice about options. The physician should encourage surveillance when it is prudent. When intervention is indicated, surgical repair is still the standard of care. When advising patients about the option of endovascular repair, long-term outcomes from ongoing clinical trials should provide the best guidance for the appropriate role of this intervention.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm — protocolized preoperative management and initial evaluation: Establishing a protocol or algorithm for urgent or emergent management of a patient with a ruptured AAA is essential for optimizing outcomes, and in the presence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 18%, whereas in the absence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 32%. An expedited evaluation consisting of the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) protocol, general assessment, and vital sign check should be initially performed by the emergency physician of any patient suspected of having a ruptured AAA, and intravascular access should be established with two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines as central or arterial access is not immediately necessary. Permissive hypotension, or hypotensive hemostasis, which refers to restricting aggressive fluid resuscitation as long as the patient remains conscious and has a systolic blood pressure between 70 and 90 mm Hg, should be implemented to limit excessive hemorrhage, and laboratory or imaging studies should be obtained only to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured AAA. Other actions that may help improve outcomes are the immediate availability of blood and blood products, warming, and avoidance of elective intubation.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^11dce84c]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

EACTS/STS Guidelines — Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management reports four trials with no differences in short-term outcomes between open surgery and EVAR in anatomically eligible patients, while observational studies showed EVAR had better outcomes in ICU transfer, blood loss and hospital stay and was potentially beneficial for women. Considerations include age > 80 years, which may favour endovascular repair, and hostile anatomy necessitating open surgery; long-term survival appears comparable between EVAR and open surgery for patients discharged from hospital.

Symptomatic but unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm — Approximately 6% to 22% of untreated aneurysms are symptomatic but unruptured, with high-risk symptoms including pain in the back, abdomen, or flank, sometimes radiating to the groin; patients presenting with such symptoms should be admitted to an ICU for arterial BP monitoring, tight BP control, medical optimization, and AAA repair, ideally in 24 to 48 hours to reduce risk of free rupture.

### Appropriate management of the small abdominal aortic aneurysm [^eb867f10]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

There is variation in the management of small aneurysms in the United States today, with some surgeons moving forward with elective repair and others practice ongoing surveillance. Literature exists to suggest that small aneurysms are repaired at a higher rate than should be considered acceptable, and this represents a deviation from current standards of care. To best understand the optimal care of this patient population, this article aims to evaluate the current management of small aneurysms, review contemporary guidelines and the literature behind them, and assess the appropriateness of surgical management of small aneurysms.

Objective

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries in succession to the 2011 and 2019 versions, with the aim of assisting physicians and patients in selecting the best management strategy.

Methods

The guideline is based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion on the matter. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to a modified European Society of Cardiology grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III and the letters A to C mark the level of evidence.

Results

A total of 160 recommendations have been issued on the following topics: Service standards, including surgical volume and training; Epidemiology, diagnosis, and screening; Management of patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), including surveillance, cardiovascular risk reduction, and indication for repair; Elective AAA repair, including operative risk assessment, open and endovascular repair, and early complications; Ruptured and symptomatic AAA, including peri-operative management, such as permissive hypotension and use of aortic occlusion balloon, open and endovascular repair, and early complications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and colonic ischaemia; Long term outcome and follow up after AAA repair, including graft infection, endoleaks and follow up routines; Management of complex AAA, including open and endovascular repair; Management of iliac artery aneurysm, including indication for repair and open and endovascular repair; and Miscellaneous aortic problems, including mycotic, inflammatory, and saccular aortic aneurysm. In addition, Shared decision making is being addressed, with supporting information for patients, and Unresolved issues are discussed.

Conclusion

The ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines provide the most comprehensive, up to date, and unbiased advice to clinicians and patients on the management of abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — door-to-intervention target and phased timeline: We suggest a door-to-intervention time of < 90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. Level of recommendation Good Practice Statement. Quality of evidence Ungraded. The adoption of a 30-30-30-minute framework is recommended as a benchmark. The initial period denotes the time from first medical contact with a patient suspected of having a ruptured aortic aneurysm, including immediate management, to the point when a decision is made to transfer the patient to a regional center, if so required, or emergent in-house vascular surgery evaluation is initiated. The second period represents the time required for rapid transfer to a regional center, if needed, and includes physician-physician phone handoff, transfer of images (if available), and in-transit care. The final period includes the time from evaluation by the in-house or receiving vascular surgery team to arterial access and placement of an aortic occlusion balloon.

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm management and need for medical management to limit growth and rupture

Current management

Randomized controlled trials suggest that early elective open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR of asymptomatic 40–55 mm AAA does not reduce mortality. One trial suggested that EVAR did not significantly reduce mortality in people with large AAA unfit for OSR although this evidence maybe outdated due to advances in EVAR. One trial found that EVAR and OSR had similar 30-day mortality for ruptured AAA. Quality of life was better in the EVAR group, and 3-year mortality was lower after EVAR in participants with proven rupture. The risk of small aneurysm rupture is higher, and outcome of surgery is worse in women compared with men. Based on this evidence, current European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend monitoring of small AAA (< 55 mm in men; < 50 mm in women) through imaging surveillance, elective surgical repair of large aneurysms in fit patients, and EVAR of ruptured AAA, if morphologically suitable. The intervention threshold for women is not evidence-based and remains a research priority.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm and large abdominal aortic aneurysm that do not undergo surgical repair

The risk of rupture of small AAA in men is < 1%/year. The 3-year rupture rate of unrepaired 50–54 mm AAA in women was 3.4% in a recent study. Most small AAA grow in size over time, with the UK small aneurysm trial finding that 70% of 40–55 mm AAA grew to 55 mm within 5 years. Large aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture (estimated as 2.2%, 6.0%, and 18.4% over 3 years for 55–60 mm, 61–70 mm, and > 70 mm AAA, respectively). Rupture rate of large AAA is significantly greater in women than men, with a recent study reporting women with unrepaired 61–70 mm AAA had a 3-year incidence of rupture of 12.8% compared with 4.5% in men. There is no evidence that the growth rate of small AAA has changed over time. Thus, medical treatments that can slow AAA growth and reduce the risk of small aneurysm rupture are needed. The remainder of this review summarizes previous research performed to test and develop medical therapy to limit AAA growth and rupture.

### Rupture signs on computed tomography, treatment, and outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^838e5d2f]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Management

AAA rupture represents a major surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention. However, an estimated 87.5% of patients admitted to the hospital with a ruptured AAA survived longer than 2 h after their admission. Furthermore, the median time interval between admission and death from AAA rupture was 10.5 h. This suggests that most patients with ruptured AAAs who reach the hospital alive are haemodynamically stable enough to undergo preoperative imaging. CT angiography permits confirmation of AAA rupture and evaluation of AAA anatomy while intravenous fluid resuscitation is initiated. Pre-interventional imaging also allows assessing the eligibility for an endovascular repair.

It has been reported that aneurysm repair can be slightly delayed in haemodynamically stable patients who present with symptomatic AAA without signs of complete rupture. Urgent treatment is still warranted in these patients, who should receive proper preoperative management and aneurysm repair within 4 to 24 h of admission. Such management optimises preoperative conditions and reduces mortality rates to those comparable to elective procedures (less than 5%). Nevertheless, in haemodynamically unstable patients with acute and complete AAA rupture, emergent and immediate treatment is mandatory.

Open surgical repair is considered the standard treatment for AAA. Surgical repair involves an extensive abdominal incision, clamping of the proximal abdominal aorta, and suturing of a graft that excludes the aneurysm (Fig. 12). Despite important advances in technology and critical care, very little or no significant reduction in mortality rates in patients with open surgical repair of ruptured AAA has been noted in over 2 decades, remaining higher than 40%.

Aortic emergencies present a diagnostic and treatment challenge for emergency physicians. Both acute aortic dissection and abdominal aortic aneurysms can be difficult to recognize, and a missed or delayed diagnosis may be fatal. A high clinical suspicion and rapid patient evaluation are important. Although many patients ultimately require surgical intervention, early and aggressive attention to hemodynamic stability by the emergency physician can provide a window to definitive treatment.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm disease: similarities and differences among cardiovascular guidelines and NICE guidance [^2390ef26]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of endovascular techniques has improved abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) management over the past 2 decades. Different cardiovascular societies worldwide have recommended the endovascular approach as the standard of care in their currently available guidelines. While endovascular treatment has established its role in daily clinical practice, a new debate has arisen regarding the indications, appropriateness, limitations, and role of open surgery. To inform this debate, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020; the systematic search identified 5 articles published between 2011 and 2020 by 4 cardiovascular societies and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Four debatable domains were assessed and analyzed: diagnostic methods and screening, preoperative management, indications and treatment modalities, and postoperative follow-up and endoleak management. The review addresses controversial proposals as well as widely accepted recommendations and "gray zone" issues that need to be further investigated and analyzed, such as screening in women, medical management, and follow-up imaging. While the recommendations for AAA management have significant overlap and agreement among international cardiovascular societies, the NICE guidelines diverge regarding the role of open repair in aortic disease, recommending conventional surgery in most elective cases.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm management thresholds and evidence — Some controversy exists regarding treatment strategies for patients who present with an AAA between 4.0 and 5.4 cm, and in UKSAT and ADAM the 30-day operative mortality in the immediate surgery groups (5.5% UKSAT, 2.1% ADAM) led to an early disadvantage in survival with no statistically significant difference in long-term survival between the immediate OSR and surveillance groups. Currently, nearly 80% of all AAAs are treated by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the United States. The CAESAR and PIVOTAL trials compared immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and 5.4 cm and 4.0 and 5.0 cm and found no survival benefit for early EVAR, and a Cochrane database review demonstrated no advantage to immediate repair by open surgery or EVAR for small AAAs (4.0–5.5 cm). Patients with an asymptomatic fusiform AAA > 5.4 cm should be considered for repair and surveillance is recommended for smaller aneurysms, with an individualized approach for patients with an AAA > 5.4 cm who are of advanced age or have significant comorbid conditions, while young, healthy patients, particularly women, with an AAA between 5.0 and 5.4 cm or those with rapid expansion of small fusiform AAAs may benefit from early repair.

Introduction

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is fatal without emergency surgical intervention. Although patients typically present with a cluster of characteristic symptoms, including collapse and back pain, in older people the differential diagnosis can be wide. Unlike myocardial infarction or stroke, the diagnosis cannot be made in the ambulance that brings most of these patients to hospital. Therefore, many patients still present in emergency departments of hospitals that do not offer emergency AAA repair. There is evidence that operative mortality after rupture is lower in larger-volume vascular centresand that, in England, operative mortality for all types of emergency surgery is lower if patients present within working hours. However, even larger-volume centres cannot offer sufficiently sized prospective case series in which to investigate hospital and clinical factors that may be associated with better patient outcomes. To date, the largest serieson endovascular repair reported on 473 patients treated between 1998 and 2011 from centres in two countries. The supposed benefits of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in reducing operative mortality have been questioned recently, with a randomized trialof endovascular versus open repair for AAA rupture (all anatomically suitable for endovascular repair) showing no difference in operative mortality between the groups.

The Immediate Management of Patients with Ruptured Aneurysm: Open Versus Endovascular Repair (IMPROVE) trial (ISRCTN 48334791;) recruited eligible patients with a clinical diagnosis of AAA rupture between late 2009 and summer 2013. This prospective cohort was used to investigate the role of factors such as hospital presentation, time to surgery, fluid replacement therapy and type of anaesthesia on the early outcomes of emergency surgery. Patients whose initial diagnosis of rupture was unsubstantiated also provided insight into the range of differential diagnoses. The aim of this paper was to investigate the details of clinical practice that could be used to benefit future patients with ruptured AAA.

Care of the patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — areas in need of further research — Research is needed to discover pharmacologic agents to limit aneurysm enlargement, to characterize biomarkers or imaging-derived determinants of rupture risk, to design prostheses that resist infection and thrombosis, and to identify approaches that reliably treat type I and type II endoleaks. Areas of uncertainty also exist in applying existing technology, and the document proposes specific questions including whether prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis is needed for the patient undergoing EVAR, whether patients undergoing OSR at low or moderate risk benefit from heparin prophylaxis, what hemoglobin level necessitates transfusion in a stable postoperative patient without ongoing blood loss, what the optimal interval, imaging modality, and duration are for postoperative surveillance after aneurysm repair, whether a defined system of care with a time benchmark from first medical contact to intervention improves outcomes for ruptured aneurysm, which factors optimize outcomes within a system of care for ruptured aneurysm, and whether a single risk-benefit scoring scheme that incorporates repair risk, rupture risk, and anticipated life expectancy can be developed.

### An international, expert-based, Delphi consensus document on controversial issues in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^a4244939]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

As a result of conflicting, inadequate or controversial data in the literature, several issues concerning the management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) remain unanswered. The aim of this international, expert-based Delphi consensus document was to provide some guidance for clinicians on these controversial topics.

Methods

A three-round Delphi consensus document was produced with 44 experts on 6 prespecified topics regarding the management of AAAs. All answers were provided anonymously. The response rate for each round was 100%.

Results

Most participants (42 of 44 [95.4%]) agreed that a minimum case volume per year is essential (or probably essential) for a center to offer open or endovascular AAA repair (EVAR). Furthermore, 33 of 44 (75.0%) believed that AAA screening programs are (probably) still clinically effective and cost effective. Additionally, most panelists (36 of 44 [81.9%]) voted that surveillance after EVAR should be (or should probably be) lifelong. Finally, 35 of 44 participants (79.7%) thought that women smokers should (or should probably/possibly) be considered for screening at 65 years of age, similar to men. No consensus was achieved regarding lowering the threshold for AAA repair and the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in patients undergoing EVAR.

Conclusions

This expert-based Delphi consensus document provides guidance for clinicians regarding specific unresolved issues. Consensus could not be achieved on some topics, highlighting the need for further research in those areas.

### Observations from the IMPROVE trial concerning the clinical care of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [^6b03ad79]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Single-centre series of the management of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are usually too small to identify clinical factors that could improve patient outcomes.

Methods

IMPROVE is a pragmatic, multicentre randomized clinical trial in which eligible patients with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm were allocated to a strategy of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or to open repair. The influences of time and manner of hospital presentation, fluid volume status, type of anaesthesia, type of endovascular repair and time to aneurysm repair on 30-day mortality were investigated according to a prespecified plan, for the subgroup of patients with a proven diagnosis of ruptured or symptomatic AAA. Adjustment was made for potential confounding factors.

Results

Some 558 of 613 randomized patients had a symptomatic or ruptured aneurysm: diagnostic accuracy was 91·0 per cent. Patients randomized outside routine working hours had higher operative mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1·47, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·00 to 2·17). Mortality rates after primary and secondary presentation were similar. Lowest systolic blood pressure was strongly and independently associated with 30-day mortality (51 per cent among those with pressure below 70 mmHg). Patients who received EVAR under local anaesthesia alone had greatly reduced 30-day mortality compared with those who had general anaesthesia (adjusted OR 0·27, 0·10 to 0·70).

Conclusion

These findings suggest that the outcome of ruptured AAA might be improved by wider use of local anaesthesia for EVAR and that a minimum blood pressure of 70 mmHg is too low a threshold for permissive hypotension.

### Association of mortality and acute aortic events with ascending aortic aneurysm: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d907de32]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines for surgical thresholds for AsAA are based largely on expert consensus and retrospective observational studies with inconsistent data. In contrast, treatment guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are founded on extensive data and are widely accepted by the surgical community. Multiple large, multicenter randomized clinical trials that included more than 200 000 patients established the natural history of small AAA (< 55 mm) as well as proper surveillance for patients with this life-threatening disease. By comparing long-term outcomes of patients randomized to either the surveillance group (surgery if aneurysm size is > 55 mm or growth rate is > 10 mm/y) or the early surgery group, the trials have shown that for AAA smaller than 55 mm, the risk of early surgery outweighs the risk of rupture during surveillance and that women have a higher risk of rupture than men. On the other hand, the natural history of large AAA (> 55 mm) has also been explored in prospective studies in which patients with AAA larger than 55 mm who were not suitable surgical candidates were followed. Although most studies confirmed that large AAA has a higher rupture rate than small AAA, controversies exist on whether the difference in rupture rate reflects the difference between patients at high operative risk with severe comorbidities and the healthier patients randomized in clinical trials. Nonetheless, in contrast to the literature in the management of AAA, clinical trials that guide practice for AsAA do not currently exist and represent an important gap in knowledge for the condition's management.

Limitations

This study has a number of limitations. First, this is a meta-analysis of studies that included a heterogenous population with different initial mean aortic diameters, variable lengths of follow-up, and different imaging methods, which may introduce variability into the combined effect estimates. Second, most studies focused on a specific outcome of the natural history of AsAA, and information on all outcomes was not available in all studies. There were insufficient data available to perform analysis for factors associated with growth rate, the rate of composite outcome, or aortic size at acute aortic events. Third, more than half of the articles included were published prior to 2010 and therefore may not represent contemporary medical management of this disease. Fourth, there might be confounders that are not adjusted for in the studies included.

### The impact of the COVID-19 public health crisis on the surgical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^d3843a45]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 epidemic introduced significant systems- and disease-based uncertainty into Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) rupture management. The goal of this work was to evaluate whether short-term AAA rupture outcomes during COVID-19 were comparable to pre-COVID era outcomes and to explore the impact of COVID status and COVID era health-care systems restrictions on AAA rupture outcomes.

Methods

The Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried for all ruptured AAAs that underwent intervention from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2022. Patients were divided into pre-COVID (1/1/19–12/31/19) and COVID (4/1/20–8/31/22) cohorts. The COVID group was subdivided into COVID unknown, COVID-, and COVID + subgroups. 1/1–3/31/2020 was excluded due to COVID status uncertainty during this time. For the univariate analysis, categorical variables were compared using the Χ 2 test; continuous variables were compared either using a two-tailed heteroscedastic Student's t-test or analysis of variance. The multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression module of IBM SPSS Statistics (V25).

Results

2,145 cases (pre-COVID: 745; COVID: 1,400) of AAA rupture were collected. Only 4 documented cases of rupture repair occurred during April 2020 compared to pre-COVID average of 62.1 cases/month. Rupture case numbers recovered to pre-COVID volumes by September 2020. COVID + patients were less likely to be transferred from outside institutions and experienced delays to operating room arrival (time of symptom start to incision of 43.3 hours for COVID + vs. 24.4 hours for all COVID era). Although the COVID + mortality rate for AAA rupture was higher the overall COVID era mortality rate (31.4% vs. 24.9%) in the univariate analysis, this mortality difference went away with comorbid adjustments. However, COVID + patients were more likely to have untreated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, require postoperative ventilatory and vasopressor support, and undergo amputation rather than salvage for acute leg ischemia. No statistically significant differences between pre-COVID and COVID cohorts were observed with gender, race, age, smoking, cardiac history or perioperative events, dialysis or preoperative creatinine, prior aneurysm repair, intervention choice of open versus endovascular aneurysm repair, maximum AAA diameter, or postoperative length of stay.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 epidemic introduced numerous structural changes in health care, creating delays and obstacles to patients' abilities to receive prehospital and hospital care. Despite these systems-level obstacles with a highly morbid disease process, COVID era patients were not at an increased risk for mortality regardless of COVID status and were largely comparable to pre-COVID era patients.

Despite the intuitive advantages of endovascular repair (EVAR) of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), uncertainty remains about the optimal management in the absence of convincing high-quality evidence. Our objective was to undertake a comprehensive literature review and perform a meta-analysis of outcome data of treatment modalities for ruptured AAAs.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted of electronic information sources to identify studies comparing perioperative outcomes of EVAR and open repair for AAA rupture. Summary estimates of odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with a random-effects model. Meta-regression models were formed to explore potential heterogeneity as a result of changes in practice over time.

Results

We selected 41 studies for analysis. The entire meta-analysis population comprised 59,941 patients (8201 EVAR patients and 51,740 open repair patients). EVAR was associated with a significantly lower incidence of in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50–0.64; P < .01; meta-analysis of risk-adjusted observational studies and randomized controlled trials: OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46–0.73; P < .01). EVAR patients had a significantly decreased risk of developing respiratory complications (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.69; P < .01) and acute renal failure (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55–0.78; P < .01) and a trend toward a reduced incidence of cardiac complications (OR, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.00; P = 0.05) and mesenteric ischemia (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44–1.00; P = 0.05). Patients treated with EVAR had significantly less requirements of intraoperative blood transfusion (standardized mean difference, -0.88; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.70; P < .01). Random-effects meta-regression revealed no statistical evidence for an association between death and year of publication (P = 0.19).

Conclusions

Our analysis provides evidence to motivate the adoption of an EVAR-first policy in a nonelective setting and the establishment of standardized protocols for the management ruptured AAAs.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk by diameter — among patients unfit for repair in the Aneurysm Detection and Management (ADAM) trial, rupture risk was 9% per year for patients with aortic diameters between 5.5 and 5.9 cm, 10% for aneurysms between 6.0 and 6.9 cm, and 33% for those ≥ 7.0 cm; pooled analyses indicate current rupture risk may be as low as 5.3% per year for AAAs between 5.5 and 7.0 cm in diameter and 6.3% per year for AAAs > 7.0 cm, and among asymptomatic patients the risk of death from causes other than AAA was higher than the risk of death from aneurysm rupture.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk by size and evidence base — Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 0.5% to 5% for aneurysms ≤ 5 cm in maximum diameter, 3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥ 30% for aneurysms ≥ 8 cm; multiple trials that are now > 2 decades old evaluating early repair for AAAs measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm found no survival benefit but an increased risk of subsequent reintervention; accordingly, a threshold of ≥ 5.5 cm is acceptable for men with infrarenal AAA, women had higher rates of aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related deaths than men with a mean maximum aneurysm diameter at rupture of 5.0 cm in women and 6.0 cm in men, and in women ASI (aneurysm diameter [cm]/BSA [m2]) has been shown to be more predictive of rupture risk than maximum diameter.

### Analysis of the differences between the ESVS 2019 and NICE 2020 guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^e6e48e30]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim was to understand why two recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2020 guidelines and the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2019 guidelines, have discordant recommendations in several important areas.

Methods

A review of the approach, methodology, and evidence used by the two guideline committees was carried out to understand potential reasons for their differing recommendations in their two final published guidelines.

Results

NICE guidelines use a multidisciplinary committee to address a limited number of prospectively identified questions, using rigorous methods heavily reliant on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) supported by in house economic modelling, with the purpose of providing the best, cost-effective health care in the UK in 46 main recommendations. The ESVS guidelines use an expert committee to encourage clinical effectiveness across a range of European health economies. ESVS guideline topics, but not questions, are prospectively identified, assessment of evidence was less rigorous, and 125 recommendations were made. More up to date evidence searches by the ESVS committee partially underscore the differences in recommendations for screening women. The NICE committee did not consider sex specific analysis or evidence for thresholds for intervention but relied on sex specific modelling to support their advice to use endovascular repair (EVAR) for ruptures in women. Their recommendation to use open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in men aged < 71 years was based on in house economic modelling. NICE recommends an open first strategy for non-ruptured AAA mainly based on earlier RCTs and UK specific economic modelling, while the ESVS guidelines recommend an EVAR first strategy after consideration of modern, but lower quality, evidence from observational studies. Similar reasons explain differences in the recommended treatments of juxtarenal aneurysms.

Conclusion

Differences between the NICE and ESVS guidelines can be explained, at least in part, by their differing perspectives, methodologies, and quality assurance. Future ESVS guidelines may benefit from more multidisciplinary input and prospectively identified questions.

### Streamlining acute abdominal aortic dissection management-an AI-based CT imaging workflow [^6b1cc276]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) consists of the life-threatening conditions of aortic dissection (AD), intramural hematoma (IMH), and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU). In acute AD, tearing of the aortic vessel intima leads to uncontrolled blood inflow into the aortic wall. Incidence has been reported to range from 2.6 to 7.2 cases per 100,000 person-years and is associated with a reported in-hospital mortality of 30.1% in women and 21.0% in men, creating a substantial healthcare burden.

The event of acute AD can cause severe abdominal or back pain; however, in many cases, symptoms are nonspecific and driven by secondary complications like visceral ischemia, resulting in a relatively high rate of patients not initially being suspected of AD, thus receiving abdominal imaging for other reasons. Modern medical management of acute AD aims at early CT-based diagnosis and prompt therapy stratification. Whereas thoracic AD including the ascending part of the vessel (type A) typically requires immediate intervention, AD located more distally in the aorta (type B) in the absence of complications like rupture, malperfusion of visceral organs, spinal ischemia, or lower limb ischemia may be managed conservatively or with elective intervention. In CT imaging, acute AD can in many cases be distinguished from its chronic form, bearing the risk of development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), representing a chronic risk for rupture.

### Epidemiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^af6ff9eb]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease remains a major source of morbidity in developed countries and can progress to life-threatening rupture if left untreated, with exceedingly high mortality. The goal of AAA management is to identify and electively repair AAAs before rupture. AAA disease burden and outcomes have improved over time with declining tobacco use and advancements in care across patients' disease course. The introduction of endovascular AAA repair, in particular, has allowed for elective AAA repair in patients previously considered too high risk for open surgery and has contributed to lower rates of AAA rupture over time. However, these improved outcomes are not universally experienced, and disparities continue to exist in the detection, treatment, and outcomes of AAA by sex, race, and ethnicity. Mitigating these disparities requires enhanced, focused efforts at preventing disease, promoting health, and delivering appropriate care among an increasingly diverse patient population.

### Overview of aortic aneurysm management in the endovascular era [^1eee3358]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Management of aortic aneurysm disease has changed in the endovascular era, with the majority of patients opting for stent-graft repair of abdominal and thoracic aneurysms. An understanding of this vascular condition is important for primary care, emergency medicine, medicine specialists, and vascular surgeons alike. Awareness of the patient risk factors for aneurysmal degeneration, sac rupture, and medical management allows physicians to screen appropriate patient populations, which decreases aneurysm-related mortality due to rupture. The evolving endovascular techniques available today have made more patients eligible for this less-invasive repair, which has lower mortality and morbidity compared with open surgery with aorta replacement. This review provides contemporary information on the etiology, natural history, evaluation, and management of aortic aneurysm disease. The complications of prior aortic repair, whether performed via endovascular or open surgery intervention, are equally important to understanding not only for vascular surgeons performing these procedures, but also for primary care, emergency department, and medicine specialists who are evaluating these patients in an office or hospital setting.

### Medical management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^dc4f353a]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Medical management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is required for several different reasons. Since these patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular death therapy to reduce cardiovascular events is essential. Treatment is in line with the medical management of coronary artery disease including smoking cessation, statins and anti-platelet therapy. Some of these therapies also will slow aneurysm growth. Currently there is no proven focused therapy that reduces aneurysm growth, but the emerging strategies are discussed. Medical management also is required to reduce peri-operative risks and stabilise endovascular aneurysm repair. Whilst some of the therapies targeting cardiovascular risk reduction may be helpful, other emerging strategies are discussed.

### Challenges, controversies, and advances in aortic catastrophes [^d705b6f4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians (EPs) are commonly faced with life-threatening entities. Particularly challenging are the aortic catastrophes, such as penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs), intramural hematomas (IMHs), and atypical presentations of acute aortic dissections and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Several factors account for this: (1) the rapidly evolving knowledge (particularly in the pathogenesis and precursors of aortic dissection [AD]), (2) the lack of comfort caused by infrequent exposure, (3) the misconceptions about the work up and treatment, (4) the lack of emergent vascular surgery back up in the community, and finally (5) the high short-term mortality and missed rates. Finally, the media has publicized cases of celebrities and other patients who experienced fatal outcomes when their aortic catastrophes went undiagnosed. Practitioners of emergency care should, therefore, understand the challenges, be aware of the recent advances, and help limit the controversies in the evaluation and management of these patients.

### Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: is endovascular aneurysm repair the answer for everybody? [^c208b5ec]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment paradigms for elective repair of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have evolved during the past 2 decades, with endovascular aneurysm repair as the preferred treatment modality. The patient care strategy for emergent treatment for ruptured AAA is not as straightforward, due in part to surgeon expertise and stent-graft availability at the institution. Although most reports have extrapolated elective endovascular aneurysm repair feasibility data to the ruptured AAA patient and the aneurysm anatomy, these expectations should be interpreted with caution. In the absence of level I evidence, and lack of adequate local hospital resources, endovascular aneurysm repair-first policy might not be feasible for all the patients who present with ruptured AAA.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm — transfer decision-making and intra-transfer management: With the increasing use of endovascular methods to treat patients presenting with a ruptured AAA, vital resources, including advanced imaging, trained staff, and robust endovascular inventory, must be available; in cases in which transfer is not necessary, the vascular team should be notified as soon as a ruptured AAA is suspected, but it may be prudent, however, to transfer a patient to a higher level facility when such resources are unavailable. Patients with good functional status and without severe comorbidity should be transferred without delay, and the urge to offer endovascular repair to patients anatomically unsuitable for such repair should be strongly resisted. Direct physician-to-physician phone handoff is necessary for all patients being transferred; it is imperative that relevant imaging be transmitted, preferably by an electronic method, and patients should receive intravenous nitroglycerin, esmolol, sodium nitroprusside, and pain medication, as needed, to avoid hypertension and to minimize the risk of uncontained rupture. Permissive hypotension is appropriate with limited resuscitation and should be maintained during transfer, and blood products are preferred to treat hypotension, but transfer should not be delayed if blood products are not readily available.

Aortic disease — synopsis highlights risk and treatment emphasis: Hypertension is a major risk factor for AD, including thoracic aortic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection, resulting in AD-related mortality. The risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture increases by 30% for each 10 mm Hg elevation in BP levels. Intensive BP management and optimal BP control (< 130/80 mm Hg) are important for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with hypertension and AD, although patients may be asymptomatic. BB are recommended, although limited data exist on the optimal choice of antihypertensive medication and have generally been extrapolated from acute aortic syndrome management, such as for acute aortic dissection.

### Will stent-graft repair emerge as treatment of choice for acute type B dissection? [^9b2b9d02]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Endovascular stent grafts are now accepted globally and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an alternative to open surgical repair for patients with descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. However, as opposed to the abdominal aorta, application of this technology to manage thoracic aortic disease is not limited to degenerative aneurysms. In fact, international registries and surveys estimate that only 60% of the thoracic cases managed currently with stent-graft placement are aneurysms. The remainder of this experience includes acute dissection, chronic dissection, traumatic aortic injury, penetrating ulcer, intramural hematoma, aortic fistula, anastomotic pseudoaneurysm, and an embolizing lesion. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the present devices used in these nonaneurysmal applications are not designed to address the unique anatomical and pathological features that these lesions present. Consequently, in the future, it is possible that we will see stent-graft designs that focus specifically on the challenges of some of the nonaneurysmal thoracic aortic pathologies.

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^5acc12f4]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a focal expansion of the abdominal aorta usually diagnosed by maximum aortic diameter of ≥ 30 mm on imaging. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic unless it ruptures which is fatal without successful surgical repair. It was reported that in 2017 there were 167 200 deaths and 3 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide attributable to AAA, although due to the low rates of post-mortems, it is likely these estimates are inaccurate. Efforts to reduce AAA-related burden have focused on early identification and improved surgical treatment. Randomized trials found that ultrasound screening in men aged ≥ 65 years to identify cases for elective repair reduced aneurysm-related mortality, but the effect on all-cause mortality is controversial with one analysis showing a small significant reduction and a more recent one not confirming this. Ultrasound screening of high-risk groups has been introduced in a number of countries, including Sweden, the UK, and the USA. With declining smoking rates, the age-adjusted prevalence of AAA has fallen in some countries, leading to questions about how screening can be delivered in the most cost-effective and ethical way. The widespread use of abdominal imaging has led to many asymptomatic AAA being identified incidentally, and advances in artificial intelligence are facilitating automatic referral to vascular surgeons and surveillance programs. There have been tremendous advances in minimally invasive devices for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but durability of this treatment remains a problem, and rupture can still occur.

### Computed tomographic angiography of the abdominal aorta [^27e276aa]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) has become the preferred imaging test of choice for various aortic conditions because of its excellent spatial resolution, rapid image acquisition, and its wide availability. CTA provides a robust tool for planning aortic interventions and diagnosing acute and chronic vascular diseases in the abdomen. CTA is the standard for imaging aneurysms before intervention and evaluating the aorta in the acute setting to assess traumatic injury, dissection, and aneurysm rupture. Knowledge of the imaging features of these disease processes, inflammatory vasculitides, and occlusive atherosclerotic disease is essential for guiding surgical and medical management of patients.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment thresholds and indications — Most AAAs are fusiform rather than saccular, and treatment recommendations for asymptomatic fusiform AAA rest primarily on the maximum transverse diameter as measured on ultrasound, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional arteriography can easily underestimate the true diameter by not accounting for luminal thrombus. There is general agreement that small aneurysms, < 4.0 cm in maximum diameter, are at low risk of rupture and should be monitored, whereas an aneurysm > 5.4 cm in diameter should be repaired in an otherwise healthy patient. Elective repair is also recommended for patients who present with a saccular aneurysm, and when an unrecognized AAA first presents symptomatically with abdominal or back pain or rupture, prompt treatment is recommended.

Treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with statins — In patients with AAA and evidence of aortic atherosclerosis, statin therapy at moderate or high intensity is recommended; in patients with AAA but no evidence of atherosclerosis, statin therapy may be considered. AAA of atherosclerotic cause is considered a coronary artery disease equivalent, with a > 20% risk of a cardiovascular event within 10 years, and intensive cholesterol lowering in patients with ASCVD reduces major cardiovascular events by an additional 15% beyond what is achieved with less intensive cholesterol lowering. Observational and registry data show associations between statins and improved outcomes in AAA, including decreased 30-day mortality in ruptured AAA (46.1% versus 59.3%; adjusted mortality rate, 0.80), improved 5-year survival in 5,892 registry patients (81% for statin users versus 77%; P = 0.005), and improved 1- and 5-year survival in a registry-based study of 37,950 patients started on statins before discharge. A meta-analysis reported slower aneurysm growth, reduced risk of rupture, and lower 30-day mortality after aortic repair, although it was not possible to distinguish benefits in those without atherosclerosis; a single prospective cohort study during long-term surveillance had not shown slowed AAA growth or direct effects on matrix metalloproteinase-9 or interleukin-6 concentrations.

### Management of acute aortic syndromes from initial presentation to definitive treatment [^eeced236]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute aortic syndromes comprise a spectrum of diseases including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. Early diagnosis, rapid intervention, and multidisciplinary team care are vital to efficiently manage time-sensitive aortic emergencies, mobilize appropriate resources, and optimize clinical outcomes.

Objective

This comprehensive review outlines the multidisciplinary team approach from initial presentation to definitive interventional treatment and post-operative care.

Discussion

Acute aortic syndromes can be life-threatening and require prompt diagnosis and aggressive initiation of blood pressure and pain control to prevent subsequent complications. Early time to diagnosis and intervention are associated with improved outcomes.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary team can help promptly diagnose and manage aortic syndromes.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^944fa37d]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^68433c0e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An abnormal dilatation of the abdominal aorta is referred to as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Due to the risk of rupture, surgical repair is offered electively to individuals with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm in size. Traditionally, conventional open surgical repair (OSR) was considered the first choice approach. However, over the past two decades endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gained popularity as a treatment option. This article intends to review the role of EVAR in the management of elective AAA.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of EVAR versus conventional OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery, and EVAR versus best medical care in those considered unfit for surgery. This was determined by the effect on short, intermediate and long-term mortality, endograft related complications, re-intervention rates and major complications.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (January 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12). The TSC also searched trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing EVAR with OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery. and comparing EVAR with best medical care in individuals considered unfit for surgery. We excluded studies with inadequate data or using an inadequate randomisation technique.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently evaluated trials for appropriateness for inclusion and extracted data using pro forma designed by the Cochrane PVD Group. We assessed the quality of trials using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. We entered collected data in to Review Manager (version 5.2.3) for analysis. Where direct comparisons could be made, we determined odds ratios (OR). We tested studies for heterogeneity and, when present, we used a random-effects model; otherwise we used a fixed-effect model. We tabulated data that could not be collated.

Main Results

Four high-quality trials comparing EVAR with OSR (n = 2790) and one high-quality trial comparing EVAR with no intervention (n = 404) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In individuals considered fit for surgery, a pooled analysis, including 1362 individuals randomised to EVAR and 1361 randomised to OSR, found short-term mortality (including 30-day or inhospital mortality, excluding deaths prior to intervention) with EVAR to be significantly lower than with OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.55; P < 0.0001). Using intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) there was no significant difference in mortality at intermediate follow-up (up to four years from randomisation), with 221 (15.8%) and 237 (17%) deaths in the EVAR (n = 1393) and OSR (n = 1390) groups, respectively (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; P = 0.40). There was also no significant difference in long-term mortality (beyond four years), with 464 (37.3%) deaths in the EVAR and 470 (37.8%) deaths in the OSR group (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; P = 0.78). Similarly, there was no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality between groups, either at the intermediate- or long-term follow up. Studies showed that both EVAR and OSR were associated with similar incidences of cardiac deaths (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P = 0.36) and fatal stroke rate (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55; P = 0.52). The long-term reintervention rate was significantly higher in the EVAR group than in the OSR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02; I(2) = 85%). Results of the reintervention analysis should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the EVAR and OSR groups. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006). In individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR, the one included trial found no difference between the EVAR and no-intervention groups with regard to all-cause mortality at final follow up, with 21.0 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 22.1 deaths per 100 person years in the no-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with EVAR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97). Aneurysm-related deaths were, however, significantly higher in the no-intervention group than in the EVAR group (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02). There was no difference in myocardial events (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91) between the groups in this study.

Authors' Conclusions

In individuals considered fit for conventional surgery, EVAR was associated with lower short-term mortality than OSR. However, this benefit from EVAR did not persist at the intermediate- and long-term follow ups. Individuals undergoing EVAR had a higher reintervention rate than those undergoing OSR. Most of the reinterventions undertaken following EVAR, however, were catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between EVAR and OSR. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group. In individuals considered unfit for open surgery, the results of a single trial found no overall short- or long-term benefits of EVAR over no intervention with regard to all-cause mortality, but individuals may differ and individual preferences should always be taken into account.

### Endovascular strategy or open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: one-year outcomes from the IMPROVE randomized trial [^049b686c]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is fatal in over 80% of cases and operative mortality remains high in those who survive to undergo repair (42%). The majority of patients in Europe, the USA, and elsewhere is treated with open surgical repair rather than the less invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) – and emergency EVAR is not available, or not always available, in many centres. Following a small pilot trial, three larger European randomized trials of endovascular vs. open repair of ruptured aneurysms were established, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that 30-day outcomes were better after either endovascular repair or an endovascular strategy: observational studies suggest that operative mortality after emergency endovascular repair is in the range of 16–36%, varying with haemodynamic stability. The conventional reporting standard for surgery is 30-day mortality and all three later randomized trials have reported this outcome recently. – In the two smaller trials, which recruited a limited range of patients, who were fit for open repair and after CT scan deemed anatomically suitable for EVAR, 30-day mortality (20–25%) was similar in patients randomized to EVAR vs. open repair. The much larger IMPROVE trial, randomized patients at the point of in-hospital clinical diagnosis, when vascular teams were alerted, but before a CT scan had confirmed either the diagnosis or the anatomical suitability for EVAR. Randomization was to an endovascular strategy (EVAR wherever possible, with open repair for those anatomically unsuitable for standard EVAR) vs. open repair. The aim of this trial was to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a preferential endovascular strategy for the management of suspected ruptured AAA. Again there was no 30-day survival benefit for the endovascular strategy, except perhaps in women, with overall mortality ∼35%.

An editorial commentary on the 30-day outcomes of the IMPROVE trial emphasized correctly that modern intensive care permitted more patients to survive to 30 days, with many patients still being in hospital at 30 days, so that only an assessment of longer term outcomes, to 90 days and beyond, would provide the requisite evidence for both clinical and patient decision-making. This need for longer term data also is endorsed by a recent Cochrane review and the IDEAL recommendations. To the patients and their families involved in the design of the IMPROVE trial, the most important outcome was going home without major complications. Here we report the 1-year pre-specified outcomes from the IMPROVE trial.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) symptomatic imaging — In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether an AAA is present and to evaluate for other causes; if an aneurysm is detected, the patient should have CT arteriography with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, and if hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves during evaluation, further imaging studies should be abandoned as care is escalated. We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric mass or significant risk factors for AAA, with Level of recommendation 1 (Strong) and Quality of evidence B (Moderate).

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^d4ae9e49]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current management of AAA is by imaging surveillance of small aneurysm and surgical repair of large, symptomatic, or ruptured aneurysms. Patients and clinicians require effective drug therapies to limit AAA growth and the risks of both AAA repair and rupture. The diabetes drug metformin holds some promise and is being evaluated in ongoing trials. Other areas that could be targeted regarding development of drugs are dyslipidemia, IL-6 signalling, and stabilization of the extracellular matrix.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair — endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open surgery shows lower perioperative mortality with EVAR (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.2–0.66), with this advantage persisting at 6 months before survival becomes equivalent; after 8 years EVAR is associated with higher aneurysm-related death (hazard ratio, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.6–16.4), secondary intervention (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7–2.7), aneurysm rupture (OR 5; 95% CI, 1.1–23.3), and death attributable to rupture (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9–6.8), while observational data indicate the EVAR survival advantage lasted longer among older patients and that fenestrated repair has a similar early survival advantage over complex open repair in the first 30 days after surgery.

Regarding inpatient care for abdominal aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome, ESVS 2019 guidelines recommend to monitor intra-abdominal pressure in all patients undergoing open or endovascular treatment for ruptured AAA, in order to achieve early diagnosis and management of intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome.

### EVAR for ruptured aneurysms: are the data complete? [^aab1982b]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair is now the preferred therapy for many patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms and has been associated with reduced immediate and short-term morbidity and mortality. Because perioperative complications so often compromise the open repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms, EVAR has been considered as an attractive option in these patients. A number of small, typically single-center studies have demonstrated excellent results. In the absence of compelling, objective clinical data, there are certainly many patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms who are well-suited for EVAR. The development of protocols and systems for the expeditious diagnosis and treatment of ruptured aneurysms should further improve therapy for this life-threatening condition.
