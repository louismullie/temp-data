## Question

please explain this if i was a 5th grader Sporadic partial-thickness cartilage thinning and/or
blistering as described. No full-thickness cartilage defect or
subchondral edema.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of "sporadic partial-thickness cartilage thinning and/or blistering, no full-thickness defect or subchondral edema" in a way a 5th grader would understand, while preserving the step-by-step thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomy and normal function of articular cartilage. Then, I should clarify what "partial-thickness" means and how it differs from "full-thickness". Next, I will interpret "thinning" and "blistering" in plain language. After that, I need to check what "subchondral edema" signifies and why its absence matters. Then, I will consider what "sporadic" implies about distribution. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical significance, prognosis, and practical next steps, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the basics: articular cartilage is the smooth, white cushion that coats the ends of bones in a joint, letting them glide and absorb shock; it has no blood vessels or nerves, so it cannot heal well on its own, which is why even small injuries can persist or slowly worsen over time [^114Mdb2i] [^115wS8wC].

> Now, I need to explain "partial-thickness". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this does not mean the damage goes all the way through the cartilage; it means the injury is like a scratch or dent that only goes partway into the cushion, not down to the bone, whereas "full-thickness" means the damage pierces through the entire cushion and exposes the bone underneath, which is a more serious problem with different healing potential [^114yLakr] [^112W7DHm].

> Next, I should translate "thinning" and "blistering". Thinning means the cushion is getting a bit worn down in spots, like a favorite spot on a couch that flattens with use; blistering means the surface is starting to bubble or separate a little, like a tiny pocket forming under wallpaper, which is an early sign of cartilage softening or delamination rather than a full tear [^111sWUWk] [^112W7DHm].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of "no full-thickness defect". This is good news because it means the damage has not punched through the entire cushion to expose bone; when bone is exposed, the joint is more likely to hurt and the risk of arthritis progression rises, so staying partial-thickness is a better scenario for symptoms and future joint health [^114yLakr] [^111p55Mr].

> I will now examine "no subchondral edema". Subchondral edema, more accurately called bone marrow edema–like signal, shows up on MRI as a bright area in the bone just under the cartilage and usually reflects stress, microdamage, or bone remodeling; its absence here suggests the bone underneath is not currently inflamed or bruised, which is reassuring and often correlates with less pain and a more favorable short-term outlook [^111RB3ca] [^112J1rpo].

> But wait, what if the report said "sporadic"? I should confirm what that implies: sporadic means the thinning or blistering is scattered in small patches rather than one big continuous area, which often reflects early, localized wear rather than widespread disease; however, even small focal defects can increase the chance of new damage nearby over time, so we should not ignore them even if they are small and scattered [^111fSV11].

> Let me think about the clinical significance and prognosis. Partial-thickness defects are less likely to cause severe pain than full-thickness lesions, but they can still contribute to discomfort, swelling, or mechanical symptoms; importantly, they have limited innate healing capacity, so they may persist or slowly progress, and they can increase the risk of developing new cartilage damage in the same compartment over time, especially in people at risk for osteoarthritis [^111p55Mr] [^111fSV11].

> Hold on, I should verify management implications. Because there is no full-thickness loss and no subchondral edema, aggressive surgery is usually not indicated; instead, the focus is on protecting the joint, reducing aggravating loads, and strengthening the muscles around the joint to offload the damaged areas, with activity modification, weight optimization, and targeted physical therapy as first-line strategies; if symptoms persist or progress, clinicians may consider injections or, rarely, cartilage-preserving procedures, but evidence for surgery in mild disease is limited and should be individualized [^116KGL5r].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that partial-thickness lesions never cause pain; let me reconsider. While cartilage itself has no nerves, pain can still arise from the underlying bone, synovium, or periarticular tissues when mechanical stress is abnormal, so even partial-thickness changes can be symptomatic depending on location, size, and joint mechanics, which is why careful clinical correlation and management are still important despite the relatively favorable imaging picture here [^111p55Mr] [^115vKvBD].

> In summary, and to keep this at a 5th-grade level: the cushion coating the bone is a bit worn and has some tiny bubbles in places, but it is not cracked all the way through and the bone underneath looks calm right now; that means it is a mild, early injury that needs protection and smart exercise rather than surgery, though we should keep an eye on it because small spots like these can sometimes lead to more wear nearby over time [^111fSV11] [^116KGL5r].

---

The report means the **cartilage is slightly worn or has small bubbles** [^112W7DHm], but it is not cracked all the way through [^114yLakr] and the bone underneath is not swollen or bruised [^notfound]. This is a **mild, early change** that may not cause pain or need surgery, but it can get worse over time, so gentle activity, weight control, and watching for new symptoms are sensible next steps [^116KGL5r] [^111fSV11].

---

## Cartilage: the joint's smooth coating

Think of cartilage as a **smooth, slippery coating** on the ends of bones that lets them glide and cushions impacts; it has no blood supply, so it heals poorly when damaged [^114Mdb2i] [^115wS8wC].

---

## What "partial-thickness cartilage thinning" means

Partial-thickness thinning means the cartilage is **worn down partway**, like a carpet that's only slightly flattened — not all the way through — so the bone is still covered and protected [^112W7DHm].

---

## What "blistering" means

Blistering means the cartilage surface has **tiny fluid-filled pockets or bubbles**, like small blisters under paint; they show early cartilage softening or separation, but the surface is not fully broken [^112W7DHm].

---

## What "no full-thickness cartilage defect" means

This means the cartilage is **not cracked all the way through**; the bone underneath is still covered, which is better than a full-thickness defect that exposes bone and can hurt more and heal poorly [^114yLakr] [^111p55Mr].

---

## What "no subchondral edema" means

This means the bone just under the cartilage is **not swollen or bruised**; subchondral edema often signals stress injury or early arthritis, so its absence is reassuring [^113otjQ3] [^112J1rpo].

---

## Why this matters

This pattern is a **mild, early sign of cartilage wear**; it may not cause pain now, but it shows the joint is starting to age or stress, and it could worsen over time [^111fSV11] [^1165uZRk].

---

## What this means for treatment and prognosis

- **No surgery now**: Partial-thickness damage usually does not need surgery; it cannot heal fully on its own, but it may stay stable for years [^115wS8wC].
- **Activity and weight matter**: Gentle exercise, weight control, and avoiding heavy impact can slow further wear [^112kmTJy].
- **Watch for changes**: New pain, swelling, or mechanical symptoms should prompt a check-up, as they could mean worsening damage [^111kwtVm].

---

## Simple summary

Your cartilage is **slightly worn with small bubbles**, but it is not cracked through and the bone underneath is not bruised; this is a mild, early change that may not hurt now, but it deserves care to help prevent it from getting worse [^114yLakr] [^111p55Mr].

### Advances in articular cartilage repair [^115wS8wC]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Many joint and systemic disorders may lead to cartilage defects. Partial thickness defects of the articular cartilage do not have healing potential. When the lesion reaches the subchondral bone, spontaneous healing may be observed, but consists of fibrocartilaginous tissue. The main efforts for cartilage repair are targeted at filling of the cartilage defect with a tissue that possesses the same mechanical properties with hyaline cartilage and the consolidation of this tissue with the native articular cartilage. There are various arthroscopic techniques and although they provide pain relief, they do not restore the damaged cartilage. Osteochondral transplantation is more effective in dealing with small or medium size full thickness defects, but further efforts are required in order to reduce the donor site morbidity, marginal necrosis and partial covering of the defect.

Bone marrow edema (BME) is a descriptive term used to describe high-signal intensity changes detected on magnetic resonance fluid-sensitive sequences that could be attributed to a number of underlying pathologies. Regardless of the cause, physiologic remodeling of the subchondral bone can be limited because of ongoing joint forces, increased focalization of stress, and reduced healing capacity of the subchondral bone. BME is a known prognostic factor associated with pain, dysfunction, and progressive cartilage damage. This review summarizes the current known causes of BMEs, theories related to histopathological changes, and current treatment options including novel biologic surgical options.

### Surgical interventions for symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis [^116KGL5r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis affecting the knee is common and represents a continuum of disease from early cartilage thinning to full-thickness cartilage loss, bony erosion, and deformity. Many studies do not stratify their results based on the severity of the disease at baseline or recruitment.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgical intervention for the management of symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis defined as knee pain and radiographic evidence of non-end stage osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1, 2, 3 or equivalent on MRI/arthroscopy). Outcomes of interest included pain, function, radiographic progression, quality of life, short-term serious adverse events, re-operation rates and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase up to May 2018. We also conducted searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. Authors of trials were contacted if some but not all their participants appeared to fit our inclusion criteria.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared surgery to non-surgical interventions (including sham and placebo control groups, exercise or physiotherapy, and analgesic or other medication), injectable therapies, and trials that compared one type of surgical intervention to another surgical intervention in people with symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data using standardised forms. We analysed the quality of evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

A total of five studies involving 566 participants were identified as eligible for this review. Single studies compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy to physical therapy (320 participants), arthroscopic surgery (debridement ± synovectomy ± chondroplasty) to closed needle joint lavage with saline (32 participants) and high tibial osteotomy surgery to knee joint distraction surgery (62 participants). Two studies (152 participants) compared arthroscopic surgery (washout ± debridement; debridement) to a hyaluronic acid injection. Only one study was at low risk of selection bias, and due to the difficulty of blinding participants to their treatment, all studies were at risk of performance and detection bias. Reporting of results in this summary has been restricted to the primary comparison: surgical intervention versus non-surgical intervention. A single study, included 320 participants with symptoms consistent with meniscal tear. All subjects had the meniscal tear confirmed on knee MRI and radiographic evidence of mild to moderate osteoarthritis (osteophytes, cartilage defect or joint space narrowing). Patients with severe osteoarthritis (KL grade 4) were excluded. The study compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and physical therapy to physical therapy alone (a six-week individualised progressive home exercise program). This study was at low risk of selection bias and outcome reporting biases, but was susceptible to performance and detection biases. A high rate of cross-over (30.2%) occurred from the physical therapy group to the arthroscopic group. Low-quality evidence suggests there may be little difference in pain and function at 12 months follow-up in people who have arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and those who have physical therapy. Evidence was downgraded to low quality due to risk of bias and imprecision. Mean pain was 19.3 points on a 0 to 100 point KOOS pain scale with physical therapy at 12 months follow-up and was 0.2 points better with surgery (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.05 better to 3.65 points worse with surgery, an absolute improvement of 0.2% (95% CI 4% better to 4% worse) and relative improvement 0.4% (95% CI 9% better to 8% worse) (low quality evidence). Mean function was 14.5 on a 0 to 100 point KOOS function scale with physical therapy at 12 months follow-up and 0.8 points better with surgery (95% CI 4.3 better to 2.7 worse); 0.8% absolute improvement (95% CI 4% better to 3% worse) and 2.1% relative improvement (95% CI 11% better to 7% worse) (low quality evidence). Radiographic structural osteoarthritis progression and quality of life outcomes were not reported. Due to very low quality evidence, we are uncertain if surgery is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, incidence of total knee replacement or withdrawal rates. Evidence was downgraded twice due to very low event rates, and once for risk of bias. At 12 months, the surgery group had a total of three serious adverse events including fatal pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and hypoxaemia. The physical therapy alone group had two serious adverse events including sudden death and stroke (Peto OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.21); 1% more events with surgery (95% CI 2% less to 3% more) and 58% relative change (95% CI 73% less to 821% more). One participant in each group withdrew due to adverse events. Two of 164 participants (1.2%) in the physical therapy group and three of 156 in the surgery group underwent conversion to total knee replacement within 12 months (Peto OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 7.13); 1% more events with surgery (95% CI 2% less to 5% more); 76% relative change (95% CI 57% less to 613% more).

Authors' Conclusions

The review found no placebo-or sham-controlled trials of surgery in participants with symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. There was low quality evidence that there may be no evidence of a difference between arthroscopic partial meniscectomy surgery and a home exercise program for the treatment of this condition. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a few small trials indicates there may not be any benefit of arthroscopic surgery over other non-surgical treatments including saline irrigation and hyaluronic acid injection, or one type of surgery over another. We are uncertain of the risk of adverse events or of progressing to total knee replacement due to very small event rates. Thus, there is uncertainty around the current evidence to support or oppose the use of surgery in mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. As no benefit has been demonstrated from the low quality trials included in this review, it is possible that future higher quality trials for these surgical interventions may not contradict these results.

Cartilage defects

Cartilage lesions are best divided according to their depth into partial-thickness and full-thickens defects. A somewhat distinct category are osteochondral lesions. According to recent studies, partial and full-thickness lesions can progress and even regress from one into another. Partial-thickness lesions are considered less symptomatic, and there is little evidence for their progression onto osteoarthritis. Full-thickness chondral and osteochondral lesions frequently cause symptoms, and they are generally believed to predispose to premature osteoarthritis. The cause of the pain in these patients is probably multifactorial and derived mainly from the subchondral bone and peri-articular tissues, although a local rise in intraosseous pressure may play an important role as well. Early focal lesions seen in aging exhibit molecular changes in the extracellular matrix similar to those observed in osteoarthritis. Moreover, the cartilage from the edge of debrided articular defects was inferior to that from a standard donor site when used for autologous chondrocyte cultivation. Focal chondral and osteochondral lesions are common, and they were encountered in about 20% of knee arthroscopies, but also in about 40% of knee MRI's in healthy subjects without a family history of knee osteoarthritis. Not all of these lesions were related to trauma, and a significant proportion of them were asymptomatic. The scientific evidence on which lesions and under what circumstances in the knee would progress to osteoarthritis is limited. An in vitro study on human cadaveric material determined the influence of osteochondral defect size on defect rim stress concentration, peak rim stress, and load redistribution to adjacent cartilage over the weight-bearing area of the medial and lateral femoral condyles. Rim stress concentration was demonstrated for osteochondral defects 10 mm and greater in size. The structural changes in the subchondral endplate might be a precursor for lesion's degenerative progression. As defect size increases, more surface area of exposed subchondral bone is contacted by the opposing articular surface, causing endplate stiffening and microcracks. An in vitro study on bovine condyles established that a critical defect area for the subchondral endplate contact was over 1.61 cm² for lateral condyle and 1.99 cm² for medial condyle. Critical defect size is defined as the defect size above which no spontaneous healing occurs. Although the term does not take into account the most important factor of lesion healing response, depth, it is still widely used. The reported critical size defects in animals (given in volumes to allow rough inter-species comparison) range from 18 mm³ in dogs to 142 mm³ in horses. Various animal models have helped us to understand the biology of cartilage repair. However, due to the anatomical and biomechanical differences, the animal models cannot give evidence on the natural history of cartilage defects in humans.

### Brief report: partial-and full-thickness focal cartilage defects contribute equally to development of new cartilage damage in knee osteoarthritis: the multicenter osteoarthritis study [^111fSV11]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk of incident cartilage damage at follow-up in subregions that are undamaged at baseline, by comparing tibiofemoral joint compartments with a baseline focal partial-thickness or full-thickness cartilage defect against compartments without any baseline cartilage damage, in knees with and those without radiographic osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

We included participants in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study for whom there were semiquantitative magnetic resonance imaging readings at baseline and at 30 months. We estimated the risk of incident cartilage defects developing in tibiofemoral compartments with prevalent partial-thickness and full-thickness cartilage defects in only one subregion within the compartment, using tibiofemoral compartments with no baseline cartilage defects as a referent. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used for all analyses, with adjustments for confounders.

Results

A total of 374 compartments (359 knees) were included, and 140 knees (39%) had radiographic OA. Compared to compartments with no baseline cartilage defects, those with partial-thickness (adjusted odds ratio 1.62 [95% confidence interval 1.06–2.47]) and full-thickness (adjusted odds ratio 1.92 [95% confidence interval 1.00–3.66]) cartilage defects in a subregion had a higher risk of incident cartilage defects in other subregions in the same compartment.

Conclusion

Prevalent focal cartilage defects, regardless of defect depth, in a single subregion within a tibiofemoral joint compartment increase the risk of developing new cartilage damage in other subregions of the same compartment for middle-aged to elderly persons with or at high risk of knee OA.

### Joint chondrolysis [^11799CFy]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Although the disease was first described in the hip, reports of chondrolysis in nearly all diarthrodial joints have since emerged with considerable variations in the literature. Despite speculation among clinicians and researchers about the implicit causal pathways and etiologic contributors associated with chondrolysis, definitive answers remain elusive. The term chondrolysis has been applied to varied levels of joint cartilage destruction from focal chondral defects to diffuse cartilage loss, revealing a lack of consistency in the application of diagnostic criteria to guide differential disease classification. Differentiating between the various potential etiologies associated with chondrolysis provides opportunities for the prevention of the disease.

### A treatment algorithm for the management of articular cartilage defects [^116Xn2cG]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical consequences of articular cartilage defects of the knee are pain, swelling, mechanical symptoms, athletic and functional disability, and osteoarthritis. Full thickness articular cartilage defects have a poor capacity to heal. The challenge to restore the articular cartilage surface is multidimensional, faced by basic scientists in the laboratory and orthopedic surgeons in the operating room. This article provides an overview of the contemporary treatment options available for the restoration of articular cartilage defects of the knee.

### The subchondral bone in articular cartilage repair: current problems in the surgical management [^114o7A27]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Recently, subchondral bone again has come more into the spotlight again. Better understanding of the subchondral bone, and the interface and interaction between cartilage and the subchondral bone may help us solve some of these problems. This field of osteoarticular repair continues to evolve. New scaffolds are being introduced without thorough clinical evaluation. Companies sponsor testing of their own products in registries or even randomized controlled trials, injecting potential bias into these studies. Independent randomized controlled trials, registers and observational studies are needed to improve in this field. These principles also have to be applied to the new treatments aimed at repair of the subchondral bone. Randomized controlled trials are best suited for answering a therapeutic question, but they are difficult to perform and not always feasible. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies need to include enough patients, and therefore multi-center studies (national and international) having adequate power will be the future. Observational studies and even case series will still be useful by providing important information on natural history, prognostic factors, adverse treatment effects, and prevalence of certain diseases or outcomes.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^112W7DHm]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of semiquantitative structural abnormalities from MRI

The MRI-based features of structural abnormalities, such as knee cartilage defects and BMLs, were measured on an ordinal scale from MRIs. Cartilage defects were assessed using the T1-weighted spoiled gradient recalled sagittal MRIs and proton density-weighted fast spin echo coronal MRIs, as reported elsewhere. The presence of any cartilage defect was defined as a grade ≥ 2 at any site within that compartment, as we reported before using a modified Outerbridge Classification scale. Briefly, grade 0 indicated normal cartilage, grade 1 indicated focal blistering, grade 2 indicated a loss of thickness of < 50%, grade 3 represented a loss of thickness > 50% and grade 4 indicated full-thickness chondral wear with the exposed subchondral bone. BMLs were measured in the tibia, femur and patellar region using the sagittal images reformatted from coronal proton density weighted images on an ordinal scoring system, as described in our previous reports. Briefly, participants without any BMLs were graded as 0 and subsequently were graded as per the percentage of the area of occupancy of BMLs, i.e.g.rade 1, ≤ 25% of the area; grade 2, > 25– < 50%; grade 3, > 50%. A BML grade ≥ 1 at any site within that compartment was defined as prevalent BML. The intra-observer reliability, i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), from cartilage defects and BMLs ranged from 0.89 to 0.94.

Measurement of morphological markers from MRI

Morphological MRI-based markers (quantitative biomarkers), such as cartilage thickness, cartilage volume and subchondral bone area, were measured in the medial femorotibial compartment (MFTC)/lateral femorotibial compartment (LFTC) and the patellar region by a quantitative approach using the T1-weighted spoiled gradient recalled sagittal MRIs, as described elsewhere. The quantitative parameters of cartilage and bone morphology (cartilage thickness, cartilage volume and subchondral bone area) were derived from the segmented voxels and 3D reconstruction of the cartilage surface areas using Chondrometrics 3.0 software (Chondrometrics, Ainring, Germany). Previous reported reproducibility of these parameters, with root mean square coefficient of variation values, ranged from 1.6 to 3.2% for cartilage thickness, 1.6 to 3.4% for cartilage volume and 1.0 to 2.1% for bone area.

We recommend reporting ligament pathology as full- or partial-thickness tears, bearing in mind the limitations of MRI in diagnosing partial tears. Searching for indirect signs of ligament insufficiency or deficiency as well as evaluation of joint malalignment may increase confidence in diagnosis. Level of evidence 5/Low (Fig. 2 A–D).

Cartilage and osteochondral lesions

The femoral, tibial, and retropatellar surfaces are capped with articular cartilage. Pathology is seen on fluid-sensitive sequences as high signal abnormalities. Cartilage pathology should be reported according to the depth of the lesion, graded as laceration/fibrillation when < 50%, and full thickness when > 50%, extending into the subchondral bone. One should be aware that MRI underestimates cartilage lesions. A cartilage lesion can progress and affect the underlying bone and bone marrow, to an osteochondral lesion. The term osteochondral lesion encompasses several different entities. In osteochondritis dissecans, there is disruption of endochondral ossification in the epiphysis, which results in an unstable fragment. If the fragment is displaced, it becomes an osteochondral defect (Fig. 4 A–D). Any focal defect visible in the cartilage, as well as the underlying bone, may be called an osteochondral defect. Traumatic or insufficiency subchondral fractures (Fig. 5 A–C), osteochondritis dissecans, avascular necrosis, and degenerative disease, all of which have different underlying pathophysiology, might progress into an osteochondral defect — the end state. If one is uncertain which subgroup the lesion belongs to, one can safely use "osteochondral lesion(s)"; though it is an unspecific term, it is very accurate. Finally, it is not recommended to use the term "osteoarthritis" on MRI as this does not correlate with clinical findings, compared to osteoarthritis on radiographs which does correlate with clinical findings. Level of evidence 5/Low.

### Osteochondral defects in the ankle: why painful? [^112qsMoZ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

In the case of an OD the following calculation can be made. The size of an average defect measures 0.85 cm² on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By means of computed tomography (CT) we measured the size of the talar OD in 50 consecutive patients that were treated for a symptomatic OD. We measured an average defect size of 0.65 cm² (0.5–0.8 cm²). The size of an OD can easily be overestimated on MRI because of bone edema, this can explain the difference. After debridement of a talar OD with a diameter of 0.65 cm² it can be calculated that the load on the remaining talar cartilage is increased by 15% (Fig. 3). This increase in load is probably not enough to cause damage to the remaining cartilage since this figure lies far beyond the threshold of 40%. Any varus or valgus malalignment can increase the load and hence increase the likelihood of progressive cartilage damage.

Radin and Paul argued that articular cartilage by virtue of its thinness is not a good shock absorber considered in terms of reduction of peak impact force. Although the underlying bone is much stiffer, it is so much longer by comparison, that its total compliance exceeds that of cartilage. Peak stresses at the joint surface, however, are still greatly reduced through redistribution and deformation of cartilage. In contrast to the tibia, which is a long bone, the talus is compact, and peak impact force can only be distributed over a small volume of bone. The small talar volume combined with its thin cartilage may explain why ODs are more common on the talar dome than in the tibial plafond.

Thin cartilage is less elastic when compared to thick cartilage. Shepherd and Seedhom suggested an inverse relation between the mean cartilage thickness and mean compressive modulus, i.e. thin cartilage has a high compressive modulus. After measuring cadaver cartilage of several species including humans, they found that two factors contribute to the deformability of the cartilage: the thickness of the cartilage and its intrinsic elasticity. There is a curvilinear relationship between the magnitude of the deformation and the thickness of the articular cartilage under a certain level of loading. In the congruent ankle joint, Wan et al. measured a peak cartilage deformation of 34.5% ± 7.3% under full body weight in persons with a medial talar dome cartilage thickness of 1.42 ± 0.31 mm (Fig. 4).

### Editorial commentary: cartilage clinical research challenges show No signs of abatement [^111BjdoL]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Medical research methods are generally poor, including methods found in recent research, research from academic institutions, and research supported by commercial funding. A solution is for systematic review authors to avoid additional review of prior publications with poor methods, and focus instead on returning to original scientific research (with improved methods) to address gaps in our clinical knowledge.

### Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss: a medium-term follow-up [^114so1xg]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occasionally used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss in the medial compartment of the knee.

Patients and Methods

Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in 90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively). Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.

Results

Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial thickness loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters), were arthroscopies for persistent pain. Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores. However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics. MRI findings of full thickness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema, synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.

Conclusion

Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full thickness cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients with partial thickness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful and misleading.

### Morphological MR imaging of the articular cartilage of the knee at 3 T-comparison of standard and novel 3D sequences [^112WWCRm]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

MR imaging analysis

All images were independently reviewed during separate sessions by two readers [with 25 years (reader A) and 10 years (reader B) of experience in musculoskeletal radiology at the time of the study]. Images were obtained without any annotation. At the time of review, the readers were blinded to the patient's clinical history and clinical findings. A total of 100 MRI data sets (5 data sets per subject for a total of 20 study subjects) were reviewed in 5 separate sessions at least 96 h apart to prevent recall bias. Each session consisted of 20 data sets that were presented randomly except that different data sets of the same patient were never reviewed in the same session. The readers used sagittal source data to create multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images in the axial and coronal plane. Subjective image quality was assessed by using the following criteria: edge sharpness, artefacts, amount of noise, tissue contrast, and reformat quality. The quality score consisted of an ordinal 5-point Likert-scale and was defined as (1) poor, unacceptable for diagnostic purposes; (2) adequate but poorer than average quality; (3) average quality of a diagnostic acceptable image; (4) above average quality; (5) best quality. The readers graded each of the six articular surfaces of the knee as follows: (1) normal; (2) low-grade cartilage defect (< 50% of total cartilage thickness); (3) high-grade cartilage defect (> 50% of total cartilage thickness). Each reader was asked to assign a confidence level to the diagnosis as follows: (1) definitely normal; (2) probably normal; (3) probably abnormal; (4) definitely abnormal. Presence of bone marrow oedema was also recorded using the same 4-point Likert scale. On UTE images, the readers prospectively evaluated the morphology of the deep osteochondral tissues to predict the status of the overlying cartilage: a distinct, continuous high linear signal at the cartilage/bone interface was considered normal (indicating normal cartilage) and thinning, interruption, or complete absence of that signal was considered abnormal (indicating cartilage lesion), according to previously described criteria by Bae et al. Finally, the UTE morphology of the osteochondral tissue was retrospectively assessed in consensus and with knowledge of the findings on conventional MR sequences.

### Bone marrow edema in the knee and its influence on clinical outcome after matrix-based autologous chondrocyte implantation: results after 3-year follow-up [^1125yK91]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an established method for treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects in the knee joint. Subchondral bone marrow edema (BME) is frequently observed after ACI, with unknown pathogenesis and clinical relevance.

Purpose

To investigate the occurrence and clinical relevance of BME after third-generation ACI in the knee joint during the postoperative course of 36 months.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

A total of 38 circumscribed full-thickness cartilage defects in 30 patients were included in this study. All defects were treated with third-generation ACI (Novocart 3D). A standardized MRI examination was carried out after 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Bone marrow edema was observed in 78.9% of defects over the postoperative course, with initial occurrence in the first 12 months. The size of the BMEs were determined according to their maximum diameter and were classified as small (< 1 cm), medium (< 2 cm), large (< 4 cm), and very large (diffuse; > 4 cm). Clinical outcomes in patients were analyzed by use of the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scoring system and a visual analog scale for pain.

Results

There were 5.3% (n = 2) small, 28.9% (n = 11) medium, 34.2% (n = 13) large, and 10.5% (n = 4) very large BMEs. In a subgroup analysis, cartilage defects of the medial femoral condyle showed significantly higher frequency of BME than did patellar defects. Clinical scores showed significant improvements throughout the entire study course (P < .05). Clinical patient outcome did not correlate with presence of BME at any time period (P > .05).

Conclusion

Midterm clinical results of the matrix-based third-generation ACI showed a substantial amount of BME over a 36-month follow-up, but this did not correlate with worse clinical outcome. Patients with femoral cartilage defects were more often affected than were those with patellar cartilage defects.

### Contrast-enhanced MRI of subchondral cysts in patients with or at risk for knee osteoarthritis: the MOST study [^114FjSov]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was (1) to evaluate contrast enhancement patterns of subchondral cysts on magnetic resonance imaging and (2) to discuss possible radiological explanations of cyst enhancement based on existing theories of subchondral cyst formation in osteoarthritis.

Materials and Methods

The Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) is a NIH-funded longitudinal observational study for individuals who have or are at high risk for knee osteoarthritis. All subjects with available non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI were included. The tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints were divided in 14 subregions. The presence and size of subchondral cysts and bone marrow edema-like lesions (BMLs) were scored semiquantitatively in each subregion on non-contrast-enhanced MRI from 0 to 3. Enhancement of subchondral cysts was evaluated on contrast-enhanced MRI as grade 0 (absent), grade 1 (partial enhancement), or grade 2 (full enhancement). The adjacent articular cartilage was scored in each subregion on non-enhanced MRI as grade 0 (intact), grade 1 (partial thickness loss), or grade 2 (full thickness loss).

Results

Four hundred knees were included (1 knee per person, 5600 subregions). Subchondral cysts were detected in 260 subregions (4.6%). After intravenous contrast administration, 245 cysts (94.2%) showed full enhancement, 12 (4.6%) showed partial enhancement and 3 (1.2%) showed no enhancement. Enhancing BMLs were found in 237 (91.2%) subregions containing cysts, which were located adjacent or in the middle of BMLs. In 121 subregions (46.5%) having cysts, no adjacent full thickness cartilage loss was detected.

Conclusion

Most subchondral cysts demonstrated full or partial contrast enhancement, and were located adjacent or in the midst of enhancing BMLs. As pure cystic lesions are not expected to enhance on MRI, the term "subchondral cyst-like bone marrow lesion" might be appropriate to describe these lesions.

### Bone marrow edema-like signal after cartilage repair does not affect outcomes in a five-year follow-up [^114KjtRG]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other limitations of this study include that this multicenter study involved the use of various MRI systems, despite employing predefined MRI protocols. Moreover, some patients had to be excluded due to non-participation in follow-up investigations and the absence of certain MRI sequences. Two groups (no BMELS (n = 8) and typical BMELS (n = 9)) are quite small although simulation-based power analysis has proven a good power of the used statistical test. However, the number of patients examined at a 5-year follow-up on cartilage repair is comparable to other studies and we are confident, that we have taken stepstones in the clinical evaluation of BMELS after cartilage repair. There is heterogeneity in the histology of BMELS. We have excluded reasons other than cartilage repair for new BMELS adjacent to the treated area, such as insufficient fractures, new cartilage lesions, or delamination. However, other reasons for the new BMELS cannot be excluded with certainty. Finally, it should be mentioned, that the utilization of the adjusted MOCART score in this study poses challenges in terms of comparing findings to those of other studies.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound in pediatric rheumatology [^116FgtWm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Cartilage Alterations

In children with JIA, MSUS imaging has been shown to be a sensitive modality to detect alterations in the articular cartilage. It allows direct visualization of articular cartilage that is normally seen as an anechoic structure with a smooth outline over the bone surfaces. Cartilage edema or loss may be seen in rheumatoid diseases according to the level of the condition.

Cartilage edema in early stages of JIA can be detected sonographically as thickening of the articular cartilage. Chronic inflammation of the cartilage results in permanent damage to the articular surface. This is observed sonographically as blurring of the articular surface. Continued destruction of the cartilage due to rheumatoid disease is seen as pitting of the articular surface and measurable thinning of the cartilage. Cartilage loss is better detected than on plain films especially in young children with thick epiphyseal cartilage and at the early stages of the disease.

In a cohort of healthy children of different ages, the reliability of the assessment of cartilage thickness with US has been recently demonstrated by Spannow et al. The authors found a good intra- and inter-observer agreement both in large and small joints, using ultrasonographic standard scans according to EULAR guidelines. Furthermore, Moller et al. have recently demonstrated that direct visualization and quantification of cartilage in MCP and PIP joints by using MSUS is objective, reliable and valid. They have suggested its use for diagnostic purposes in rheumatoid patients.

The presence of juxta-articular flow at color Doppler examination in the growing child may either represent normal flow of the well-vascularised cartilage of the epiphysis or synovial hyperemia indicating inflammation. Flow in the cartilage probably indicates normal cartilaginous flow in contrast to flow inside the synovium which probably indicates hyperemia.

### 3D histopathological grading of osteochondral tissue using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography [^111sWUWk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2017). Low credibility.

Surface structure

Integrity/continuity: Early signs of OA include fraying and softening of the cartilage surface.
- **Smooth and continuous**: Refer to intact, uninvolved superficial AC (zone 1) which appears smooth and without indentations.
- **Slightly discontinuous**: AC features few protrusions attributed to cartilage surface edema, which occurs in early OA.
- **Moderately discontinuous**: AC surface appears discontinuous due to presence of fibrillation throughout the zone 1 and simple fissures extending to the upper part of zone 2.
- **Severely discontinuous**: AC shows superficial zone fraying and delamination with extensive, branched fissures extending deep into the zone 2/zone 3 with extensive ECM loss.

AC – zones 1, 2, 3

AC is heterogeneous and its material properties change as a function of depth. Based on its morphology and biochemical constitution, uncalcified AC features three zones (1–3): superficial zone (or lamina splendens), middle (or transitional) zone, and deep (or radial) zone. The fourth zone, which is subjacent to the tidemark, is the calcified cartilage zone.
- **Cellularity**: Chondrocyte hypercellularity and cloning or clustering indicates an attempt to repair the injured/degraded ECM; whereas hypocellularity is a consequence of chondrocytic necrosis and/or apoptosis (cell death).
- **ECM (structural integrity)**: Progression of ECM degradation (Slight, moderate or severely disorganized) along its depth (zones) provides an index of the OA severity. This appears as heterogeneity or loss of organization.
- **Fibrillation and fissure(s)**: Mild damage occurs as fibrillation or fissures, which are restricted to the cartilage surface; whereas, severe damage involves full thickness loss of cartilage and damage to the underlying bone.
- **Fibrous tissue**: Normal AC mainly consists of collagen Type II and proteoglycans. However, in an attempt to repair damaged AC, fibrous tissue can be formed, which is composed of collagen types I and III.

Calcified AC – zone 4

- **ECM (structural integrity)**: The calcified cartilage can be normal, slightly, moderately or severely disorganized.
- **Vascular infiltration**: Blood vessels are absent from normal adult AC. However, channels containing cellular elements, including blood vessels, invade from the SB into the calcified cartilage and breach the tidemark in OA. Vascular invasion of the calcified cartilage zone is a critical component in the progression of OA.
- **Fibrous tissue**: In an attempt to repair damaged AC, fibrous tissue can be formed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging provides additional utility in the preoperative cartilage assessment of patients undergoing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty [^116t1Mrs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The selection of patients with correct indications is important to optimise the success and longevity of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Accepted surgical indications for medial UKA are anteromedial bone‐on‐bone osteoarthritis (OA), full‐thickness cartilage in the lateral compartment and functionally intact medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL). Additionally, and particularly for the Oxford UKA, evidence of patellofemoral (PF) OA may not be considered a contraindication if the PF joint does not have full‐thickness cartilage loss within the lateral facet or trochlea, with any eburnation, grooving or subluxation.

The traditional gold standard for assessing these features is with preoperative anteroposterior and mediolateral radiographs, which provide reliable sensitivity and specificity for experienced UKA surgeons. More recently, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide higher accuracy in the assessment of the joint has become commonplace. The high tissue contrast obtained with MRI provides improved resolution to delineate partial‐thickness cartilage defects and ACL or MCL deficiencies, compared with standard radiographs. Specifically for medial UKA, MRI is useful for checking the integrity of the lateral and PF compartments and the ACL. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to detect additional structural abnormalities not visible on radiographs, such as subchondral bone marrow oedema (BME) but may have the potential to affect clinical outcomes.

Although MRI can provide additional resolution compared to radiographs alone, some have suggested that it may be too sensitive for preoperative assessment of UKA patients. This could adversely lead to unnecessary costs or over‐utilisation of total knee arthroplasty for patients who would otherwise have good clinical outcomes with UKA. There is a need to better understand the perceived benefits and need of MRI for UKA patient assessment. There is currently no consensus on the most appropriate classification system of cartilage damage severity using MRI. The International Cartilage Regeneration & Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) classification, initially developed for use in arthroscopy, is considered easily transferrable for MRI evaluation. The ICRS MRI lesion classification is used here to evaluate the utility of MRI for preoperative assessment of medial UKA patients. The main aim of this study was to assess the benefits offered by MRI for preoperative cartilage assessment of UKA patients compared with standard radiographs by (1) comparing OA severity of the medial, lateral and PF compartments when assessed using MRI compared with standard radiographs, and (2) investigating associations of these two assessments with postoperative clinical outcomes.

### Do existing magnetic resonance imaging definitions of knee osteoarthritis identify knees that will develop clinically significant disease over up to 11 years of follow-up? [^117Ukkiq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteophyte presence was scored in six TF locations (0, none; 1, small; 2, medium; 3, large) (Figure 2A and B). Articular cartilage was scored for lesion size and degree of full‐thickness loss in 10 TF subregions (0, normal; 1.0, 1%–10% area damaged, no full thickness; 1.1, 1%–10% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 2.0, 10%–75% area, no full thickness; 2.1, 10%–75% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 2.2, 10%–75% area, 10%–75% full thickness; 3.0, > 75% area, no full thickness; 3.1, > 75% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 3.2, > 75% area, 10%–75% full thickness; 3.3, > 75% area, > 75% full thickness) (Figure 2C). Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were scored in 10 TF subregions (0, none; 1, < 25% of subregion; 2, 25%–50%; 3, > 50%) (Figure 2D). Meniscal damage was scored in six locations (0, normal; 1, signal abnormality; 2, radial tear; 3, horizontal tear; 4, vertical tear; 5, complex tear; 6, partial maceration; 7, progressive partial maceration; 8, complete maceration) (Figure 2D). Meniscal extrusion was scored in two locations (0, < 2 mm; 1, 2–2.9 mm; 2, 3–4.9 mm; 3, > 5 mm). Figure 2E and F illustrate the 10 subregions for cartilage and BML assessment.

### Subchondral insufficiency fractures, subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis, and other apparently spontaneous subchondral bone lesions of the knee-pathogenesis and diagnosis at imaging [^115CwYcB]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

A few years later in 2008, another histological study of lesions diagnosed as "SONK" by Takeda et al. found that while in the early stages without collapse no osteonecrosis was seen, such features were visible in more advanced stages and confined to the area distal to the site of the fracture, which showed impaired healing (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Histological pattern of a SIF. Bone marrow necrosis ("necrosis") is located in the area between the fracture plane partially repaired ("hyperostosis") and the subchondral bone ("subchondral bone"), detached in this case. Cellular marrow with edema ("edema") is located more proximally to the fracture plane

Clinical context

The clinical context of SIFs is the same as that of the so-called SONKs. Both types of lesions occur mainly in patients above 60 years of age, mainly females, without any specific history of metabolic disorder or therapeutic intervention. A potential link with underlying osteopenia is suggested by some studies, but not all. However, it should be noted that insufficiency fractures may be particularly large or numerous in patients with conditions leading to bone fragility such as in renal transplant recipients or in cases of osteomalacia (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4

The bone marrow of this portion of the condyle shows BME-like high signal intensity (asterisk). Note that the BME-like signal extends between the fracture and the bone-cartilage interface (arrowheads). That area of the subchondral bone is in continuity with the rest of the epiphyseal area

Subchondral bone changes after marrow-stimulating techniques

Various techniques have been developed to repair full-thickness cartilage defects, chiefly among them marrow-stimulation techniques (MST), such as subchondral drilling, abrasion arthroplasty, and microfracture. MST attempt to stimulate filling of a cartilage defect with reparative tissue resulting from perforation of the subchondral bone. Blood and mesenchymal cells from the underlying marrow cavity form a clot in the defect that gradually differentiates into a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue. MST procedures, in particular the more recently introduced microfracture technique, are generally considered as first-line treatment for full-thickness cartilage lesions and have demonstrated good to excellent results in 60–80% of patients. There are, however, concerns over the durability of the repair tissue and hence the clinical outcome, especially in defects that are larger than 2–4 cm² and located in areas other than the femoral condyles.

### External knee adduction and flexion moments during gait and medial tibiofemoral disease progression in knee osteoarthritis [^114r7UE6]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

Following a detailed reading protocol, each knee was scored using the Whole-Organ MRI Score (WORMS) method, by one of two expert musculoskeletal radiologists. Baseline and 2-year scans were evaluated as pairs, with known chronology as suggested for longitudinal studies in knee OA, but blinded to all other data. Two medial weightbearing femoral condylar subregions (central and posterior) and 3 medial tibial plateau subregions (anterior, central, and posterior) were each scored separately for cartilage morphology and bone marrow lesions. At each subregion, cartilage morphology was scored: 0 (normal thickness and signal); 1 (normal thickness, increased signal on T2-weighted images); 2 (solitary, focal, partial or full-thickness defect ≤ 1 mm in width); 3 (multiple areas of partial-thickness loss or grade 2 lesion > 1 mm, with areas of preserved thickness); 4 (diffuse, > 75%, partial-thickness loss); 5 (multiple areas of full-thickness loss, or full-thickness lesion > 1 mm, with areas of partial-thickness loss); and 6 (diffuse, > 75%, full-thickness loss). Subchondral bone marrow lesions were scored: 0 (normal); 1 (mild, < 25% of region); 2 (moderate, 25–50% of region); and 3 (severe, > 50% of region). In a previous study, the inter-rater intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) (unspecified model) for these same readers were 0.98 and 0.90 for medial cartilage morphology and bone marrow lesions respectively.

Baseline-to-2-year progression of cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions in the medial tibiofemoral compartment were each defined as a full-grade score worsening in any of the 5 medial femoral and tibial subregions. Medial femoral surface progression was defined as score worsening in either of the 2 femoral subregions, and tibial surface progression as worsening in any of the 3 tibial subregions.

Cervical and lumbar facet joint degeneration — morphology and prevalence in the elderly — show articular cartilage thinning, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy, with high prevalence in individuals aged 50 years and more and specimens evaluated from 59 to 92 aged persons. Pathological changes attributed to facet joint degeneration were articular cartilage thinning, sclerosis of the subchondral bone, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy; after evaluating cervical facet joints in the elderly, the prevalence of cervical facet joint degeneration was concluded to be probably very high in individuals aged 50 years and more, with severity tending to increase with age; all levels of the cervical spine were affected to almost the same degree, whereas in the lumbar spine degeneration increased towards the lower levels; cervical cartilage was often evenly degenerated over the joint surface while in the lumbar spine certain regions were affected predominantly; in this study, only specimens of facet joints from 59 to 92 aged persons were evaluated.

### Subchondral insufficiency fractures, subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis, and other apparently spontaneous subchondral bone lesions of the knee-pathogenesis and diagnosis at imaging [^113otjQ3]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

It is therefore possible to confuse BME-like lesions associated with osteoarthritis, with that associated with SIF or SIF-ON, particularly since the latter is also found in the elderly population, who often present with a certain degree of chondrosis. This confusion is evident in some studies on lesions described as SIFs, where knees with complete cartilage destruction and those with intact cartilage are included in the same series.

It is important clinically to distinguish BME-signal changes related to osteoarthritis, from those related to SIF, because the latter may be reversible, whereas in progressive osteoarthritis, the prognosis depends on the cartilage disease rather than the BME-like signal intensity (Fig. 29). When facing a BME-like signal, the radiologist should diligently look for cartilage abnormalities. Indeed, the presence of a cartilage lesion may not always be immediately apparent and may require a thorough and detailed examination.

Fig. 29
Pejorative evolution of SIF related to cartilage degradation. a, b Initial T1-weighted MR image shows a typical subchondral insufficiency fracture in the medial tibial plateau on T1-weighted image (arrow in a) with a BME-like high-signal intensity on fat-suppressed T2-weighted image (asterisk in b). c The lesion is associated with a radial tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (arrow). d – f Six months later, T1-weighted (d) and fat-suppressed T2-weighted (e) images show various signal intensities in bone on both sides of a severe chondral loss (arrows in f). The initial examination already showed a clear thinning of the cartilage of the medial condyle (arrowhead in b), which could have indicated a pejorative evolution

In brief, in the event of a BME-like pattern secondary to a cartilage lesion, the prognosis does not depend on the BME but on the evolution of the cartilage disease itself.

### Association between cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone remodeling in patients with knee osteoarthritis comparing MRI and (99m) Tc-DPD-SPECT / CT [^113jkvvT]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between cartilage lesions assessed with 3T-MRI and remodeling of the subchondral bone detected by (99m)Tc-DPD-SPECT/CT.

Design

(99m)Tc-DPD-SPECT/CT and MRI of 27 knees of 25 patients with chronic knee pain and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) were evaluated by one nuclear physician and one radiologist. Six regions of the knee (in total 162 regions in 27 knees) were assessed according to structural joint lesions graded with a modified Whole Organ MR imaging score (WORMS) and according to subchondral (99m)Tc-DPD-SPECT uptake. Relationships between regional WORMS scores and uptake were quantified using general estimating equations. In a secondary analysis the uptake sum with the WORMS sum per joint was compared using Spearman correlations.

Results

Elevated subchondral uptake was significantly associated with the grade of cartilage lesions (P < 0.0001). Mean uptake was significantly higher subjacent to full thickness cartilage lesions compared to partial thickness lesions (P < 0.0001). A similar association was observed between bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) and cartilage lesions. The sum of uptakes per joint was positively correlated to the WORMS sum (rs = 0.42) and to the sum of cartilage lesions per joint (rs = 0.50).

Conclusion

Both functional and structural changes of the subchondral bone in terms of scintigraphic osseous activity and the presence and degree of BMEP were significantly associated with cartilage lesions in patients with OA of the knee. This association was pronounced with full thickness lesions, indicating a possible protective effect of the cartilage layer for the subjacent bone.

### Magnetic resonance-detected subchondral bone marrow and cartilage defect characteristics associated with pain and X-ray-defined knee osteoarthritis [^114tzscb]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether the presence of subchondral bone marrow abnormalities (bone marrow edema (BME)) and cartilage defects, determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), would explain the difference between painful osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK) compared with painless OAK or pain without OAK.

Method

Four groups of women (30 per group), aged 35–55 years, were recruited from the southeast Michigan Osteoarthritis cohort (group 1: painful OAK; group 2: painless OAK; group 3: knee pain without OAK; and group 4: no OAK or knee pain). OAK was defined by a Kellgren-Lawrence score of 2 or greater, while pain was based on self-report. BME and cartilage defects were identified from MRI.

Results

BME lesions were identified in 56% of all knees. BME lesions were four times (95% CI = 1.7, 8.7) more likely to occur in the painless OAK group as compared with the group with pain, but no OAK. BME lesions > 1cm were more frequent (OR = 5.0; 95% CI = 1.4, 10.5) in the painful OAK group than all other groups. While the frequency of BME lesions was similar in the painless OAK and painful OAK groups, there were more lesions, > 1cm, in the painful OAK group. About 75% of all knees had evidence of some cartilage defect, of which 35% were full-thickness defects. Full-thickness cartilage defects occurred frequently in painful OAK. One-third of knees with full-thickness defects and 47% of knees with cartilage defects involving bone had BME > 1cm. Women with radiographic OA, full-thickness articular cartilage defects, and adjacent subchondral cortical bone defects were significantly more likely to have painful OAK than other groups (OR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.3, 7.6).

Conclusion

The finding on MRI of subchondral BME cannot satisfactorily explain the presence or absence of knee pain. However, women with BME and full-thickness articular cartilage defects accompanied by adjacent subchondral cortical bone defects were significantly more likely to have painful OAK than painless OAK.

### Comparative reliability and diagnostic performance of conventional 3T magnetic resonance imaging and 1.5T magnetic resonance arthrography for the evaluation of internal derangement of the hip [^116cyuhM]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Image analysis

All anonymised MR images were independently and prospectively analysed by two experienced MSK radiologists (authors 2 and 8, 17 years' experience each). The radiologists were unaware of whether the patient proceeded to surgery, the surgical findings and the total proportion of patients who underwent surgery. All 1.5T MRA and conventional 3T MRI examinations were evaluated in a random order by each radiologist without reference to the other examination. Each radiologist completed a score sheet evaluating each acetabular quadrant (anterosuperior, posterosuperior, posteroinferior and anteroinferior) for the acetabular labrum (normal, partial tear, full thickness tear) (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4), articular cartilage defect (acetabulum and femoral head; normal, partial, full thickness), articular cartilage delamination (present or absent, linear high (fluid) signal intensity on PD or T2 weighted sequences or prominent linear low signal intensity paralleling the subchondral bone plate within/deep to acetabular articular cartilage on T1 or PD weighted sequences) (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and subchondral oedema (present or absent). Evaluation also included ligamentum teres and transverse ligament (intact or torn), as well as radial femoral bump, femoral pit and acetabular retroversion, recording them as present or absent.

### The subchondral bone in articular cartilage repair: current problems in the surgical management [^1125hu9Q]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Application of evidence-based medicine to the subchondral bone

Evidence-based medicine has gained popularity in orthopedic surgery. Historically, surgeons have practiced what they learned from senior colleagues and then refined these techniques through their own experience and mistakes. It is also a fact that the majority of new techniques have been adopted in clinical practice without evidence from a randomized controlled trial. Randomized controlled trials having enough power are difficult to perform in surgery. However, to move forward, randomized controlled trials are needed with long-term follow-up as an important supplement to registers and observational studies.

Fifty years ago, bone and subchondral bone were main targets in osteochondral repair. Bone grafting using auto- and allografts has a long tradition in orthopedic surgery. For decades, subchondral bone was the main focus in cartilage repair. Scientists and surgeons believed that cartilage was impossible to regenerate in adults, and repair was initiated by debridement and drilling. Undoubtedly, progress has been made along the way, but in a sense we have closed the circle and are back to where we started. Many believed that cell-based therapies had solved the problem of repairing osteochondral defects. However, randomized controlled trials, clinical studies and meta-analyses have not given us the necessary evidence. A Cochrane review did not find evidence for superiority of any of the studied techniques for cartilage repair. Another paper by Jakobsen et al. concluded that the majority of studies on cartilage had a low methodological quality. Recently, another systematic review of the treatment of focal articular cartilage defects in the knee was published. They identified five randomized controlled trials and concluded that no technique consistently had superior results compared with the others. A weakness of all studies was that no control (non-operative) groups were used. It is also fact that no technique available today has been able in clinical studies to prove the regeneration of normal hyaline cartilage. No doubt that tissue engineering has a great potential in osteochondral repair, and most of us realize that previous and current marrow-stimulation techniques are not the solutions for the future. However, new techniques have to be carefully evaluated before they are generally adopted.

### Changes of the subchondral bone microchannel network in early osteoarthritis [^117Enrwe]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We have identified a 3D network of subchondral microchannels that connects the deep zone of cartilage to the bone marrow (i.e., cartilage-bone marrow microchannel connectors; CMMC). However, the pathological significance of CMMC is largely unknown. Here, we quantitatively evaluated how the CMMC microarchitecture is related to cartilage condition, as well as regional differences in early idiopathic osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

Two groups of cadaveric female human femoral heads (intact cartilage vs early cartilage lesions) were identified, and a biopsy-based high-resolution micro-CT imaging was employed. Subchondral bone (SB) thickness, CMMC number, maximum and minimum CMMC size, and the CMMC morphology were quantified and compared between the two groups. The effect of joint's region and cartilage condition was examined on each dependent variable.

Results

The CMMC number and morphology were affected by region of the joint, but not by cartilage condition. On the other hand, the minimum and maximum CMMC size was changed by both the location on the joint, as well as the cartilage condition. The smallest CMMC were consistently detected at the load-bearing region (LBR) of the joint. Compared to non-pathological subjects, the size of the microchannels was enlarged in early OA, most noticeably at the non-load-bearing region (NLBR) and the peripheral rim (PR) of the femoral head. Furthermore, subchondral bone thinning was observed in early OA as a localized occurrence linked with areas of partial chondral defect.

Conclusion

Our data point to an enlargement of the SB microchannel network, and a collective structural deterioration of SB in early idiopathic OA.

The migration of the BME-like pattern from one portion of the epiphysis to another or from one epiphysis to another can be observed at follow-up imaging. This migration of the BME-like pattern is the only definitive characteristic at MRI that distinguishes CRPS 1 from SIF (Fig. 26).

Fig. 27
Bone marrow edema (BME)-like signal associated with focal chondral lesion. a, b T1-weighted (a) and fat-suppressed T2-weighted MR images (b) show BME-like signal intensities similar to those of subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFs) (asterisks). Here, the BME-like signal intensity is related to a deep focal cartilage defect (arrow in b), evident in the present case

In summary, the MRI appearance of CRPS 1 lesions is almost similar to that of SIF, apart from the usually greater intensity of BME-like signal changes and the frequent migration of lesions at follow-up.

BME-like signal associated with chondral lesions

The so-called BME-like lesions are frequently seen in osteoarthritis and are typically associated with pain. At histology, these lesions correspond to a number of abnormalities, including bone marrow necrosis, bone marrow fibrosis, and necrotic or remodeled trabeculae, but edema is not a major constituent).

BME-like signal changes are generally less intense and less extensive in osteoarthritis than in SIF and their location is more variable. BME-like signal can either be homogeneous (Fig. 27) or heterogeneous, especially in cases of advanced osteoarthritis, due to associated structural bone changes (hyperostosis, necrosis, geodes, etc.) (Fig. 28).

Fig. 28
Subchondral bone changes associated with advanced osteoarthritis. a Radiograph shows heterogeneous subchondral bone densification and complete narrowing of the medial joint space. b, c T1- and T2-weighted MR images (b and c) show focal heterogeneous low signal intensities of these areas, quite similar to what could be seen in subchondral osteonecrosis

### Osteochondral defects in the ankle: why painful? [^111bRgTp]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Most osteochondral talar defects are caused by trauma. They may heal and remain asymptomatic or progress to subchondral cysts with deep ankle pain on weight bearing. The pain in osteochondral defects is most probably caused by an intermittent local rise in intraosseous fluid pressure with occurs on every step, and which thus sensitizes the highly innervated subchondral bone. The development of symptoms and subchondral cysts depends on the defect type, joint congruence, alignment, impact force and shearing stress. Symptoms and subchondral cyst formation will only occur in case of a local small diameter defect in the subchondral plate.

Cartilage has a liquid and a solid component (i.e. collagen and proteoglycans) that enables it to withstand compressive stress. A congruent joint surface, such as the ankle, is covered by thin articular cartilage. Incongruent joints, such as the knee, are covered by thicker cartilage. There is a curvilinear relation between the cartilage thickness and deformation. Thick cartilage easily deforms, thereby increasing the load-bearing area and decreasing the stress area.

Fluid from the damaged cartilage can be forced into the microfractured subchondral bone plate underneath during loading. The smaller the diameter of the defect in the subchondral plate, the higher the fluid pressure. This intermittent local rise in high fluid pressure will cause osteolysis and the eventual formation of a subchondral cyst. Malalignment of the ankle joint may aggravate this process by increasing the local pressure in specific locations of the ankle. The pain in osteochondral defects is most probably caused by the repetitive high fluid pressure and decrease in pH, sensitizing the highly innervated subchondral bone.

### Autologous cartilage implantation for full thickness articular cartilage defects of the knee [^115Y5Sd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of strategies have been employed for managing articular cartilage defects of the knee, including drilling and abrasion arthroplasty. These treatments are not always effective and when they are, the benefits may only be transitory. Unsuccessfully treated cartilage damage may progress to degenerative disease states and result in the need for a total knee replacement. In recent years the surgical implantation of healthy cartilage cells (autologous cartilage implantation [ACI]) into damaged areas has been seen as an alternative option and is currently under investigation as a potential improvement over the current strategies for the management and treatment of articular cartilage defects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of ACI in patients with full thickness articular cartilage defects of the knee.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (May 2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to June Week 4 2001), CINAHL (1982 to July Week 2 2001), EMBASE (1980 to 2001 Week 27), SPORTDiscus (1949 to June 2001), Current Contents (1993 Week 26 to 2001 Week 30) and the National Research Register (Issue 2, May 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing ACI with any other type of treatment (including no treatment or placebo) for symptomatic cartilage defects of the medial or lateral femoral condyle, trochlea or patella.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers applied the entry criteria to identified studies.

Main Results

No completed randomised controlled trials investigating this treatment were identified through the above searches. One possible trial has been placed in Studies Awaiting Assessment, awaiting translation of the full trial report. Ongoing trials currently underway will be incorporated in future updates of this review.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No information is available from RCTs which can influence current practice. Therefore, since current evidence is subject to the inherent weaknesses of case series or reports, ACI must currently be considered as a technology under investigation whose effectiveness is yet to be determined in well designed and conducted clinical trials. The results of ongoing randomised clinical trials will help improve this situation.

### Translation of clinical problems in osteoarthritis into pathophysiological research goals [^112TC8vh]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a huge and ever increasing problem

OA is the most prevalent joint disease and accounts for more disability among the elderly than any other disease. It is estimated that OA affects about 40 million people in Europe.OA can affect each and every joint but is most common in the knee, hip, spine and hand. Clinically, it is characterised by joint pain, limitation of movement, tenderness, stiffness, crepitus and various degrees of inflammation. OA is considered a disease of the whole joint organ; structural changes include cartilage fibrillation, fissures, full thickness loss of articular cartilage, osteophyte formation, changes in the subchondral bone plate, synovitis and fibrosis in synovium or capsule.

To provide exact numbers on the incidence and prevalence of disease is a difficult task. A major cause of this is the fact that radiographic changes are not always associated with joint pain and vice versa. Moreover, OA is generally a slow progressive disease. Epidemiological studies are difficult to compare due to differences in study population and disease criteria. OA is relatively infrequent in people under the age of 40 years but definitely increases with age. Under the age of 45 years, women are less affected than males, but this gender difference reverses above 45 years. Europe has an increasingly ageing population as well as an obesity epidemic; old age and obesity are both major risk factors for OA. Since currently no therapeutic options other than pain control and joint replacement are available, the burden of OA will continue to rise in the coming decades.

### MR imaging of epiphyseal lesions of the knee: current concepts, challenges, and controversies [^115daWP1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article focuses on spontaneous painful conditions involving the subchondral bone and marrow of mature knee epiphyses. MR imaging is the technique of choice for the work-up of these lesions and enables distinction of two main categories of lesions on the basis of T1-weighted images: avascular necrosis, and lesions presenting the bone marrow edema pattern. This latter category encompasses spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, and a variety of self-resolving conditions that may be differentiated by the study of the subchondral bone marrow area on T2-weighted images. Behind definite appellation of lesions, the challenge for the radiologist is to provide a prognosis: the distinction between self-resolving lesions from those that may evolve to epiphyseal collapse and joint impairment should be possible in most cases.

### Hypointense signal lesions of the articular cartilage: a review of current concepts [^112tQUu5]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion of articular cartilage disease detection by MRI usually focuses on the presence of bright signal on T2-weighted sequences, such as in Grade 1 chondromalacia and cartilage fissures containing fluid. Less emphasis has been placed on how cartilage disease may be manifested by dark signal on T2-weighted sequences. The appearance of the recently described "cartilage black line sign" of the femoral trochlea highlights these lesions and further raises the question of their etiology. We illustrate various hypointense signal lesions that are not restricted to the femoral trochlea of the knee joint and discuss the possible etiologies for these lesions.

### Spectrum of common and uncommon causes of knee joint hyaline cartilage degeneration and their key imaging features [^1165uZRk]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyaline cartilage lining the surfaces of diarthrodial joints is an important construct for transmission of load and to reduce friction between the bones. Normal wear and tear accounts for about 3–5 percent knee cartilage loss ever year in otherwise healthy people after the age of 30 years. Several conditions and diseases lead to premature cartilage degeneration. Standardized description of cartilage loss, detailed evaluation of the joint health and determining the underlying etiology of cartilage loss are important for effective reporting, multidisciplinary communications and patient management. In this article, the authors discuss normal and abnormal imaging appearances of the hyaline cartilage of knee with focus on using controlled terminology and MRI classifications. The reader will benefit and learn key MR imaging features of a spectrum of common and uncommon conditions and diseases affecting the knee cartilage, such as trauma, secondary injury associated with meniscus and ligament injury related instability, arthritis, ischemia, idiopathic, and hereditary conditions including Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) mutations and mucopolysaccharidosis type IX disease with illustrative case examples.

### Definition of a critical size osteochondral knee defect and its negative effect on the surrounding articular cartilage in the rat [^115KEreP]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2017). Low credibility.

As the incidence of OA has been associated with joint trauma, osteochondral defects may not remain restricted to a local wound, and they could also trigger a whole joint disease. In fact, there is some evidence that the presence of asymptomatic osteochondral defects or full thickness chondral defect leads to articular cartilage loss and to the development of early OA. In this case, the anabolic activity of chondrocytes seems to be reduced in both normal and OA-articular cartilage, which can be explained, at least partially, by cartilage's limited capacity to recover from damage and exposure to inflammation. Moreover, fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFr) also show regulatory effects on both catabolic and anabolic processes of the joint. Therefore, therapies targeting inflammatory cytokines and FGFs are assumed to be of great relevance in the treatment of joint diseases and in the prevention of trauma related OA. However, our knowledge about the mechanisms triggering degeneration of the cartilage surrounding osteochondral defects is still incomplete and further understanding is required.

In this study, osteochondral defects of different sizes were used to evaluate the natural course of spontaneous osteochondral healing over time, not only within the defect area but also in the cartilage surrounding the defect. The aim of the present study was: (1) to define the critical size of an osteochondral defect in rats, (2) to define the course of subchondral bone plate advancement, (3) and to examine the association between osteochondral defects and degeneration of the surrounding cartilage.

### Effect of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in the treatment of a post-traumatic chondral defect of the knee [^114gn47R]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of post-traumatic isolated chondral defects poses a particular challenge to treating clinicians. It is recognised that articular cartilage has a limited capacity to heal. Furthermore, several studies have shown that isolated defects predispose a patient to later development of progressive and generalised degenerative osteoarthritis.

The chosen management path for isolated chondral defects can be influenced by factors including patient age, partial-thickness or full-thickness chondral loss and the site of the lesion. Given the concern regarding early progression to osteoarthritis, surgical interventions are often considered. These can include, but are not limited to, arthroscopic debridement, microfracture/osteoplasty and, where appropriate, techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI).

Microfracture, otherwise known as osteoplasty, is a commonly used and accepted technique whereby holes are drilled or punched through the subchondral plate at the site of full-thickness cartilage loss and is designed to stimulate a healing response. It has been postulated that this method encourages the subsequent migration of bone marrow pluripotent stem cells to the area of injury creating an environment amenable to healing.

Unfortunately while studies have successfully shown cartilaginous response at the site of microfracture, subsequent histological analysis has indicated type I fibrocartilage formation rather than hyaline cartilage. Additional studies have shown only fair to poor clinical outcome in long-term follow-up. Inadequate defect filling and reduced load-bearing properties of fibrocartilage have been postulated as the reasoning behind disappointing long-term outcome results. Additional understanding of the relative paucity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within bone marrow — as little as 0.001% in bone marrow aspirates — may also explain the inability to form hyaline-like cartilage.

Chondrocyte implantation techniques such as ACI and MACI have shown encouraging results in the management of isolated chondral defects. Both preclinical and clinical trials have indicated hyaline-like cartilage regrowth, and correspondingly long-term clinical trials have observed encouraging durability in structure and patient outcome. The application of such interventions unfortunately remains limited due to the need to do additional surgery in harvesting the donor autograft cartilage, subsequent donor site morbidity and the observed poor integration of the grafted defect with the surrounding cartilage. The site of chondral defect has also influenced observed outcome. While reliable results are achieved with lesions involving the medial or lateral femoral condyle, lesions of the patellofemoral joint are not associated with such reproducible results.

On MRI, the alterations are similar to those seen in most transient epiphyseal lesions: BME-like signal changes which are more or less extensive, predominate near the articular surfaces, and are associated with edema-like signal in the adjacent soft tissues (Fig. 24 c-e). A fine high-intensity line is also frequently present immediately adjacent to the subchondral bone lamina on T2FS images (Fig. 24 c).

MRI changes in the bone marrow precede the radiographic bone rarefaction by several weeks and may regress before it. Therefore, in the case of chronic CRPS 1, the MRI may be normal, contrasting with radiological and clinical alterations.

In practice, there is no notable difference between the MRI appearance of CRPS 1 and that of other transient epiphyseal lesions, except that in CRPS 1 edema-like alterations in the bone and soft tissues are often more intense and last longer than in SIF. To add to the confusion, subtle deformations of the subchondral surface and thin subchondral fracture lines may also be seen in CRPS 1 (Fig. 25).

### Brief report: intraarticular sprifermin not only increases cartilage thickness, but also reduces cartilage loss: location-independent post hoc analysis using magnetic resonance imaging [^113L6CYo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

These observations have raised questions as to whether the effects of DMOADs are greater in joint regions where mechanical challenges are potentially small and cartilage thickness may be static, and whether drugs can also be effective in regions where mechanical challenges are high and cartilage loss is supposedly most progressive. These considerations apply between compartments (i.e. medial versus lateral), but also within these compartments (i.e. peripheral versus central). In several studies, subregional cartilage change was shown to be highly variable between knees 11, 12, and often occurred in opposite directions (loss versus gain), thereby canceling each other out when the mean change across different knees from different participants 11 was reported. Therefore, analyses to ascertain the average cartilage change across compartments, plates, or subregions of the cartilage among patients are unable to conclusively answer whether, at an individual level, cartilage loss is reduced by a DMOAD.

The objective of this post hoc analysis of the results from the recent RCT evaluating sprifermin for the treatment of knee OA 10 was to use subject‐specific, location‐independent analysis of cartilage change, in order to test whether an anabolic drug such as sprifermin increases cartilage thickness at some locations in the joint, and whether the treatment is also capable of reducing cartilage loss wherever it occurs in a given knee.

Volume fill of (osteo)chondral defect

Despite the improved signal-to-noise ratio that can be achieved with recent developments in MR imaging, the thin and highly congruent cartilage layers of the ankle joint pose a greater challenge for assessment of the volume of cartilage defect filling than for the knee. Hence the "volume fill of the (osteo)chondral defect" was adapted to 50% increments for the ankle joint. The volume of defect filling must be assessed in relation to the adjacent native reference cartilage and must be described as a percentage of the hypothetical volume of intact cartilage that covers the defect. It has been previously reported that ankle cartilage thickness is relatively homogenous throughout the joint with similar thickness reported for tibial and talar cartilage. Thus, if the articular surfaces of the tibia and talus cannot be separately identified on MR images, the thickness of the native cartilage should be assumed to be half of the distance between subchondral bone plates. Since there is a high percentage of osteochondral lesions in the ankle joint, greater attention was paid to the subchondral bone. Therefore, the volume fill of the defect variable for the ankle also includes an assessment of the volume fill or restoration of the subchondral bone in case of osteochondral lesions. The volume of filling is considered complete (100%) and scored with 20 points when the repair tissue articular surface is flush with the surrounding reference cartilage with a repair tissue volume equivalent to the hypothetical volume of healthy cartilage that would cover the defect (Fig. 1_1). A repair with incomplete cartilage defect filling compared to adjacent native regions is classified as underfilled and can be "minor underfilling" (50–99% filled, Fig. 1_2c), which is scored with 15 points, or "severe underfilling" (< 50%, Fig. 1_3a), which is scored with 10 points. Complete chondro-osseous delamination in situ (Fig. 1_3b) receives the same score as severe underfilling as it bears the risk of cartilage fragment dislocation and subchondral bone exposure. On MR imaging, chondro-osseous delamination is characterized by a fissure-like, fluid-like interface between the repair tissue and subchondral bone. Although delamination may subsequently resolve in the early postoperative period, once maturation of cartilage is complete, the finding indicates that further repair to bone incorporation is unlikely. If the defect extends into the subchondral bone, the depth of the bony defect has to be measured. A bony defect, which is not filled with repair tissue and is less than 5 mm deep is scored with five points (Fig. 1_4), a bony defect equal to or greater 5 mm and not filled with repair tissue is scored with 0 points (Fig. 1_5).

Imaging — knee OA evaluation around GAE — states that preprocedural (< 6 months) conventional weight-bearing radiographs are routinely obtained and that the Kellgren and Lawrence scale is used to grade severity, with reporting emphasized because current evidence suggests that GAE outcomes may be correlated with radiographic severity of OA. Knee MR imaging is not routinely performed in people with knee OA; however, it is recommended as a research tool to help investigators assess for longitudinal changes after GAE, and optimal MR imaging sequences for GAE are not defined but have included a 3-plane localizer, axial proton density, axial T2 fat-sat, coronal T1, coronal proton density fat-sat, sagittal proton density, sagittal proton density fat-sat, and trochlear oblique T2 fat-sat; dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging may also be considered for evaluation of synovitis. Semiquantitative scoring includes the Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS), full-thickness cartilage defects were reported to be the strongest predictor of poor outcome, and other classifications include the MR imaging Osteoarthritis Knee Score and Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Score; a whole-joint semiquantitative scoring system proposed by Guermazi et al has also been described to assess synovitis and may represent an OA-specific tool to guide imaging response to GAE.

For articular cartilage defects, a low level of certainty applies when patients present with acute trauma with haemarthrosis (0–2 hours) associated with osteochondral fracture, insidious onset aggravated by repetitive impact, intermittent pain and swelling, history of "catching" or "locking", and joint-line tenderness.

Classic appearance of BME-like signal

The key finding of SIFs is BME-like signal. However, this MRI sign is far from specific. At histology, actual BME (extracellular fluid) is rarely seen, and the MRI signal alterations originally described as edema are due to a variable amount of vascular dilatation, interstitial hemorrhage, cellular infiltration, granulation tissue, microfracture and callus formation, necrosis, and fibrosis, depending on the etiology. At imaging, it is therefore recommended to avoid the terms "edema" or "edematous signal" in favor of "edema-like signal". In the rest of this article, we will refer to these MRI signal alterations of the bone marrow as "BME-like signal" or "BME-like pattern".

BME-like signal refers to an ill-defined area of bone marrow with moderately decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, more evident on fat-suppressed fluid sensitive images (Fig. 7 b, c) (i.e. fat-suppressed T2 (T2FS), short-tau inversion recovery (STIR), fat-suppressed proton density (DPFS), Dixon T2 "Water" images). For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to all types of fat-suppressed fluid-sensitive sequences as "T2FS". After intravenous injection of contrast media, the signal on T1-weighted sequences enhances and becomes practically similar to that of normal bone marrow (Fig. 10).

Enhancement pattern of a presumed subchondral insufficiency fracture with osteonecrosis. a T1-weighted MR image shows low signal intensity predominating near the condylar surface, extending deep in the epiphysis, and gradually attenuating with blurred outlines (asterisk). b, c On fat-suppressed T2-weighted image (b), this area (asterisk) shows high signal intensity and enhances after intravenous contrast injection (asterisk on post-contrast T1-weighted sequence in c). In this case, the subchondral area immediately adjacent to the bone plate (arrows) shows low signal intensity with fat-suppressed T2-weighting (in b) and no enhancement with post-contrast T1-weighting (in c). This pattern corresponds to an area of degraded subchondral fatty marrow, suggestive of a SIF-ON

The prognostic value of T2-weighted MR images is summarized in Fig. 21.

Note that in some cases, a very limited area with subchondral low T2 signal intensity is of doubtful prognosis and may progress either to healing or to SIF-ON. Without a particular event (meniscectomy or rapid cartilage degeneration for example), the evolution of a typical SIF towards a SIF-ON is very rare

Image analyses

All MRI images were independently reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists (Qiu and Sheng, with 3 and 13 years of clinical experience, respectively). The routine MR imaging protocol was used to grade the articular cartilage on the patellofemoral joint according to the modified Noyes classification system: grade 0 = normal cartilage, grade 1 = increased T2 signal intensity of morphologically normal cartilage, grade 2A = superficial partial-thickness cartilage defect less than 50% of the total articular surface thickness, grade 2B = deep partial-thickness cartilage defect greater than 50% of the total articular surface thickness, and grade 3 = full thickness cartilage defect (Fig. 2). The MRI measurements were performed by two other fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists (Li and Yu, with 7 and 18 years of clinical experience, respectively) after all the data of the two groups were mixed and distributed blindly and randomly. All measurements were repeated by one of the radiologists (Li), and the interval between the first and second reading was at the last 4 weeks.

Fig. 2
The modified Noyes classification system of patellar cartilage lesions. a Grade 1 — increased T2 signal intensity of morphologically normal cartilage; b grade 2A — superficial partial-thickness cartilage defect less than 50% of total articular surface thickness; c grade 2B — deep partial-thickness cartilage defect greater than 50% of the total articular surface thickness; d grade 3 — full-thickness cartilage defect

Two quantitative parameters for evaluating patellar position were assessed on the images of each MRI examination. The Insall–Salvati ratio was calculated as the patellar tendon length divided by the maximum patellar diagonal length on sagittal MRI image (Fig. 4 a). The Insall–Salvati ratio was used to reflect the height of the patella, and the threshold was defined as > 1.2. The most superior point of patella-entrance of femoral trochlea distance ratio (SP-ET index) was used to reflect the vertical position of the patella relative to the trochlea. The entrance of femoral trochlea was the first craniocaudal plane where the complete cartilaginous trochlea can be seen (Fig. 3 a–c). The sagittal plane with the greatest longitudinal diameter of the patella was used to obtain the SP-ET index which was calculated as the distance between the most superior point of patella and the entrance of femoral trochlea divided by the patellar articular surface length (Fig. 4 b, c).

If you are preparing information for distribution, then test it with your intended audiences to see what they understand from it, and if you are talking to patients in person, keep asking them what they have understood so far. Moreover, remember: decisions are based on far more than just factual information. If a patient makes a decision that seems to contradict the evidence, it does not mean they have necessarily misunderstood; they could be making the right decision for them, all things considered.

MRI

Overall, the final MRI evaluation revealed the filling of the defects by new tissues, with a slightly less compact structure than native cartilage and a heterogeneous signal. Cartilage degradation or joint damage was observed in two knees, and bone formation within the plate was identified in four. Examples of MRI are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^113NPQaR]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans — evaluation of patients remaining symptomatic after treatment: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that patients who remain symptomatic after treatment for OCD have a history and physical examination, x- rays and/or MRI to assess healing. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus, with the clarification that the supporting evidence is lacking and that a Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. In patients with OCD that remain symptomatic despite previous treatment, ongoing evaluation with a goal to preserve the patient's knee function and native cartilage is a priority, and the evaluation is based upon the patient's symptoms, signs, and imaging to detect possible deterioration; although lesion stability may not be assessed with a high level of confidence on imaging studies, the progression or worsening of the condition can be evaluated by comparing sequential imaging studies. The work group acknowledges that radiographic studies expose the patient to radiation and is aware of the increased costs of imaging studies, and notes that the practice of ongoing history, physical, and imaging studies is consistent with the current practice of most orthopaedic surgeons. Supporting evidence is stated as: There is no evidence to address this recommendation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^1124pht8]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

AAOS osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee — scope, patient population, and evidence policy — addresses the diagnosis and treatment of skeletally immature and skeletally mature patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, and states that the guideline is not intended for use as a benefits determination document. AAOS cautions that an absence of evidence is not evidence of ineffectiveness and holds that properly developed clinical practice guidelines should not seek to guide clinical practice when data are absent unless the disease, disorder, or condition in question can result in loss of life or limb; the AAOS incorporates expert opinion into a guideline under these circumstances, and only under these circumstances. It explains that when the AAOS states that it cannot recommend for or against a given intervention or service, it is stating that currently available data do not provide clear guidance on which course of action is best and that it is therefore reluctant to make a recommendation that has potentially national ramifications. When evidence is absent for osteochondritis dissecans of the knee, the AAOS believes it is particularly important for treatment to be based on mutual patient and physician communication, with discussion of available treatments and procedures applicable to that patient, and with consideration of the natural history of the disease and current practice patterns; once the patient has been informed of available therapies and has discussed options with his/her physician, an informed decision can be made, and clinician input based on experience with both conservative management and surgical skills increases the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options.

### Ultrasonography and articular cartilage defects in the knee: an in vitro evaluation of the accuracy of cartilage thickness and defect size assessment [^115uXaBB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this cadaver study was to test the accuracy of ultrasonography in measuring cartilage thickness, and the extent and depth of induced cartilage defects on the medial and lateral femoral condyles of the knee in a clinically relevant setting. With the knees maximally flexed, cartilage thickness was measured at 24 marked sites in four knees with a 10 MHz probe. The areas of measurement were then excised and the thickness measured with a calliper gauge. In another seven cadaver knees, 21 cartilage defects were produced. The defect diameter varied from 4 to 8 mm. The depths of the defects were either a partial cartilage defect (grade 2), a defect to intact subchondral bone (grade 3), or a defect involving subchondral bone (grade 4) (classification by ICRS). The limits of agreement between ultrasonography and calliper gauge measurement for cartilage thickness were chi(diff) ± 2SD(diff) = 0.0 ± 0.4 mm. For cartilage defect diameter, the limits of agreement between ultrasonography and the slide ruler measurement were chi(diff) ± 2SD(diff) = -0.2 ± 1.0 mm. For the depths of the lesions there was a 100% agreement between radiologist and actual lesion depth for the classification into International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grades 2, 3, and 4. Our conclusion is that ultrasonography is capable of measuring accurately both cartilage thickness and the extent and depth of induced cartilage defects in a cadaver model.

Modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score

All MRI scans 10 years after surgery were acquired bilaterally using a 3-T GE Signa Premier scanner (GE HealthCare) with two 16-channel medium flex receive-only coils (NeoCoil). The imaging protocol included bilateral 3D proton-density fat-saturated FSE (ie, Cube) (TR/TE, 1200/27 ms; echo train length, 32; matrix, 512 × 512 pixels; FOV, 16 cm; slice thickness, 0.6 mm [interpolated into 0.3 mm]) for evaluate cartilage and meniscal morphology.

Two radiologists with 9 years and 7 years of experience (V.K. and K.Z.) read the images and graded the MRI findings on the 10-year follow-up images using the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Considering that the original WORMS scale was created for knees with established OA, and our study involved a smaller cohort with expectedly mild degenerative findings, we combined the original 15 compartments into a total of 6: MF, MT, LF, LT, patella, and trochlea. Cartilage and bone marrow lesions were assessed in these 6 compartments by using a modified semiquantitative WORMS, and the highest grade of lesion was recorded for each region. Cartilage signal and morphology were scored with an 8-point scale: 0 = normal thickness and signal, 1 = normal thickness but increased signal, 2 = partial-thickness focal defect < 1 cm in greatest width, 2.5 = full-thickness focal defect < 1 cm in greatest width, 3 = multiple areas of partial-thickness (grade 2) defects intermixed with areas of normal thickness or a grade 2 defect > 1 cm but < 75% of the region, 4 = diffuse (at least 75% of the region) partial-thickness loss, 5 = multiple areas of full-thickness loss (grade 2.5) or a grade 2.5 lesion > 1 cm but < 75% of the region, and 6 = diffuse (at least 75% of the region) full-thickness loss. Subarticular bone marrow abnormalities were defined as poorly marginated areas of increased signal intensity in the normal subchondral and epiphyseal bone marrow. A 4-point grading scale was used to assess the size of the bone marrow abnormalities: 0 = none, 1 = minimal (< 25% of region), 2 = moderate (25%-50% of region), and 3 = severe (> 50% of region). Meniscal morphology was assessed in 6 regions using a modified WORMS: the anterior, body, and posterior region of the medial and lateral menisci separately. An additional grade was added to the meniscal classification "intrasubstance degeneration" to better assess early degenerative disease. The grading scale ranged from 1 to 4: 0 = normal,1 = intrasubstance abnormalities, 2 = nondisplaced tear, 3 = displaced or complex tear, and 4 = complete destruction. The reconstructed ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) were assessed as intact or torn. We calculated the WORMS Total Score as a sum of every point in cartilage, bone marrow lesion, and meniscal gradings, and the WORMS Medial Score as a sum of medial compartment scores in cartilage, bone marrow lesion, and meniscal gradings.

Differences in edema areas among the treatment groups were analyzed. After 3 months, significant differences in edema areas between the MFX and MACI groups (p = 0.035) were found, indicating larger edema areas after MFX. However, at the 12-month mark, there was no significant difference in edema areas within the treatment groups (p = 0.736). Likewise, at the 60-month mark, no significant difference in edema areas was observed (p = 0.098), illustrated in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Area of BMELS in mm²; Larger BMELS were seen after 3 months in the MFX group, no differences were seen after 12 and 60 months. No significant difference between the size of the initial BMELS and edema progression patterns after 60 months was detected

Correlations were examined between the size of BMELS three and 60 months after surgery and between the IKDC score and the overall KOSS score after 60 months. No significant correlations were found between the size of BMELS at 3 months and the IKDC score and the overall KOOS score (Pearson correlation coefficient between IKDC and the size of the BMELS was −0.214 (p = 0.159)). Between the KOOS score and the size of the BMELS, the correlation coefficient was −0.185 (p = 0.222). For the size of the BMELS after 60 months, the correlation coefficient with the IKDC score was 0.165 (p = 0.279), and with the overall KOOS score, it was 0.109 (p = 0.476).

To evaluate whether the size of existing BMELS after 3 months is a factor in the differentiation between atypical and typical edema progress, we compared only cases with BMELS after 3 months and excluded all cases with no edema-like lesion after 3 months. The statistical evaluation consisted of 16 cases, with nine exhibiting a typical progress of BMELS and seven cases displaying an atypical progress over 60 months. The two-tailed asymptotic significance in this Mann–Whitney U -test was found to be 0.266, suggesting no statistically significant difference between the size of the initial BMELS and edema progression patterns.

Figure 3 depicts the patterns of progression observed within the lesions and classifies the lesions based on specific characteristics. Figure 4 shows a clinical example of an atypical course of BMELS in a 27-year-old patient with an otherwise good clinical outcome.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

Shoulder structures and associated pathologies

Evaluation of different joint structures was performed as follows: any pathological finding of the bone was noted and described. Cartilage was assessed as either (0) normal and homogenous, (1) focal areas of inhomogeneities with normal contour, (2) partial-thickness cartilage loss of less than 50%, or (3) partial-thickness cartilage loss of more than 50% or full-thickness cartilage loss with exposed subchondral bone. Muscle quality of the rotator cuff muscles was assessed as described by Goutallier et al. The quality of the supraspinatus (SSP) tendon was categorized as (0) normal, (1) tendinopathy, (2) articular-sided partial-thickness tear, (3) bursal-sided partial-thickness tear, and (4) full-thickness tear. The infraspinatus (ISP) and subscapularis (SSC) tendons were characterized as (0) normal, (1) tendinopathy, (2) partial-thickness tear, and (3) full-thickness tear. The quality and position of the long head of biceps tendon (LHBT) in the bicipital groove was evaluated as follows: (0) normal, (1) tendinopathy, (2) subluxation but still within the bicipital groove, and (3) displaced from the bicipital groove. The glenoid labrum was categorized as (0) normal, (1) mild, (2) moderate, (3) advanced degeneration, and (4) torn. The acromioclavicular (AC) joint was evaluated as (0) normal, (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) advanced degeneration. The subacromial bursa was characterized as (0) not visible; (1) less than 2 mm, considered normal; and (2) thickened over 2 mm, considered abnormal as described by White et al. Each structure was assessed in all planes of the acquired image sets and sequences.

### Understanding haemophilic arthropathy: an exploration of current open issues [^112c6whG]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemophilic arthropathy is joint damage evolving from recurrent joint bleeds that occur in patients suffering from the clotting disorder haemophilia. Insight into the pathogenetic mechanism of this blood-induced arthropathy yields possible treatment targets and modalities useful to reduce this invalidating co-morbidity of haemophilia. Joint bleeding leads to initially independent adverse changes in both the synovial tissue and the articular cartilage. These subsequently influence each other: the synovial inflammatory changes enhancing cartilage damage and vice versa. Consequently, effective treatment strategies will have to affect both pathways.

The basic goal of small-molecule screening is the identification of chemically 'interesting' starting points for elaboration towards a drug. A number of innovative approaches for pursuing this goal have evolved, and the right approach is dictated by the target class being pursued and the capabilities of the organization involved. A recent trend in high-throughput screening has been to place less emphasis on the number of data points that can be produced, and to focus instead on the quality of the data obtained. Several computational and technological advances have aided in the selection of compounds for screening and widened the variety of assay formats available for screening. The effect on the efficiency of the screening process is discussed.

### Articular cartilage damage… [^116U6u51]. Wikipedia (2008). Low credibility.

Articular cartilage damage in the knee may be found on its own but it will more often be found in conjunction with injuries to ligaments and menisci. People with previous surgical interventions face more chances of articular cartilage damage due to altered mechanics of the joint. Articular cartilage damage may also be found in the shoulder causing pain, discomfort and limited movement. Cartilage structures and functions can be damaged. Such damage can result from a variety of causes, such as a bad fall or traumatic sport-accident, previous knee injuries or wear and tear over time. Immobilization for long periods can also result in cartilage damage. Articular cartilage does not usually regenerate after injury or disease leading to loss of tissue and formation of a defect. This fact was first described by William Hunter in 1743.

Several surgical techniques have been developed in the effort to repair articular cartilage defects. Presentation Mechanism Articular cartilage has a very limited capacity for self repair. Small damage does not repair itself and can often get worse over time. As cartilage is aneural and avascular, shallow damage often does not trigger pain. When the damage increases and the chondral defect reaches the subchondral bone, the blood supply in the bone starts a healing process in the defect. Scar tissue made up of a type of cartilage called fibrocartilage is then formed. Although fibrocartilage is able to fill in articular cartilage defects, its structure is significantly different from that of hyaline cartilage; it is much denser and it doesn't withstand the demands of everyday activities as much as hyaline cartilage. It is therefore at a higher risk of breaking down. Wang et al.

found that small articular cartilage defects can progress to osteoarthritis over time if left untreated. An articular cartilage defect that initially may be small still has the potential to have a physical and chemical "domino effect" on the surrounding "normal" articular cartilage. Pitkin et al. discovered a potential etiology for articular cartilage damage. When the interarticular transmission of pressures is interrupted so that cartilage cannot distribute its pressure load to adjacent joints, it bears exceptionally high loads, which in time lead to degradation. Diagnosis No non-invasive tests are currently able to diagnose articular cartilage damage. Additionally, symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Or as Dr. Karen Hambly stated: You may or may not have pain and you could have no, or limited, swelling.

Yes you may experience locking if a piece of articular cartilage has broken off and is a loose body in the joint or you may experience catching or giving way. You are likely to have some muscle wasting and difficulty in activities such as going up and down stairs, walking or running but then people with any moderate knee injury are likely to as well. This is why articular cartilage damage is the 'Cinderella' of knee problems. It tends to be diagnosed only after other structures have been ruled out – well if it isn't your meniscus or ligaments, what else could it be, perhaps we should look at the articular cartilage. — Dr. Karen Hambly, Articular Cartilage Repair of the Knee. MRI-scans are becoming more valuable in the analysis of articular cartilage but their use is still expensive and time-consuming. X-rays show only bone injuries and are therefore not very helpful in diagnosing cartilage damage, especially not in early stages.

### Chondropathy… [^114hFmg2]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Chondropathy refers to a disease of the cartilage. It is frequently divided into 5 grades, with 0–2 defined as normal and 3–4 defined as diseased. Some common diseases affecting/involving the cartilage
- **Achondroplasia**: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism.
- Cartilage tumors
- **Costochondritis**: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest pain.
- **Osteoarthritis**: The cartilage covering bones is thinned, eventually completely worn out, resulting in a "bone against bone" joint, resulting in pain and reduced mobility. Osteoarthritis is very common, affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of "wear and tear" rather than a true disease. It is treated by Arthroplasty, the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint made of titanium and teflon.

Chondroitin sulfate, a monomer of the polysaccharide portion of proteoglycan, has been shown to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, possibly by increasing the synthesis of the extracellular matrix.
- **Spinal disc herniation**: Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain.
- **Relapsing polychondritis**: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death occurs by suffocation as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses. Repairing articular cartilage damage Though articular cartilage damage is not life-threatening, it does strongly affect the quality of life. Articular cartilage damage is often the cause of severe pain, swellings, strong barriers to mobility and severe restrictions to the patient's activities.

Over the last decades, however, surgeons and biotech ventures have elaborated promising procedures that contribute to articular cartilage repair. However, these procedures do not treat osteoarthritis. References External links

### Treatment of equine lameness [^1176K7tE]. Wikipedia (2024). Medium credibility.

The process of healing Bone Bone heals by formation of a callus over the defective area. Speed and quality of healing is directly related to the blood supply and fracture stability. Rest is required immediately following injury to reduce movement of the fracture site. Stability may be improved through use of surgical implants or casting, depending on the location of extent of the fracture. In some cases, the callus may place pressure on surrounding soft tissue structures. The callus of a splint bone fracture can push on the adjacent suspensory ligament, leading to lameness from secondary suspensory desmitis. Treatment usually involves the removal of the offending callus. Damage to any of these tissues leads to inflammation, which is especially problematic in the joint. While degeneration of articular cartilage is a common disease process in working animals, resulting in osteoarthritis, cartilage is aneural and does not produce pain.

Pain associated with osteoarthritis is secondary to joint capsule pain, due to joint distention and reduced range of motion, or to pain from the underlying bone, which may become damaged following erosion of the articular cartilage. In the case of severe joint pathology such as an osteochondral chip, intra-articular fracture, osteochondritis dissecans lesion, or ligamentous or meniscal injury, arthroscopy may be required to ensure normal function of that joint. Debris within the joint, such as from a chip fracture, can cause long term damage to the synovium and articular cartilage leading to osteoarthritis, and is therefore best removed. Following acute injury, joints often benefit from specialized physical therapy, such as swimming, to prevent the loss of range of motion associated with joint capsule fibrosis. Treatment of joint cartilage injury is difficult and often unrewarding. Partial-thickness defects do not heal.

The body will try to repair full-thickness cartilage defects using scar tissue or fibrocartilage, both of which are poor substitutes for normal, healthy articular cartilage. Current treatment includes arthroscopy-produced microfratures within the subchondral plate. These microfractures encourage an inflammatory response within the defect, which recruits stem cells to the area. Unfortunately, these cells differentiate into fibrocartilage, rather than normal joint cartilage, leading to inferior tissue repair at the site of injury. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate has shown some benefits when grafted into the area following microtrauma. However, the primary treatment for degenerative joint disease involves reducing the inflammatory process that is known to accelerate articular cartilage degeneration. Tendon and ligament Tendon is primarily composed of elastic type I collagen. However, mature tendon contains cells that have a limited ability to regenerate.

Following injury, tendon lays down type III collagen, or scar tissue, which is stronger than type I collagen but stiffer and less-elastic. This makes it less distensible and more likely to re-injure when the horse begins to stretch the tendon during strenuous work. Certain treatments may improve the final tendon fiber quality, and subsequently increase the likelihood that the horse will return to full performance post-injury. Tendons and ligaments heal by formation of scar tissue, which is less elastic and lacks the very regular, organized pattern of fibrils of normal tissue. Exercise helps to encourage proper fiber alignment, and subsequently leads to a tissue that is closer to its original elasticity. Cellulitis leads to an extreme degree of swelling, which can persist after elimination of the underlying cause and result in long-term lameness. Therefore, reduction of edema is a very important part of treatment, and walking is often performed multiple times each day.

### Osteochondritis dissecans… [^111pX19y]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint disorder primarily of the subchondral bone in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain during and after sports. In later stages of the disorder there will be swelling of the affected joint that catches and locks during movement. Physical examination in the early stages does only show pain as symptom, in later stages there could be an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement. There it will show as bone defect area under articular cartilage. The bone will then possibly heal to the surrounding condylar bone in 50% of the cases. Or it will develop into a pseudarthrosis between condylar bone core and osteochondritis flake leaving the articular cartilage it supports prone to damage. Signs and symptoms In osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation.

These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow. People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I. The onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.

Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur. Causes Despite much research, the causes remain unclear but include repetitive physical trauma, ischemia, hereditary and endocrine factors, avascular necrosis, rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus, and problems of bone formation.

Although the name "osteochondritis" implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth. Pathophysiology Osteochondritis dissecans differs from "wear and tear" degenerative arthritis, which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD is a problem of the bone underlying the cartilage, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns. OCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply and decalcification of the trabecular bone matrix.

### Cartilage… [^114Mdb2i]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

In other taxa, such as chondrichthyans and cyclostomes, it constitutes a much greater proportion of the skeleton. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle or tendon. The matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen fibers and, sometimes, elastin. It usually grows quicker than bone. As cartilage does not contain blood vessels or nerves, it is insensitive. However, some fibrocartilage such as the meniscus of the knee has partial blood supply. Nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion. The compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage generates fluid flow, which assists the diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes. Compared to other connective tissues, cartilage has a very slow turnover of its extracellular matrix and is documented to repair at only a very slow rate relative to other tissues.

Structure Development In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules that form the extracellular matrix. In all vertebrates, cartilage is the main skeletal tissue in early ontogenetic stages; in osteichthyans, many cartilaginous elements subsequently ossify through endochondral and perichondral ossification. Following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis, cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state. The division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly, and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself. It has been identified that non-coding RNAs as the most important epigenetic modulators can affect the chondrogenesis. This also justifies the non-coding RNAs' contribution in various cartilage-dependent pathological conditions such as arthritis, and so on. The collagen, mostly collagen type II, constrains the proteoglycans. The ECM responds to tensile and compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage. Cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition, but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body. The ECM of articular cartilage is classified into three regions: the pericellular matrix, the territorial matrix, and the interterritorial matrix. During this mode, the deformation of the tissue has two main regions.

In the first region, the displacement is rapid due to the initial flow of fluid out of the cartilage, and in the second region, the displacement slows down to an eventual constant equilibrium value. Under the commonly used loading conditions, the equilibrium displacement can take hours to reach. However, permeability is sensitive to loading conditions and testing location. For example, permeability varies throughout articular cartilage and tends to be highest near the joint surface and lowest near the bone. Permeability also decreases under increased loading of the tissue. The body solves this problem with stiffer, higher modulus layers near bone, with high concentrations of mineral deposits such as hydroxyapatite. Collagen fibers in this region are anchored directly to bones, reducing the possible deformation.

### Chondromalacia patellae… [^111vmrzR]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Chondromalacia patellae 'softening' χόνδρος 'cartilage' and Latin patella 'kneecap') is an inflammation of the underside of the kneecap and softening of the cartilage. The cartilage under the kneecap is a natural shock absorber, and overuse, injury, and many other factors can cause increased deterioration and breakdown of the cartilage. The cartilage is no longer smooth and therefore movement and use is very painful. While it often affects young individuals engaged in active sports, it also afflicts older adults who overwork their knees. Chondromalacia patellae is sometimes used synonymously with patellofemoral pain syndrome. However, there is general consensus that patellofemoral pain syndrome applies only to individuals without cartilage damage. This condition is also known as Chondrosis.

Cause The condition may result from acute injury to the patella or chronic friction between the patella and a groove in the femur through which it passes during knee flexion. Possible causes include a tight iliotibial band, neuromas, bursitis, overuse, malalignment, core instability, and patellar maltracking. Pain at the front or inner side of the knee is common in adults of all ages especially when engaging in soccer, gymnastics, cycling, rowing, tennis, ballet, basketball, horseback riding, volleyball, running, combat sports, figure skating, snowboarding, skateboarding and even swimming. The pain is typically felt after prolonged sitting. Skateboarders most commonly experience this injury in their non-dominant foot due to the constant kicking and twisting required of it. Swimmers acquire it doing the breaststroke, which demands an unusual motion of the knee. People who are involved in an active lifestyle with high impact on the knees are at greatest risk.

Proper management of physical activity may help prevent worsening of the condition. Athletes are advised to talk to a physician for further medical diagnosis, as symptoms may be similar to more serious problems within the knee. Tests are not necessarily needed for diagnosis, but in some situations they may confirm diagnosis or rule out other causes for pain. Commonly used tests are blood tests, MRI scans, and arthroscopy. While the term chondromalacia sometimes refers to abnormal-appearing cartilage anywhere in the body, it most commonly denotes irritation of the underside of the kneecap. The patella's posterior surface is covered with a layer of smooth cartilage, which the base of the femur normally glides smoothly against when the knee is bent. However, in some individuals the kneecap tends to rub against one side of the knee joint, irritating the cartilage and causing knee pain.

Diagnosis When investigating a possible diagnosis of chondromalacia, a physician will carry out a complete examination of the affected knee. The physician will palpate the patella and surrounding tissue, feel the joint to observe when and how the distress manifests and obtains a list of symptoms and clinical history. The following tests or procedures may be used to refine the diagnosis:

- A knee X-ray and/or blood test – this can assist to exclude certain types of arthritis or inflammation.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging – to observe cartilage condition and assess deterioration
- Arthroscopy – a low invasive approach to image the inside of the knee joint by inserting an endoscope into the knee joint. Treatment In the absence of cartilage damage, pain at the front of the knee due to overuse can be managed with a combination of RICE, anti-inflammatory medications, and physiotherapy.
