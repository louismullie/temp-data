## Question

Preferred fluid for aki

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the preferred intravenous fluid is for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context in which fluid is being used — resuscitation of hypovolemia, treatment of established AKI, maintenance fluids, and prophylaxis around contrast exposure. Then, I should evaluate the comparative evidence for balanced crystalloids versus saline. Next, I will review the role and risks of colloids, especially hydroxyethyl starch and albumin. After that, I need to consider hemodynamic strategy and fluid responsiveness to avoid fluid overload. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-aligned recommendations and note key exceptions where saline might still be preferred.

> Let me first confirm the scope and principles. In AKI, fluids are given to correct intravascular hypovolemia and optimize renal perfusion, but I need to ensure we avoid fluid overload because venous congestion and positive balance can worsen kidney injury. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — fluid choice matters, but so do timing and reassessment. Repeated evaluation of volume status and use of dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness are emphasized, and vasopressors should be integrated when hypotension persists after volume optimization [^111mj1UK] [^112SPgM7] [^117973fd].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence comparing balanced crystalloids to normal saline. The SMART trial in critically ill adults showed a modest but significant reduction in MAKE30 (death, new RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction) with balanced crystalloids versus saline. Wait, let me verify — SPLIT was neutral and a 2019 meta-analysis did not find significant pooled differences, although the trial sequential analysis was inconclusive. I need to reconcile this: despite heterogeneity, contemporary ICU guidelines now recommend favoring balanced crystalloids in AKI or at risk of AKI, reflecting physiologic plausibility and SMART's signal on kidney endpoints [^116t63eg] [^113dbjVJ] [^112YKrQf] [^116gmNEP].

> I will now examine crystalloids versus colloids. KDIGO recommends isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for intravascular volume expansion in AKI, and I should double-check the safety data. Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is consistently associated with increased AKI, RRT, and even mortality; gelatins carry a signal for higher AKI risk; albumin appears kidney-safe but without consistent renal benefit. But wait, what about CRISTAL suggesting a mortality signal for colloids? Hold on, that trial had a heterogeneous population and did not clearly demonstrate renal benefit, so it does not override the renal harm seen with starches or the guideline preference for crystalloids [^111QhqtH] [^115se755] [^116ttj6p] [^115L5u9S].

> Let me consider the chloride issue and physiologic rationale. High-chloride saline can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, and lower renal perfusion in experimental and clinical models, whereas balanced crystalloids are closer to plasma composition and may be less injurious to the kidney. Hmm, wait a minute — are there exceptions? Yes, in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis or certain neurosurgical contexts, saline may be chosen deliberately for its chloride and osmolar profile, so I need to individualize in those scenarios [^1142sRSd] [^115AaxyK].

> I should confirm what to do around iodinated contrast. KDIGO 2012 supported isotonic saline or isotonic bicarbonate for volume expansion in patients at increased risk, but I need to check more recent radiology guidance. The Canadian Association of Radiologists advises no prophylactic hydration for eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and finds insufficient evidence even when eGFR ≤ 30 in many settings, suggesting that routine hydration may not always be necessary. Hold on, I should verify the local policy and patient risk profile; practices vary as evidence has evolved since KDIGO 2012 [^1149Dbv5] [^114Anr3s] [^111xqcZw] [^112cHzE1].

> Now, let me review maintenance fluid and stewardship when enteral intake is insufficient. Intravenous fluids are drugs — so I need to prescribe the smallest effective dose, avoid using oliguria alone as an automatic trigger, and prefer buffered or balanced isotonic crystalloids to minimize hyperchloremia while carefully tracking net balance to prevent fluid overload and associated AKI progression [^1178uzWT] [^115Y3xdJ].

> Next, I should review hemodynamic targets and de-resuscitation. After initial resuscitation, a restrictive or neutral fluid strategy with early de-resuscitation can limit accumulation; a pilot RCT in AKI showed lower fluid balance and less RRT with restrictive management. I need to ensure perfusion pressure with vasopressors rather than more fluid when volume replete — MAP of about 65–70 mmHg is reasonable for most, individualizing higher targets for chronic hypertension if needed and reassessing frequently to avoid both hypoperfusion and congestion [^114rC7zL] [^116M1KhU] [^114sfsAy] [^112SPgM7].

> Let me reconsider albumin briefly. I initially thought albumin might be renoprotective in septic shock, but wait, I should verify — data from ALBIOS and perioperative trials show no consistent reduction in AKI or RRT with albumin versus crystalloids, though some analyses suggest possible survival signals in septic shock subgroups. Given cost and lack of consistent renal benefit, albumin is not the routine choice for AKI volume expansion, though it may be considered selectively in septic shock or hypoalbuminemia after crystalloid resuscitation has been optimized [^116ttj6p] [^1162FgqQ].

> Bottom line: For patients with, or at risk of, AKI who need IV volume expansion, use isotonic balanced crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte) rather than 0.9% saline when feasible; avoid HES and other synthetic colloids; reserve albumin for select scenarios; and pair fluids with dynamic assessment and timely vasopressors to prevent fluid overload, with limited exceptions where saline is intentionally chosen for chloride repletion or neurosurgical considerations [^116gmNEP] [^115Y3xdJ] [^116t63eg].

---

Balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) are the **preferred fluids for AKI** [^116gmNEP] because they reduce major adverse kidney events compared with saline [^116t63eg] and are recommended by the ESICM (2024) and KDIGO (2012) [^notfound]. Saline is acceptable if balanced fluids are unavailable or in specific contexts (e.g. hypochloremic alkalosis), but **should be avoided in large volumes** due to hyperchloremic acidosis [^116CGTHr] and renal vasoconstriction [^1142sRSd]. Colloids, especially hydroxyethyl starch [^116ttj6p], **are contraindicated** due to increased AKI and mortality risk [^111QhqtH] [^116BESjx]. Fluid therapy should be individualized and guided by dynamic assessment [^115Y3xdJ] to **avoid both hypovolemia and fluid overload** [^111mj1UK] [^114rC7zL].

---

## Evidence supporting balanced crystalloids

Balanced crystalloids have **electrolyte compositions closer to plasma** [^115AaxyK], featuring lower chloride and buffers (lactate, acetate, gluconate) which reduce hyperchloremic acidosis [^1142sRSd] and renal vasoconstriction [^113fkgX8].

- **SMART trial**: Balanced crystalloids reduced major adverse kidney events (MAKE30) versus saline in critically ill adults (14.3% vs 15.4%; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.99; P = 0.04) [^116t63eg].

- **SALT-ED trial**: In non-ICU adults, balanced crystalloids reduced MAKE30 versus saline (4.7% vs 5.6%; OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70–0.95; P = 0.01) [^1149DfFC].

- **ESICM 2024**: Recommends balanced crystalloids over saline in AKI [^116gmNEP].

- **KDIGO 2012**: Recommends isotonic crystalloids over colloids for volume expansion in AKI [^115se755] [^111yGjMU].

---

## Risks associated with saline

Saline's high chloride content can cause **hyperchloremic acidosis** [^116CGTHr], renal vasoconstriction, and reduced GFR [^113fkgX8], which increases the risk of AKI and RRT [^1142sRSd].

- **Hyperchloremic acidosis**: Linked to renal vasoconstriction and reduced perfusion [^1142sRSd] [^116CGTHr].

- **Increased AKI risk**: Observational data associate saline with higher AKI and RRT rates [^1142sRSd] [^115AaxyK].

- **Guideline caution**: ESICM 2024 and KDIGO 2012 advise caution with saline in AKI [^116gmNEP] [^115se755] [^112SPgM7].

---

## Role of colloids

Colloids — especially **hydroxyethyl starch** [^116BESjx] — are associated with increased AKI, RRT, and mortality and **are not recommended in AKI** [^111QhqtH] [^112o8FKU]. **Albumin** has no clear renal benefit and should be used selectively if needed [^112o8FKU] [^1162FgqQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific factors

Fluid choice should be **individualized** to the clinical context and patient-specific factors [^115Y3xdJ].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred fluid** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| General AKI | Balanced crystalloids | - Lower MAKE30 [^116t63eg] <br/> - Guideline-supported [^116gmNEP] [^115se755] |
| Sepsis | Balanced crystalloids | Greater benefit in septic patients [^116t63eg] [^1149DfFC] |
| Hypochloremic alkalosis | Saline | Corrects chloride deficit [^1142sRSd] |
| Liver failure | Balanced crystalloids | Avoid lactate-containing fluids |
| Hyperkalemia | Saline | Avoid potassium-containing fluids |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **ESICM 2024**: Prefer balanced crystalloids over saline in AKI [^116gmNEP].

- **KDIGO 2012**: Use isotonic crystalloids over colloids for volume expansion in AKI [^111yGjMU] [^115se755].

- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign**: Use crystalloids for initial resuscitation; balanced solutions preferred in sepsis.

---

Balanced crystalloids are **preferred for AKI** [^116gmNEP] because they reduce kidney events [^116t63eg] and are guideline-endorsed. Saline is acceptable only when balanced fluids are unavailable or specifically indicated, and **colloids should be avoided** because of harm [^111QhqtH].

- **Fluid management and hemodynamic support**: Ensuring adequate hydration and volume status is essential in preventing and treating acute kidney injury (AKI). Both oral and intravenous (i.v.) fluids may be administered depending on the local environment and clinical context. The administration of i.v. fluids should be guided by hemodynamic assessment for specific indications and contraindications. When deciding on fluid therapy, consideration for the clinical context and history, including timing of the insult, is critical. Both the physiological response to fluids and the underlying condition related to AKI are dynamic over time, so fluid administration should be based on repeated assessment of overall fluid and hemodynamic status and dynamic tests of fluid responsiveness.

- **Timing of fluid administration**: There continues to be concern about excessive fluid administration for hypotension, and earlier use of vasoactive medications may be appropriate for some patients. The effect of these strategies on kidney function is not clearly defined and is likely to be context-specific. Ongoing major multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining kidney endpoints are evaluating fluid administration and vasoactive medications; their results are likely to impact AKI treatment recommendations.

- **Methods of fluid administration**: Significant new evidence from several large multicenter RCTs regarding the use of protocolized goal-directed fluid therapy in early septic shock has suggested important findings.

The effect of colloids on renal function has undergone extensive scrutiny over the last decade. Large RCTs have substantiated the increased risk of AKI and RRT with the use of starches, particularly in sepsis, where they also lead to increased mortality. This is verified by several meta-analyses, which underpin the abandonment of starches in critically ill patients. Clinical data on the effects of gelatine on renal function are scarce. A recent meta-analysis, including three trials in 212 patients comparing gelatins with crystalloids or albumin, indicated a 35% increased relative risk of developing AKI with gelatine.

In contrast to artificial colloids, the administration of albumin appears to be safe for the kidney. A large RCT comparing normal saline to 4% HA in various clinical settings failed to demonstrate any differences in renal function. In the ALBIOS trial, the use of hyperoncotic (20%) albumin showed no effect on AKI or the need for RRT in severe sepsis but enabled a less positive fluid balance, confirming the results of another small trial. A post hoc analysis of the ALBIOS trial showed a survival benefit in septic shock confirmed by meta-analyses. Hypoalbuminemia in cardiac surgery might be another indication, with improved fluid balance as well as a reduced rate of AKI being observed in a single-centre RCT of 220 patients.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury? Con [^1142sRSd]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The high chloride content of 0.9% saline leads to adverse pathophysiological effects in both animals and healthy human volunteers, changes not seen after balanced crystalloids. Small randomized trials confirm that the hyperchloremic acidosis induced by saline also occurs in patients; however, there was no demonstrable clinical outcome benefit when compared with balanced crystalloids, perhaps due to a type II error. A strong signal is emerging from recent large propensity-matched and cohort studies regarding the adverse effects that 0.9% saline has on the clinical outcomes in surgical and critically ill patients when compared with balanced crystalloids.

Major complications include an increased incidence of acute kidney injury, a greater need for renal replacement therapy, and the potential for pathological hyperchloremia to increase postoperative mortality. However, there are no large-scale randomized trials comparing 0.9% saline with balanced crystalloids. Some balanced crystalloids are hypo-osmolar and may not be suitable for neurosurgical patients because of their propensity to cause brain edema. Saline may be the solution of choice for the resuscitation of patients with alkalosis and hypochloremia.

Nevertheless, there is evidence to suggest that balanced crystalloids cause less detriment to renal function than 0.9% saline, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes. Hence, we argue that chloride-rich crystalloids such as 0.9% saline should be replaced with balanced crystalloids as the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury.

### Balanced crystalloids versus saline in critically ill adults [^116t63eg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Both balanced crystalloids and saline are used for intravenous fluid administration in critically ill adults, but it is not known which results in better clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: In a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial conducted in five intensive care units at an academic center, we assigned 15,802 adults to receive saline (0.9% sodium chloride) or balanced crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte A) according to the unit is randomization to which they were admitted. The primary outcome was a major adverse kidney event within 30 days — a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥ 200% of baseline) — all censored at hospital discharge or 30 days, whichever occurred first.

- **Results**: Among the 7,942 patients in the balanced-crystalloids group, 1,139 (14.3%) had a major adverse kidney event, compared with 1,211 of 7,860 patients (15.4%) in the saline group (marginal odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.99; conditional odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In-hospital mortality at 30 days was 10.3% in the balanced-crystalloids group and 11.1% in the saline group (P = 0.06). The incidence of new renal-replacement therapy was 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively (P = 0.08), and the incidence of persistent renal dysfunction was 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively (P = 0.60).

- **Conclusions**: Among critically ill adults, the use of balanced crystalloids for intravenous fluid administration resulted in a lower rate of major adverse kidney events compared to saline.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^115L5u9S]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The ongoing debate regarding the optimal choice of fluid — synthetic colloid or crystalloid solutions — for resuscitation in trauma patients remains unresolved. Large studies have shown little, if any, benefit of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 over traditional crystalloids. The CRISTAL trial identified a potential mortality benefit in a heterogeneous hypovolemic patient cohort resuscitated with various colloid solutions compared to crystalloid solutions. However, several limitations identified by the authors limit its applicability, including the lack of consideration for renal injury and potential 90-day outcome benefits, which warrant further research.

When reviewing the available literature, several trials indicate that recruitment and consent requirements resulted in fluid comparison commencing after the initial resuscitation phase, complicating outcome benefit interpretation in trauma patients. These studies do, however, demonstrate a trend toward requiring less synthetic colloid fluid to achieve hemodynamic goals compared to crystalloids, with a ratio of colloid to crystalloid (to achieve similar physiological effects) varying between 1:1.1 and 1:1.6. This ratio is smaller than previously thought, as the ATLS teaches a ratio of 1:3, with significance in subgroups of patients yet to be determined.

Concerns remain about the adverse effects of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on renal function and coagulopathy, although crystalloid fluids are not without complications. Further studies are needed to compare these solutions comprehensively.

### Balanced crystalloids versus normal saline for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^112YKrQf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a fundamental component of the management of critically ill patients, but whether the choice of crystalloid affects patient outcomes remains controversial. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloids with normal saline.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and EMBASE up to October 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared balanced crystalloids versus normal saline in critically ill patients. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary results were the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and risk of receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). Two authors independently screened articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The meta-analysis was conducted using Revman 5.3, trial sequential analysis (TSA) 0.9, and STATA 12.0.

- **Results**: Nine RCTs were identified. The pooled analyses showed that there were no significant differences in mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.86, 1.01, P = 0.08), incidence of AKI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88, 1.00, P = 0.06), or RRT use rate (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69, 1.27, P = 0.67) between balanced crystalloids and normal saline groups. However, TSA did not provide conclusive evidence.

- **Conclusions**: Among critically ill patients receiving crystalloid fluid therapy, use of a balanced crystalloid compared with normal saline did not reduce the mortality, risk of severe AKI, or RRT use rate. Further large randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm or refute this finding.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit. Expert opinion of the Working Group for Nephrology, ESICM [^112qRD7w]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). High credibility.

For preventative measures against acute kidney injury, specifically concerning the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, the ESICM 2010 guidelines recommend administering isotonic crystalloids for prophylactic volume expansion in patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. It is also advisable to consider administering isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution, especially for emergency procedures.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: An updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112Ax4vZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

General preventive measures should be applied to all patients admitted to the ICU, including the correction of hypovolemia and hypotension, discontinuation and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, and correction of hyperglycemia.

- **Fluid management**: The aim of fluid administration is to correct intravascular hypovolemia without causing fluid overload and associated complications, including the development and progression of AKI. An association between elevated central venous pressure, renal venous congestion, and development of AKI, mainly reported in congestive heart failure, has also been found in other ICU patient cohorts. A randomized trial in ARDS patients found fluid-restrictive strategies to be safe. In contrast, peri-operative restrictive fluid management increased the risk of AKI in patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery. In established AKI, the role of fluid restriction remains uncertain and likely depends on pre-existing intravascular volume status. A pilot study in critically ill patients with AKI showed that restricting fluid intake to prevent fluid overload was associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects and less need for RRT. Similarly, a strategy of active fluid restriction after initial fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock was associated with less AKI progression, but this finding could not be reproduced in two subsequent trials using a similar approach. The results of ongoing RCTs examining the effectiveness and safety of fluid restriction and the role of active de-resuscitation in high-risk environments are awaited.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^111ruYKS]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Patient characteristics at baseline are presented with continuous data as median [25th percentile – 75th percentile], unless otherwise noted. Categorical data are shown as number (no.) and percentage (%). No significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between the two study groups, with P values ranging from 0.05 to 0.78.

Chronic kidney disease stage III or greater is defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration equation and the patient's baseline creatinine value. Baseline creatinine is defined as the lowest plasma creatinine measured in the 12 months prior to hospitalization. If unavailable, it is the lowest plasma creatinine measured between hospitalization and intensive care unit admission. For patients without an available plasma creatinine between 12 months prior to hospitalization and the time of ED presentation, estimated creatinine is used. A total of 37 patients (28%) in the balanced crystalloid group and 45 patients (35%) in the saline group did not have a measured plasma creatinine value available between 12 months prior to hospital admission and the time of intensive care unit admission.

Acute kidney injury, stage II or greater, is defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria as either a first plasma creatinine value at the time of ED presentation at least 200% of the baseline value or both (1) greater than 4.0 mg/dL and (2) increased by at least 0.3 mg/dL from the baseline.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^114CV5FC]. Nephron Clinical Practice (2012). High credibility.

The KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering the use of oral N-acetylcysteine alongside IV isotonic crystalloids in patients who are at increased risk of developing contrast-induced acute kidney injury. These preventative measures are specifically aimed at reducing the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic hemodynamics is central to clinical management. However, there is considerable debate regarding the efficacy, nature, extent, and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue edema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences.

- **Conflict in treatment goals**: We discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolemia and renal injury.

Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain the best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

### COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury: Consensus report of the 25th acute disease quality initiative (ADQI) workgroup [^1149DfFC]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Hypovolaemia is common in early COVID-19 and hence individualized fluid management is critical. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated that fluid and vasopressor resuscitation based on dynamic haemodynamic assessment may reduce the risk of AKI and respiratory failure in patients with septic shock. We suggest that a similar strategy may be valuable in patients with COVID-19 to reduce the risk of COVID-19 AKI.

Since the publication of the KDIGO guidelines for AKI in 2012, more evidence has emerged regarding the importance of the composition of crystalloids used for volume expansion. The Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) demonstrated that, compared with saline, the use of balanced crystalloids decreased the composite outcome of death, new RRT, or persistent kidney dysfunction among critically ill adults, with the largest effect observed among patients with sepsis. This beneficial effect was replicated in non-critically ill patients and in the perioperative setting. However, three systematic reviews of studies in adults and children did not demonstrate reduced rates of AKI or mortality with balanced crystalloids compared with saline in pooled analyses. Given the possible harm caused by the use of 0.9% saline, we recommend using balanced fluids unless there is an indication for other types of fluid (e.g. saline 0.9% for hypochloraemic hypovolaemia).

Several strategies have also emerged for the prevention or mitigation of drug-associated AKI, the most important one being drug stewardship. Single- and multi-centre collaborative studies are ongoing to further explore this strategy.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: Part 1: Definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^112SPgM7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). High credibility.

Patients at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), and particularly those with manifest AKI, require careful monitoring of their hemodynamic status. This is in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. Hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy within protocols that have appropriate hemodynamic goals.

When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions. Therefore, ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP stresses that this rule does not apply to patients in whom a decrease in circulating volume is present, such as in hemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted. Iso-osmolar solutions with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also points out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

Renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and since the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^113nhEFc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety are key considerations in the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The wide variation in healthcare infrastructure, staffing, and funding within and across LMICs results in a broad range of treatment capabilities. A 2015 cross-sectional study on the identification and management of AKI in various healthcare facilities found that crystalloid fluid was used as initial management in 92% of all patients in LMICs, and 73.9% of these patients were administered antibiotics. Diuretics were used in 36.1% of patients. Additionally, a 2016 survey of 160 physicians treating kidney disease in low-resource settings revealed that nearly all regional hospitals had access to oral and intravenous hydration solutions and antibiotics. Meanwhile, only 60% and 52% of rural healthcare providers had access to intravenous fluids and antibiotics for AKI management, respectively.

Feasibility and affordability of AKI treatment have been ongoing challenges in LMICs, especially in remote and community healthcare settings. Intravenous fluids are the most commonly available resource for managing AKI in both urban and community settings in LMICs, and they could be beneficial for AKI patients early in their disease courses. However, emerging evidence suggests increased adverse outcomes among AKI, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and critically ill patients receiving excessive fluid resuscitation, raising safety concerns if this treatment is improperly implemented by providers with little working knowledge of fluid management. One observational study of 1,808 patients with sepsis across intensive care units (ICUs) in 84 countries found an increased risk of death in those…

### New insights into fluid resuscitation [^112o8FKU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recent high-quality randomized-controlled trials comparing the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) preparations and crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients have demonstrated an increased risk of death and use of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Consequently, several systematic reviews incorporating these new results have been published, consistently demonstrating an increased risk of death and use of RRT associated with HES solutions, regardless of the type of HES and dose administered, both in general intensive care patients and those with severe sepsis. These effects become apparent in the post-resuscitation period and may relate to increased tissue accumulation associated with HES. These results question the clinical role of semi-synthetic colloids for fluid resuscitation and mandate a reappraisal of how these fluids are administered to critically ill patients, specifically considering the potential for toxicity.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^113fkgX8]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluid is common in critical care. Historically, 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) has been the most frequently administered fluid. Balanced crystalloid solutions, such as lactated Ringer's solution and Plasma-Lyte, represent an increasingly used alternative to saline. Recent data from clinical trials suggest that crystalloid composition may affect patient outcomes, such as kidney injury, but the mechanistic effects of balanced crystalloids versus saline on the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) remain uncertain.

Pre-clinical studies have found that the chloride content of intravenous fluids influences renal vasoconstriction, glomerular filtration rate, biomarkers of AKI, and the incidence of AKI by clinical criteria and histology. Randomized trials among healthy human volunteers suggest that intravenous solutions with high chloride content, such as 0.9% saline, may decrease renal artery blood velocity, renal cortical perfusion, and urine output. A small randomized trial among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery found lower concentrations of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an early biomarker of renal tubular injury, with balanced crystalloids compared to saline.

Observational studies have reported lower rates of AKI and renal replacement therapy (RRT) among acutely ill adults treated with balanced crystalloids rather than saline. Two recent clinical trials found that balanced crystalloid solutions decreased the composite of death, RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction during acute illness.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^115Nv1fn]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Recent trials have suggested that the use of balanced crystalloids may decrease the incidence of major adverse kidney events compared to saline in critically ill adults. However, the effect of crystalloid composition on biomarkers of early acute kidney injury remains unknown.

- **Methods**: From February 15 to July 15, 2016, an ancillary study to the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART) was conducted. This study compared the effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) among 261 consecutively-enrolled critically ill adults admitted from the emergency department to the medical ICU. After obtaining informed consent, urine was collected 36 ± 12 hours after hospital admission. NGAL and KIM-1 levels were measured using commercially available ELISAs. Levels at 36 ± 12 hours were compared between patients assigned to balanced crystalloids and those assigned to saline using a Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Results**: The 131 patients (50.2%) assigned to the balanced crystalloid group and the 130 patients (49.8%) assigned to the saline group were similar at baseline. Urinary NGAL levels were significantly lower in the balanced crystalloid group (median, 39.4 ng/mg [IQR 9.9 to 133.2]) compared with the saline group (median, 64.4 ng/mg [IQR 27.6 to 339.9]) (P < 0.001). However, urinary KIM-1 levels did not significantly differ between the balanced crystalloid group (median, 2.7 ng/mg [IQR 1.5 to 4.9]) and the saline group (median, 2.4 ng/mg [IQR 1.3 to 5.0]) (P = 0.36).

- **Conclusions**: In this ancillary analysis of a clinical trial, the use of balanced crystalloids was associated with significantly lower urinary NGAL levels compared to saline, although no significant difference was observed in KIM-1 levels.

### Management of acute kidney injury: Core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.

Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently, there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Fluid balance and acute kidney injury [^114sfsAy]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous fluids are widely administered to patients who have, or are at risk of, acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the deleterious consequences of overzealous fluid therapy are increasingly being recognized. Salt and water overload can predispose individuals to organ dysfunction, impaired wound healing, and nosocomial infection, particularly in patients with AKI, where fluid challenges are frequent and excretion is impaired.

In this review article, we discuss how interstitial edema can further delay renal recovery and why conservative fluid strategies are now being advocated. Applying these strategies in critical illness is challenging. Although volume resuscitation is needed to restore cardiac output, it often leads to tissue edema, thereby contributing to ongoing organ dysfunction.

- **Conservative strategies**: Fluid management mandates a switch towards neutral balance and then negative balance once hemodynamic stabilization is achieved. In patients with AKI, this approach might require renal replacement therapy to be given earlier than with more liberal fluid management. However, hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion can occur in patients with AKI if excessive fluid removal is pursued with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy. Thus, accurate assessment of fluid status and careful definition of targets are needed at all stages to improve clinical outcomes.

A conservative strategy of fluid management was recently tested and found to be effective in a large, randomized controlled trial in patients with acute lung injury. Similar randomized controlled studies in patients with AKI are needed to further validate this approach.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury? Con [^113PBR9v]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical studies in surgical or critically ill patients highlight that, although human studies have confirmed 0.9% saline infusions lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, adversely affecting renal function, there was no concrete evidence linking saline use to adverse patient outcomes until recently. A recent review noted side effects associated with saline use, but it emphasized that these had not yet resulted in clinically important outcomes, likely due to a lack of data.

A literature review fails to identify any clinical study proving 0.9% saline is superior to balanced crystalloids. Despite the absence of evidence supporting better clinical outcomes with balanced crystalloids until recent years, 0.9% saline continues to be widely used. Studies in perioperative and resuscitation settings demonstrate that 0.9% saline causes hyperchloremic acidosis compared to balanced crystalloids. Although these studies involved relatively small patient numbers and showed no clinical outcome differences between groups, they suggest temporary hyperchloremic acidosis from 0.9% saline could be mistakenly attributed pathological significance and potentially exacerbate acidosis from a definite pathological state. Recent studies indicate that 0.9% saline may lead to more adverse events than balanced crystalloids, resulting in worse patient outcomes.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^116eCx8n]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly impacts clinical outcomes across a range of baseline risks. For instance, after controlling for other variables, critically ill patients developing stage 2 AKI had an odds ratio (OR) for hospital mortality of 2.95 (95% CI 1.38–6.28, p = 0.005) compared to those without AKI. In contrast, those with stage 3 AKI had an OR of 6.88 (95% CI 3.87–12.23, p < 0.001). Risk-adjusted rates for AKI and mortality are similar worldwide. Additionally, patients developing AKI had worse kidney function at hospital discharge, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in 47.7% (95% CI 43.6–51.7), compared to 14.8% (95% CI 11.9–18.2) in those without AKI, p < 0.001. Thus, the composite of death, dialysis, and persistent kidney dysfunction, often referred to as major adverse kidney events (MAKE), is an attractive endpoint for trials of treatments for AKI.

However, MAKE is not an appropriate endpoint for prevention trials.

- **Effectiveness in context**: Rates of MAKE are modest in many settings. For example, in cardiac surgery, only about 10.5% of patients develop MAKE prior to 90 days. Patients with AKI experience MAKE at a rate of 12%, with rates increasing with AKI severity, while it occurs in 4.5% of patients without AKI. Thus, AKI increases the risk for MAKE nearly threefold. However, an intervention reducing AKI occurrence by 25% would only modestly impact MAKE rates, potentially lowering its occurrence from 10.5% to 9% depending on the rates and severity distribution of AKI in the cohort studied.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship.

However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. The use of a standardized fluid stewardship test (FST) can be considered in AKI to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression and integrate into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered.

Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^115ExDBi]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Derivation of the study cohort**: A total of 261 patients admitted from the ED between February 15, 2016, and July 15, 2016, and located in the medical ICU on day 2 of hospital admission provided informed consent for biospecimen collection and were included in the analysis (Figure S2). Of these, 131 (50.2%) were assigned to the balanced crystalloid group in SMART, and 130 (49.8%) were assigned to the saline group. A total of 111 of the 261 patients (42.5%) also had urine samples available from day 0, of whom 60 (54.1%) were in the balanced crystalloid group, and 51 (45.9%) were in the saline group.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Among the 261 patients enrolled, the median age was 58 years. Twelve percent of patients had stage III or greater chronic kidney disease (CKD) (as defined in the supplemental methods), 26% had stage II or greater AKI at ED presentation (prior to the intervention), 26% had a diagnosis of sepsis, and 8% were receiving vasopressors. Patients assigned to the balanced crystalloid group (n = 131) and saline group (n = 130) were similar at baseline with respect to age, gender, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, and baseline plasma creatinine concentration (Table 1, Tables S3–4). Among the 111 patients with urinary biomarkers measured on day 0, the balanced crystalloid and saline groups did not differ with regard to urinary NGAL level (median, 70 [IQR, 33 to 442] vs. 81 [IQR, 28 to 461]; P = 0.89) or KIM-1 level (median, 3.5 [IQR, 2.1 to 6.9] vs. 3.1 [IQR, 1.4 to 5.5]; P = 0.36).

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^117BVgdy]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Among all 261 patients, urinary NGAL levels on day 2 were significantly lower in the balanced crystalloid group (median: 39.4 ng/mg; IQR: 9.9 to 133.2) compared with the saline group (median: 64.4 ng/mg; IQR: 27.6 to 339.9) (P < 0.001). Urinary KIM-1 levels on day 2 did not differ between the balanced crystalloid group (median: 2.7 ng/mg; IQR: 1.5 to 4.9) and the saline group (median: 2.4 ng/mg; IQR: 1.3 to 5.0) (P = 0.36). Results were similar in analyses adjusting for pre-specified baseline covariates.

- **Urinary biomarker levels on day 2 by study group**: Urinary NGAL and KIM-1 concentration levels, scaled to urinary creatinine concentration, are displayed for patients in the balanced crystalloid group (green) and saline group (yellow). The three horizontal lines on each colored box indicate the upper quartile, median, and lower quartile, respectively, with vertical dashed lines extending to 1.5 times the interquartile range. Each boxplot is overlaid with one dot for each patient's observed biomarker values.

- **Subgroup analyses**: The effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary NGAL levels on day 2 appeared to be greater among patients without sepsis, patients with higher APACHE II scores, and patients with AKI on ED presentation. Scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II range from 0 to 71.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury? Con [^116CGTHr]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The hyperchloremic acidosis caused by the infusion of moderate-to-large quantities of 0.9% saline can last for several hours after the end of the infusion, even in healthy volunteers, and may reflect the lower [Na+]:[Cl−] ratio in saline (1:1) than in balanced crystalloids (1.18–1.43:1) or in plasma (1.38:1). Two theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: dilutional acidosis and the Stewart hypothesis.

It has been proposed that the infusion of large volumes of saline causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration due to a dilutional effect, resulting in acidosis. The effects of randomly allocated 2-hour infusions of almost 70 ml/kg (i.e. up to 5 liters) of 0.9% saline or Hartmann's solution were studied in patients undergoing elective gynecological operations. There was a significant decrease in pH (7.41–7.28), serum bicarbonate concentration (23.5–18.4 mmol/l), and anion gap (16.2–11.2 mmol/l), accompanied by an increase in serum chloride concentration (104–115 mmol/l) during the first 2 hours of saline infusion. Although pH, bicarbonate, and chloride concentrations did not change significantly after Hartmann's solution, the anion gap decreased (15.2–12.1 mmol/l). The volume of fluid replacement in this study may be considered excessive, but it confirmed that hyperchloremic acidosis accompanied saline infusions in patients. In a study of 30 patients undergoing major surgery, randomly allocated to receive either 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte 148 at 15 ml/kg/h, those receiving saline had significantly increased chloride concentrations (Δ[Cl−] +6.9 vs. +0.6 mmol/l, P < 0).

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury? Con [^112bof9H]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, on the basis of literature, there is adequate evidence to suggest that balanced crystalloids are more physiological than 0.9% saline and cause less detriment to renal function, with perhaps better clinical outcomes. Hence, we submit that we have presented a coherent argument to recommend that chloride-rich crystalloids such as 0.9% saline should be replaced with balanced crystalloids as the mainstays of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury.

We recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65–70 mmHg (Grade 1B) rather than a higher MAP target (80–85 mmHg) in patients with septic shock. However, for patients with chronic hypertension, we recommend aiming for a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock (Grade 1C). We recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than to 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage with severe admission hypertension (Grade 1C). If vasopressors are needed for the treatment of hypotension, we recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function (Grade 1B) and suggest vasopressin in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery (Grade 2C). We suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available (BPS).

Preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can theoretically be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation or inotropic drugs, through renal vasodilators or systemic vasopressors. Optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in a large open-label multicenter RCT randomizing 777 patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. In most of the patients, the achieved MAP was above the set target. The study found no difference in mortality, incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.7% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.42), or need for RRT (33.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.5), but more atrial fibrillation in the high target group.

### Effect of a buffered crystalloid solution vs saline on acute kidney injury among patients in the intensive care unit: The SPLIT randomized clinical trial [^113dbjVJ]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is the most commonly administered intravenous fluid; however, its use may be associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality.

- **Objective**: To determine the effect of a buffered crystalloid compared with saline on renal complications in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

- **Design and setting**: Double-blind, cluster randomized, double-crossover trial conducted in four ICUs in New Zealand from April 2014 through October 2014. Three ICUs were general medical and surgical ICUs; one ICU had a predominance of cardiothoracic and vascular surgical patients.

- **Participants**: All patients admitted to the ICU requiring crystalloid fluid therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients with established AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) were excluded. All 2278 eligible patients were enrolled; 1152 of 1162 patients (99.1%) receiving buffered crystalloid and 1110 of 1116 patients (99.5%) receiving saline were analyzed.

- **Interventions**: Participating ICUs were assigned a masked study fluid, either saline or a buffered crystalloid, for alternating 7-week treatment blocks. Two ICUs commenced using one fluid, and the other two commenced using the alternative fluid. Two crossovers occurred so that each ICU used each fluid twice over the 28 weeks of the study. The treating clinician determined the rate and frequency of fluid administration.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with AKI (defined as a rise in serum creatinine level of at least 2-fold or a serum creatinine level of ≥ 3.96 mg/dL).

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: Diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^1162FgqQ]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Whether colloids have a role in surgery has been debated and studied. Colloids, specifically hydroxyethyl starch solutions, initially held promise as a way to minimize the overall volume of fluids administered but have been shown to be nephrotoxic in the intensive care setting. While the nephrotoxic effect was not replicated in surgical populations, strong evidence of coagulopathy, bleeding, and transfusion prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland) to issue a black box warning in 2013, and the European Medicines Agency (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to suspend marketing authorization in 2018. The widespread use of the synthetic colloid hydroxyethyl starch waned behind mounting evidence of potential clinical harm; however, whether this risk persists with human-derived albumin (the primary colloid replacement for hydroxyethyl starch) remained unresolved.

Albumin is routinely utilized in cardiac surgery to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and for volume replacement, although evidence supporting such practice is limited or conflicting. The randomized, double-blind, single-center Albumin in Cardiac Surgery (ALBICS) trial showed no difference in major adverse events (a composite including acute kidney injury) between cardiac surgery patients with albumin or lactated Ringer's solution used for cardiopulmonary bypass priming fluid and perioperative volume replacement, suggesting that routine use of albumin did not provide any benefit for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A recent meta-analysis confirmed this finding.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^1178uzWT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Intravenous fluids are drugs and should be prescribed as such. Among the available fluids, crystalloids have the highest benefit/risk ratio and should generally be prescribed first. For critically ill patients or when a large amount of fluids is expected to be infused, balanced solutions should be preferred due to their favorable effects on patient outcomes, including kidney function. The preferred solution for non-critically ill patients or low-volume resuscitation is less clear. However, given the availability of balanced solutions and their low cost, they could be considered for all patients.

The role of albumin remains a matter of debate, but there is indirect evidence that albumin may favorably affect the outcomes of patients with septic shock. The indications and effects of gelatins remain unclear for critically ill patients. The role of dextrans in this patient population should probably remain marginal until more data is forthcoming.

Acute renal failure in the intensive care unit is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

- **Objectives**: To determine recommendations for the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI), focusing on the role of potential preventative maneuvers including volume expansion, diuretics, use of inotropes, vasopressors/vasodilators, hormonal interventions, nutrition, and extracorporeal techniques.

- **Method**: A systematic search of the literature was performed for studies using these potential protective agents in adult patients at risk for acute renal failure/kidney injury between 1966 and 2009. The following clinical conditions were considered: major surgery, critical illness, sepsis, shock, and use of potentially nephrotoxic drugs and radiocontrast media. Where possible, the following endpoints were extracted: creatinine clearance, glomerular filtration rate, increase in serum creatinine, urine output, and markers of tubular injury. Clinical endpoints included the need for renal replacement therapy, length of stay, and mortality. Studies are graded according to the international Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group system.

- **Conclusions and recommendations**: Several measures are recommended, though none carries grade 1A. We recommend prompt resuscitation of the circulation with special attention to providing adequate hydration while avoiding high-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) preparations and maintaining adequate blood pressure using vasopressors in vasodilatory shock. We suggest specific vasodilators.

We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

- **Prevention of AKI**: For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for the expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure.

- **Diagnosis of AKI**: For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We suggest the expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow.

- **Management of AKI**: For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as the first choice, where available and feasible.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend restricting the use of contrast medium. They advise administering either iso-osmolar or low-osmolar iodinated contrast media, rather than high-osmolar iodinated contrast media, in patients at increased risk of contrast-induced AKI.

**Volume expansion recommendations**: We recommend controlled fluid resuscitation in volume depletion, while, however, avoiding volume overload (Grade 1C). We recommend against the use of starches (Grade 1A), as harm has been shown, and suggest not using gelatine or dextrans for fluid resuscitation (Grade 2C). We recommend correction of hypovolaemia/dehydration using isotonic crystalloids in patients receiving intravascular contrast media (Grade 1B). Regular monitoring of chloride levels and acid-base status is recommended in situations where chloride-rich solutions are used (BPS). For large volume resuscitation, we suggest the use of balanced crystalloids (Grade 2C). If a colloid is deemed necessary for the treatment of patients with septic shock, human serum albumin is suggested (Grade 2C). We suggest prophylactic volume expansion with crystalloids to prevent AKI by certain drugs (specified below) (BPS). Finally, we advise not delaying urgent contrast-enhanced investigations or interventions for potential preventative measures (BPS).

### Crystalloids versus colloids: Exploring differences in fluid requirements by systematic review and meta-regression [^1174rCym]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Positive fluid balance has been associated with worse outcomes, and knowledge of differences in the amounts of different types of fluid needed to achieve the same endpoints may have important clinical implications. Large molecules persist longer in the blood vessels than smaller molecules, which means that less intravenous colloid may be needed to achieve similar hemodynamic endpoints compared to crystalloid. Recent clinical data, however, challenge this physiological concept, with investigators reporting lower-than-expected crystalloid/colloid ratios in various populations.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to December 18, 2013, to retrieve all studies comparing any type of crystalloid with any type of colloid in all types of patients. The crystalloid/colloid ratio was calculated for each study. Descriptive analysis was performed for all studies, and a meta-analysis was conducted on those studies reporting full data, in terms of means and standard deviations, of infused fluid volumes. Studies were grouped according to study and population characteristics. A meta-regression analysis was then performed to evaluate some of the possible reasons for differences in crystalloid/colloid ratios across studies.

- **Results**: From 976 studies, 48 were retained for the final analysis; 24 of these had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The crystalloid/colloid ratio across all the studies included in the meta-analysis was 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.65), with marked heterogeneity among studies (I = 94%).

### Pragmatic recommendations for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^113xjp5W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the management of patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) are largely based on evidence from resource-rich settings, mostly located in high-income countries. It is often impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings. We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

- **Prevention of AKI**: For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure.

- **Diagnosis of AKI**: We suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We also suggest the expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow.

- **Management of AKI**: For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend the judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as the first choice, where available and feasible. For patients requiring dialysis who do have ARDS, we suggest using hemodialysis.

### Effect of balanced crystalloids versus saline on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults [^113yG2x8]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The co-primary outcomes for the study were urinary concentrations (scaled to urinary creatinine) of NGAL and KIM-1 on day 2. Secondary biomarker outcomes included the change in NGAL and KIM-1 concentration (scaled to urinary creatinine concentration) from day 0 to day 2 among patients with urine available from day 0.

Secondary clinical outcomes included 30-day in-hospital mortality, stage II or greater acute kidney injury (AKI) according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria, highest creatinine level before discharge or day 30, final creatinine value before discharge or day 30, new receipt of renal-replacement therapy (RRT), the number of days alive and free from the ICU, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and RRT. Additionally, the proportion of patients who met one or more criteria for a major adverse kidney event within 30 days (MAKE30) — the composite of death, new receipt of RRT, or persistent renal dysfunction — was also evaluated.

Effects of haemodialysis or haemofiltration

- **Recommendation**: We do not recommend using prophylactic intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) or haemofiltration (HF) for the purpose of prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) only (1C).

- **Rationale**: The evidence collected by KDIGO demonstrates that IHD to prevent CIN in well pre-hydrated patients at risk is not effective and that there is even a trend to more harm, including more CIN and an increased need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). High-volume HF in this setting has been reported to be beneficial. The protocol used in these studies included HF in the ICU with high volumes of bicarbonate fluid. It seems likely that under these conditions, the beneficial effects observed were due to volume expansion and loading with bicarbonate rather than to the removal of contrast media by HF. In view of the high costs and logistical problems, the evidence seems too weak to recommend prophylactic HF at this moment.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^115Y3xdJ]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Correction of intravascular hypovolemia is a key component of the prevention and management of acute kidney injury (AKI), but excessive fluid administration is associated with poor outcomes, including the development and progression of AKI. There is growing evidence that fluid administration should be individualized, taking into account patient characteristics, the nature of the acute illness and trajectories, and the risks and benefits of fluids. Existing data support the preferential use of buffered solutions for fluid resuscitation of patients at risk of AKI who do not have hypochloremia. There is a limited role for albumin, and starches should be avoided. Fluids should only be administered until intravascular hypovolemia has been corrected and euvolemia has been achieved using the minimum amount of fluid required to achieve and maintain euvolemia. Oliguria alone should not be viewed as a trigger for fluid administration. If fluid overload occurs, fluid therapy needs to be discontinued, and fluid removal using diuretic agents or extracorporeal therapies should be considered.

### Restrictive fluid management versus usual care in acute kidney injury (REVERSE-AKI): A pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial [^114rC7zL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

We compared a restrictive fluid management strategy to usual care among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who had received initial fluid resuscitation.

- **Methods**: This multicenter feasibility trial randomized 100 AKI patients 1:1 in seven ICUs in Europe and Australia. Restrictive fluid management included targeting a negative or neutral daily fluid balance by minimizing fluid input and/or enhancing urine output with diuretics administered at the discretion of the clinician. Fluid boluses were given as clinically indicated. The primary endpoint was cumulative fluid balance 72 hours from randomization.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) cumulative fluid balance at 72 hours from randomization was -1080 mL (2003 mL) in the restrictive fluid management arm and 61 mL (3131 mL) in the usual care arm, with a mean difference (95% CI) of -1148 mL (-2200 to -96) mL, P = 0.033. Median [IQR] duration of AKI was 2 [1–3] days and 3 [2–7] days, respectively (median difference -1.0 [-3.0 to 0.0], P = 0.071). In total, 6 out of 46 (13%) patients in the restrictive fluid management arm and 15 out of 50 (30%) in the usual care arm received renal replacement therapy (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.16–0.91), P = 0.043. Cumulative fluid balance at 24 hours and 7 days was lower in the restrictive fluid management arm. The dose of diuretics was not different between the groups. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the usual care arm.

- **Conclusions**: In critically ill patients with AKI, a restrictive fluid management regimen resulted in lower cumulative fluid balance and fewer adverse events compared to usual care.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions [^115AaxyK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is the most common intervention received by acutely ill patients. Historically, saline (0.9% sodium chloride) has been the most frequently administered intravenous fluid, especially in North America. Balanced crystalloid solutions (e.g. lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte) are an increasingly used alternative to saline. Balanced crystalloids have sodium, potassium, and chloride content closer to that of extracellular fluid and, when given intravenously, have fewer adverse effects on acid-base balance.

Preclinical research has demonstrated that saline may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, inflammation, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and death. Studies of patients and healthy human volunteers suggest that even relatively small volumes of saline may exert physiological effects. Randomized trials in the operating room have demonstrated that using balanced crystalloids rather than saline prevents the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may reduce the need for vasopressors.

Observational studies among critically ill adults have associated receipt of balanced crystalloids with lower rates of complications, including acute kidney injury and death. Most recently, large randomized trials among critically ill adults have examined whether balanced crystalloids result in less death or severe renal dysfunction than saline. Although some of these trials are still ongoing, a growing body of evidence raises fundamental concerns regarding saline as the primary intravenous crystalloid for critically ill adults.

### The risk of AKI in patients treated with intravenous solutions containing hydroxyethyl starch [^116BESjx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). High credibility.

Intravenous fluids are arguably one of the most commonly administered inpatient therapies and have largely been viewed as part of the nephrologist's toolkit in the management of acute kidney disease. Recently, findings have suggested that intravenous fluids may be harmful if given in excess (quantitative toxicity) and that some may be more harmful than others (qualitative toxicity), particularly for patients who already have AKI. Recent clinical trials have investigated hydroxyethyl starch solutions and found worrying results for the renal community. In this brief review, we consider the published literature on the role of hydroxyethyl starch solutions in AKI, with particular emphasis on two large recent randomized clinical trials conducted in Europe and Australia.

In this ancillary analysis of a clinical trial comparing balanced crystalloids to saline among critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids were associated with modestly lower urinary concentrations of NGAL and similar urinary concentrations of KIM-1, compared with saline. Future research should examine mechanisms other than tubular injury by which the use of balanced crystalloids rather than saline might affect the receipt of renal replacement therapy and death.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^1119zuuW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluids are closely linked through oliguria, which is both a marker of the former and a trigger for the administration of the latter. Recent advancements in this field have challenged the physiological and clinical rationale for using oliguria as a trigger for fluid administration. This has brought attention to the delicate balance between the benefits and harms of different fluid management strategies in critically ill patients, particularly those with AKI. This narrative review addresses various aspects of fluid management in AKI, outlining physiological aspects, the effects of crystalloids and colloids on kidney function, and the impact of various resuscitation and de-resuscitation strategies on the course and outcome of AKI.

In summary, large infusions of fluids may predict a higher risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Our findings support the hypothesis that routine intravenous fluids may not be routine and, in themselves, may be associated with organ dysfunction. Our results can be used to build hypotheses for further controlled trials.

### Acute kidney injury: Diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and the resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. It is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. The severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine levels. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present, such as in older males with prostatic hypertrophy.

General management principles for acute kidney injury include the determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and a reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is an inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause.

Rationale

Relative and overt hypovolemia are significant risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). Timely fluid administration can restore circulating volume and renal perfusion, which may also reduce nephrotoxicity. Volume replacement should be performed in a controlled, monitored fashion, as the injudicious use of fluids carries inherent risks. It may even contribute to AKI by increasing renal interstitial edema and renal parenchymal pressure. Moreover, goal-directed therapy, including the use of central venous pressure (CVP) as a resuscitation target, has not been shown to prevent AKI in sepsis.

Volume replacement may be administered using crystalloids, colloids, or their combination. Isotonic crystalloids represent the mainstay for correcting extracellular volume depletion, with the caveat that hyperchloremia should be prevented to reduce potential renal vasoconstriction. Compared to crystalloids, colloids theoretically result in greater plasma expansion. However, this effect depends on vascular barrier integrity, which may be compromised in sepsis, particularly in the presence of vasoplegia. Consequently, the difference in required volumes for fluid resuscitation was minimal between crystalloids and colloids in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, large volume replacement with colloids alone risks hyperoncotic impairment of glomerular filtration and osmotic tubular damage.

Available artificial colloids include gelatins, dextrans, and until recently, starches. Gelatins have a moderate volume effect. Although there is a risk of osmotic nephrosis with gelatins, there is a lack of clear clinical data on deleterious outcomes.

### Colloids versus crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill people [^111QhqtH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Critically ill individuals may lose fluid due to serious conditions, infections such as sepsis, trauma, or burns, and require urgent fluid replacement to prevent dehydration or kidney failure. Colloid or crystalloid solutions may be employed for this purpose. Crystalloids, which contain small molecules, are cost-effective, easy to use, and provide immediate fluid resuscitation but may increase oedema. Colloids, which have larger molecules, are more expensive and may offer quicker volume expansion in the intravascular space but can induce allergic reactions, blood clotting disorders, and kidney failure. This report updates a Cochrane Review last published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of using colloids versus crystalloids in critically ill individuals requiring fluid volume replacement on mortality, need for blood transfusion or renal replacement therapy (RRT), and adverse events (specifically allergic reactions, itching, and rashes).

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 23 February 2018. Clinical trials registers were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving critically ill individuals requiring fluid volume replacement in hospital or emergency out-of-hospital settings. Participants included those with trauma, burns, or medical conditions like sepsis. We excluded neonates, elective surgery, and caesarean section cases. The comparison was made between a colloid (suspended in any crystalloid solution) and a crystalloid (isotonic or hypertonic).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion.
