## Question

Middle-aged man with episodic sympathetic symptoms and elevated plasma free metanephrines suggesting catecholamine-secreting tumor.

A 49 year-old-male presents with a primary complaint of several recent episodes of severe headache, sudden anxiety, and a 'racing heart'. The patient originally attributed these symptoms to stress at work; however, these episodes are becoming more frequent and severe. Laboratory evaluation during such an episode reveals elevated plasma free metanephrines. Which of the following additional findings in this patient is most likely?

Answer Choices:
A. Decreased 24 hour urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels
B. Episodic hypertension
C. Anhidrosis
D. Hypoglycemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which additional finding is most likely in a 49-year-old man with episodic sympathetic symptoms and elevated plasma free metanephrines, consistent with a catecholamine-secreting tumor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma and how that translates into clinical manifestations. Then, I should verify the diagnostic implications of elevated plasma free metanephrines. Next, I will evaluate each answer choice against guideline-supported features and the literature. Finally, I will select the most likely finding and briefly justify why the alternatives are less likely or incorrect, anchoring to high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its mechanism. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that cause episodic surges of norepinephrine and/or epinephrine, producing paroxysmal symptoms such as headache, diaphoresis, palpitations, anxiety, and hypertension; these spells reflect transient vasoconstriction and sympathetic hyperactivity rather than sustained disease, which explains the episodic nature of the presentation [^e438d8d7] [^6a7eec4d].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical marker. Elevated plasma free metanephrines is a highly sensitive first-line test for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma because metanephrines are continuously produced from tumor catecholamine metabolism and are relatively stable in plasma, yielding sensitivity around 99% in referral cohorts; this strongly supports the diagnosis in the right clinical context and makes the pretest probability high here [^abde78c9] [^c6339c1c].

> Now, I will examine Option A, decreased 24-hour urine VMA. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: VMA is a metabolite of catecholamines, but it is neither sensitive nor specific for pheochromocytoma, and contemporary guidelines explicitly recommend against using VMA for evaluation because it misses many cases; thus, a decreased VMA would not be expected and would not support the diagnosis, making this option unlikely and guideline-discordant [^3292ae42].

> Next, Option B, episodic hypertension. I should confirm whether this aligns with the pathophysiology and guidelines. Paroxysmal hypertension is a hallmark feature of catecholamine-secreting tumors and is repeatedly emphasized in hypertension guidelines as a key indication to test for pheochromocytoma; the spells reflect catecholamine surges with vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output, so episodic hypertension is exactly what we would expect in this patient [^e438d8d7] [^2d0adbc2].

> Let me consider Option C, anhidrosis. Hmm, wait a minute, anhidrosis reflects sympathetic cholinergic failure and is not a feature of pheochromocytoma; instead, these patients often have diaphoresis during spells due to sympathetic activation, so anhidrosis would argue against, not for, a catecholamine-secreting tumor in this context [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option D, hypoglycemia. Hold on, I should verify the metabolic profile. Pheochromocytoma is classically associated with hyperglycemia from catecholamine-induced glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, not hypoglycemia; hypoglycemia would suggest an insulinoma or other etiology rather than a catecholamine-secreting tumor, so this is inconsistent with the expected pathophysiology here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most likely additional finding is episodic hypertension, which is mechanistically expected, clinically characteristic, and explicitly highlighted in guidelines as a core manifestation prompting biochemical testing for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma; the other options either reflect outdated or insensitive tests (VMA), incompatible autonomic signs (anhidrosis), or conflicting metabolic patterns (hypoglycemia) [^e438d8d7] [^2d0adbc2].

---

The most likely additional finding in a middle-aged man with episodic sympathetic symptoms and elevated plasma free metanephrines is **episodic hypertension** [^e438d8d7], as catecholamine-secreting tumors characteristically cause paroxysmal hypertension during spells [^6a7eec4d]. This aligns with the classic triad of headache, sweating, and palpitations [^e438d8d7] and is supported by guideline emphasis on testing for pheochromocytoma in patients with paroxysmal hypertension or spells with BP lability, headache, sweating, and palpitations [^2d0adbc2]. Decreased VMA is unlikely because VMA is a nonspecific, low-sensitivity metabolite that is not used to exclude pheochromocytoma [^3292ae42]; anhidrosis is not expected, as these tumors typically cause diaphoresis; and hypoglycemia is not a feature of catecholamine excess, which tends to raise glucose [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of catecholamine-secreting tumors

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that **secrete catecholamines** (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine), causing episodic sympathetic activation [^abde78a9]. Plasma free metanephrines are elevated because tumors continuously metabolize catecholamines to metanephrines, providing high diagnostic sensitivity [^abde78a9].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with **paroxysmal symptoms** due to episodic catecholamine release, including:

- Severe headache
- Palpitations/tachycardia
- Diaphoresis
- Anxiety/panic
- Pallor
- Nausea/vomiting
- Chest pain
- Episodic hypertension or hypertensive crises [^e438d8d7]

The **classic triad** of headache, sweating, and palpitations is highly suggestive [^e438d8d7].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Clinical relevance** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Decreased 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels | VMA is a nonspecific metabolite with low sensitivity; decreased VMA does not support pheochromocytoma and is not used to exclude it [^3292ae42] | Unlikely |
| B. Episodic hypertension | Characteristic of catecholamine-secreting tumors; paroxysmal hypertension is a hallmark feature [^e438d8d7] | Most likely |
| C. Anhidrosis | These tumors typically cause diaphoresis, not anhidrosis | Unlikely |
| D. Hypoglycemia | Catecholamines increase glucose via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis; hypoglycemia is not expected | Unlikely |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely additional finding is **episodic hypertension**, consistent with catecholamine excess and supported by clinical guidelines [^e438d8d7]. Confirm diagnosis with repeat plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines under strict conditions [^c6339c1c], followed by adrenal imaging (CT/MRI) and functional imaging if needed [^619cb8b9].

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^691e71de]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Economic evaluation (decision analysis)

We investigated whether use of an age-adjusted fractionated plasma metanephrine measurement could result in cost savings in imaging expenditures, compared to use of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements interpreted in a conventional fashion, for detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma in a hypothetical tertiary care hypertensive population. We thus performed a decision analysis, with resource implications defined by costs of confirmatory imaging (CT and MRI), interpreted from a third party payer perspective. In the decision analysis, we compared algorithm "A" in which biochemical testing consisted of measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines with these measurements interpreted relative to the 95% reference range (defined by a normetanephrine fraction above 0.9 nmol/L or a metanephrine fraction above 0.5 nmol/L) to algorithm "B", in which fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements were interpreted by using the age-adjusted metanephrine score. The sensitivity and specificity of biochemical tests was based on data from the validation set. In each algorithm, all patients with positive biochemical testing would undergo confirmatory imaging. The imaging protocol for patients with positive biochemical tests in either strategies began with computerized tomography ([CT] with and without intravenous contrast) of the abdomen, then if negative, I-131 or I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (efficacy for I-131 and costs for I-123 shown). The horizon (endpoint) of the analyses was positive diagnosis or exclusion of pheochromocytoma, for hypothetical hypertensive patients subjected to each strategy. The outcome of the analyses was the number of patients with pheochromocytoma expected to be detected by each strategy. The costs of false positive biochemical tests were reflected only in the costs of subsequent imaging and not in potential costs of needless surgery or its possible complications.

The diagnostic efficacy of imaging studies was based on respective estimates from the literature: The sensitivity of CT imaging of the abdomen was assumed to be 98% with a specificity of 70%. The sensitivity of MIBG in detecting benign sporadic pheochromocytoma was assumed to be 87.4% with a specificity of 98.9%.

All costs were reported in 2002 US dollars. Costs of imaging investigations were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Rochester Business Office. For the purpose of the decision analysis model, the prevalence of pheochromocytoma in the hypertensive population that would typically be screened was assumed to be 0.5%.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^4903eba4]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID symptom management — commonly used medications are outlined with typical doses, indications, and notable side effects. Propranolol 5–10 mg BID to QID is used for IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia), POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), OH (orthostatic hypotension), NCS (neurocardiogenic syncope), and episodic hypertension, with bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, depression, and asthma exacerbation noted. Midodrine 2.5–10 mg TID to QID targets POTS, OH, NCS, and hypotension and can cause supine hypertension, scalp paresthesias, and piloerection. Fludrocortisone is started at 0.05 mg QD for 1 week then increased by 0.05 mg QD every week to a max dose of 0.2 mg QD for POTS, OH, NCS, or hypotension, with hypokalemia, edema, and headache listed. Pyridostigmine 30–60 mg BID to TID is noted for POTS, OH, AN, and GI dysmotility with constipation, with diarrhea and muscle twitching reported. H1 and H2 antihistamines in combination have a sample regimen of cetirizine 10 mg daily or levocetirizine 5 mg daily plus famotidine 20 mg daily or bid for MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) symptoms, with listed adverse effects for cetirizine and famotidine. Low‑dose naltrexone sample regimen starts 1 mg QD for 4 weeks then increases by 1 mg QD every 4 weeks to a max dose of 4.5 mg QD being studied for fatigue, PEM/PESE (postexertional malaise/postexertional symptom exacerbation), and headache, and often requires compounding with diarrhea and nausea noted. Methylphenidate 5–10 mg BID to TID is listed for POTS, OH, NCS, brain fog, and fatigue with headache, tachycardia, insomnia, and risk of PEM/PESE exacerbation during the drug's duration of action. Amantadine 100 mg QD to BID is described for fatigue and brain fog, is contraindicated for ESRD (end‑stage renal disease) with withdrawal risks if abruptly discontinued, and may cause dry mouth, OH, neuropsychiatric symptoms, livedo reticularis, nausea, and abdominal pain. Gabapentin 100–300 mg QHS to TID, then increased 100–300 mg every week, is described for neuropathic pain and poor sleep quality with need for renal dosing and brain fog, sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea. The table additionally lists COVID‑19 vaccine with an annual booster to lower risk of subsequent COVID infection sequelae and reduce the severity and duration of PASC, while vaccine reaction or worsening of symptoms is noted. A general principle states that medication use in Long COVID generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing with extra attention to starting doses lower and ramping up slowly, prioritizing patient preference, using caution with medications that may worsen some symptoms while improving others, and tapering off if no noticeable benefit.

Diagnosis of PheochromocytomaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this study is to develop better methods of diagnosis, localization, and treatment for pheochromocytomas. These tumors, which usually arise from the adrenal glands, are often difficult to detect with current methods. Pheochromocytomas release chemicals called catecholamines, causing high blood pressure. Undetected, the tumors can lead to severe medical consequences, including stroke, heart attack and sudden death, in situations that would normally pose little or no risk, such as surgery, general anesthesia or childbirth. Patients with pheochromocytoma may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Study participants will undergo blood, urine, and imaging tests, described below, to detect pheochromocytoma. If a tumor is found, the patient will be offered surgery.

If surgery is not feasible, evaluations will continue in follow-up visits. If the tumor cannot be found, the patient will be offered medical treatment and efforts to detect the tumor will continue. Main diagnostic and research tests may include the following:

- Blood tests
- mainly measurements of plasma or urine catecholamines and metanephrines as well as methoxytyramine. If necessary the clonidine suppression test can be carried out.
- Standard imaging tests
- Non-investigational imaging tests include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonography, and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and FDG PET/CT. These scans may be done before and/or after surgical removal of pheochromocytoma.
- Research PET scanning is done using an injection of radioactive compounds. Patients may undergo 18F-FDOPA, 18F-DA, as well as 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. Each scan takes up to about 2 hours.
- Genetic testing
- A small blood sample is collected for DNA analysis and other analyses. Drug: Drug:

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^b57b5d14]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) — DSM-IV-TR disease definition and symptom differentiation state that DSM-IV-TR identifies the essential features of OCD as recurrent obsessions or compulsions (Criterion A) that are severe enough to be time consuming, i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day, or cause marked distress or significant impairment (Criterion C). DSM-IV-TR describes obsessions as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and describes compulsions as physical or mental acts that the patient feels driven to perform in order to magically prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress. Compulsive acts — also known as rituals — are carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner, and the psychiatrist should differentiate between obsessions and mental rituals or compulsions since the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to these symptoms differ. Obsessions occur spontaneously or are evoked by a feared environmental stimulus or event and generate anxiety or distress, whereas mental compulsions such as counting, praying, or reviewing actions, conversations, or lists are initiated by the patient willfully, albeit sometimes reluctantly, with the aim of feeling safer or reducing anxiety or distress.

### Association of generalized anxiety disorder with autonomic hypersensitivity and blunted ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity during peripheral adrenergic stimulation: a randomized clinical trial [^10195409]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Importance

β-Adrenergic stimulation elicits heart palpitations and dyspnea, key features of acute anxiety and sympathetic arousal, yet no neuroimaging studies have examined how the pharmacologic modulation of interoceptive signals is associated with fear-related neurocircuitry in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Objective

To examine the neural circuitry underlying autonomic arousal induced via isoproterenol, a rapidly acting, peripheral β-adrenergic agonist akin to adrenaline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This crossover randomized clinical trial of 58 women with artifact-free data was conducted from January 1, 2017, to November 31, 2019, at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Exposures

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess neural responses during randomized intravenous bolus infusions of isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 μg) and saline, each administered twice in a double-blind fashion.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Blood oxygen level-dependent responses across the whole brain during isoproterenol administration in patients with GAD vs healthy comparators. Cardiac and respiratory responses, as well as interoceptive awareness and anxiety, were also measured during the infusion protocol.

Results

Of the 58 female study participants, 29 had GAD (mean [SD] age, 26.9 [6.8] years) and 29 were matched healthy comparators (mean [SD] age, 24.4 [5.0] years). During the 0.5-μg dose of isoproterenol, the GAD group exhibited higher heart rate responses (b = 5.34; 95% CI, 2.06–8.61; P = 0.002), higher intensity ratings of cardiorespiratory sensations (b = 8.38; 95% CI, 2.05–14.71; P = 0.01), higher levels of self-reported anxiety (b = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.33–1.76; P = 0.005), and significant hypoactivation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that was evident throughout peak response (Cohen d = 1.55; P < .001) and early recovery (Cohen d = 1.52; P < .001) periods. Correlational analysis of physiological and subjective indexes and percentage of signal change extracted during the 0.5-μg dose revealed that vmPFC hypoactivation was inversely correlated with heart rate (r56 = -0.51, adjusted P = 0.001) and retrospective intensity of both heartbeat (r56 = -0.50, adjusted P = 0.002) and breathing (r56 = -0.44, adjusted P = 0.01) sensations. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex hypoactivation correlated inversely with continuous dial ratings at a trend level (r56 = -0.38, adjusted P = 0.051), whereas anxiety (r56 = -0.28, adjusted P = 0.27) and chronotropic dose 25 (r56 = -0.14, adjusted P = 0.72) showed no such association.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this crossover randomized clinical trial, women with GAD exhibited autonomic hypersensitivity during low levels of adrenergic stimulation characterized by elevated heart rate, heightened interoceptive awareness, increased anxiety, and a blunted neural response localized to the vmPFC. These findings support the notion that autonomic hyperarousal may be associated with regulatory dysfunctions in the vmPFC, which could serve as a treatment target to help patients with GAD more appropriately appraise and regulate signals of sympathetic arousal.

### The economic implications of three biochemical screening algorithms for pheochromocytoma [^de1ba00d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Pheochromocytoma is a rare, life-threatening condition. Using a modeling technique, we studied the economic implications of detection strategies for pheochromocytoma (third-party payer perspective). The diagnostic efficacy of biochemical tests was based on Mayo Clinic Rochester data. In all hypothetical algorithms, positive biochemical tests were followed by abdominal computerized tomography and, if negative, metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. In each hypothetical algorithm, imaging would be indicated after positive biochemical testing as follows: algorithm A, fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements above the laboratory reference range; or algorithm B, abnormal measurements of 24-h urinary total metanephrines or catecholamines. In algorithm C, subjects with fractions of plasma metanephrine at or above 0.5 nmol/liter or normetanephrine at or above 1.80 nmol/liter would undergo imaging, whereas those with values between the reference range and these cutoffs would undergo 24-h urinary measurements (total metanephrines and fractionated catecholamines) and be imaged if positive. We determined that, if 100,000 hypertensive patients (including 500 patients with pheochromocytoma) were tested, algorithm A (measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines alone) would detect 489 pheochromocytoma patients at a cost of 56.6 million dollars, whereas B (24-h urinary measurements) would detect 457 pheochromocytoma patients for 39.5 million dollars, and C (combination of measurements of fractionated plasma metanephrines and urines) would detect 478 patients for 28.6 million dollars. None of the screening strategies for pheochromocytoma described are affordable if implemented on a routine basis in extremely low-risk patients. However, algorithm C may be the least costly, and at a reasonable level of sensitivity, for subjects in whom the suspicion of disease is moderate.

### A mechanistic model for individualised treatment of anxiety disorders based on predictive neural biomarkers [^33cbf304]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The 3-biomarker model

Taken together, we suggest that the biological origin of amygdala hyper-responsiveness might be based on imbalances in amygdala-centred regulatory mechanisms, consisting of three core regulatory hubs (biomarkers) that might upregulate amygdala responsiveness. The amygdala-biomarker is defined by disruption of GABA-based inhibitory processes within the amygdala. The PFC-biomarker is characterised by reduced recruitment of inhibitory top-down projections. The LC-biomarker is based on increased noradrenaline release from the LC, which drives up amygdala activation by disrupting GABAergic inhibition and intensifies emotion processing by amplifying attentional processes. Yet, those three biomarkers form an amygdala-centred network and manifestations in one biomarker might affect the other mechanisms driving the network (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1.
(a) Despite high PFC control, increased amygdala (AMG) response occurs due to inherent amygdala hypersensitivity. (b) A lack of emotion regulation is based on low PFC control, which results in increased amygdala responsiveness. (c) Elevated noradrenaline release due to high LC drive leads to increased amygdala responsiveness and distraction in cortical processes involved in emotion processing.

### A mechanistic model for individualised treatment of anxiety disorders based on predictive neural biomarkers [^3396d2d0]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We need models to refine our understanding of the underlying working mechanisms of biomarkers in order to individualise treatment in psychiatry by adapting treatment to individual biological predispositions. Here we propose a neurobiology-based mechanistic model that might help to clarify some of the clinical heterogeneity among patients with anxiety disorders. The model may foster treatment selection tailored to the anxiety evoking neurobiological mechanism of the individual patient.

Research demonstrated that anxiety is characterised by functional and structural alterations in cortical and subcortical areas that have been primarily related to amygdala hyperactivity (Etkin & Wager). We propose three potential mechanisms that all result in increased amygdala responsiveness: (a) inherent amygdala hypersensitivity, (b) low prefrontal control and (c) high locus coeruleus (LC) drive. There is ample evidence that local, for instance GABAergic mechanisms in the amygdala are critical for amygdala responsiveness (Braga, Aroniadou-Anderjaska, Manion, Hough, & Li). However, a considerable body of animal and patient-related research points towards noradrenergic projections that drive amygdala hyper-responsiveness. Located in the brain stem, the LC is the major noradrenaline source of the brain (Szabadi). During acute stress, noradrenaline is released by LC neurons and from there projected to almost the entire brain. Such projections to the amygdala enhance amygdala responsiveness (Hermans et al.), while high noradrenaline release to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) distracts attentional processes and working memory (Arnsten & Li; Sara). In contrast, inhibitory prefrontal regulation reduces amygdala responsiveness (Etkin & Wager; Etkin, Büchel, & Gross; Kohn et al.). Correspondingly, anxiety disorders have been associated with impaired prefrontal control (Etkin & Wager; Sylvester et al.).

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency behavioural and psychiatric manifestations — pharmacologic considerations: A broad spectrum of symptomatic medications, including antidepressants, stimulants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers, may be beneficial and healthcare providers should adhere to age- and dose-specific guidelines. There are no absolute contraindications for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), or stimulants in THD, but caution is recommended due to effects on monoamine neurotransmitter homeostasis and potential for exacerbated adverse effects, and dopamine receptor blocking antipsychotic medications should be avoided due to their antidopaminergic effects.

### Biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma… [^abde78c9]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

tumor. Pheochromocytomas are chromaffin cell tumors typically arising in the adrenal glands and characterized by excessive production of catecholamines, often leading to increased blood pressure and symptoms of catecholamine excess. If not diagnosed or if left untreated, the excessive secretion of catecholamines by these tumors can have devastating consequences. Thus, although pheochromocytomas. are rare tumors, they must be considered in many patients with hypertension, the latter representing up to a quarter of the adult population in Western countries. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma depends crucially on demonstration of excessive production of catecholamines. 1, 2 This step, however, is fraught with difficulties, in particular false-negative. These commonly used tests were compared with measurements of plasma concentrations of free metanephrines, normetanephrine, and metanephrine, which is a promising new test for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

9, 11, 14 The study population was selected from a total of 1003 patients tested. for pheochromocytoma using plasma free metanephrines. Patients were tested between 1994 and 2001 at 4 referral centers. These increases were consistently larger than those of plasma norepinephrine, urinary norepinephrine, urinary fractionated normetanephrine, urinary total metanephrines, and urinary VMA. Increases in all analytes were larger in patients with sporadic. 99% for use of plasma free metanephrines in the detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma. Among all patients with pheochromocytoma, sensitivities were the highest for measurements of plasma free metanephrines at 99%, followed. free metanephrines.

Both hereditary cases were in patients who were normotensive and asymptomatic and had no other biochemical evidence of the tumor. Both were patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and had single adrenal tumors of less than 1 cm in diameter, which were identified and removed coincidentally. during surgery for renal carcinoma. The single false-negative result for plasma free metanephrines in patients with sporadic pheochromocytoma involved a patient tested for possible tumor recurrence 13 years after the removal of a large extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. Computed tomography and all biochemical tests yielded negative results. The. was removed. Thus, despite the considerable time between biochemical testing and final diagnosis, all tests performed were designated as providing false-negative results. Integrated comparison of sensitivity and specificity using ROC curves showed that the diagnostic power of plasma free metanephrines was superior to that of all other tests.

### Symptoms of pheochromocytoma, with particular reference to headache, correlated with catecholamine production… [^6a7eec4d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- In a series of 27 patients with proved pheochromocytoma, differential analysis of catecholamines in blood, urine, and tumor specimens of 19 patients enabled grouping of subjects into those whose tumors produced predominantly norepinephrine, predominantly epinephrine and approximately equal amounts of both. Sustained hypertension was more common in the first group and pallor and tremor in the latter two groups, but no distinctive syndrome could be recognized as signifying the secretion of NE or E. Headache was a symptom in 20 of 27 patients and was related to sudden, transient elevation of the blood pressure, rather than sustained hypertension. The variable duration and intensity of the headache in different patients can be explained by the pressor and cranial vasoconstrictor effects of the secreted amines, which respectively enhance and diminish vascular headache.

### Severe paroxysmal hypertension (pseudopheochromocytoma) [^2253da16]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Severe, symptomatic paroxysmal hypertension always generates suspicion of a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. However, most patients with this disorder do not have this tumor and their condition remains undiagnosed and ineffectively treated. This case series, summarizing the course of 21 such patients, suggests a cause and an effective treatment approach. All 21 patients insisted that the paroxysms were not related to stress or emotional distress, initially discouraging consideration of a link to emotions. Nevertheless, with careful psychosocial interviewing, the disorder could be attributed to emotions patients were not aware of, and, therefore, unable to report. Such emotions were related either to previous severe emotional trauma or to a general tendency to keep distressful emotions out of awareness. Blood pressure elevation during episodes was documented by a physician on at least one occasion. Twenty-one cases met this description.

A pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in none, after appropriate assessment of plasma or urinary catecholamine levels, and, if indicated, radiological studies. In many cases, prior extensive diagnostic investigations had been conducted, including imaging procedures of the adrenal gland in 8 patients and of the brain in 7 and radionuclide or angiographic studies to exclude ischemic coronary disease in 6. Treatment and treatment outcome were also assessed. Treatment was considered successful if hypertensive episodes ceased occurring. The clinical characteristics of the disorder are summarized in Table 1. Hypertensive episodes were accompanied by severe physical symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, flushing, and diaphoresis. All patients described the episodes as abrupt in onset, and insisted they were not provoked by stress, emotional distress, fear, or panic.

The insistence by all the patients that the episodes were not related to emotional distress initially discouraged consideration of a psychosomatic basis. However, details of the psychosocial history, and the subsequent rapid response to psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological intervention, uncovered the disorder's relationship to emotions kept from conscious awareness. The case histories of 5 patients, in whom this disorder was successfully treated, help to demonstrate the origin, clinical severity, and treatment of paroxysmal hypertension. A 33-year-old Hispanic man had been hospitalized many times during 5 years and was medically disabled with severe hypertensive paroxysms, with blood pressure readings reaching 220/140 mm Hg, associated with diaphoresis, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, palpitations, headache, and back and neck pain.

Repeated urine catecholamine assays, renal and abdominal computed tomographic scans, meta-iodobenzylguanidine scans, and renal angiography were unrevealing. Antihypertensive regimens had been ineffective or poorly tolerated. The patient reported no stressors other than his illness. However, as a child, he had been physically abused by his father, frequently and without provocation. Yet, he reported feeling strong love and no anger toward his father. A psychiatric consultant diagnosed the patient as having an "anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified. " Treated with alprazolam and amitriptyline, the patient's hypertensive episodes ceased completely, with no recurrence during 3 years of follow-up. A 66-year-old man with a 5-year history of mild hypertension began to experience hour-long episodes of sweats and facial redness, with blood pressure elevation to 190/110 mm Hg or higher, followed by exhaustion. Between episodes, his blood pressure was normal.
