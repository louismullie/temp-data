## Question

Hospital acquired pneumonia duration after discharge?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long antibiotic therapy should continue after discharge for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and what evidence and guidelines support that duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition and time window that constitutes HAP. Then, I should verify the authoritative guideline-recommended total duration of therapy. Next, I will consider whether this duration applies uniformly to all patients or whether special circumstances warrant longer or shorter courses. After that, I should translate this into a practical post-discharge plan based on how much inpatient therapy has already been given. Finally, I will double-check real-world practice patterns and the risks of overtreatment to ensure the recommendation is safe and actionable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity so I don't conflate HAP with CAP or HCAP. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is defined as pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after admission and not incubating at the time of admission, with VAP as a related but distinct category linked to mechanical ventilation, and importantly some definitions extend HAP to include pneumonia within 14 days after discharge, which is precisely the scenario for post-discharge continuation of therapy here [^113Cm8E2].

> I need to verify the core recommendation on duration. The IDSA/ATS 2016 HAP guideline makes a strong recommendation for a 7-day total course of antimicrobial therapy for HAP, with the same 7-day target applied to VAP, and European guidance converges on a 7–8 day total duration for nonventilated HAP when patients respond clinically, so the evidence-based default is 7 days total, not longer [^114WeUDG] [^111zk2cM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that 7 days fits every scenario. I should confirm modifiers: for slow clinical response, severe immunocompromise, complications like empyema or lung abscess, or specific pathogens such as MRSA or nonfermenting gram-negatives including Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter, a longer course may be warranted, whereas a shorter 3-day course has been studied when the probability of HAP is low and CPIS remains low without deterioration, but that latter strategy is selective and not the routine recommendation for confirmed HAP [^116BnpwW] [^111iDKBz] [^111zk2cM].

> Next, I should review the translation into post-discharge dosing so it's practical. If the patient has already received 3 inpatient days and is clinically improving, the remaining duration is 4 additional days. If 5 inpatient days were given, then 2 more days suffice. If 7 days have already been completed inpatient, then no post-discharge antibiotics are needed, and this math assumes a standard total of 7 days unless the clinical scenario warrants the extended durations I just mentioned.

> Wait, let me verify how this aligns with VAP data, since HAP guidance often extrapolates from VAP trials. High-quality evidence and meta-analyses show that 7–8 days of therapy for VAP yields comparable mortality and recurrence outcomes to 10–15 days while increasing antibiotic-free days, with the notable exception that VAP due to nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli may have higher recurrence with short courses, reinforcing the caution to extend in those specific pathogen contexts and by analogy in HAP with similar organisms [^1138cYdS] [^113JpqFi] [^1116n6vn].

> I should double-check real-world practice to ensure the recommendation isn't at odds with what actually happens. Multiple cohorts show substantial overtreatment at discharge, with over 70% of pneumonia patients receiving excess duration and the vast majority of excess days generated post-discharge. Each extra day correlates with more antibiotic-associated adverse events, underscoring that adhering to a 7-day total for HAP and minimizing post-discharge days is both evidence-based and safety-conscious [^1131eoXS] [^1142uEa4] [^1169h2wM].

> Let me reconsider any edge cases that could confuse the total duration calculation. If the diagnosis is uncertain, cultures are negative, and the patient is improving on a 7-day total, stopping is still reasonable; conversely, if cultures grow MRSA or a nonfermenter and the patient remains slow to respond, extending toward 10–14 days may be justified, but this should be an intentional exception rather than routine, and documentation should justify the extension beyond 7 days [^116jHgUu] [^113JpqFi] [^116BnpwW].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. For adults with confirmed HAP, complete a total of 7 days of antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the post-discharge duration equals 7 days minus whatever inpatient therapy has already been administered, with longer total courses reserved for specific host, pathogen, or response factors, and with a plan to reassess at 48–72 hours after discharge to ensure continued clinical stability and adherence [^116jHgUu] [^113EwshH] [^114WeUDG].

---

The recommended total duration of antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is **7 days** [^116jHgUu], regardless of whether the patient is discharged before completing the course. If the patient is discharged before 7 days, **continue antibiotics at home to complete the 7-day total**. Prolonged therapy beyond 7 days is not recommended unless there is **slow clinical response, immunosuppression, or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms** [^114WeUDG] [^116BnpwW]. Shorter courses (5–6 days) may be considered only in select cases with rapid clinical improvement and no risk factors for recurrence, but this is not standard practice [^notfound].

---

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, the **recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP is 7 days** [^114WeUDG]. This recommendation is based on evidence that 7 days of therapy provides outcomes comparable to longer courses, with fewer antibiotic-related adverse events and reduced risk of resistance [^1138cYdS] [^1116n6vn]. The **total duration** should be 7 days, regardless of whether the patient remains hospitalized or is discharged before completing the course.

---

## Management of antibiotic therapy after discharge

When a patient with HAP is discharged before completing the recommended 7-day antibiotic course, **clinicians should**:

- **Continue antibiotics at home**: Prescribe oral antibiotics to complete the remaining days of the 7-day course [^116jHgUu].

- **Document the rationale**: Clearly document the reason for continued therapy and the planned duration in the discharge summary.

- **Ensure adherence**: Provide patient education and arrange follow-up to monitor adherence and clinical response [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy after discharge

Several factors may influence the **duration of antibiotic therapy after discharge**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical response | Rapid improvement may allow shorter courses (5–6 days) in select cases [^112RuRoF] [^115ZMh8f] |
| Immunosuppression | May require longer courses (10–14 days) [^notfound] |
| Multidrug-resistant organisms | May require longer courses (10–14 days) [^116BnpwW] |
| Complications (e.g. abscess, empyema) | May require longer courses (10–14 days) [^111zk2cM] |
| Patient adherence | Poor adherence may necessitate closer follow-up or alternative regimens [^112Dckyy] |

---

## Risks associated with prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged antibiotic therapy beyond the recommended 7 days is associated with several risks, including:

- **Increased risk of antibiotic-related adverse events**: Such as Clostridioides difficile infection, renal impairment, and hematologic abnormalities [^1131eoXS].

- **Development of antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged therapy increases the risk of resistance, particularly in multidrug-resistant organisms [^113JpqFi].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Longer therapy increases healthcare expenditures without additional clinical benefit [^1138cYdS].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended duration

The IDSA/ATS recommendation of a 7-day course for HAP is supported by multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews demonstrating that **shorter courses (7–8 days) are as effective as longer courses (10–15 days)** regarding clinical cure, recurrence, and mortality, while reducing antibiotic-related adverse events and resistance [^1138cYdS] [^1116n6vn] [^113JpqFi].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up after discharge

Patients discharged with ongoing antibiotic therapy for HAP should have **close follow-up** to monitor adherence, clinical response, and detect complications early [^notfound]. Follow-up may include:

- **Telephone follow-up**: Within 48–72 hours after discharge to assess adherence and clinical status [^notfound].

- **Clinical review**: Within 7 days after discharge to evaluate response and manage any complications [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Reinforce adherence, symptom monitoring, and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 7 days of antibiotic therapy for HAP, regardless of discharge status [^116jHgUu].

- **Post-discharge management**: Continue antibiotics at home to complete the 7-day course if discharged earlier [^notfound].

- **Prolonged therapy**: Only consider longer courses (10–14 days) in cases of slow clinical response, immunosuppression, or multidrug-resistant organisms [^116BnpwW].

- **Monitoring**: Ensure close follow-up after discharge to monitor adherence and clinical response [^112GoCP1].

---

The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP is **7 days**, regardless of discharge status. If discharged earlier, antibiotics should be continued at home to complete the 7-day course, with longer courses reserved for specific clinical scenarios.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^115jmLSg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAE), and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) are detrimental to patients and increase costs. The attributable mortality of VAP is estimated to be ~10% but varies considerably by type and severity of underlying illness. VAP and VAE extend duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, prolong intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and increase mortality risk, and they are also associated with greater use of antimicrobials and higher costs. Patients with VAEs are ~50% more likely to die compared to similar patients with VAP, and NV-HAP is associated with a doubling of the length of time until discharge and substantially higher mortality rates compared to similar patients without NV-HAP.

### Antibiotic overuse after hospital discharge: a multi-hospital cohort study [^111ir1kW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients treated for pneumonia were identified by discharge diagnostic codes and receipt of antibiotic treatment by hospital Day 2. We included all patients treated for CAP, including those who (during the time frame of this study) would have been classified as having healthcare–associated pneumonia (HCAP) and those who were treated for pneumonia but did not meet guideline-based diagnostic criteria for pneumonia. Patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia were excluded. Patients treated for a UTI (including both patients meeting the criteria for a UTI and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) were identified based on any urine culture during the hospitalization that was flagged as positive (the criteria for "positive" varied across hospitals but was typically based on a colony-forming unit cutoff). Patients were also excluded if they had urological procedures during the hospitalization.

Data Collection

Detailed patient data — including diagnostic criteria (eg, symptoms, imaging, vital signs, and laboratory and culture results), comorbidities, and discharge antibiotic prescriptions — were collected from the medical record by abstractors for 30 days after discharge. Additional outcome data were obtained via a telephone follow-up 30 days after discharge using a standardized script; patients discharged on antibiotics were asked, "have you had any side effects from your prescribed antibiotic?"

Study endpoints and selection of covariates

The primary endpoint of this analysis is LOS defined as the time from hospital admission to hospital discharge. We recorded baseline data including demographic characteristics (age, gender), comorbid diseases, and living situation (at home, nursing home residents or living with continuous nursing support at home), insurance status, clinical presentation on admission and initial results from blood analysis. All patients were followed until hospital discharge and we further assessed adverse events during the hospital stay including need for ICU admission and development of CAP specific complications (empyema).

Discussion

The main value of the current study is that it shows the medium and long-term safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients admitted for a case of CAP, based on clinical stability criteria, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications; nor did it lead to higher mortality or readmission rates, nor differences in the systemic inflammation presented by these patients. That is, the fact that there are no significant long-term differences in the main results under study between the control and intervention groups, validates our proposal to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with clinically stable CAP from the point of view of the long-term safety of the patient.

The beneficial effects of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment have been studied widely. On the one hand, it reduces antimicrobial resistance, possible adverse effects and costs, while, on the other hand, it improves adherence to treatment. However, despite current evidence avoiding unnecessarily prolonged treatments remains an arduous task, likely due to a false sense of security provided by longer-term treatments. In fact, a retrospective study carried out in the United States in patients admitted for CAP, observed that the average duration of antibiotic treatment exceeded the recommended time by 74 and 71% for patients aged 18–64 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively.

A remarkable strength of this study is that it is based on a clinical trial with a unique design where the doctor him or herself decided on the type of antibiotic and in which similar cure rates were obtained for both groups. Likewise, unlike most of the studies published so far and despite the exclusion of patients requiring admission to Intensive Care, up to 40% of patients with IV and V PSI were included. However, the evidence for critically ill patients is limited. Chastre et al. carried out a double-blind clinical trial in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia in which they compared 8-day versus 15 day antibiotic regimens. The authors observed no differences between the two groups except in the case of non-fermenting gram-negative germs. Recently, in a meta-analysis in which they compared regimens of ≤ 6 days versus ≥ 7 days with similar results, they carried out a sub-analysis in patients with severe pneumonia, observing lower mortality in the group with the shorter regimen (2.2% vs. 4.7%).

Regarding inpatient care for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to laboratory monitoring, ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2017 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine serial measurements of procalcitonin to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with hospital-acquired when the anticipated duration is 7–8 days.

### Guidelines and critical pathways for severe hospital-acquired pneumonia [^114Y4fE1]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early, appropriate, and adequate empiric therapy can increase the chance of survival. In 1995, the American Thoracic Society provided guidelines for the initial treatment of immunocompetent HAP patients, which is one of the principal HAP management approaches available to physicians today. However, these guidelines have several important limitations, including a lack of recommendations for duration of therapy and no recognition of newer drugs such as cefepime, trovafloxacin, and meropenem. Furthermore, they fail to distinguish among similar compounds (ie, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) or to recommend specific antibiotics. The clinician using these guidelines needs to address local patterns of antimicrobial resistance, especially in ICUs. Effective computerized antibiotic management programs that incorporate information on local patterns of antimicrobial resistance can assist physicians in empiric therapy decision making, improve patient quality of care, and reduce medical costs.

Overall, the median duration of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR: 5–10; minimum 2; maximum 31), and the median duration of aqueous penicillin G use was 4 days (IQR: 3–6; minimum 2; maximum 17). Children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia stayed in hospital for as long as children without radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (median 7 days [IQR: 4–10] versus median 7 days [IQR: 5–9]; P = 0.903). No difference was found between the two subgroups regarding duration of penicillin use (radiologically-confirmed pneumonia: median 4 days [IQR: 3–6] versus no radiologically-confirmed pneumonia: median 4 days [IQR: 3–6]; P = 0.402). Overall, aqueous penicillin G was substituted by other antibiotics in 29 (10.2%) cases. Children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia had aqueous penicillin G substituted more frequently than those without radiologically-confirmed pneumonia (15.6% versus 6.9%; P = 0.019).

No patient died and everyone was discharged after improvement. Table 2 presents the significant differences found during progression of disease between children with or without radiologically-confirmed pneumonia or normal CXR during aqueous penicillin G treatment. Those with substitution of aqueous penicillin G were excluded. The comparison of the symptoms and signs during hospital course which did not demonstrate significant difference is shown in Table 3.

### Implementation of French recommendations for the prevention and the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia: a cluster-randomized trial [^116YeDHJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We determined whether an audit on the adherence to guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) can improve the outcomes of patients in intensive care units (ICUs).

Methods

This study was conducted at 35 ICUs in 30 hospitals. We included consecutive, adult patients hospitalized in ICUs for 3 days or more. After a 3-month baseline period followed by the dissemination of recommendations, an audit on the compliance to recommendations (audit period) was followed by a 3-month cluster-randomized trial. We randomly assigned ICUs to either receive audit and feedback (intervention group) or participate in a national registry (control group). The primary outcome was the duration of ICU stay.

Results

Among 1856 patients enrolled, 602, 669, and 585 were recruited in the baseline, audit, and intervention periods, respectively. The composite measures of compliance were 47% (interquartile range [IQR], 38–56%) in the intervention group and 42% (IQR, 25–53%) in the control group (P = 0.001). As compared to the baseline period, the ICU lengths of stay were reduced by 3.2 days in the intervention period (P = 0.07) and by 2.8 days in the control period (P = 0.02). The durations of ICU stay were 7 days (IQR, 5–14 days) in the control group and 9 days (IQR, 5–20 days) in the intervention group (P = 0.10). After adjustment for unbalanced baseline characteristics, the hazard ratio for being discharged alive from the ICU in the control group was 1.17 (95% confidence interval, .69–2.01; p = 0.10).

Conclusions

The publication of French guidelines for HAP was associated with a reduction of the ICU length of stay. However, the realization of an audit to improve their application did not further improve outcomes.

### Antibiotic overuse and stewardship at hospital discharge: the reducing overuse of antibiotics at discharge home framework [^114d2LJj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY STEWARDSHIP TARGETS FOR DISCHARGE ANTIBIOTICS

Based on what is known, there are at least 4 main targets to improving antibiotic prescribing at discharge (Table 1). First, and perhaps most critical, is stopping unnecessary antibiotics in patients who initially were considered to have a possible infection (eg, pulmonary infiltrates, tachycardia) but were later determined to have a nonbacterial etiology (eg, heart failure, viral pneumonia). If not done at 48–72 hours during a "time-out", discharge is an ideal time to consolidate the medication list and finalize discharge diagnoses, including removing infectious diagnoses that have been ruled out. Second, for patients who have a confirmed or likely infection, the most common type of antibiotic overuse at discharge is excess duration. As noted by the CDC's Core Elements for ASPs, discharge is a critical time for improving total duration of therapy given that the vast majority of excess duration occurs after hospitalization. For stewardship programs seeking "low hanging fruit" to begin their discharge assessment, community-acquired pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections are prime targets. Third, reducing fluoroquinolone use at discharge remains a critical target. Despite reductions in fluoroquinolone prescribing during hospitalization, fluoroquinolone use at discharge has only minimally decreased. Primary avoidable causes of fluoroquinolone use at discharge include pneumonia, intraabdominal infections, and perioperative therapy. Finally, patients discharged on OPAT can often be optimized by switching to oral therapy, reducing duration, optimizing dose and agent, or stopping antibiotics altogether. Additional opportunities exist for special populations, most critically improving communication, monitoring, and antibiotic use at discharge to SNFs.

### Inappropriate diagnosis of pneumonia among hospitalized adults [^117ScYBQ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Data Collection

HMS's data collection and quality assurance procedures have been previously described. Briefly, trained abstractors entered data from the medical record into a central deidentified repository. Patient data, including demographics, comorbid and concurrent conditions, laboratory studies, vital signs, antibiotic type and duration, and outcomes, were collected from 90 days preceding hospitalization through 30 days following hospitalization. To enable assessment of inappropriate diagnosis, abstractors abstracted (1) any signs (eg, leukocytosis) or symptoms (eg, new/increased cough, sputum production, dyspnea) potentially associated with pneumonia documented in clinician and nursing notes through hospital day 3, including documentation associated with the symptom (eg, "patient coughing", "family-reported increased cough") (Table 1 and eAppendix in Supplement 1); (2) radiographic findings (eg, pulmonary consolidation) from chest imaging reports through day 4 of the hospitalization, including details (eg, single lobe, multifocal), and markers of uncertainty (eg, abstraction tool in the eAppendix in Supplement 1); and (3) antibiotic administration, including in the emergency department or prescribed at hospital discharge.

SI conversion factors: To convert Pa 2 to kilopascals, multiply by 0.133; leukocytes to ×10⁹/L, multiply by 0.001.

To assess associations between antibiotic use and patient outcomes, abstractors collected data from the medical record through 30 days postdischarge. Outcomes included 30-day mortality, readmission, emergency department visit, Clostridioides difficile infection, and/or in-hospital antibiotic-associated adverse events documented by a physician. To reduce risk of missing important outcomes, patients were also called 30 days postdischarge to obtain additional outcome data. Patients discharged to inpatient hospice, an extended care facility, or prison were ineligible for follow-up telephone calls.

### Landmark survival as an end-point for trials in critically ill patients – comparison of alternative durations of follow-up: an exploratory analysis [^117XB88e]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Many interventional ICU trials have used different durations of follow up with which to assess mortality but the most appropriate duration of follow up is uncertain. Our results show that the mortality of sepsis and community acquired pneumonia does not reach a plateau until 90 days after ICU admission and that a substantial proportion of late deaths occur after hospital discharge. Accordingly, assessment of mortality at day 90 and without censoring at hospital discharge is the strategy that is most strongly supported by this analysis. Prolongation of follow up, to 180 days, adds little value. In contrast, duration of follow up to 28 days may well be adequate for patients with ICU admissions due to non-operative trauma.

Epidemiological data shows that severity of illness and organ failure that requires intervention can have a mortality effect long after hospital discharge It is thus possible that characteristics of the disease, patient, and interventions in ICU may have a long-term effect on outcomes of ICU patients. In our study multivariable analysis showed that markers of acute illness, such as the number of organ failure and APACHE score, were the strongest predictors of mortality for sepsis, community acquired pneumonia, and non-operative trauma. On the other hand among non-modifiable characteristics only age was important in patients with community acquired pneumonia and sepsis, while co-morbidities did not appear to have an independent predictive value across the three diagnostic subgroups. Although it may be argued that death is not the only patient-centred outcome, it is however one of the most important outcomes studied in many clinical trials. Death, especially long-term survival rate, is often used in many clinical trials as the primary end-point, not only in ICU medicine but also in cardiology and oncology.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (discharge from hospital), IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to document the patient's ability to tolerate the home anti-infective regimen, whether oral or IV, and the home oxygen regimen, if applicable, before hospital discharge.

### Predictors for length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: results from a Swiss multicenter study [^1114wM7K]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause for hospitalization and has a substantial impact on health care costs. Therefore, economic and rational management of CAP should include discharge of patients as early as possible without exposing them to the risk for worsening or recurrent infection. Current guidelines recommend discharging patients as soon as they are clinically stable, have no other active medical problems, and have a safe environment for continued care. Still, length of hospital stay (LOS) is variable and arbitrary in different settings. For example, in Switzerland LOS in patients with CAP was only reduced by 1.2 days over the last 10 years. In an ageing patient population, social, functional and nursing-related factors may become increasingly important and early discharge planning including organization of help and/or nursing assistance at home becomes more important for shortening LOS. In this context, early information of patients and their families about time management and expected duration of LOS is of particular importance and may help to optimize early discharge strategies.

There are a number of well validated clinical scores which predict 30-day mortality and have shown to improve initial-site-of-care decisions. However, there is no similar instrument for prediction of LOS. Previously, different parameters which are associated with LOS have been reported. Some predictors directly relate to the acute disease or underlying comorbidities, while other factors include the social situation of the patient. Yet, a reliable clinical prediction rule which helps physicians estimating LOS based on these and other factors is missing.

The aim of the present study was to propose a LOS prediction rule in a well characterized cohort of CAP patients from six different Swiss hospitals, one only focusing on admission parameters and one also considering follow up information. Furthermore, we investigated whether type of medical insurance was associated with LOS. One could assume that privately insured patients have shorter LOS because they may have priority for diagnostic studies, are more easily being transferred to post acute care centers and are treated by more experienced physicians. On the other hand, financial incentives could lead to higher LOS in patients, particularly in a pay-for-service health care system such as in Switzerland.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to complete a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy in patients with HAP.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^112ixW7N]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Over the study period, appropriate antibiotic use for hospitalized patients with uncomplicated CAP increased substantially, and adverse events decreased. The HMS CQI model of a multipronged intervention including (1) data collection and benchmarking, (2) sharing of best practices, and (3) pay-for-performance incentives may be a successful model for improving antibiotic use across diverse hospitals.

Consistent with findings of previous studies, we found that the majority of patients with CAP received an excessive duration of antibiotics despite randomized trials, systematic reviews, and guidelines supporting the safety and efficacy of 5-day (or even 3-day) treatment courses. Prior single-center studies have demonstrated that stewardship programs can reduce excessive-duration antibiotic treatment (though not adverse events) for CAP. Our study builds on previous studies by demonstrating that a CQI model is associated with higher rates of appropriate antibiotic use and fewer adverse events across a diverse set of hospitals. Notably, appropriate antibiotic use increased over time even in small (< 200-bed) hospitals, which historically have a harder time implementing stewardship. One reason may be that the data infrastructure provided by HMS directly addresses the common barrier for small hospitals of obtaining metrics on antibiotic prescribing to inform improvement. This strategy could also be helpful for other infectious disease states. HMS has already been targeting antibiotic stewardship in urinary tract infection and has reduced inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria over time through similar mechanisms.

Despite improved duration of therapy, we note that more than half of patients received antibiotics for an excessive duration even during the later quarters of CQI participation. Those numbers may be higher in the future as cases formerly categorized as HCAP become eligible for 5-day therapy under the new CAP guidelines. Potential continued barriers to improvement are myriad. One is that > 95% of excessive-duration antibiotic treatment occurs after hospital discharge. Because discharge antibiotics are not part of national antibiotic use measures, they are often not a focus of hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs. Hospitals doing well on inpatient prescribing may miss opportunities for discharge stewardship. In HMS, though we provided education and resources related to discharge prescribing (see Supplementary Material), we did not standardize an approach to discharge stewardship across hospitals. Antibiotic stewardship interventions at discharge, including pharmacist audit and feedback or order sets with 5-day stop dates, may be a way to speed improvement at the local hospital level.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = 0.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Implementation of an evidence-based guideline to reduce duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^115EUYz3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with pneumonia often remain hospitalized after they are stable clinically, and the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is a rate-limiting step for discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether implementation of an evidence-based guideline would reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with pneumonia.

Methods

In a seven-site, cluster randomized clinical trial, we enrolled 325 control and 283 intervention patients who were admitted by one of 116 physician groups. Within site, physician groups were assigned randomly to receive a practice guideline alone (control arm) or a practice guideline that was implemented using a multifaceted strategy (intervention arm). The effectiveness of guideline implementation was measured by the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay; differences in the rates of discontinuation and hospital discharge were assessed with proportional hazards models. Medical outcomes were assessed at 30 days.

Results

Intravenous antibiotic therapy was discontinued somewhat more quickly in the intervention group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.52; P = 0.06) than in the control group. Intervention patients were discharged more quickly, but the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.38; P = 0.11). Fewer intervention (55% [157/283]) than control (63% [206/325]) patients had medical complications during the index hospitalization (P = 0.04), with no differences in other medical outcomes, including mortality, rehospitalization, and return to usual activities, between treatment arms.

Conclusions

The multifaceted guideline implementation strategy resulted in a slight reduction in the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and a nonsignificant reduction in length of stay, without affecting patient outcomes.

### Association between time to clinical stability and outcomes after discharge in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^112GoCP1]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse outcomes after discharge in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) might be associated with the inflammatory response during hospitalization, recognized by the length of time needed for the patient to reach clinical stability (time to clinical stability [TCS]). The objective of this study was to assess the association between TCS and outcomes after discharge in hospitalized patients with CAP.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients discharged alive after an episode of CAP was conducted at the Veterans Hospital of Louisville, Kentucky, between 2001 and 2006.

Results

Among the 464 patients enrolled in the study, 82 (18%) experienced an adverse outcome within 30 days after discharge, leading to either readmission or death. Patients with a TCS > 3 days showed a significantly higher rate of adverse outcomes after discharge compared with those with a TCS ≤ 3 days (26% vs 15%, respectively; OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.19–3.3; p = 0.008) as well as adverse outcomes after discharge related to pneumonia (16% vs 4.6%, respectively; OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 2–8.2; P < .001). The propensity-adjusted analysis showed that delay in reaching TCS during hospitalization was associated with a significant increased risk of adverse outcomes. Adjusted ORs comparing patients who reached TCS at days 2, 3, 4, and 5 to those who reached TCS at day 1 were 1.06, 1.54, 2.40, and 10.53, respectively.

Conclusions

Patients with CAP who experienced a delay in reaching clinical stability during hospitalization are at high risk of adverse outcomes after discharge and should receive close observation and an early follow-up.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^112L5r7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Second, during triannual meetings, HMS disseminates national guidelines, key literature, and best practices related to pneumonia care and antibiotic stewardship. These meetings include presentations on successful strategies and brainstorming sessions to engage lower-performing hospitals. In March 2018, an antibiotic toolkit was disseminated via webinar and included curated literature, customizable guidelines/pocket cards, sample communications to clinicians, and examples of successful interventions (details in Supplementary Material). How hospitals use HMS resources is left to hospital discretion.

Third, HMS selects certain quality metrics to become pay-for-performance metrics that, if met, provide additional funding for hospitals from BCBSM. The amount of funding varies depending on hospital size (number of beds) and the number of CQIs in which the hospitals participate. Each year HMS has up to 3 pay-for-performance metrics for the antimicrobial use initiative determined by representatives from across the collaborative. BCBSM generally agrees to suggested metric targets suggested by HMS provided that they represent "reach targets" for the collaborative; each year, the target that must be reached for full funding increases to help raise the bar (eg, in 2018, > 20% of those eligible for 5-day therapy must receive 5 ± 1 days of therapy; in 2019, > 45%; and in 2020, > 50%) (see Supplementary Material for target details).

Outcomes and Data Collection

The primary study outcome was a dichotomous variable representing whether a patient hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP who was eligible for a short, 5-day antibiotic course, appropriately received 5 (± 1) days of effective antibiotic therapy (inpatient plus discharge duration). Patients potentially eligible for inclusion were identified based on presence of a discharge diagnostic code of pneumonia and receipt of antibiotics on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization. Patients not eligible for inclusion were those with any of the following: concomitant infection (eg, cellulitis), initial admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), pregnancy, severe immune compromise (eg, any transplant, neutropenia, human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 cell count < 200/µL), or fungal infection. Patients were included only if they received ≥ 3 days of antibiotic therapy and met diagnostic criteria for CAP, including chest imaging findings and ≥ 2 signs or symptoms consistent with pneumonia (Supplementary Material).

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) definitions — diagnostic scope and time thresholds: The panel states the existing definitions are clinically useful and generally accepted and did not consider amending them, and defines pneumonia as the presence of a new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence of infection including new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation, while recognizing there is no gold standard for diagnosing HAP or VAP. HAP is defined as a pneumonia not incubating at hospital admission and occurring 48 hours or more after admission, and VAP is defined as a pneumonia occurring > 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. In this document, HAP denotes pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation; thus, HAP and VAP are mutually exclusive events.

### Initial risk class and length of hospital stay in community-acquired pneumonia [^1147njJR]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The total medical costs of community-acquired pneumonia are directly related to the costs of hospital admission and length of stay. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reasons for prolonged duration of stay in patients stratified in five risk classes for death, and to identify factors associated with prolonged stay. The study population consisted of 295 patients. According to lower (classes I, II, III) or to higher (classes IV, V) risk, the target duration of hospitalization was set at 5 and 7 days, respectively. The causes of prolonged hospitalization were classified as pneumonia-related, complications, unstable comorbid diseases and nonclinical factors. The overall percentage of patients with appropriate duration of hospitalization was 32%. Causes of prolonged hospitalization were related mainly to pneumonia (32%) from all risk classes. Morbid complications and instability of the underlying illness were greater in class V patients. Nonclinical factors were present in 29.5% of cases. Hypoxaemia, anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and complications appearing before 72 h were associated with prolonged hospitalization. The cause of prolonged hospitalization of patients with community-acquired pneumonia is multifactorial, depending mainly on pneumonia and comorbid conditions but there is a large number of unnecessary hospitalization days that could be reduced by improving the efficiency of hospital care.

### Evaluation of antiviral therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in shanghai, China [^116segtw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and divided into seven groups according to the treatment option. Information including age, sex, and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained at admission and after a 5-day treatment cycle were assessed. The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed. At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including the duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms, and main laboratory results. No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P = 0.151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P = 0.116). At discharge, 7 of 184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leukocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission. According to the results, the inclusion of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regimens based on symptomatic treatment had no significant additional impact on the improvement in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the results of chest CT imaging, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests at discharge were not completely consistent.

### Early versus later response to treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: analysis of the REACH study [^1175xnAX]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

A comparison of patient characteristics for those patients who did not have TCS assessed by Halm's criteria revealed no relevant differences in the baseline data, apart from a small difference in the proportion of patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) (13.8% vs. 7.2% of early responders and 7.9% of later responders). In addition, a smaller proportion of patients had PORT/PSI or CURB-65 assessment of disease severity (Table 3). Clinical outcomes and resource use were also similar, except for a higher mortality rate observed in patients not assessed by Halm's criteria (9.7% vs. 0.6% for early responders and 1.6% for later responders) (Table 6).

An analysis of those patients who had received antibiotic pre-treatment, compared with those who had not, showed that pre-treatment with antibiotics was associated with a shorter hospital length of stay for both early and later responders (mean 8.6 vs. 10.1 days for early responders and 15.3 vs. 17.0 days for later responders) (Table 7). Fewer later responders with antibiotic pre-treatment were admitted to ICU, and those that were, remained there for a shorter duration than patients without antibiotic pre-treatment. A higher mortality rate was observed in late responders with antibiotic pre-treatment compared with those without pre-treatment (5.2% vs. 0.5%) (Table 7).

### Atypical coverage in community-acquired pneumonia after outpatient β-lactam monotherapy [^116bSKCv]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after > 48 h of outpatient beta-lactam monotherapy, coverage of atypical pathogens is recommended based on expert opinion.

Methods

In a post-hoc analysis of a large study of CAP treatment we included patients who received beta-lactam monotherapy for > 48 h before hospitalization. Length of hospital stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, and number of treatment escalations were compared for those that continued beta-lactam monotherapy and those that received atypical coverage at admission.

Results

Of 179 patients (median age 66 years (IQR 50–78), 100 (56%) male), 131 (73%) received additional atypical coverage at admission. These patients were younger, had less comorbidities, and longer symptom duration, compared to those that continued beta-lactam monotherapy. In crude analysis, median (IQR) LOS was 6 (4–8) and 6 (4–9) days, mortality was 2% and 4%, and treatment escalations occurred in 8 (17%) and 11 (8%) patients without and with atypical coverage, respectively. Adjusted effect ratios for absence of atypical coverage on LOS, mortality, and treatment escalation were 0.77 (95% CI 0.61–0.97), 0.37 (0.04–3.67), and 2.75 (0.94–8.09), respectively.

Conclusion

In adults hospitalized with CAP after > 48 h of outpatient beta-lactam monotherapy, not starting antibiotics with atypical coverage was associated with a trend towards more treatment escalations, without evidence of increased LOS or mortality.

§ Refers to patients hospitalized again (due to CAP) after initial discharge.

ICU = intensive care unit; N/A = not applicable; SD = standard deviation.

An association between early response and shorter duration of hospitalization (mean 9.4; standard deviation [SD]: 7.0; median 8.0 days), lower rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU; 3.3%) and shorter duration of ICU stay (mean 6.2; SD: 5.7; median 4.0 days) was observed compared with later responders (mean 15.6; SD: 10.5; median 12.0 days; 21.3%; mean 10.4; SD: 10.1; median 8.0 days, respectively).

Hospital resource use, such as blood pressure support, mechanical ventilation and parenteral nutrition, was higher in patients who had a later response, and there were more cases of septic shock compared with patients with an early response (7.9% vs. 0.3%) (Table 6). There were few deaths reported (n = 6). Reasons for death in early responders (n = 2) were CAP-related in one case, and non-CAP-related in the other, based on investigator assessment. Death in later responders (n = 4) was related to CAP in two cases, unrelated in one and unknown in the fourth. "Post-clinical stability", differences between early and later responders in terms of length of stay and ICU admissions were minimal (mean length of hospital stay 5.9 days, both early and later responders (Table 6).

### Early-stage predictors of the acute phase duration in uncomplicated COVID-19 pneumonia [^113KPcEL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Since its first appearance in China, COVID‐19 has rapidly spread worldwide, straining the national health systems of several countries. Hence, it is crucial to identify simple clinical or laboratory predictors of hospitalization duration at the first contact of patients with hospital facilities, to appropriately allocate medical resources. Our investigation demonstrated that patient age, P/F ratio at admission, and platelet count predicted the acute phase duration of noncomplicated SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia.

The mean disease duration was approximately 1 week. Other studies have utilized different admission and discharge protocols. However, data from a large cohort of 1420 patients from 18 European hospitals are available; however, this data pertains to the duration of symptoms of mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 (962 females, mean age 39.17 ± 12.0 years, 30.7% of health care workers), with symptoms disappearing after 11.5 ± 5.7 days. This difference is attributed to patient being discharged after the acute phase of pneumonia, only when alarm symptoms and signs such as dyspnea and oxygen desaturation disappeared, while still presenting symptoms such as cough or asthenia.

Clinical outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was the length of hospitalization duration due to COVID-19 pneumonia; the monotherapy and combination therapy groups were compared.

The hospitalization period was calculated from admission to patient discharge based on the clinical management guide of COVID-19 for front-line healthcare worker by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan (MHLW) (used version at the time, version 3.0; current latest version, version 6.0) including "Criteria for release from accommodation facility care" for patient with symptoms discharge is possible: 1) 10 days after the date of onset and 72 hours after the resolution of symptoms (he definition of "the resolution of symptoms": when fever subsides without any antipyretics and respiratory symptoms such as cough, difficulty in breathing, improve); 2) 24 hours after the resolution of symptoms if the patient has tested negative with the PCR test twice within at least 24 hours between tests; 3) if the patient could not be discharged due to social reasons, the number of days until the discharge criteria were met were used for evaluation. At the time this study was conducted in Japan, the MHLW required that patients be discharged from hospital in accordance with the above discharge criteria, and these criteria was strictly followed in our medical institutions as well as most of hospitals in Japan. As a result, we designed the study with these discharge criteria in mind, as well as length of hospitalization as an objective endpoint consistent with the patient's interests.

Objectives

Multiple randomized controlled trials exploring the outcomes of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia have noted that hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients who require subsequent ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia suffered higher mortality than either those who did not (nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia) or had ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. We examined the epidemiology and outcomes of all three conditions in a large U.S. database.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Two hundred fifty-three acute-care hospitals, United States, contributing data (including microbiology) to Premier database, 2012–2019.

Patients

Patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia identified based on a slightly modified previously published International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition/International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition-Clinical Modification algorithm.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 17,819 patients who met enrollment criteria, 26.5% had nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, 25.6% vHAPB, and 47.9% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia predominated in the Northeastern United States and in large urban teaching hospitals. Patients with nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia were oldest (mean 66.7 ± 15.1 yr) and most likely White (76.9%), whereas those with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia were youngest (59.7 ± 16.6 yr) and least likely White (70.3%). Ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia was associated with the highest comorbidity burden (mean Charlson score 4.1 ± 2.8) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia with the lowest (3.2 ± 2.5). Similarly, hospital mortality was highest among patients with ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (29.2%) and lowest in nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (11.7%), with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in-between (21.3%). Among survivors, 24.5% of nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia required a rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge, compared with 22.5% among ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and 18.8% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Unadjusted hospital length of stay after infection onset was longest among ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and shortest among nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients. Median total hospital costs mirrored length of stay: ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia $77,657, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $62,464, and nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $39,911.

Conclusions

Both hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remain associated with significant mortality and cost in the United States. Our analyses confirm that of all three conditions, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia carries the highest risk of death. In contrast, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remains most costly. Nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia survivors were most likely to require a readmission within 30 days of discharge.

### Short treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia [^116m9x7m]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lower respiratory tract infections are one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. Usual guidelines for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend 5–7days of antibiotic treatment. In daily practice, physicians often prescribe 9–10days of antibiotic treatment. Among available strategies to decrease antibiotic use, possibly preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing treatment durations is the safest and the most acceptable to clinicians. We aim to review data evaluating the efficacy of short antibiotic duration in adult CAP and which criteria can help clinicians to reduce antibiotic treatment.

Recent Findings

Several studies and meta-analyses demonstrated that the treatment duration of 7days or less was sufficient for CAP. Two trials found that 3-day treatments were effective, even in hospitalized CAP. To customize and shorten duration, clinical and biological criteria have been studied and reflect patient's response. Indeed, stability criteria were recently shown to be effective to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Procalcitonin was also studied but never compared with clinical criteria.

Summary

Treatment duration for CAP is still under debate, but several studies support short durations. Clinical criteria could be possibly used to discontinue antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic overuse and stewardship at hospital discharge: the reducing overuse of antibiotics at discharge home framework [^1169h2wM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS CURRENTLY KNOWN ABOUT ANTIBIOTIC USE AND OVERUSE AT DISCHARGE

Antimicrobials are prescribed to half of all patients during hospitalization and more than 1 in 8 at hospital discharge. For common infections treated in the hospital, up to half of antibiotic days occur after the patient has left the hospital. For community-acquired pneumonia, two-thirds of patients receive an excess antibiotic duration (ie, days beyond guideline-recommended durations) at discharge, with each excess day increasing the risk of adverse antibiotic events. Despite recent efforts to reduce fluoroquinolone use and the greater harm associated with fluoroquinolones compared with other effective antibiotics, fluoroquinolones remain the most common antibiotic prescribed at discharge. Up to 80% of fluoroquinolone days prescribed for acute infectious hospitalizations occur after discharge, which places patients at increased risk for adverse events (eg, Clostridioides difficile infection [CDI]) that may go underdetected in their home. In total, up to 70% of antibiotic courses prescribed at discharge from medicine services could be improved by narrowing the spectrum, choosing a safer drug, reducing duration, or stopping antibiotics altogether. Though data are sparse, surgical patients, who commonly receive antibiotics both for treatment and prophylaxis, could likely also benefit from antibiotic stewardship at discharge, including reducing duration of antibiotic treatment and stopping unnecessary post-operative prophylaxis.

Three specific scenarios related to discharge stewardship merit special discussion and are discussed in the following sections.

The distribution of time to clinical stability according to any of the criteria is shown in Figure 2. The majority of patients reached clinical stability on days 2–5. Approximately half of the patients with clinical stability data (n = 1,604) achieved clinical stability early in the course of treatment (day ≤ 4) (51.9%; n = 833), and 97.1% had achieved clinical stability on or before day 15. However, a small percentage (0.7%) of patients had not achieved clinical stability by day 30. Clinical failure (defined as acute haemodynamic deterioration or death, or any other criterion considered by the investigator to be indicative of clinical failure) occurred in 355 patients (17.4%). Of these, the failure was related to CAP in 239 patients (67.3%), unrelated in 85 patients (23.9%) and for unknown reasons in 31 patients (8.7%).

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### A novel risk-adjusted metric to compare hospitals on their antibiotic prescribing at hospital discharge [^115ZMh8f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparing Hospital Performance on the Risk-Adjusted Metric to Antibiotic Prescribing for Community-Acquired Pneumonia

We compared hospital performance on this risk-adjusted metric (groups 1–4) with a more intuitive assessment of antibiotic-prescribing quality: total antibiotic duration (inpatient + post-discharge) for uncomplicated cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Eligible cases of CAP were identified using the criteria shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, which included the following: a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia; chest imaging within the 48 hours before/after admission; antibiotics started less than 48 hours after admission; receipt of inpatient with or without post-discharge antibiotics for LOT ≥ 4; the absence of a lung abscess, an empyema, and other infection types; no pleural drainage procedures; and no immunosuppression.

For groups 1–4, we calculated (a) mean total antibiotic duration for CAP and (b) the percentage of patients with CAP who received the shortest effective antibiotic duration. An LOT of 6 or fewer days was chosen as the upper cutoff for "b" because patients receiving an antibiotic dosed more frequently than every 24 hours could have received antibiotics on 6 unique calendar days, even though the total duration was equal to 120 hours, or 5 days. Professional guidelines on CAP acknowledge that a total antibiotic duration of 5 days is appropriate for most patients. We compared "b" across patients at hospitals within each group (1–4) by using a generalized linear mixed model with the logit link function. This model included indicator variables for the type of random intercept group and a random intercept for each hospital.

### Declining length of hospital stay for pneumonia and postdischarge outcomes [^1149rqR5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to assess 8-year trends in the duration of hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia and to evaluate the impact of declining length of stay on postdischarge short-term readmission and mortality.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of 1886 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were discharged from a single hospital between March 1, 2000, and June 30, 2007. The main outcomes measured were all-cause mortality and hospital readmission during the 30-day period after discharge. Regression models were used to identify risk factors associated with hospital length of stay and the adjusted associations between length of stay and mortality and readmission.

Results

Factors associated with a longer hospital stay included the number of comorbid conditions, high risk classification on the Pneumonia Severity Index, bilateral or multilobe radiographic involvement, and treatment failure. Patients treated with an appropriate antibiotic were less likely to have an increased length of stay. The mean length of stay was significantly shorter during the 2006 to 2007 period (3.6 days) than during the 2000 to 2001 period (5.6 days, P < .001). Despite the reduction in length of stay, there were no significant differences in the likelihood of death or readmission at 30 days between the 2 time periods. Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that patients with hospital stays less than 3 days did not have significant increases in postdischarge outcomes.

Conclusion

The marked decreased in the length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia since 2000 has not been accompanied by an increase in short-term mortality or hospital readmission.

### Community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113Cm8E2]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hospital-acquired pneumonia:

- **Definition**: HAP (nosocomial pneumonia) is a lower respiratory infection occurring in patients at least 48 hours after admission to the hospital, or within 14 days after discharge from the hospital.
- **Pathophysiology**: The three main infection routes include inhalation (most common), aspiration and hematogenous dissemination (rare). HAP is most frequently caused by S. aureus (especially, MRSA), Pseudomonas species (especially P. aeruginosa), Acinetobacter species, E. coli, and Klebsiella species (including extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing and extensively drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae). Other pathogens include S. maltophilia, Chryseobacterium species, E. meningoseptica.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of HAP (HAP) in the US is estimated at 363 per 100,000 patient-days.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of HAP are similar to community-acquired pneumonia. Typical pneumonia is characterized by severe malaise, fever, chills, productive cough with purulent sputum (yellow-greenish), dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain associated with rales and increased tactile fremitus. Atypical HAP presents with extrapulmonary manifestations (eg. myalgia, nervous system impairment, and gastrointestinal symptoms).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis of HAP is highly dependent on risk factors and comorbidities. However, multidrug-resistant HAP is associated with higher mortality.

VAP duration of therapy — summary of evidence indicates that short courses of antibiotics (7–8 days) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.0 days; 95% CI, 2.26–5.78 days) and reduced recurrent VAP due to MDR pathogens (42.1% vs 62.3%; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, .21–.95) compared with long courses (10–15 days), with no differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, treatment failure, hospital length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. In patients with VAP due to non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (33% of patients), short courses were associated with recurrence (41.8% vs 24.7%; OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16) but no mortality or other clinical differences, and a more recent and larger body of evidence comparing short-course vs long-course treatment found no differences in these outcomes.

### Excess antibiotic treatment duration and adverse events in patients hospitalized with pneumonia: a multihospital cohort study [^1131eoXS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials demonstrate no benefit from antibiotic treatment exceeding the shortest effective duration.

Objective

To examine predictors and outcomes associated with excess duration of antibiotic treatment.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

43 hospitals in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium.

Patients

6481 general care medical patients with pneumonia.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the rate of excess antibiotic treatment duration (excess days per 30-day period). Excess days were calculated by subtracting each patient's shortest effective (expected) treatment duration (based on time to clinical stability, pathogen, and pneumonia classification [community-acquired vs. health care-associated]) from the actual duration. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to calculate rate ratios to assess predictors of 30-day rates of excess duration. Patient outcomes, assessed at 30 days via the medical record and telephone calls, were evaluated using logit GEEs that adjusted for patient characteristics and probability of treatment.

Results

Two thirds (67.8% [4391 of 6481]) of patients received excess antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics prescribed at discharge accounted for 93.2% of excess duration. Patients who had respiratory cultures or nonculture diagnostic testing, had a longer stay, received a high-risk antibiotic in the prior 90 days, had community-acquired pneumonia, or did not have a total antibiotic treatment duration documented at discharge were more likely to receive excess treatment. Excess treatment was not associated with lower rates of any adverse outcomes, including death, readmission, emergency department visit, or Clostridioides difficile infection. Each excess day of treatment was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events reported by patients after discharge.

Limitation

Retrospective design; not all patients could be contacted to report 30-day outcomes.

Conclusion

Patients hospitalized with pneumonia often receive excess antibiotic therapy. Excess antibiotic treatment was associated with patient-reported adverse events. Future interventions should focus on whether reducing excess treatment and improving documentation at discharge improves outcomes.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^113LV5iU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

This was a multicenter study assessing complications developed during 1 year of patients previously hospitalized with CAP who had been included in a randomized clinical trial concerning the duration of antibiotic treatment. Mortality at 90 days, at 180 days and at 1 year was analyzed, as well as new admissions and cardiovascular complications. A subanalysis was carried out in one of the hospitals by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) at admission, at day 5 and at day 30.

Results

A total of 312 patients were included, 150 in the control group and 162 in the intervention group. Ninety day, 180 day and 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis were 8 (2.57%), 10 (3.22%) and 14 (4.50%), respectively. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of 1-year mortality (p = 0.94), new admissions (p = 0.84) or cardiovascular events (p = 0.33). No differences were observed between biomarker level differences from day 5 to day 30 (CRP p = 0.29; PCT p = 0.44; proADM p = 0.52).

Conclusions

Reducing antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients with CAP based on clinical stability criteria is safe, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications.

### Short-course versus prolonged-course antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill adults [^117Ps6LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the most common hospital-acquired infection affecting patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of short versus prolonged-course antibiotic administration for HAP in critically ill adults, including patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to February week 4, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to March 2011), LILACS (1985 to March 2011) and Web of Science (1985 to March 2011).

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed durations of antibiotic therapy, or comparing a protocol intended to limit duration of therapy with standard care, for HAP (including patients with VAP) in critically ill adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main Results

Eight studies (1703 patients) were included. Methodology varied considerably and we found little evidence regarding patients with a high probability of HAP who were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, a short seven to eight-day course of antibiotics compared with a prolonged 10 to 15-day course (three studies, N = 508) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (odds ratio (OR) 4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26 to 5.78) and reduced recurrence of VAP due to multi-resistant organisms (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.95), without adversely affecting other outcomes. However, for cases of VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), recurrence was greater after short-course therapy (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.16; two studies, N = 176), though other outcome measures did not significantly differ. Discontinuation strategies utilising clinical features (one study; N = 302) or procalcitonin (three studies; N = 323) led to a reduction in duration of therapy and, in the procalcitonin studies, increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference (MD) 2.80; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.21) without negatively affecting other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude that for patients with VAP not due to NF-GNB, a short fixed-course (seven or eight days) antibiotic therapy may be more appropriate than a prolonged course (10 to 15 days). Use of an individualised strategy (incorporating clinical features or serum procalcitonin) appears to safely reduce duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP.

### Instability on hospital discharge and the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with pneumonia… [^115kuWCK]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Instability on discharge is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Pneumonia guidelines and pathways should include objective criteria for judging stability on discharge to ensure that efforts to shorten length of stay do not jeopardize patient safety. If oxygenation was not measured on a given day, the value of the most recent assessment was used. The mean last day that oxygen saturation was measured was 6. 4 days. Patients who used home oxygen prior to admission were not considered to have unstable oxygenation on discharge. All patients received a standard telephone follow-up call 30 days after discharge to ascertain survival, readmissions, and return to their usual activities. Any death or readmission within 30 days of discharge was considered a major event. Patients who died after being readmitted were only counted as having 1 major event.

We constructed this composite outcome because we believed that either adverse outcome could be a marker of a patient being sent home prior to being clinically ready. The mean length of hospital stay was 9. 2 ±
8. 9 days. The mean length of stay ranged from 7. 7 to
11. 3 days among the 4 sites. In the 30 days after discharge, 23 patients died; the median time to death was 18 days. Sixty-seven patients were readmitted within 30 days; the median time of readmission was 10 days. We also found a similar relationship between instabilities on discharge and risk of adverse outcomes at 7 and 14 days when complications are most likely to be purely pneumonia related. We found no significant relationship between hospital length of stay and instability on discharge.

For example, the median length of stay was 7 days in those with no instabilities, 8 days for those with 1 instability, and 6 days for patients with 2 or more instabilities; the median length of stay was 8 days among patients with 1 or more instabilities.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^117PyR3C]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The study Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia was published by Ane Uranga and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the trial question was: what is the role of duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia? In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the population was: 312 patients (116 female, 196 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were HIV infection; chronic immunosuppression; lived in a nursing home; discharge from an acute care hospital, an onsite subacute care unit, or a palliative care unit within the previous 14 days; taken antibiotics in the 30 days before admission. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the interventions were: n = 162 discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days (protocolized duration of antibiotic treatment for a minimum of 5 days) n = 150 physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation (duration of antibiotic treatment determined by physicians). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in clinical success at day 10 (56.3% vs. 48.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI -0.53 to 2.85). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical success at day 30 (91.9% vs. 88.6%; RR 1.04, 95% CI -1.03 to 3.11) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 5 (27.2 vs. 24.7; AD 2.5, 95% CI -0.48 to 5.48) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 10 (17.9 points vs. 18.6 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -3.99 to 2.59). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days were noninferior to physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation with respect to clinical success at day 10.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^116Ani3X]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The most common indication for antibiotics in hospitalized patients is suspected respiratory tract infection. Diagnosing pneumonia, however, is difficult. The cardinal signs of pneumonia (fever, impaired oxygenation, tachypnea, productive cough, leukocytosis, and radiographic infiltrates) are not specific for pneumonia, individually or collectively. Many acute and chronic conditions mimic the clinical presentation of pneumonia, including congestive heart failure, exacerbations of obstructive lung disease, atelectasis, mucus plugging, pulmonary embolism, hypersensitivity reactions, and others. Radiographic infiltrates are frequent in hospitalized patients and difficult to interpret: interobserver variability is high and specificity for pneumonia is low. Notwithstanding the difficulty of accurately diagnosing pneumonia, it is a common diagnosis and therefore frequently invoked by clinicians to explain patients' signs and symptoms. The net result of these many potential sources of error is that overdiagnosis of pneumonia is common and may account for a substantial fraction of unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitalized patients.,

The problem is often compounded by continuing antibiotic treatment for longer than needed. Guidelines recommend treating community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for 5 days and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 7 days, but adherence to these guidelines is poor. Moreover, at least 3 randomized clinical trials suggest that it is safe to stop antibiotic treatment once clinical signs are normalizing, even after as few as 3 days. We sought to quantify the frequency of potentially unnecessary prescribing for pneumonia by identifying the percentage of hospitalized patients started on antibiotic therapy for possible CAP and HAP with clinical signs within reference ranges on the first day of antibiotic administration, the number of days until clinical signs normalized among patients with at least 1 abnormal clinical sign on the first day of antibiotic treatment, and the duration of therapy beyond when clinical signs normalized.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering longer courses of antibiotics in patients with inappropriate initial empiric therapy individualized to the patient's clinical response, specific bacteriological findings (such as pandrug-resistant bacteria, MRSA, or bacteremia), and the serial measurement of biomarkers when indicated.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^111zb32A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To describe how the secondary outcomes (ie, 30-day patient outcomes) changed during the study period, we used logistic regression models, adjusting for hospital clustering, to obtain aORs for change by quarter. For each model, we adjusted for patient factors associated with the outcome (details in Supplementary Material). As above, we constructed logistic regression models that allowed for random intercepts and slopes adjusting for patient risks by averaging over the covariate distribution in the population to produce risk-standardized outcome predictions. In this model, the variation across hospitals in the rate of change in secondary outcomes over time was small and not significant, so the final model includes only a random intercept allowing for different baseline secondary outcome rates. We again graphically present predicted overall rates of change (averaging across hospitals and the population patient covariate distribution) as well as individual smoothed hospital curves averaging over patient covariates (Figure 2). As a secondary analysis, we imputed missing data through a 10-fold multiple imputation procedure and combined using standard rules.

Figure 2.
The predicted probability of a patient hospitalized with CAP having an adverse event within 30-days of hospital discharge is shown over time by quarter (aOR of adverse event per quarter:.98, 95% CI:.96–.99). The average over all hospitals is shown in blue and smoothed individual hospital curves are shown in gray. Predicted probabilities were obtained from logistic regression models, adjusting for hospital clustering, allowing for random intercepts, and adjusting for patient risks to obtain aORs for change by quarter. Composite adverse events, measured at 30-days after discharge, include mortality, hospital readmission, urgent visit (includes any urgent visit not resulting in hospitalization including emergency department visit, urgent care visit, or observation stay), and antibiotic-associated adverse events obtained from a combination of chart review and patient phone calls at 30-days. Note: Dates on x-axis are given in month/date/year format.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^113egaeS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Changes in Appropriate Antibiotic Duration Over Time

Over the study period, the proportion of patients treated with a 5-day antibiotic duration increased from 22.1% (predicted probability adjusted for hospital clustering, 20.9% [95% CI, 17.2%–25.0%]) to 45.9% (43.9% [36.8%–51.2%]; P < .001) (Figure 1). Each quarter was associated with higher odds of receiving an appropriate 5-day antibiotic duration (aOR per quarter, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.07–1.14]), for an annual aOR of 1.49 (1.33–1.66). Improvement in appropriate antibiotic duration over time was driven by a decrease in antibiotic duration at discharge (median [interquartile range] discharge duration, 5 [3–7] days in 2017 and 3 [2–5] days in 2020; P < .001).

Every year, the collaborative average was higher than the "pay-for-performance" target set by the CQI, though not all hospitals met the metric: 85% (35 of 41) met the metric in 2018 and 44% (18 of 41) in 2019. There was evidence of variation in adoption; hospitals with low baseline rates had, on average, larger increases in rates of appropriate treatment (Figure 1). The estimate of the variance of the random slopes across hospitals was 0.005 on the log odds scale (95% CI:.001–.008), which implies a wide variation in rates of change with 95% of hospitals falling into a range of 0.96–1.27 for OR per quarter. However, the hospital characteristics we evaluated did not explain the variation in slope of improvement across hospitals (Supplementary Table 3).

### Antibiotic overuse after hospital discharge: a multi-hospital cohort study [^113XxGVq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Setting and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included patients discharged between 1 July 2017 and 30 July 2019 from 46 diverse hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety (HMS) Consortium (a collaborative quality initiative funded by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan). Hospital participation in HMS is voluntary and includes half of nongovernment hospitals in Michigan, including rural hospitals, community hospitals, and academic teaching hospitals. Since 2017, HMS has collected data on patients treated for pneumonia or UTI. As part of its quality improvement efforts, HMS shares guidelines during in-person quarterly meetings, provides a toolkit to help hospitals improve, and sets pay-for-performance metrics targeting 3 critical areas for antibiotic stewardship: (1) unnecessary antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria; (2) reducing excessive duration (particularly in community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]); and (3) emphasizing use of nonfluoroquinolone therapy when safe to do so.

The sampling, inclusion, and exclusion criteria have been described previously. Briefly, we included non–critically ill, hospitalized, adult medical patients who were treated for either pneumonia or a UTI during hospitalization. To identify patients for inclusion, discharge lists at each hospital were consecutively screened by HMS abstractors until 2 patients met the inclusion criteria daily (including weekends). Abstractors (who are not involved in patient care) undergo in-person and online case-based training on data abstraction and eligibility criteria, and undergo random audits for quality assurance. Patients were excluded if they did not receive antibiotic therapy, were pregnant, were severely immune-compromised (ie, diagnosed with AIDS or neutropenia, had a history of transplant, or had received ≥ 2 immunosuppressive agents), had concomitant infections (eg, cellulitis), died during hospitalization, or were transferred to another hospital or to intensive care.

### A novel risk-adjusted metric to compare hospitals on their antibiotic prescribing at hospital discharge [^113rYQsg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison Between the Risk-Adjusted Metric and Antibiotic Duration for Community-Acquired Pneumonia

There were 41 076 cases of uncomplicated CAP, which accounted for 5.5% of all inpatients exposed to antibiotics. The median number of CAP cases per hospital was 286 (IQR, 181–407); all but 4 (3.1%) hospitals had 50 or more cases. The median inpatient antibiotic duration was 4 (IQR, 2–5) days and the median post-discharge duration was 3 (IQR, 0–5) days. In all, 70.3% of patients with CAP received post-discharge antibiotics. Table 2 shows how antibiotic duration differed across groups 1–4. Compared with patients at group 4 hospitals, patients were more likely to receive the shortest effective antibiotic duration for CAP at group 1 hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 2.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27–3.90; P < .001), group 2 hospitals (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.86–3.43; P < .001), and group 3 hospitals (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.66–2.86; P < .001).

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria for HAP/VAP antibiotic discontinuation — we suggest using PCT levels plus clinical criteria rather than clinical criteria alone to guide discontinuation (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), noting it is not known if benefits apply where standard VAP therapy is already 7 days or less. Evidence from a systematic review found 14 trials with 4221 patients showing decreased antibiotic exposure (adjusted mean difference, −3.47 days; 95% CI, −3.78 to −3.17 days) without increased mortality or treatment failure. Trials specifically in VAP (2 published and 1 abstract) pooled 308 patients and showed shorter antibiotic duration with PCT plus clinical criteria (9.1 days vs 12.1 days; P < .00001) with no difference in mortality and no effects on mechanical ventilation duration, ICU or hospital length of stay, recurrent pneumonia, or resistance. The panel had low confidence due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision (I² = 21%), and noted usual short-course therapy is about 7–8 days; the evidence is predominantly from VAP, so recommendations for HAP are mostly based on VAP studies.

### Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in community acquired pneumonia: a prospective, multicenter, observational study (CAPRIVI) [^116c3Ru4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Time to improvement and cure rates

In total, 96.7% of patients in the efficacy population were reported to improve, i.e. feel better, during the study, while only 2.8% did not improve (Figure 3). Improvement was achieved in 78.9% of patients after 3 days, 88.3% after 4 days, and 94.4% after 5 days. The mean duration until improvement was 2.7 ± 1.3 days.

Figure 3
Cumulative increase in proportion of patients who showed improvement (efficacy population).

Cure of infection was reported in 93.2% of patients at the end of therapy, versus 5.2% who were not cured (data were missing in 1.6% of patients). Stratified analyses by symptoms, diagnostic measures, vital signs, and previous antibiotic use at baseline identified no substantial differences in the rate of cure of CAP between subgroups. Cure rates in patients with mild, moderate, or severe infection, for example, were 94.3%, 94.6%, and 89.6%, respectively.

Time to hospital discharge

A total of 93.2% of patients were discharged from hospital after a mean of 10.4 ± 5.9 days of moxifloxacin therapy. Stratified analysis showed that duration of hospitalization was longer in patients with a higher CRB-65 score at baseline (mean 13.5 and 10.4 days for scores of ≥ 2 and < 2, respectively) and in patients who did not versus who did achieve a cure by moxifloxacin (mean 15.5 and 10.2 days). The most frequently identified reasons why patients were not discharged from hospital were concomitant diseases (0.6%) and failure of moxifloxacin therapy (0.3%).

### Inappropriate diagnosis of pneumonia among hospitalized adults [^116kb7uk]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Little is known about incidence of, risk factors for, and harms associated with inappropriate diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Objective

To characterize inappropriate diagnosis of CAP in hospitalized patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study, including medical record review and patient telephone calls, took place across 48 Michigan hospitals. Trained abstractors retrospectively assessed hospitalized patients treated for CAP between July 1, 2017, and March 31, 2020. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were adults admitted to general care with a discharge diagnostic code of pneumonia who received antibiotics on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization. Data were analyzed from February to December 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Inappropriate diagnosis of CAP was defined using a National Quality Forum-endorsed metric as CAP-directed antibiotic therapy in patients with fewer than 2 signs or symptoms of CAP or negative chest imaging. Risk factors for inappropriate diagnosis were assessed and, for those inappropriately diagnosed, 30-day composite outcomes (mortality, readmission, emergency department visit, Clostridioides difficile infection, and antibiotic-associated adverse events) were documented and stratified by full course (> 3 days) vs brief (≤ 3 days) antibiotic treatment using generalized estimating equation models adjusting for confounders and propensity for treatment.

Results

Of the 17 290 hospitalized patients treated for CAP, 2079 (12.0%) met criteria for inappropriate diagnosis (median [IQR] age, 71.8 [60.1–82.8] years; 1045 [50.3%] female), of whom 1821 (87.6%) received full antibiotic courses. Compared with patients with CAP, patients inappropriately diagnosed were older (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.11 per decade) and more likely to have dementia (AOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.55–2.08) or altered mental status on presentation (AOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39–2.19). Among those inappropriately diagnosed, 30-day composite outcomes for full vs brief treatment did not differ (25.8% vs 25.6%; AOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.23). Full vs brief duration of antibiotic treatment among patients was associated with antibiotic-associated adverse events (31 of 1821 [2.1%] vs 1 of 258 [0.4%]; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, inappropriate diagnosis of CAP among hospitalized adults was common, particularly among older adults, those with dementia, and those presenting with altered mental status. Full-course antibiotic treatment of those inappropriately diagnosed with CAP may be harmful.

### Chest physiotherapy in paediatric patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised clinical trial [^113R6w7W]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chest physiotherapy has been used to treat children hospitalised with pneumonia with no clear scientific evidence to support a beneficial effect. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of chest physiotherapy as an adjuvant treatment in children hospitalised with acute community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

Children (aged 1–12 years) with a clinical and confirmed radiological diagnosis of pneumonia sequentially admitted to a tertiary children hospital were eligible for this study. Participants were randomly selected to receive a standardised respiratory physiotherapy (positioning, thoracic vibration, thoracic compression, positive expiratory pressure, breathing exercises and forced exhalation with the glottis open or 'huffing') three times daily in the 'intervention group' or a non-mandatory request to breathe deeply, expectorate the sputum and maintain a lateral body position once a day in the 'control group'. The primary outcomes were reduction in respiratory rate and severity score (respiratory rate, recession, fever, oxygen saturation and chest x-ray) from baseline to discharge. Secondary outcome was duration of hospitalisation.

Results

In all, 72 patients were randomly allocated to the intervention (n = 35) or control (n = 37) groups. There were no differences at admission on severity of pneumonia between groups. Respiratory rate and severity score significant decreased between admission to discharge within each group; however, there were no differences when comparing groups. Also, there was no significant difference in duration of hospitalisation between the control and intervention groups (6 vs 8 days, p = 0.11, respectively).

Conclusions

This clinical trial suggests that, in children hospitalised with moderate community-acquired pneumonia, chest physiotherapy did not have clinical benefits in comparison to control group.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^1138cYdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — duration of therapy: For patients with VAP, we recommend a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer duration (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Remarks: There exist situations in which a shorter or longer duration of antibiotics may be indicated, depending on the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters. One systematic review included 6 randomized trials that enrolled 508 patients with HAP/VAP; short courses of antibiotics (ie, 7–8 days) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.02 days; 95% CI, 2.26–5.78 days) and reduced recurrent VAP due to MDR pathogens (42.1% vs 62.3%; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, .25–.95) compared with long courses (ie, 10–15 days), with no differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, treatment failure, hospital length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. In the subgroup with a non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacillus including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (33% of patients), short courses were associated with recurrent infection (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16), but no other differences. Another systematic review enrolled 835 patients with VAP and similarly found short-course regimens increased antibiotic-free days without differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of ICU stay.

### Antibiotic use and outcomes among children hospitalized with suspected pneumonia [^112jb1ta]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although viral etiologies predominate, antibiotics are frequently prescribed for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Objective

We evaluated the association between antibiotic use and outcomes among children hospitalized with suspected CAP.

Designs, Settings and Participants

We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of children hospitalized with suspected CAP.

Intervention

The exposure was the receipt of antibiotics in the emergency department (ED).

Main Outcome and Measures

Clinical outcomes included length of stay (LOS), care escalation, postdischarge treatment failure, 30-day ED revisit, and quality-of-life (QoL) measures from a follow-up survey 7–15days post discharge. To minimize confounding by indication (e.g., radiographic CAP), we performed inverse probability treatment weighting with propensity analyses.

Results

Among 523 children, 66% were < 5 years, 88% were febrile, 55% had radiographic CAP, and 55% received ED antibiotics. The median LOS was 41h (IQR: 25, 54). After propensity analyses, there were no differences in LOS, escalated care, treatment failure, or revisits between children who received antibiotics and those who did not. Seventy-one percent of patients completed follow-up surveys after discharge. Among 16% of patients with fevers after discharge, the median fever duration was 2days, and those who received antibiotics had a 37% decrease in the mean number of days with fever (95% confidence interval: 20% and 51%). We found no statistical differences in other QoL measures.

### Avoidable 30-day readmissions following hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia… [^115uJCN8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This cohort study analyzed the results of an independent review of readmissions following hospitalization for CAP within 30 days among patients discharged from 2 large hospitals in France in 2014. Structured clinical records including clinical information for both index and readmission stays were independently reviewed by 4 certified board physicians. All consecutive adult patients hospitalized in 2014 with a diagnosis of CAP in our 2 eligible hospitals were eligible. All analyses presented were performed in March 2021. Conclusions and Relevance Only a small number of readmissions following hospitalization for CAP were deemed avoidable, comprising less than 10% of all readmissions. Shorter time interval between hospitalization discharge and readmission was associated with avoidability.

Data on hospital stays with confirmed CAP with readmission within 30 days of discharge were submitted to 4 medical experts to evaluate the unplanned nature of readmission, its avoidable nature, and the causes of readmissions. We recruited a convenience sample of 9 board-certified physicians with experience in managing CAP, including 3 infectious disease specialists, 3 pulmonologists, and 3 clinical epidemiology specialists. The median delay between the index hospitalization discharge and the readmission was notably shorter when the readmission was deemed avoidable. None of the other factors related to preadmission, functional and cognitive status, and postdischarge were found as significantly associated with avoidability. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with avoidable readmissions. The difference in time from hospital discharge to readmission was significantly lower in the avoidable readmission group.

This finding corroborates doubts about the pertinence of the 30-day readmission interval used by the HRRP program. In 2016, Chin and colleagues32 reported that the hospital-level quality signal captured in pneumonia readmission risk was highest between the first and the seventh day postdischarge. In conclusion, our study found that only a small proportion of readmissions following hospitalization for pneumonia were avoidable. Given the complexity of clinical situations, detailed clinical data and multiple independent reviews are essential to judge whether a pneumonia readmission is avoidable. The use of 30-day readmission following a hospitalization for CAP for determining shortcut payments and public reporting may unfairly penalize hospitals.

### Causes and risk factors for rehospitalization of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^113jDwUZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rehospitalization after inpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia occurs in one-tenth of all hospitalizations, but the clinical circumstances surrounding readmission to the hospital have not been well studied. The objective of this study was to identify the causes and risk factors for rehospitalization of inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

This project was performed as part of a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial of the implementation of practice guidelines to reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and duration of hospitalization for patients who have received a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia. The trial was conducted at 7 hospitals in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from February 1998 through March 1999. The primary outcome for these analyses was rehospitalization within 30 days after the index hospitalization. Two physicians independently assigned the cause of rehospitalization as pneumonia related, comorbidity related, or both; consensus was reached for all assignments. Patient demographic characteristics and clinical factors independently associated with rehospitalization were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis.

Results

Of the 577 patients discharged after hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, 70 (12%) were rehospitalized within 30 days. The median time to rehospitalization was 8 days (interquartile range, 4–13 days). Overall, 52 rehospitalizations (74%) were comorbidity related, and 14 (20%) were pneumonia related. The most frequent comorbid conditions responsible for rehospitalization were cardiovascular (n = 19), pulmonary (n = 6) and neurological (n = 6) in origin. Less than a high school education (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–3.4), unemployment (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–12.3), coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5–4.7), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–4.1) were independently associated with rehospitalization.

Conclusions

The majority of rehospitalizations following pneumonia are comorbidity related and are the result of underlying cardiopulmonary and/or neurologic diseases. Careful attention to the clinical stability of patients with these coexisting conditions at and following hospital discharge may decrease the frequency of rehospitalization of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Nosocomial pneumonia: state of the science [^117StAfM]. American Journal of Infection Control (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality due to hospital-acquired infections. A thorough understanding of the most recent developments in evaluating and managing nosocomial pneumonia is critical for infection control professionals and hospital epidemiologists, given the incidence and cost of this important patient safety problem. We review the evidence on pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both ventilator-associated and nonventilator-associated pneumonia. Key recommendations are then provided for diagnostic testing strategies, antibiotic selection, and treatment duration. We also summarize the most recent data on how to prevent hospital-acquired infection, in general, and nosocomial pneumonia, in particular.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^116vBWn7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients eligible for a 5-day antibiotic duration were identified using previously published methods based on national guidelines. Briefly, patients expected to have a 5-day antibiotic duration were those who reached clinical stability (afebrile for ≥ 48 hours and having ≤ 1 vital sign abnormality) by hospital day 5 or were discharged by day 3 of hospitalization. Because we were targeting patients whose eligibility for a 5-day duration was clear, we excluded patients infected by an organism that may require longer treatment (ie, bacteremia, Legionella, Staphylococcus, or Pseudomonas species, or other nonfermenting gram-negative organisms) or a condition that may require longer treatment (ie, moderate immune compromise [ie, human immunodeficiency virus with CD4 cell count > 200/µL, recent chemotherapy, treatment with biologic agents, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency], structural lung disease, moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Because HMS began before the removal of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) terminology from national guidelines, CAP was defined based on the 2007 CAP guidelines, and patients who met criteria for HCAP (eg, hospitalization within 90 days) were excluded. Patients who died, were transferred to the ICU during hospitalization, or who were missing critical data to calculate antibiotic duration were also excluded (see Supplementary Figure 2 for definitions and flow diagram).

### Short-course versus prolonged-course antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill adults [^1116n6vn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the most common hospital-acquired infection affecting patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, current national guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are several years old and the diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients (VAP) has been subject to considerable recent attention. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP in the critically ill is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of short versus prolonged-course antibiotics for HAP in critically ill adults, including patients with VAP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2015), MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations (5 June 2015), EMBASE (2010 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to June 2015) and Web of Science (1955 to June 2015).

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a fixed 'short' duration of antibiotic therapy with a 'prolonged' course for HAP (including patients with VAP) in critically ill adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main Results

We identified six relevant studies involving 1088 participants. This included two new studies published after the date of our previous review (2011). There was substantial variation in participants, in the diagnostic criteria used to define an episode of pneumonia, in the interventions and in the reported outcomes. We found no evidence relating to patients with a high probability of HAP who were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, overall a short seven- or eight-day course of antibiotics compared with a prolonged 10- to 15-day course increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (two studies; N = 431; mean difference (MD) 4.02 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26 to 5.78) and reduced recurrence of VAP due to multi-resistant organisms (one study; N = 110; odds ratio (OR) 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.95), without adversely affecting mortality and other recurrence outcomes. However, for cases of VAP specifically due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), recurrence was greater after short-course therapy (two studies, N = 176; OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.16), though mortality outcomes were not significantly different. One study found that a three-day course of antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected HAP but a low Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) was associated with a significantly lower risk of superinfection or emergence of antimicrobial resistance, compared with standard (prolonged) course therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of a small number of studies and appreciating the lack of uniform definition of pneumonia, we conclude that for patients with VAP not due to NF-GNB a short, fixed course (seven or eight days) of antibiotic therapy appears not to increase the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, and may reduce the emergence of resistant organisms, compared with a prolonged course (10 to 15 days). However, for patients with VAP due to NF-GNB, there appears to be a higher risk of recurrence following short-course therapy. These findings do not differ from those of our previous review and are broadly consistent with current guidelines. There are few data from RCTs comparing durations of therapy in non-ventilated patients with HAP, but on the basis of a single study, short-course (three-day) therapy for HAP appears not to be associated with worse clinical outcome, and may reduce the risk of subsequent infection or the emergence of resistant organisms when there is low probability of pneumonia according to the CPIS.

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^113NyXsL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause for hospitalization and antibiotic overuse. We aimed to improve antibiotic duration for CAP across 41 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS).

Methods

This prospective collaborative quality initiative included patients hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP who qualified for a 5-day antibiotic duration. Between 23 February 2017 and 5 February 2020, HMS targeted appropriate 5-day antibiotic treatment through benchmarking, sharing best practices, and pay-for-performance incentives. Changes in outcomes, including appropriate receipt of 5 ± 1–day antibiotic treatment and 30-day postdischarge composite adverse events (ie, deaths, readmissions, urgent visits, and antibiotic-associated adverse events), were assessed over time (per 3-month quarter), using logistic regression and controlling for hospital clustering.

Results

A total of 41 hospitals and 6553 patients were included. The percentage of patients treated with an appropriate 5 ± 1–day duration increased from 22.1% (predicted probability, 20.9% [95% confidence interval: 17.2%–25.0%]) to 45.9% (predicted probability, 43.9% [36.8%–51.2%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per quarter, 1.10 [1.07–1.14]). Thirty-day composite adverse events occurred in 18.5% of patients (1166 of 6319) and decreased over time (aOR per quarter, 0.98 [95% confidence interval:.96–.99]) owing to a decrease in antibiotic-associated adverse events (aOR per quarter, 0.91 [.87–.95]).

Conclusions

Across diverse hospitals, HMS participation was associated with more appropriate use of short-course therapy and fewer adverse events in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated CAP. Establishment of national or regional collaborative quality initiatives with data collection and benchmarking, sharing of best practices, and pay-for-performance incentives may improve antibiotic use and outcomes for patients hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^114pWXgT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

While 47 hospitals contributed data to HMS, 6 were excluded for participating in less than half of the study period (23 February 2017 through 5 February 2020), leaving 41 hospitals for our analysis (87%). Hospitals that dropped out were similar to those that participated (Supplementary Table 1). There were 6553 patients with uncomplicated CAP who were eligible for a 5-day duration and included in this study (see Supplementary Table 2 for patient characteristics). The most common empiric antibiotics were ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and levofloxacin. The most common discharge antibiotics were azithromycin, oral cephalosporins, and levofloxacin. Over the study period both empiric and discharge fluoroquinolone use decreased, replaced largely by cephalosporin and β-lactam use (Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B).

Over the study period, 34.0% of patients eligible for a 5-day duration (2228 of 6553) received an appropriate 5 ± 1–day duration. Proportions of patients with uncomplicated CAP treated with an appropriate 5-day duration ranged from 10.0% to 69.0% across hospitals; hospitals that were academic, nonprofit, larger, or part of a statewide healthcare system had higher rates of appropriate 5-day treatment (Table 1).

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### The information and support needs of patients discharged after a short hospital stay for treatment of low-risk community acquired pneumonia: implications for treatment without admission [^114rY6D7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that patients with low-risk community acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be effectively treated as outpatients. This study aimed to explore patients' experiences of having pneumonia and seeking health care; their perceptions of the information provided by health professionals; how they self managed at home; their information and support needs; and their beliefs and preferences regarding site of care.

Methods

We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 15 patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of low-risk CAP and had received fewer than 3 days hospital care. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, and data were analysed thematically.

Results

Most patients left hospital with no clear understanding of pneumonia, its treatment or follow-up and most identified additional-other specific information needs when they got home. Some were unable to independently address their activities of daily living in their first days at home. Main concerns after discharge related to the cause and implications of pneumonia, symptom trajectory and prevention of transmission. Most sought advice from their GP in their first days at home, and indicated they would have appreciated a follow-up phone call or visit to discuss their concerns. Patients' preferences for site of care varied and appeared to be influenced by beliefs about safety (fear of rapid deterioration at home or acquiring an infection in hospital), family burden, access to support, or confidence in home-care services. Those who received intravenous (IV) medication were more likely to state a preference for hospital care.

Conclusion

Trends to support community-based treatment of CAP should be accompanied by increased attention to the information and support needs of patients who go home to self-manage. Although some information needs can be anticipated and addressed on diagnosis, specific needs often do not become apparent until patients return home, so some access to information and support in the community is likely to be necessary. Our finding that patients who received IV treatment for low-risk CAP were concerned about the relative safety of home-based care highlights the potential importance of the inferences patients make from treatment modalities, and also the need to ensure that patients' expectations and understandings are managed effectively.

HAP (Non-VAP) antibiotic duration — recommendation states: For patients with HAP, we recommend a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy (rather than a longer duration, very low-quality evidence). Remarks indicate that shorter or longer durations may be used depending on the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters, and the guideline panel found no studies that provided useful data for comparing short-term to long-term antibiotic therapy in HAP.

### Duration of antibiotic use among adults with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in the United States [^1142uEa4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggest that duration of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) often exceeds national recommendations and might represent an important opportunity to improve antibiotic stewardship nationally. Our objective was to determine the average length of antibiotic therapy (LOT) for patients treated for uncomplicated CAP in US hospitals and the proportion of patients with excessive durations.

Methods

Records of retrospective cohorts of patients aged 18–64 years with private insurance and aged ≥ 65 years with Medicare hospitalized for CAP in 2012–2013 were used. Inpatient LOT was estimated as a function of length of stay. Outpatient LOT was based on prescriptions filled post discharge based on data from outpatient pharmacy files. Excessive duration was defined as outpatient LOT > 3 days.

Results

Inclusion criteria were met for 22128 patients aged 18–64 years across 2100 hospitals and 130746 patients aged ≥ 65 years across 3227 hospitals. Median total LOT was 9.5 days. LOT exceeded recommended duration for 74% of patients aged 18–64 years and 71% of patients aged ≥ 65 years. Patients aged 18–64 years had a median (quartile 1-quartile 3) 6 (3–7) days outpatient LOT and those aged ≥ 65 years had 5 (3–7) days.

Conclusions

In this nationwide sample of patients hospitalized for CAP, median total LOT was just under 10 days, with more than 70% of patients having likely excessive treatment duration. Better adherence to recommended CAP therapy duration by improving prescribing at hospital discharge may be an important target for antibiotic stewardship programs.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — antibiotic duration is informed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) data; the evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy for ≤ 7 days does not reduce the benefits of antibiotic therapy while shorter courses almost certainly reduce antibiotic-related side effects, C. difficile colitis, the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, and costs, so antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for ≤ 7 days, and the recommendation is strong.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of antibiotic therapy, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to decide on the duration of antibiotic therapy based on validated measures of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and ability to tolerate oral intake) Continue antibiotics until the patient achieves stability and for at least 5 days in patients with CAP.
