## Question

What pediatric temperature warrants medical attention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric fever thresholds and when to seek medical attention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal definition of fever and how measurement method affects interpretation. Then, I should stratify by age, especially neonates and young infants, and clarify what "well-appearing" means. Next, I will examine how height of fever interacts with risk of serious bacterial infection and when it changes management. After that, I should review special populations and medication-related hyperthermia. Finally, I will synthesize practical thresholds and red flags, and close with counseling and safety-netting considerations, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the fever definition and measurement issues. Fever in children is generally defined as a rectal temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F) or higher, and rectal thermometry remains the most reliable noninvasive method for estimating core temperature in infants and young children, with axillary measurements typically about 1°C lower than rectal, which can misclassify fever if not interpreted correctly [^1116ESiz] [^111AjGpX]. Wait, let me verify the axillary offset; yes, axillary tends to read lower, so a reported axillary temperature of 37.5°C could correspond to a rectal temperature near 38.5°C, reinforcing the need to confirm route and re-measure when decisions hinge on a narrow threshold.

> Now, I need to stratify by age because risk and recommended workup differ dramatically. For neonates 28 days or younger, any documented fever of 38.0°C or higher is a medical emergency and warrants full sepsis evaluation, empiric antibiotics, and hospital admission. I should double-check that this remains the standard across policies and reviews, and yes, both AAP-aligned summaries and emergency medicine policies consistently recommend this aggressive approach given the high risk of serious bacterial infection in this group [^115wo3tK] [^115iuAar]. Hold on, I should verify that "well-appearing" status does not mitigate this; for neonates, even well-appearing infants with fever still require full evaluation and admission, so appearance is not a reassuring feature in this age band [^115wo3tK].

> For infants 8 to 60 days, I will now examine the AAP 2021 guideline framework. The guideline addresses well-appearing, term infants with fever ≥ 38.0°C and provides age-stratified algorithms. Importantly, it allows for shared decision-making in older subgroups when labs are reassuring, but I need to ensure I do not overstate this as "optional hospitalization" for all, because some scenarios still mandate admission based on abnormal markers or inability to obtain/interpret cerebrospinal fluid [^1116ESiz] [^114aTYCM] [^111YY33L]. Let me reconsider the key thresholds: 8–21 days generally require hospitalization with full sepsis workup; 22–28 days may be managed with shared decision-making if initial labs are normal; 29–60 days can often be managed as outpatients if all inflammatory markers, urinalysis, and CSF (if obtained) are normal and reliable follow-up is assured, which I should confirm aligns with the action statements, and it does [^1116ESiz] [^117BqUs9] [^111YY33L].

> Next, I should review how height of fever influences risk and testing in older infants and children. Initially, I thought temperature alone poorly predicts serious bacterial infection, but wait, let me verify nuance here. While overall diagnostic accuracy of temperature for SBI is modest in mixed-age cohorts, higher temperatures, particularly ≥ 39.0–39.5°C, correlate with increased SBI risk in young infants and can shift pretest probability and testing thresholds, even though fever height should never be interpreted in isolation [^115FMWv3] [^113b65Qi] [^113eMv63]. I should double-check that this does not imply that lower fevers are safe. Indeed, a meaningful minority of infants with temperatures below 38.2°C still harbor SBIs, so clinical appearance and risk stratification remain paramount [^111GcNov].

> For children older than 3 months, I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Most fevers in this group are viral and self-limited. However, persistent high fever, ill appearance, focal signs, or concerning evolution warrant evaluation, and certain clinical contexts, such as cough with hypoxia or chest recession, should prompt chest radiography even in well-appearing children, which I should confirm against policy statements, and yes, ACEP supports selective chest radiography in 2 months to 2 years with fever and respiratory features or high fever and prolonged duration [^111xy4GX] [^113NWVeq]. But wait, what if the child is unvaccinated or has special risk factors? In those cases, a lower threshold for blood culture and broader evaluation is reasonable given altered epidemiology and risk, so I should keep risk modifiers in mind [^111vRtaq].

> I will now examine special populations and medication-related hyperthermia. In children with cancer and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, any fever ≥ 38.0°C is an oncologic emergency requiring urgent evaluation and empiric IV antibiotics due to the risk of rapid deterioration, so I should emphasize this as a strict threshold with time-sensitive treatment goals [^114cuyji]. For children on topiramate, I need to check the hyperthermia warning; the FDA labeling cautions about oligohidrosis and hyperthermia, advising immediate contact if high or persistent fever or decreased sweating occurs, so I should flag this as a medication-specific red flag requiring prompt assessment [^1157eEcY] [^114uuM19] [^113wpEN2]. Let me also consider environmental heat illness; rising ED volumes for pediatric heat-related illness underscore the need to counsel on hydration, cooling, and when to seek care, especially during heat waves [^111YyE58].

> Next, I should review hypothermia, because I need to ensure I do not overlook low temperatures. In young infants, axillary temperatures ≤ 35.5–36.5°C can be the first sign of serious bacterial infection and should trigger evaluation. Recent quality improvement work shows that standardizing recognition and rewarming protocols in primary care reduces missed sepsis, so I should treat low temperatures with the same urgency as fever in this age group [^111Cj1we] [^1144btbh] [^117QeSkH]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond the neonatal period. Evidence and reviews emphasize that hypothermia in infants up to about 90 days can signal invasive infection and merits hospital-level care when concerning features are present [^117QeSkH].

> Let me synthesize practical thresholds while keeping the clinical context front and center. Any neonate with rectal temperature ≥ 38.0°C needs immediate emergency evaluation. Infants 8–60 days with fever ≥ 38.0°C require guideline-based evaluation and age-specific disposition. Children older than 3 months with persistent fever ≥ 39.0°C, ill appearance, focal findings, dehydration, or concerning evolution should seek medical attention within 24 hours. And any temperature ≥ 40.0°C warrants same-day evaluation regardless of age, with escalation if accompanied by lethargy, poor perfusion, respiratory distress, seizures, or inaccessibility to care [^115wo3tK] [^1116ESiz]. I should confirm that these align with consensus and policy language, and yes, ACEP policies and AAP summaries support age-based thresholds and emphasize that appearance and access to follow-up modify disposition decisions [^115rx7Q7].

> I need to ensure I address febrile seizures and caregiver red flags explicitly. Febrile seizures are common and usually benign, but any first febrile seizure or a prolonged seizure warrants medical evaluation; caregivers should also seek care for fever with signs of serious illness such as inconsolability, persistent vomiting, poor intake, altered consciousness, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, or new rash, and I should reinforce that these trump absolute temperature in decision-making [^114vxEjf] [^1176J5JB]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying that seizures alone dictate admission; most febrile seizures are managed outpatient with appropriate follow-up, but evaluation is still indicated to confirm diagnosis and exclude other causes [^114vxEjf].

> Finally, I should review counseling and safety-netting, because misinterpretation of fever drives unnecessary visits. Fever phobia remains prevalent, so I should explain that fever is a symptom, not a disease, clarify correct measurement technique and antipyretic dosing, and provide explicit return precautions tied to appearance, hydration, and duration rather than a single temperature value. This approach reduces anxiety and improves appropriate use of care [^11455mSB] [^111pczec]. Let me double-check that updated temperature norms can guide expectations; recent percentile data show that rectal medians in infants are around 37.2°C and axillary medians around 36.7°C, which helps contextualize what constitutes a meaningful elevation in practice [^114wzzqi].

A pediatric fever of **≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)** [^115rx7Q7] warrants medical evaluation, but the urgency depends on age and clinical appearance [^116rDVDj]. For infants **< 28 days**, any fever requires **immediate emergency care** [^115wo3tK]. For infants **29–90 days**, fever ≥ 38.0°C warrants **urgent evaluation within 24 hours** [^115rx7Q7]. For children **> 3 months**, fever ≥ 39.0°C (102.2°F) or fever lasting > 5 days [^113NNs1J] should prompt medical assessment; seek care sooner if the child appears ill, has poor intake, dehydration, persistent vomiting, difficulty breathing, lethargy, or altered consciousness [^1176J5JB]. Always seek immediate care for **febrile seizures** [^1176J5JB], **stiff neck** [^1176J5JB], **rash** [^notfound], or **temperature ≥ 40.0°C (104°F)** [^111LhjAX].

## Age-specific fever thresholds and recommendations

| **Age group** | **Fever threshold** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Neonates (0–28 days) | ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) | Immediate emergency evaluation [^115wo3tK] |
| Infants (29–90 days) | ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) | Urgent medical evaluation within 24 hours [^115jSzgZ] |
| Children (> 3 months) | ≥ 39.0°C (102.2°F) | Medical evaluation within 24–48 hours [^notfound] |
| Any age | ≥ 40.0°C (104°F) | Immediate medical evaluation [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms warranting immediate medical attention

Regardless of temperature, seek immediate medical attention if any of the following are present:

- **Lethargy or difficulty waking**: Persistent drowsiness, difficulty waking, or unresponsiveness [^1176J5JB].
- **Difficulty breathing**: Rapid breathing, grunting, nasal flaring, or signs of respiratory distress [^111Cj1we].
- **Dehydration**: Dry mouth, decreased urine output, sunken eyes, or poor skin turgor [^notfound].
- **Persistent vomiting or inability to keep fluids down**: Risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance [^notfound].
- **Rash**: Especially if rapidly spreading, purplish, or accompanied by other symptoms [^notfound].
- **Seizures**: Febrile seizures or any seizure activity [^1176J5JB].
- **Stiff neck or severe headache**: Potential signs of meningitis or other serious infections [^1176J5JB].
- **Altered consciousness**: Confusion, irritability, or unusual behavior [^notfound].

---

## Duration of fever and its significance

The duration of fever also guides evaluation: **1–3 days** is common with viral infections and is managed with supportive care if the child appears well [^111yfqeo]; **4–5 days** warrants medical evaluation to rule out bacterial infections or other causes [^113NNs1J]; and **> 5 days** requires medical evaluation to assess for serious bacterial infection, pneumonia, or other underlying conditions [^113NNs1J].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised children**: Lower threshold for medical evaluation due to increased risk of serious infections [^113NNs1J].
- **Recent vaccinations**: Fever within 48 hours of vaccination is common but still warrants evaluation if the child appears ill or the fever persists [^114787Zu].
- **Underlying chronic conditions**: Children with chronic illnesses may require earlier medical evaluation [^111yfqeo].

---

## Parental guidance and home management

Parents should monitor temperature with a **rectal thermometer** for infants and an oral or tympanic thermometer for older children [^111AjGpX]. Provide antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) per dosing guidelines and ensure adequate hydration [^notfound]. Seek medical attention if the child deteriorates or new symptoms develop [^113NNs1J].

---

A pediatric fever of **≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)** warrants medical evaluation, with urgency determined by age, clinical appearance, and duration. Immediate care is required for neonates, ill-appearing children, or those with concerning symptoms, while older children with brief, mild fevers and a well appearance may be observed at home with clear return precautions.

Acute management of childhood AIS — temperature control highlights that pyrexia is associated with adverse outcomes in adult stroke but pediatric effects are uncertain; an adult multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of patients with temperatures ranging from 36°C to 39°C failed to show any difference with acetaminophen versus placebo, though post hoc analysis demonstrated a difference in expected modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months, and in a pediatric retrospective analysis fever had no influence on outcome although present acutely in 38% of subjects; given limited pediatric data, it is reasonable to follow AHA/ASA adult stroke guidelines when treating fever in children.

### Not too sick, not too well: reducing the diagnostic void in pediatric emergency medicine [^116kEQa1]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Take for example young Anya (case study: Part A)

Anya is 18 months old. She has had a cold for a couple of days. This morning her mother finds her to be pale, clingy, and not her usual self. She vomited once, and now refuses food. Anya is brought to the emergency department.

She is seen on arrival and noted to be flushed and quiet. She is aware of her surroundings and reaches for objects. She has a raised respiratory rate (42 breaths per minute) and a high heart rate (165 beats per minute). There is no rash but her hands and feet feel cold. Her temperature is 40.1 degrees centigrade. She had spat out the acetaminophen (paracetamol) her mother had tried to give her in the morning.

What now? Does Anya need to be prioritized, or is she safe to wait? Is Anya going to require investigations or admission?

Given that febrile illness is the second most common presentation to Emergency Departments (after breathing difficulty) it is easy to see why this type of case poses a challenge. Fever in the young child can markedly affect their appearance, a cardinal feature in the initial assessment of children. Compounding the initial assessment are the parent or caregiver's preconceived notions of the significance of fever. On the one hand, clinicians aim to ally with parents to take their concerns seriously. On the other hand, the dissonance between perception of illness and safety risk of fever in children between parents and clinicians is often marked.

In the presented scenario, historically, protocols would flag this child is at risk of sepsis. The clinician may elect to observe or even undertake initial investigations. If parental concern was strong and the treating clinician felt that Anya's overall appearance was not in keeping with a virus they may also elect to treat with antibiotics awaiting the results of various cultures. Regardless of the path chosen, the clinician wrestles with a feared retrospective criticism if the child were to return more unwell with a confirmed bacterial illness.

### Pediatric fever [^1124saku]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fever is a common complaint in children. The most common cause is self-limited viral infection. However, neonates and young infants are evaluated and treated differently than older, vaccinated, and clinically evaluable children. Neonates should be admitted to the hospital, young infants in the second month of life may be risk stratified, and those deemed low risk on testing may be sent home with close follow-up. Children older than 2 months may be evaluated clinically for signs of bacterial infection that require intervention. Urinary tract infections cause more than 90% of serious bacterial illness in children, and younger children have a higher incidence of infection.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^1141U4fh]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels — strength of recommendations regarding each critical question is based on evidence grading, expert opinion, and consensus, with Level A recommendations reflecting a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies), Level B recommendations identifying strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies), and Level C recommendations based on Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, expert consensus, with "consensus" placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation; recommendations may be downgraded because of heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, and publication bias, and, when possible, clinically oriented statistics such as likelihood ratios (LRs) and number needed to treat are presented.

Regarding medical management for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to setting of care, AAP 2021 guidelines recommend to manage well-appearing febrile infants 29–60 days of age at home if all of the following are met:

- CSF analysis, if obtained, is normal

- urinalysis is negative

- all obtained inflammatory markers are normal

- appropriate parental education is provided

- follow-up plans for reevaluation in 24 hours are developed and in place

- plans are developed and in place in case of change in clinical status, including means of communication between family and providers and access to emergency medical care.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^113hEeEt]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that US pediatricians are more concerned about general fever than fever following vaccination. Management and definitions of fever severity by pediatricians in our sample depend on infant age. Recommendations for managing fever were dependent on the fever level, infant age, timing in relation to vaccination, and the time of day fever was reported. These results may be valuable when developing fever management guidelines and when estimating the burden of managing fever in the US.

### Approach to the febrile infant [^115aTAZK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Evaluation and management of the febrile infant has long been an area of variability. Recent guidelines were released by the American Academy of Pediatrics in August 2021 to help provide evidence-based clinical guidelines to decrease variability and improve outcomes.1 These guidelines largely focus on management and treatment guidelines for 3 age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. The inclusion criteria for these guidelines are previously healthy, term infants born at 37 weeks gestation or later, with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. The most significant changes to historical practice are in the 22- to 28-day and 29- to 60-day age groups. If initial laboratory work is reassuring, patients may not need cerebrospinal fluid studies, and patients may be monitored at home or at the hospital using shared decision-making with the family.

### Consent for emergency medical services for children and adolescents [^116srqdA]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients frequently seek medical treatment in the emergency department (ED) unaccompanied by a legal guardian. Current state and federal laws and medical ethics recommendations support the ED treatment of minors with an identified emergency medical condition, regardless of consent issues. Financial reimbursement should not limit the minor patient's access to emergency medical care or result in a breach of patient confidentiality. Every clinic, office practice, and ED should develop policies and guidelines regarding consent for the treatment of minors. The physician should document all discussions of consent and attempt to seek consent for treatment from the family or legal guardian and assent from the pediatric patient. Appropriate medical care for the pediatric patient with an urgent or emergent condition should never be withheld or delayed because of problems with obtaining consent. This statement has been endorsed by the American College of Surgeons, the Society of Pediatric Nurses, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Emergency Nurses Association, and the National Association of EMS Physicians.

As a relatively new field, there has been a recent explosion in evidence around the management of children in the emergency department (ED). This review highlights 10 articles published in the last year providing evidence that is germane to the care of children by emergency medicine (EM) physicians. There is a focus on high prevalence conditions, such as fever and trauma, as well as interventions that can improve mortality, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and massive transfusion.

### Risk stratification and management of the febrile young child [^114RNqCM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Febrile young children present frequently to the emergency department. While most febrile children recover uneventfully, certain subgroups are at higher risk of serious infection. Febrile neonates require extensive diagnostic testing, antibiotic therapy, and hospital admission. Diagnostic testing can be utilized in older patients to identify children at low risk and high risk for serious infection. This information may assist in determining the treatment and disposition of these febrile children.

### A comparison of temperature thresholds to begin laboratory evaluation of well-appearing febrile infants [^111GcNov]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Young infants who develop fever are at an increased risk for serious infection. It is unclear, however, what temperature cutoff would be optimal to begin evaluating these infants because some criteria use different thresholds. We sought to determine the percentage of infants presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with a temperature less than 38.2°C who develop serious infection compared with those with higher temperatures.

Methods

We used a publicly available dataset from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network. Patients were included if they were aged 60 days or younger, had a documented rectal temperature of 38.0°C or higher in the ED or a history of fever within 24 hours before presentation to the ED, and were being evaluated for serious infection. We used the same exclusion criteria as the original Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network study but further excluded those who were ill-appearing (Yale Observation Score > 10). Serious infections included any of the following: urinary tract infection, bacteremia, bacterial or herpes meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, or bacterial enteritis. Data were described using frequencies (percentages) and compared between groups using χ² test.

Results

Of the 4619 eligible infants, 1311 (28.4%) had a temperature lower than 38.2°C. Infants with temperatures lower than 38.2°C were significantly less likely to have a serious infection compared with those with higher temperatures (97 [7.5%] vs 365 [11.2%], P < 0.001). Of the infants with temperatures lower than 38.2°C who were tested, 67 (5.8%) had a urinary tract infection, 10 (0.8%) had bacteremia, 3 (0.4%) had bacterial meningitis, 3 (2.9%) had herpes meningitis, 17 (4.5%) had bacterial pneumonia, and 2 (4.8%) had bacterial enteritis.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that infants with temperatures lower than 38.2°C were significantly less likely to have a serious infection than those with higher temperatures. Using an evaluation cutoff of 38.2°C, however, would likely miss a clinically important number of well-appearing infants with serious infections.

### Fever without source in children 0 to 36 months of age [^115iuAar]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Although fever in the young child (0–36 months) is a common clinical problem, the evaluation and treatment of febrile children remain controversial. Furthermore, universal vaccination with the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has changed the epidemiology of invasive bacterial disease in young children. This article addresses the approach to febrile neonates (0–28 days old), young infants (1–3 months old), and older infants and toddlers (3–36 months old) in the PCV7 era.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^111nS9De]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Eye Disorders

Instruct patients taking EPRONTIA to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision, visual disturbances, or periorbital pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Oligohidrosis and Hyperthermia

Closely monitor EPRONTIA treated patients, especially pediatric patients, for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Counsel patients to contact their healthcare professionals immediately if they develop a high or persistent fever, or decreased sweating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Metabolic Acidosis

Warn patients about the potential significant risk for metabolic acidosis that may be asymptomatic and may be associated with adverse effects on kidneys (e.g., kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis), bones (e.g., osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and/or rickets in children), and growth (e.g., growth delay/retardation) in pediatric patients, and on the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including EPRONTIA, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, and advise of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, or behavior or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct patients to immediately report behaviors of concern to their healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Evaluation and management of the febrile young infant [^111M6e4J]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Fever (≥ 38°C) in young infants (< 90 days of age) represents a common clinical challenge for pediatricians in both outpatient and inpatient settings. While the majority of febrile infants will ultimately be determined to have no serious infection, serious infections when present can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Since the evaluation and empiric treatment of presumptive serious infection has associated risks (e.g. medication side effects, stress/disruption of hospitalization, nosocomial infection, etc.) as well as substantial costs, attempts have been made to clearly define an accurate method that enables clinicians to correctly stratify which infants are at relatively low risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI) and may therefore be safely managed less aggressively. Although this topic has been extensively studied and discussed, no single protocol has been universally adopted and clinical practices continue to vary. This paper discusses multiple distinct protocols currently in use, as well as the evidence upon which they are based and the points on which the evidence is not yet definitive.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: the approach to the febrile child [^113NNs1J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Febrile children presenting to the emergency department pose unique challenges. This article highlights the importance of identifying children at particular risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI) using risk factors, red flags and appropriate investigations. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the risk factors for SBI in febrile children, including young age, ill-appearing children and those with complex comorbidities or immunodeficiency. The presence of red flags in febrile children should immediately alert concern and prompt senior clinician review. This article also discusses the appropriate use of investigations and their role in complementing clinical assessment. When discharging children home after emergency department assessment, safety netting should be undertaken to ensure parents are aware when to seek further medical opinion. The presence of a prolonged fever of 5 days or longer should alert suspicion and usually requires further investigation.

### Barriers to translating diagnostic research in febrile children to clinical practice: a systematic review [^111KMTM1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the topic of identifying febrile children at risk of serious infections has been addressed by numerous research groups, identified predictors remain diverse and implementation of results in routine practice has been limited. The aim of this paper is to discuss the problems and challenges in advancing diagnostic research in febrile children.

Methods

The characteristics and results of 35 studies identified from a systematic review on predictors for febrile children were evaluated.

Results

Current diagnostic research is mainly performed in subpopulations, defined by age and temperature limits and in paediatric emergency settings, ignoring the role of primary care. It is characterised by a dichotomous approach of outcomes and a wide variability of potential predictors. Validation of results to other settings and impact studies of prediction rules on patient outcomes are scarce. In designing diagnostic studies on children suspected of serious infections focus is needed on all clinically relevant populations within the spectrum of primary care and emergency department settings. Consensus is also needed on the definition of fever, the concept of serious infection and the set of predictors to focus on. The heterogeneity of patients in different settings and countries stress the need for continuous updating of prediction rules in routine practice. Broad validation in different clinical settings and countries and impact analysis in routine care is essential.

Conclusions

Scientists in the field of diagnosis of serious infection in children must agree on core design features to be incorporated in all studies in the area of diagnostic research in febrile children. This will improve evidence from future studies, and their generalisability and implementation in routine practice.

### Predictors of disease severity in children presenting from the community with febrile illnesses: a systematic review of prognostic studies [^117E8mX3]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The major limitation of our work arises from the heterogeneity of studies, which precludes comparison of effect estimates. Second, it is difficult to determine if studies included children presenting to first-line health workers. We did not exclude studies solely based on the designated 'level' of a health facility: concerned parents in all settings use primary, secondary and tertiary care facilities as their first point-of-access. Third, most studies included only hospitalised children. This is a major barrier to understanding the potential for prognostic factors and prediction models to guide referral or admission decisions. Follow-up of children assessed as 'low-risk' (ie, those managed in the community) must be a priority for future studies seeking to determine the validity of prognostic factors and prediction models in outpatient settings. Fourth, in line with other reviews we found most studies to be of low quality. Recent guidance may help address this. Finally, we framed the review around 'febrile illness', rather than, for example, 'clinically-suspected infection'. Our rationale was to ensure the findings were as relevant as possible for lesser-trained community health workers in resource-constrained settings, for whom a presumptive diagnosis of suspected infection can be challenging. Febrile illness is an accepted 'pragmatic point-of-entry' in these settings, however, we acknowledge that some children (particularly younger infants) may not mount a fever in response to serious infection. Therefore, despite our deliberately broad definition of febrile illness (documented abnormal temperature and history of fever), and the inclusion of studies of children with 'suspected sepsis', relevant studies may have been missed. Of note, in view of a suggestion arising during the peer-review process we also performed a second MEDLINE search, using alternate search strings, which did not yield any additional eligible articles (online supplemental appendix S7).

### Fever-child care and schools… [^116S8ot2]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Fever is an elevation of the normal body temperature. Fever is most commonly caused by the body's response to a viral or bacterial infection, but it can have causes other than infection, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, a reaction to a vaccine or medication, or cancer. For infants and children older than 2 months, a body temperature above 101 °F from any site is considered meaningfully elevated above normal. For infants younger than 2 months, a body temperature above 100. 4 °F is considered meaningfully elevated above normal. These temperature elevations are not necessarily an indication of a significant health problem. Children's temperatures may be elevated for a variety of reasons, most of which do not indicate serious illness. Only if Yes, when all the following criteria are met: When exclusion criteria are resolved, the child is able to participate, and staff.

### Lack of accuracy of body temperature for detecting serious bacterial infection in febrile episodes [^115FMWv3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Body temperature is a time-honored marker of serious bacterial infection, but there are few studies of its test performance. The aim of our study was to determine the accuracy of temperature measured on presentation to medical care for detecting serious bacterial infection.

Methods

Febrile children 0–5 years of age presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric hospital were sampled consecutively. The accuracy of the axillary temperature measured at presentation was evaluated using logistic regression models to generate receiver operating characteristic curves. Reference standard tests for serious bacterial infection were standard microbiologic/radiologic tests and clinical follow-up. Age, clinicians' impression of appearance of the child (well versus unwell) and duration of illness were assessed as possible effect modifiers.

Results

Of 15,781 illness episodes 1120 (7.1%) had serious bacterial infection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for temperature was 0.60 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.58–0.62]. A threshold of ≥ 38°C had a sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64–0.70), specificity of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.44–0.46), positive likelihood ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.2–1.3) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.7–0.8). Age and illness duration had a small but significant effect on the accuracy of temperature increasing its "rule-in" potential.

Conclusion

Measured temperature at presentation to hospital is not an accurate marker of serious bacterial infection in febrile children. Younger age and longer duration of illness increase the rule-in potential of temperature but without substantial overall change in its test accuracy.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^114uuM19]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Eye Disorders

Instruct patients taking TOPAMAX to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision, visual disturbances, or periorbital pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Oligohidrosis and Hyperthermia

Closely monitor TOPAMAX-treated patients, especially pediatric patients, for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Counsel patients to contact their healthcare professionals immediately if they develop a high or persistent fever, or decreased sweating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Metabolic Acidosis

Warn patients about the potential significant risk for metabolic acidosis that may be asymptomatic and may be associated with adverse effects on kidneys (e.g., kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis), bones (e.g., osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and/or rickets in children), and growth (e.g., growth delay/retardation) in pediatric patients, and on the fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including TOPAMAX, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, and advise of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, or behavior or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct patients to immediately report behaviors of concern to their healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^113iCgjM]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) and metabolic effects — There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the use of TTM to change measures of cerebral or systemic metabolic demand in pediatric patients, and none of the studies investigated the impact markers of metabolic demand had upon outcome measures, resulting in insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the modulation of metabolic response via TTM to improve measures of outcome such as length of stay, morbidity, or mortality. Clinicians should be aware of the impact that TTM may have upon metabolism and substrate utilization, and metabolic support should be driven by the disease state and actual measurement of metabolism.

### ACR appropriateness criteria fever without source or unknown origin-child [^113NWVeq]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The cause of fever in a child can often be determined from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; infections account for the majority of cases. Yet in 20%, no apparent cause can be found, designated as fever without source (FWS). The yield of chest radiography in children with FWS is low, and it is usually not appropriate. However, in children with respiratory signs, high fever (> 39°C), or marked leukocytosis (≥ 20,000/mm³), chest radiography is usually appropriate, as it has a higher yield in detecting clinically occult pneumonia. In newborns with FWS, there is higher risk for serious bacterial infection, and the routine use of chest radiography is controversial. In children with neutropenia, fever is a major concern. In some clinical circumstances, such as after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chest CT scan may be appropriate even if the results of chest radiography are negative or nonspecific, as it has higher sensitivity and can demonstrate specific findings (such as lung nodule and "halo sign") that can guide management. In a child with prolonged fever of unknown origin despite extensive medical workup (fever of unknown origin), diagnosis is usually dependent on clinical and laboratory studies, and imaging tests have low yield. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Fever in the pediatric patient [^116rDVDj]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, and immune status as well as the results of a careful physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

### Permissive versus restrictive temperature thresholds in critically ill children with fever and infection: a multicentre randomized clinical pilot trial [^113D2PeB]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever improves pathogen control at a significant metabolic cost. No randomized clinical trials (RCT) have compared fever treatment thresholds in critically ill children. We performed a pilot RCT to determine whether a definitive trial of a permissive approach to fever in comparison to current restrictive practice is feasible in critically ill children with suspected infection.

Methods

An open, parallel-group pilot RCT with embedded mixed methods perspectives study in four UK paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and associated retrieval services.

Participants were emergency PICU admissions aged > 28 days to < 16 years receiving respiratory support and supplemental oxygen.

Subjects were randomly assigned to permissive (antipyretic interventions only at ≥ 39.5 °C) or restrictive groups (antipyretic interventions at ≥ 37.5 °C) whilst on respiratory support. Parents were invited to complete a questionnaire or take part in an interview. Focus groups were conducted with staff at each unit. Outcomes were measures of feasibility: recruitment rate, protocol adherence and acceptability, between group separation of temperature and safety.

Results

One hundred thirty-eight children met eligibility criteria of whom 100 (72%) were randomized (11.1 patients per month per site) without prior consent (RWPC). Consent to continue in the trial was obtained in 87 cases (87%). The mean maximum temperature (95% confidence interval) over the first 48 h was 38.4 °C (38.2–38.6) in the restrictive group and 38.8 °C (38.6–39.1) in the permissive group, a mean difference of 0.5 °C (0.2–0.8). Protocol deviations were observed in 6.8% (99/1438) of 6-h time periods and largely related to patient comfort in the recovery phase. Length of stay, duration of organ support and mortality were similar between groups. No pre-specified serious adverse events occurred. Staff (n = 48) and parents (n = 60) were supportive of the trial, including RWPC. Suggestions were made to only include invasively ventilated children for the duration of intubation.

Conclusion

Uncertainty around the optimal fever threshold for antipyretic intervention is relevant to many emergency PICU admissions. A more permissive approach was associated with a modest increase in mean maximum temperature. A definitive trial should focus on the most seriously ill cases in whom antipyretics are rarely used for their analgesic effects alone.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^116ayG7Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Respondents' Perception of Seriousness of Fever

Pediatricians' categorization of fever is shown in Figure 1. On average, across the three age groups (0–2 months, 2–4 months, and 4–6 months), respondents indicated that they considered temperatures between 37.8–38.1°C to be mild, those between 38.3–38.7°C to be moderate, those between 38.8–39.5°C to be serious, and those between 39.5–40.3°C to be extremely serious. The temperature at which fevers were considered to be more serious increased with infant age. For example, a fever of 39.5 ± 0.9°C (mean ± S.D) was considered to be extremely serious for infants 0–2 months of age, while a fever of 40.3 ± 0.6°C (mean ± S.D) was considered extremely serious for infants 4–6 months of age. For a given category of fever, respondents consistently indentified a lower mean temperature for the younger age ranges, but the differences were not statistically significant for any of the categories.

### Fever after immunization: current concepts and improved future scientific understanding [^11413Fx5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Fever is a common clinical complaint in adults and children with a variety of infectious illnesses, as well as a frequently reported adverse event following immunization. Although the level of measured temperature indicative of a "fever" was first defined in 1868, it remains unclear what role fever has as a physiologic reaction to invading substances, how best to measure body temperature and compare measurements from different body sites, and, consequently, how to interpret fever data derived from vaccine safety trials or immunization safety surveillance. However, even with many aspects of the societal, medical, economic, and epidemiologic meanings of fever as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) still elusive, it is a generally benign — albeit common — clinical sign. By standardizing the definition and means of assessment of fever in vaccine safety studies, thereby permitting comparability of data, we hope to arrive at an improved understanding of its importance as an AEFI.

### Heat-related illness trends at a pediatric health care system, 2012 to 2023 [^111YyE58]. Academic Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

As extreme summer temperatures become more frequent due to a changing climate, there is an increased risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children. We aimed to examine trends in heat-related illness over time and describe differences in patient characteristics and outcomes for children with "heat-specific" diagnoses compared to rhabdomyolysis, a severe form of heat-related illness. We conducted a retrospective study at a pediatric health care system with two large children's hospitals to identify Emergency Department encounters with a heat-related ED diagnosis from May-September from 2012 to 2023. Aggregate heat-related illness encounters, as a proportion of total ED encounters, increased 170% from 2012 (4.3 per 10,000) to 2023 (11.6 per 10,000) (p = 0.01). Summer months with higher peak temperatures had higher heat-related ED volume (R² = 0.44, p < 0.001). Most heat-specific encounters resulted in ED discharge (96%), while most rhabdomyolysis encounters resulted in admission (63%). We found that ED volume for heat-related illness is associated with higher temperature and is increasing over time. Heat-specific diagnoses are more common than rhabdomyolysis. Given the rise in healthcare utilization from heat-related illness, it is essential for all pediatricians to understand the health implications of our changing climate.

### Targeted temperature management in pediatric neurocritical care [^115WTjxR]. Pediatric Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Targeted temperature management encompasses a range of clinical interventions to regulate systemic temperature, and includes both induction of varying degrees of hypothermia and fever prevention ("targeted normothermia"). Targeted temperature management plays a key role in the contemporary management of critically ill neonates and children with acute brain injury. Yet, many unanswered questions remain regarding optimal temperature management in pediatric neurocritical care. The introduction highlights experimental studies that have evaluated the neuroprotective efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia and explored possible mechanisms of action in several brain injury models. The next section focuses on three major clinical conditions in which therapeutic hypothermia has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in pediatric populations: neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, postcardiac arrest encephalopathy, and traumatic brain injury. Clinical implications of targeted temperature management in pediatric neurocritical care are also discussed. The final section examines some of the factors that may underlie the limited neuroprotective efficacy of hypothermia that has been observed in several major pediatric clinical trials, and outlines important directions for future research.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^114aTYCM]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

### Current evidence on the care of young infants with hypothermia in the emergency department [^117QeSkH]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The presence of hypothermia among young infants in the emergency department may be a sign of serious or invasive bacterial infections, or invasive herpes simplex viral infection. However, hypothermia may also occur due to a variety of other infectious and noninfectious conditions or environmental exposure. In some settings, hypothermia may represent a protective, energy-conserving response to illness. Recent efforts have enhanced our understanding of the prevalence of serious infections among infants with hypothermia, although challenges remain due to lack of standardized definitions and comprehensive guidelines. There exists extensive variation in the care of young infants with hypothermia. Risk factors for serious bacterial infections in infants with hypothermia, as identified in single-center and multicenter retrospective studies, include lower temperatures, older age, and abnormalities in blood and urine testing. Given the absence of clear guidelines, management of infants with hypothermia relies heavily on clinician judgment and shared decision making, guided by individual patient assessments and risk factors. This review article summarizes existing evidence and identifies gaps in the management of infants (< 90 days) with hypothermia in the emergency department.

### Evaluation and management of young febrile infants: an overview of the new AAP guideline [^116RoBua]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics released a clinical practice guideline for the management of febrile infants in August 2021 to compile nearly 40 years of research into a cohesive text that would provide a framework for the clinician in safely managing these patients in a variety of settings. (1) This guideline incorporates shared decision-making with the caregiver to guide treatment when appropriate and provides algorithms for 3 age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. This guideline applies to previously healthy, well-appearing infants born at 37 weeks' gestation or later who have a temperature of at least 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C) in the previous 24 hours at home or in a clinical setting. Infants younger than 8 days and those with diagnosed focal infections are excluded. The highlighted changes to historical practice are in the 2 older age groups. In 22- to 28-day-old infants, if initial laboratory work is normal, shared decision-making is used to direct lumbar puncture and hospital admission with the possibility of monitoring the patient at home or in the hospital. In 29- to 60-day-old infants, admission to the hospital is indicated only if laboratory evaluation is concerning for meningitis or based on clinician judgment. The occurrence of invasive bacterial infection in a febrile infant with a positive viral test is still not well-measured, as broad viral panels are more recently developed technology. As this research evolves and expected advancements in early detection of infectious organisms and biomarkers occur, this new information will need to be incorporated into the existing evidence.

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^113cpRnb]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric and adult brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) — introduction and scope states that determination that a patient meets neurologic criteria for death is a medical responsibility that leads to a legal declaration and notes that the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) stipulated that determination of BD/DNC must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards. The guideline clarifies the brain death determination process and integrates guidance for adults and children into a single guideline, with updates addressing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), targeted temperature management, and primary infratentorial injury. Prior accepted standards (2010 adult and 2011 pediatric) stipulated that BD/DNC should be declared when a patient with a known cause of catastrophic brain injury has permanent loss of function of the entire brain, including the brainstem, resulting in (1) coma, (2) brainstem areflexia, and (3) apnea in the setting of an adequate stimulus.

### Fever phobia revisited: have parental misconceptions about fever changed in 20 years? [^11455mSB]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Fever is one of the most common reasons that parents seek medical attention for their children. Parental concerns arise in part because of the belief that fever is a disease rather than a symptom or sign of illness. Twenty years ago, Barton Schmitt, MD, found that parents had numerous misconceptions about fever. These unrealistic concerns were termed "fever phobia". More recent concerns for occult bacteremia in febrile children have led to more aggressive laboratory testing and treatment. Our objectives for this study were to explore current parental attitudes toward fever, to compare these attitudes with those described by Schmitt in 1980, and to determine whether recent, more aggressive laboratory testing and presumptive treatment for occult bacteremia is associated with increased parental concern regarding fever.

Methods

Between June and September 1999, a single research assistant administered a cross-sectional 29-item questionnaire to caregivers whose children were enrolled in 2 urban hospital-based pediatric clinics in Baltimore, Maryland. The questionnaire was administered before either health maintenance or acute care visits at both sites. Portions of the questionnaire were modeled after Schmitt's and elicited information about definition of fever, concerns about fever, and fever management. Additional information included home fever reduction techniques, frequency of temperature monitoring, and parental recall of past laboratory workup and treatment that these children had received during health care visits for fever.

Results

A total of 340 caregivers were interviewed. Fifty-six percent of caregivers were very worried about the potential harm of fever in their children, 44% considered a temperature of 38.9 degrees C (102 degrees F) to be a "high" fever, and 7% thought that a temperature could rise to ≥ 43.4 degrees C (≥ 110 degrees F) if left untreated. Ninety-one percent of caregivers believed that a fever could cause harmful effects; 21% listed brain damage, and 14% listed death. Strikingly, 52% of caregivers said that they would check their child's temperature ≤ 1 hour when their child had a fever, 25% gave antipyretics for temperatures < 37.8 degrees C (< 100 degrees F), and 85% would awaken their child to give antipyretics. Fourteen percent of caregivers gave acetaminophen, and 44% gave ibuprofen at too frequent dosing intervals. Of the 73% of caregivers who said that they sponged their child to treat a fever, 24% sponged at temperatures ≤ 37.8 degrees C (≤ 100 degrees F); 18% used alcohol. Forty-six percent of caregivers listed doctors as their primary resource for information about fever. Caregivers who stated that they were very worried about fever were more likely in the past to have had a child who was evaluated for a fever, to have had blood work performed on their child during a febrile illness, and to have perceived their doctors to be very worried about fever. Compared with 20 years ago, more caregivers listed seizure as a potential harm of fever, woke their children and checked temperatures more often during febrile illnesses, and gave antipyretics or initiated sponging more frequently for possible normal temperatures.

Conclusions

Fever phobia persists. Pediatric health care providers have a unique opportunity to make an impact on parental understanding of fever and its role in illness. Future studies are needed to evaluate educational interventions and to identify the types of medical care practices that foster fever phobia.fever, fever phobia, child, children, antipyretics, sponging, health care practices.

### Effect of rapid respiratory virus testing on antibiotic prescribing among children presenting to the emergency department with acute respiratory illness: a randomized clinical trial [^114AB8Tt]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

We conducted a single-center, randomized clinical trial (Randomized Clinical Trial Assessing Point-of-Care Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Diagnostics [RAPID]) of children aged 1 month to 18 years evaluated in a large pediatric ED from December 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019. Data analysis was performed from March 23, 2020, to April 2, 2021. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. The Children's Hospital Colorado health system serves a 7-state region and comprises a primary academic ED, 2 community-based satellite EDs, and 3 urgent care facilities, evaluating approximately 170 000 children each year. Children with influenzalike illness (ILI) presenting to the primary academic ED were eligible for study participation. To minimize ascertainment bias, the research staff approached children and families for participation as soon as they were roomed in the ED, before clinical evaluation. We defined ILI as a temperature greater than or equal to 37.8 °C and at least 1 of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion for children aged 12 months to 18 years. For children aged 1 month to less than 1 year, we defined ILI as temperature greater than 37.8 °C or at least 1 of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion. Children were included in the study if they were triage level 3 (stable, should be seen by a clinician within 30 minutes), 4 (stable, may be seen nonurgently by a clinician, requires minimal testing), or 5 (stable, may be seen nonurgently by a physician, requires no testing) based on the Emergency Severity Index to identify a population that would likely be evaluated at an urgent care facility. Children were excluded if they had experienced respiratory symptoms longer than 14 days, were seen in nurse-only visits, or had enrolled in this study within the previous 14 days. The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutions Review Board. All participants' parents or legal guardians provided written informed consent, and children gave assent if aged 7 years or older and were not cognitively impaired. We provided financial incentives after all study procedures during the initial visit ($20) and following completion of a 10-day survey ($10). A waiver of consent was obtained for clinician surveys because these data were deidentified. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials.

### Should blood cultures be obtained in all infants 3 to 36 months presenting with significant fever? [^111h9nV5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Fever without source (FWS) in children 3–36 months is a common presenting complaint. Because of changes in immunization practices and their effects on rates of bacteremia, older guidelines may no longer be applicable. We reviewed the literature regarding the necessity of obtaining a blood culture in non-toxic children in this age group with FWS.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search on the topic of bacteremia in febrile children 3–36 months from 2004-present.

Results

Eight studies were included. Although the studies varied in terms of approach and analysis, all suggested a rate of bacteremia in a non-toxic, febrile child 3–36 months of age to be less than 1%.

Conclusions

Strong consideration should be given for foregoing blood culture in a non-toxic child 3–36 months of age with FWS.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^111LhjAX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Serious bacterial infection (SBI) epidemiology in febrile infants and children: Fever accounts for 15% of all emergency department (ED) visits in a given year for patients younger than 15 years, yet in a study of more than 3,000 febrile infants only 58% of those with bacteremia or bacterial meningitis appeared clinically ill; in the pneumococcal vaccine era, the risk of SBI by age has been reported as 13% in neonates (aged 3 to 28 days), 9% in infants aged 29 to 56 days, and 7% in infants aged 90 days or younger; additionally, in otherwise well-appearing febrile infants or children aged 3 months to 36 months the risk of a positive blood culture result was approximately 12% with a fever (≥ 40°C [104°F]).

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^117Ppu7L]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A fever is an increase in the body's temperature above normal. This study examined how US pediatricians perceive and manage fever generally versus fever occurring after vaccination in infants up to six months of age.

Methods

A web-based survey of 400 US pediatricians subscribing to the Physician Desk Reference was conducted in December 2008. Data were collected on the respondents' socio-demographics, number of years in practice, type of practice, their definition of fever severity in infants, and their recommendations for managing fever. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate the odds of a pediatrician recommending an emergency room visit (ER) or a hospital admission, office visits, or other treatment option, as a function of infant's age, temperature, whether the infant has recently received a vaccine, and whether the fever was reported during or after office hours, adjusting for practice type and socio-demographic variables.

Results

On average, the 400 responding pediatricians' (64% were female, average age of 49 years, years in practice = 20 years) threshold for extremely serious fever was ≥ 39.5°C and ≥ 40.0°C for infants 0–2 month and > 2–6 month of age respectively. Infants were more likely to be referred to an ER or hospital admission if they were ≤ 2 months of age (Odds Ratio [OR], 29.13; 95% Confidence interval [95% CI], 23.69–35.82) or > 2–4 months old (OR 3.37; 95% CI 2.99–3.81) versus > 4 to 6 months old or if they had a temperature ≥ 40.0°C (OR 21.06; 95% CI 17.20–25.79) versus a temperature of 38.0–38.5°C. Fever after vaccination (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.25–0.33) or reported during office hours (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.15–0.20) were less likely to result in referral to ER or hospital admission.

Conclusion

Within this sample of US pediatricians, perception of the severity of fever in infants, as well as the response to infant fever are likely to depend on the infant's age. Recommendations for the management of fever in infants are likely to depend on fever severity level, the infant age, timing in relation to recent vaccination, and the time of day fever is reported. Our results indicate that US pediatricians are more concerned about general fever than fever following vaccination.

### Infant fever-AAP… [^1131wQRf]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Nearly two decades in the making, the American Academy of Pediatrics has published the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Well-Appearing Febrile Infants 8–60 Days Old. Infant Fever Overview. About 14 out of every 1, 000 healthy infants born full term develop a fever during the ages 8 days to 60 days old. While most fevers do not lead to severe illness, it can be challenging to immediately identify the cause of a baby's fever while avoiding unnecessary tests or hospitalizations. More than 10% of febrile infants are diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. The likelihood of a more invasive bacterial infection is much lower, with fewer than. 05% of infants developing meningitis, the most serious infection. Some other infections in young infants include pneumonia, sepsis and gastroenteritis.

AAP Recommendations In its clinical practice guideline, AAP addresses many questions raised in evaluating otherwise well-appearing infants between 8–60 days old who develop a fever at or above 100. 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on a comprehensive review of evidence, recommendations are provided for 3 age groups: 8–21 days, 22–28 days, and 29–60 days of age. For each age grouping, seven key action statements are provided: four deal with evaluation, one with initial treatment and two with further management. The guidelines provide a decision-making algorithm for each age group. Evaluation and Management of Well-Appearing Febrile Infants 8–60 Days Old.

### Not too sick, not too well: reducing the diagnostic void in pediatric emergency medicine [^11639Suo]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Do we need a change of focus in spotting the unwell child?

There is no standardized definition of wellness available to health care professionals. To recognise the well child requires training, time, and thought. Parental descriptions and use of terminology concerning the child's condition may not match that of the clinician. Age, duration of symptoms, and access to care outside of the emergency department all influence how quick an emergency physician may be to deem a child "well" (read: safe for discharge home). From a systems lens, emergency departments could not function if every child with normal vital signs and common, benign, self-limiting condition received an in-depth invasive investigation. From an interpersonal lens, there may be a dissonance between the wellness that the emergency physician sees and the miserable symptomatology the parent experiences. Common scenarios include presentations for fever, cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, or refusal to eat.

The effect of fever in particular on decision making is complex. Fever is a common feature of uncomplicated low risk illness and is non-specific. Due to a weak association between higher fever and serious bacterial infection many guidelines include a fever threshold as a discriminating feature in decision making. Unfortunately fever is too non-specific to have any clinical usefulness, regardless of its degree. In practice fever does influence the decision-making process due to the features commonly associated with a raised temperature: typically tachycardia and altered peripheral perfusion, alongside a reduced activity level and changes in behaviour. While fever itself is non-specific the overall appearance and behaviour of a child that is febrile at the time of assessment is often one that impairs the decision making of the clinician. For this reason well timed analgesia can be an extremely effective strategy in the emergency department, allowing a clinician to see a child who had a high fever an hour ago with all the associated features of sepsis yet now looks and behaves like a well child.

### Comparison of pediatric and general emergency medicine practice patterns in infants with fever [^112QFpJo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate and compare the management approaches of pediatric and general emergency medicine physicians in infants presenting to the emergency department (ED) with complaint of fever.

Methods

Infants 90 days of age or younger with a chief complaint of fever were included for review. Vital signs, laboratory workup, disposition, and final diagnosis were collected. Compliance with guidelines was assessed and compared between EDs.

Results

Compliance with admission guidelines was not significantly different in any of the 3 age groups evaluated between the pediatric and general ED (PED and GED). Compliance with guideline recommendations for laboratory workup was not significantly different between the 2 EDs, nor was overall compliance with guideline recommendations.

Conclusions

No significant variations in the management of febrile infants or compliance with published guidelines between PED and GED physicians were observed. Young infants can be safely treated for fever in the PED or GED.

### Beliefs and expectations of Canadian parents who bring febrile children for medical care [^111pczec]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this survey was to study the beliefs, expectations, and satisfaction of Canadian parents regarding fever and the treatment of their febrile children.

Methods

A survey was developed exploring caregiver beliefs and treatment strategies, as well as expectations and satisfaction with medical care. Some items were modeled after previous studies to allow comparison. Caregivers with febrile children were recruited from 2005 to 2007 at 3 urgent care centers and emergency departments in Edmonton, Canada: a pediatric emergency department (n = 376), an urban urgent care center (n = 227), and a suburban urgent care clinic (n = 173).

Results

High and rapidly rising temperature, as well as physical symptoms associated with fever, caused concern in most parents surveyed. Seventy-four percent of parents felt that the elevated temperature from fever was dangerous and 90.3% always try to treat it. Forty degrees Celsius was the most commonly sited threshold for danger. Identifying the cause (80.6%) and seriousness (87.4%) of fever were the most com-mon stressors identified. Caregivers expected to receive information about the child's illness and appropriate treatment. The parents most often wanted information about febrile seizures and the potential dangers of febrile illness. Only 16.7% of caregivers expected anti-biotics. Nearly 92% of subjects were usually satisfied with medical care.

Conclusions

Fever phobia continues to be a significant issue for Canadian parents. As a result, they treat fever aggressively and often seek medical attention. Good communication is important for medical staff caring for febrile children and typically leads to satisfied parents.

### Management of fever in infants and children [^115ViT6G]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is no question that fever is a source of great consternation for parent and physician alike; however, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of every febrile illness. Inherent in the words diagnostic impression is a degree of uncertainty. The only question remaining is how much uncertainty is in the best interest of the child. Physicians try to use the existing scientific data to best determine the prevalence of disease and outcome. At the same time, they must recognize the limitations of both the data and their ability to be generalized to every population. Everything clinicians do has risks and costs, which they must balance against the incidence of complications and the benefits of testing. To take away clinical judgment makes physicians technicians not clinicians.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^111YZRN1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Fever in well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 1 to 3 months (29 to 90 days) — predictors of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid testing: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified, and admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the ED is needed (Consensus recommendation).

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^112jhsiB]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Population addressed — Eligibility and exclusions for this guideline are defined as follows: This guideline addresses febrile infants who are well appearing; infants appearing moderately or severely ill are at higher risk for invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) and are NOT addressed, and we recommend that when clinicians are uncertain as to whether an infant is well appearing, this guideline should not be applied. For eligibility, infants must be well appearing, have documented rectal temperatures of ≥ 38.0°C or 100.4°F at home in the past 24 hours or determined in a clinical setting, have a gestation between ≥ 37 and < 42 weeks, and be 8 to 60 days of age and at home after discharge from a newborn nursery or born at home. The algorithms are intended to exclude preterm infants (< 37 weeks' gestation).

### The accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children: prospective cohort study of 15 781 febrile illnesses [^117RCBit]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Diagnostic decision making has received little attention compared with therapeutics, despite the universally accepted "medical mantra" of the importance of history taking and physical examination for all patients. Given the complexity of this process and the sheer number of clinical symptoms and signs elicited (including multiple thresholds at multiple and varying times during the illness), it is highly likely that errors in judgment occur when combining these clinical features. In many situations, inefficiencies, costs, and harms may occur by the needless ordering of additional tests and by overtreatment or undertreatment. By combining routinely collected clinical information into a statistical model, we have demonstrated that a clinical diagnostic model may improve the care of children presenting with fever who have suspected serious bacterial illness.

Conclusions

Urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bacteraemia occur in about 7% of children who present to an emergency department with a febrile illness, but only 70–80% of such children are prescribed antibiotics on initial consultation and 20% of children without an identified bacterial infection are probably overtreated with antibiotics. Combining physician elicited symptoms and signs into a statistical model presented as a computer assisted diagnostic decision system provides scope to improve sensitivity compared with physician judgment, thereby improving early treatment.

### Brain temperature: heat production, elimination and clinical relevance [^111DHtsq]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Neurological insults are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, both in adults and especially in children. Among possible therapeutic strategies to limit clinical cerebral damage and improve outcomes, hypothermia remains a promising and beneficial approach. However, its advantages are still debated after decades of use. Studies in adults have generated conflicting results, whereas in children recent data even suggest that hypothermia may be detrimental. Is it because brain temperature physiology is not well understood and/or not applied properly, that hypothermia fails to convince clinicians of its potential benefits? Or is it because hypothermia is not, as believed, the optimal strategy to improve outcome in patients affected with an acute neurological insult? This review article should help to explain the fundamental physiological principles of brain heat production, distribution and elimination under normal conditions and discuss why hypothermia cannot yet be recommended routinely in the management of children affected with various neurological insults.

### Pyrexia in a young infant-is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection? [^116vd3f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study has revealed some implications when assessing febrile infants in the ED. We found that a higher temperature may confer a greater risk for SBI. However, height of fever should be interpreted in conjunction with other risk factors to identify infants at risk for SBIs. Repeated monitoring and clinical assessment is necessary.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Pediatric emergency department management benefits from appropriate early redirection of nonurgent visits [^113niLQk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Overcrowding at pediatric emergency departments (EDs) may result in delayed clinical management and higher risks of medical error. This study was designed to prospectively evaluate what parents of sick children seek emergency care for and how these patients are being assessed and managed.

Methods

Patients aged 0 to 17 years seeking ED care at an urban Swedish university hospital, from 8 AM to 9 PM on 25 consecutive days, were included. Clinical urgency and further level of medical care were determined by experienced nurses based on individual clinical signs and vital parameters. Information on presenting problem, medical priority, gender, age, waiting time, day of week, time of day, and further management was recorded.

Results

Among 1057 included children, two thirds were assessed by physicians, whereas one third were referred directly by nurses for other ED (n = 54) or primary care (n = 114), or sent home with medical advice (n = 176), more often during evenings and weekends. Of primarily referred patients, 7.6% returned within 72 hours, and three of them were admitted. Young infants, patients with respiratory or neurological problems, and sicker patients with fever or infections were mainly assessed by physicians, within desired priority time.

Discussion

More than one fourth of pediatric ED patients might rapidly, appropriately, and safely be referred for primary care or sent home by experienced pediatric nurses soon after arrival, thereby facilitating management of urgent and more appropriate patients. Evaluations by physicians were primarily required in young infants and for urgent medical conditions demanding qualified pediatric skills.

### A cross-sectional study characterizing pediatric temperature percentiles in children at well-child visits [^114wzzqi]. Academic Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Temperature measurement plays a central role in determining pediatric patients' disease risk and management. However, current pediatric temperature thresholds may be outdated and not applicable to children.

Objective

To characterize pediatric temperature norms and variation by patient characteristics, time of measurement, and thermometer route.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 134,641 well-child visits occurring between 2014–2019 at primary care clinics that routinely measured temperature. We performed bivariate and multivariable quantile regressions with clustered standard errors to determine temperature percentiles and variation by age, sex, time of measurement, and thermometer route. We performed sensitivity analyses: 1) using a cohort that excluded visits with infectious diagnoses that could explain temperature aberrations and 2) including clinic as a fixed effect.

Results

The median rectal temperature for visits of infants ≤ 12 months old was 37.2˚C, which was 0.4˚C higher than the median axillary temperature. The median axillary temperature for children 1–18 years old was 36.7˚C, which was 0.1˚C lower than the median values of all other routes. The 99th percentile for rectal temperatures in infants was 37.8˚C and the 99.9th percentile for axillary temperatures in children was 38.5˚C. Adjusted analyses did not demonstrate clinically significant variation in temperature by sex, age, or time of measurement.

Conclusions

These updated temperature norms can serve as reference values in clinical practice and should be considered in the context of thermometer route used and the clinical condition being evaluated. Variations in temperature values by sex, age, and time of measurement were not clinically significant.

### Common diagnoses among pediatric attendances at emergency departments [^1115XsE1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Next, the common diagnoses differed between pediatric and general EDs. Similar to studies down in the United States, general EDs in Singapore are more likely to encounter injuries and musculoskeletal complaints due to the sudden and distressing nature of traumatic injuries. When a child presents with acute gross deformities or a profuse bleed, caregivers may choose to bring their child to the nearest ED rather than travel further to a pediatric ED due to the perceived urgency of the condition. Caregivers may also have differing expectations of the care provided by different EDs, of which traumatic complaints could be satisfactorily addressed in most EDs, while non-traumatic complaints require the expertise and reassurance of pediatric specialists. Thus, it is important that general ED physicians have the competence and confidence in managing trauma cases unique to the pediatric population. Additional considerations such as the use of computed tomography in pediatric head injury, and the importance of sedation and analgesia in pediatric wound management must not be ignored.

Lastly, the common diagnoses across all EDs reflect the healthcare-seeking behaviours of pediatric patients and their caregivers. This healthcare-seeking behaviour may be fuelled by the healthcare system in Singapore as there are only two pediatric EDs in Singapore where care is provided at a subsided rate and attendance to the ED does not require primary care referral. Regardless, studies have shown that caregivers have a predilection for seeking pediatric care at EDs, even if their conditions do not necessitate emergent medical attention. Similarly, in this study, some common pediatric diagnoses seen at EDs, such as URTI, gastroenteritis and unspecified fever, can be adequately addressed by primary care providers. The inclination to seek medical help at EDs may be due to round-the-clock accessibility, perceived higher quality of care, and greater patient/caregiver satisfaction at EDs. There is a need to reshape the delivery of primary care in Singapore such that pediatric patients seek care at appropriate medical facilities that are best tailored for their condition. Caregiver education on pediatric health and ED utilization can also reduce unnecessary ED visits for non-urgent conditions, thereby minimising the strain on limited resources. Inefficiencies and delayed care for critically ill patients in EDs can thus be reduced.

### What clinical signs best identify severe illness in young infants aged 0–59 days in developing countries? A systematic review [^111Cj1we]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Despite recent overall improvement in the survival of under-five children worldwide, mortality among young infants remains high, and accounts for an increasing proportion of child deaths in resource-poor settings. In such settings, clinical decisions for appropriate management of severely ill infants have to be made on the basis of presenting clinical signs, and with limited or no laboratory facilities. This review summarises the evidence from observational studies of clinical signs of severe illnesses in young infants aged 0–59 days, with a particular focus on defining a minimum set of best predictors of the need for hospital-level care. Available moderate to high quality evidence suggests that, among sick infants aged 0–59 days brought to a health facility, the following clinical signs — alone or in combination — are likely to be the most valuable in identifying infants at risk of severe illness warranting hospital-level care: history of feeding difficulty, history of convulsions, temperature (axillary) ≥ 37.5°C or < 35.5°C, change in level of activity, fast breathing/respiratory rate ≥ 60 breaths per minute, severe chest indrawing, grunting and cyanosis.

### Pyrexia in a young infant-is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection? [^113b65Qi]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-centre study, we described the relationship between the height of fever at ED triage and risk of SBI among infants ≤ 3 months of age. High temperature as a continuous variable, as well as a temperature threshold of ≥ 39 °C, were independently associated with increased risk of SBI after accounting for gender, age and SIS.

The presence of pyrexia is important in the early recognition of serious infections in young infants. In diagnostic algorithms, the height of temperature is not consistently specified. For the past few decades, there have been conflicting reports on the association between high temperature and SBIs. In older age groups, height of fever alone is unreliable in predicting SBI. A prospective cohort study in paediatric patients aged 0–5 by Williams et al. suggested that whilst higher temperatures were associated with a SBI, a third risked being overlooked if they did not reach a temperature threshold of 38 °C. There were also other studies suggesting that pyrexia ≥ 39–40 °C may be associated with SBI particularly in young infants. After adjusting for age, gender and SIS, we similarly demonstrated that a temperature ≥ 39 °C was an independent predictor for SBI. However, we recognize that temperature is a dynamic vital sign, and height of fever should be interpreted in conjunction with other risk factors.

The prevalence of SBI varies widely across international literature. Our study cohort (n = 228, 21.5%) reported a relatively high prevalence of SBI. From a health services perspective, this may be because we are the larger of only 2 paediatric EDs locally. Young infants with borderline temperatures and who examine well at primary health services would likely be discharged and not referred to our hospital. Whilst SBIs are reported to be more prevalent in infants ≤ 28 days, our study population demonstrated a greater proportion of SBI in the older infants > 28 days old (n = 166, 80.2%). These findings may be different because of a higher proportion of booked pregnancies with effective antibiotic prophylaxis for mothers with known S. agalactiae colonization locally and subsequently there were only 6 (2.6%) positive cultures for GBS infections documented during this study period. Nonetheless, this emphasizes the importance of careful clinical evaluation in a febrile infant aged between 28–90 days. Higher temperatures ≥ 39 °C were demonstrated high specificity and NPV for SBI.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of new generation tympanic thermometry in children under different cutoffs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AjGpX]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Body temperature measurement is a routine in the management of sick children for both parents and healthcare providers. An accurate diagnosis of fever is crucial in clinical practice and an inaccurate one could lead to serious complications and improper medical decisions. Core temperature is the gold standard for temperature measurement. However, core temperature measurements, such as pulmonary artery and lower esophagus measurement, are invasive and require specialized equipment, therefore, are unpractical for daily clinical practice. Ideally, body temperature measurement should be noninvasive, accurate, pain-free, cost-effective and time-efficient.

Traditionally, non-invasive methods of body temperature measurement include rectal temperature, oral temperature and axillary temperature. Among these methods, rectal thermometry has been the most reliable for measuring body temperature in children and is considered clinically to be the best estimation of the core temperature. However, it is time-consuming and requires certain level of practice. Furthermore, it may cause emotional distress, and -although very rare- brings possible complications such as perforation or transmission of micro-organisms. And therefore infants, health workers and parents more or less express reluctance to perform it.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^115jSzgZ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 29 to 90 days presenting with fever (≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) — patient management recommendations are as follows: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified. Admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the ED is needed. (Consensus recommendation).

### Fever of unknown origin in childhood [^112qt4hV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood fever of unknown origin (FUO) is most often related to an underlying infection but can also be associated with a variety of neoplastic, rheumatologic, and inflammatory conditions. Repeated, focused reviews of patient history and physical examination are often helpful in suggesting a likely diagnosis. Diagnostic workup should be staged, usually leaving invasive testing for last. Advances in molecular genetic techniques have increased the importance of these assays in the diagnosis of FUO in children.

Fever is one of the most common chief complaints for patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Most of the time, these patients are diagnosed with a virus and treated with supportive care; however, there are a subset of patients with chronic conditions or special circumstances that require a more thorough approach when they enter the ED with a fever. This article will go into detail about why we must be on high alert when these children present with a fever and how we should approach them medically.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Fever is an increased body temperature above the normal level of about 98. 6° Fahrenheit or 37° Celsius. Fever usually indicates an infection but may also occur in other disorders, such as some types of cancer or arthritis. Fever in infants, especially those younger than 3 months, can signal a serious infection. Such young infants who have fever should be seen by a doctor to determine the cause and treat it.

### Pyrexia in a young infant-is height of fever associated with serious bacterial infection? [^113eMv63]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile infants younger than 90 days old form a significant proportion of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). A cross-sectional study estimated 2 million febrile infants ≤ 90 days old presenting to EDs in the USA over the recent decade (2007–2017). Among young febrile infants, up to 10–15% of have a serious bacterial infection (SBI) defined as bacteraemia, meningitis or urinary tract infection (UTI). Young infants are at risk of SBIs due to an immature immune system, vaccination naivety against common infections and potential perinatal exposure to certain pathogens, and may develop complications including cognitive deficits, hearing loss and potential mortality.

Currently, guidelines recommend febrile infants ≤ 28 days old to undergo evaluation for SBIs including a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, urine cultures and blood cultures, and in specific cases, cultures from stool, fluid or tissue samples, followed by prompt administration of empiric broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. For older infants between 28–90 days old, those without clinical or analytical risk factors may not require such extensive evaluation to avoid invasive procedures and unnecessary anxiety. However as clinical symptoms differentiating minor febrile illnesses from SBI are often absent in young infants, many are still subjected to hospitalisation and invasive procedures.

Published literature has provided criteria to identify patients at low risk of SBIs, including the Rochester criteria (RC), Philadelphia criteria (PC), and Boston criteria (BC). Whilst fever (≥ 38 °C) is necessary for the application of these clinical assessment tools, height of fever is not identified to be an independent risk factor for SBI. Hyperpyrexia defined as a rectal temperature of ≥ 41.1 °C, was previously reported to be associated with bacterial meningitis by McCarthy et al. in the 1970s. Most of these cases were attributed to Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), which substantially decreased following the introduction of the Hib vaccination in the 1980s. Other studies published conflicting results regarding the relationship between the height of fever and presence of SBI in the paediatric population. Aronson and Pantell et al. created clinical prediction tools which include height of temperature to identify well looking infants at risk of invasive bacterial infections (IBI). Results from recent systematic reviews by Rosenfeld-Yehoshua et al. in 2018 and Davis et al. in 2019 have suggested that hyperpyrexia in young infants is suggestive of increased risk of SBIs.

We aim to study the association between the height of fever at ED triage and a subsequent diagnosis of SBI.

### Continuous timely monitoring of core temperature with two wearable devices in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer-a comparison study [^114cuyji]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (FN) is a frequent, potentially life-threatening complication in pediatric patients with cancer. During neutropenia, fever is often the first and only clinically detectable sign of infection. Therefore, FN is treated with emergency hospitalization and empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Time to administration of antibiotics (TTA) is frequently used as a quality of care measure because of a possible association of longer TTA with worse clinical outcomes. Normally, temperature is only measured when fever is suspected. Correspondingly, the majority of FN episodes are diagnosed at temperatures above the predefined fever limit, which may lead to delayed therapy and worse outcomes. Furthermore, high fever is a risk factor for bacteremia.

Wearable devices (WDs) are increasingly used to continuously monitor vital signs in different settings. WD-based continuous temperature monitoring with timely data accessibility may lead to earlier diagnosis, shorter TTA, and thus ultimately to improved outcomes in FN. Combined with other continuously measured vital signs, patterns predicting imminent fever or infection might additionally be detectable, further reducing TTA.

In pediatric patients with cancer, the feasibility of continuous temperature monitoring has been studied during hospitalization and at home using "stick-on" patches. A recently published case series describes three fever episodes in which fever was either detected earlier or only by such patches and consequently led the patients to seek medical attention. In our previous study (NCT04134429), we showed that with the Everion®, continuous recording of vital signs in pediatric patients is possible over a wide age range. However, the predefined feasibility criterion was missed, mainly due to non-compliance plus missing automated transmission rebooting after technical failures, thus independent of the WD assessed.

The primary aim of this study was to compare two different WDs regarding the feasibility of continuous core temperature recording of good quality with timely data accessibility in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. Secondary feasibility-related study aims were (1) to compare feasibility for other vital signs recorded by the Everion®, (2) to compare feasibility disregarding time delay in data accessibility, (3) to assess the impact of the improved study setting on compliance using published Everion® data for comparison, and (4) to explore patient satisfaction, user-friendliness and side effects of the WDs, and investigator efforts. An additional secondary aim was (5) to compare the WDs regarding the agreement of continuously recorded core temperature measurements and discrete ear measurements. A tertiary aim was to explore patterns of vital signs recorded before the onset of fever or infection.

### Temperature measurement at well-child visits in the United States [^115AD527]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency and predictors of temperature measurement at well-child visits in the US and report rates of interventions associated with visits at which temperature is measured and fever is detected.

Study Design

In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 22 518 sampled well-child visits from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey between 2003 and 2015. We estimated the frequency of temperature measurement and performed multivariable regression to identify patient, provider/clinic, and seasonal factors associated with the practice. We described rates of interventions (complete blood count, radiograph, urinalysis, antibiotic prescription, and emergency department/hospital referral) by measurement and fever (temperature ≥ 100.4 °F, ≥ 38.0 °C) status.

Results

Temperature was measured in 48.5% (95% CI 45.6–51.4) of well-child visits. Measurement was more common during visits by nonpediatric providers (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.6–2.5; reference: pediatricians), in Hispanic (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.6–2.3) and Black (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.9; reference: non-Hispanic White) patients, and in patients with government (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7–2.4; reference: private) insurance. Interventions were more commonly pursued when temperature was measured (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6) and fever was detected (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.5–9.4).

Conclusions

Temperature was measured in nearly one-half of all well-child visits. Interventions were more common when temperature was measured and fever was detected. The value of routine temperature measurement during well-child visits warrants further evaluation.

### Topiramate tablet (Topiramate) [^115zocaQ]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Eye Disorder

Instruct patients taking topiramate to seek immediate medical attention if they experience blurred vision, visual disturbances or periorbital pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.2)].

Oligohydrosis and Hyperthermia

Closely monitor topiramate-treated patients, especially pediatric patients, for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Counsel patients to contact their healthcare professionals immediately if they develop a high or persistent fever, or decreased sweating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Metabolic Acidosis

Warn patients about the potential, significant risk for metabolic acidosis that may be asymptomatic and may be associated with adverse effects on kidneys (e.g., kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis), bones (e.g., osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and/or rickets in children), and growth (e.g., growth delay/retardation) in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations(8.1)].

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including topiramate, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct patients to immediately report behaviors of concern to their healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Which low urgent triaged febrile children are suitable for a fast track? An observational European study [^114uCLfH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a secondary analysis of the Management and Outcome of Fever in children in Europe (MOFICHE) study, which is embedded in the Personalised Risk assessment in Febrile illness to Optimise Real-life Management across the European Union project. The MOFICHE study is an observational multicentre study assessing management and outcome of febrile children using routinely collected data of 12 EDs in 8 European countries (Austria, Germany, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands n = 3, Slovenia, Spain, the UK n = 3). The hospital characteristics are described in previous studies.

Study population and setting

Children up to 18 years with fever (temperature ≥ 38℃) measured at the ED or a history of fever within 3 days before the ED visit were included in the MOFICHE study. For this secondary analysis, we included the nine EDs who use the MTS for allocating triage urgency levels to patients, namely EDs in Austria, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands (n = 2), Spain, and the UK (n = 3). Subsequently, from these EDs we included children who were triaged as low urgent (those assigned a triage acuity of either 'standard' or 'non-urgent' using the MTS) since we hypothesise that a proportion of these children are suitable for assessment in a fast track. Children with known comorbidities and with missing data on disposition were excluded.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and public were not involved in the design and conduct of the study.

Triage urgency level

The MTS consists of 52 flow charts based on the patients' presenting problem such as abdominal pain. The most appropriate flow chart is chosen by triage nurses to prioritise patients on clinical urgency. Each flow chart consists of specific discriminators and categorises patients in one of the five triage categories, which are linked to a maximum waiting time for doctors' assessment. The five MTS urgency categories are: immediate (maximum waiting time 0 min), very urgent (maximum waiting time 10 min), urgent (maximum waiting time 60 min), standard (maximum waiting time 120 min), non-urgent (maximum waiting time 240 min). For this study, we used predefined three-category triage levels consisting of the categories 'high urgent', 'intermediate urgent' and 'low urgent'. The MTS categories very urgent and immediate were classified as high urgent, urgent was classified as intermediate urgent and patients allocated to standard or non-urgent were classified as low urgent.

### Evaluation and management of febrile infants in the emergency department [^112YW25h]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Managing fever in pediatric patients has always been a high-risk aspect of emergency medicine, and this is especially true of infants. The task of correctly discerning "well" versus "ill" can be difficult for these patients because they cannot describe their symptoms and have not developed normal social behaviors. Recent studies, however, have greatly enhanced physicians' understanding of how best to manage these young patients. With this research comes an array of new recommendations for diagnosing and treating febrile infants, which can be incorporated into the practice of every emergency physician who cares for pediatric patients.

### Knowledge and management of fever among latino parents [^115Srqq4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Fever is a common childhood condition that is often misunderstood and incorrectly managed by parents. This study uses a questionnaire about fever administered to a convenience sample of Spanish-speaking-only parents bringing their child to a hospital-based urban pediatric clinic. The questionnaire elicits information about definition and cause of fever, concerns about fever, methods of temperature measurement, and treatment modalities used by the parents. Latino parents have numerous misconceptions about fever and its role in illness. Educational interventions should target fever definition, clarification of cause and potential harm of elevated temperatures, temperature monitoring, and safe treatment modalities. Owning a thermometer is strongly associated with correct knowledge of temperature values. Providing parents with a thermometer and educating them about its proper use may lead to an increase in appropriate monitoring and medical treatment of the febrile child.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^117TWfFQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Recommendation for Fever Management Following Vaccination

Nearly three-quarter (72.3%) of the sample reported that their recommendations for fever management would differ if fever followed vaccination rather than if fever was of general nature. However, when asked at what temperature antipyretic medication would be recommended for general fever and fever after vaccination, participating pediatricians responded without significant difference between the two clinical scenarios. In general, respondents indicated that they would recommend the use of antipyretic medications at temperatures of about 38.3°C, regardless of whether fever followed vaccination or not. The average temperatures at which respondents indicated they would recommend antipyretic medications for both general fever and those following vaccination increased very slightly with infant age. The recommendation to manage fever within the 48 hours following vaccination at home without antipyretic medication was not a common choice for most respondents. Over 97.3% reported never recommending this for infants with extremely serious fever and 56.1% reported never recommending this option for infants with mild fever. Managing at home with antipyretic medication was more likely to be recommended for infants with mild or moderate fever.

Reliance on Practicing Guideline and Parents' Education About Fever Management

Most respondents (89.5%) reported some reliance on the fever management guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in their response to fever in infants; only 10.5% reported that they did not use the guidelines of the AAP in their practice.

Most respondents (85.3%) reported that they "always" or "usually" explained to parents how to manage infant fever during well-baby visits; and even higher proportion (95.8%) reported that they "always" or "usually" explained to parents how to manage infant fever during a vaccination visit.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^111tP813]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In general, the intensity of treatment or management recommendations provided by respondents increased with higher levels of fever and is inversely related to infant age. Whittler et al. conducted a survey in 1998 to examine pediatricians' recommendation for infants with a body temperature of 40.3°C. In their study, 96% of the responders recommended hospital admission for the 3 week old febrile infants and 62% recommended hospital admission for 7 week old febrile infants. In our study, 86.0% of respondents recommended immediate ER visit or hospital admission for infants 0–2 months of age with a body temperature greater than 40.0°C. Whittler et al. found that 6% of respondents recommended hospital admission for 4-month-old infants with a fever of 40.3°C, while 31.1% of the respondents in our study recommended hospital admission for the same scenario. The difference in these results may be due to the different designs of the questionnaires for the two surveys. In our survey, all recommendations were based on a scenario of parents' calls, while in Whittler's study the participating pediatricians were provided a scenario of clinic visit. We found that physician respondents were more inclined to recommend an ER visit in response to infant fever after office hours rather than during office hours. Results indicate that a significant portion of recommendations for ER visits would have been recommendations for a same day office visit had the fever occurred during office hours. These results may have practical implications for the

organization of the emergency departments during off-office hours and may suggest that specific educational programs for the management of fever in infants are needed in the US.

Other studies in the US as well as outside the US reported variable compliance rates to current guidelines for managing fever. Young conducted a case scenario survey for primary care physicians in Utah. The results of the study showed that compliance with guidelines vary from 9.6% to 75% depending on the age of the febrile child. Gabriel et al found that pediatricians and emergency department physicians would order fewer tests and would prescribe less antibiotics to febrile children who have been vaccinated previously with pneumoccoal conjugate vaccine. Chiappini et al found that the management of well-appearing febrile infants varies across pediatricians in Italy after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Although most pediatricians in our study reported some reliance on the fever management guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), it is apparent that the general attitude of pediatricians towards fever management has been changing since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Fever without source in unvaccinated children aged 3 to 24 months: what workup is recommended? [^111vRtaq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Fever is the most common complaint for infants and children brought to the emergency department. Most febrile children younger than 3 years will have a clinically apparent source of infection. However, in approximately 20% of these children, a source cannot be identified by history and physical examination alone. The recommended diagnostic approach to children younger than 3 years presenting with fever without source (FWS) has changed dramatically over the past 30 years because of the widespread use of the Haemophilus influenza type b and polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines. The percentage of children in the United States unvaccinated at 24 months is now over 1% and seems to be increasing. This article will review what is currently known about FWS in children aged 3 to 24 months in the modern era and how it pertains to unvaccinated children treated in the emergency department. An algorithm for the treatment of unvaccinated young children presenting with FWS is proposed.

### Evaluation of the precision of emergency department diagnoses in young children with fever [^114hKgDw]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. To characterize causes of fever in children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS. One-year retrospective review of ED records. Inclusion criteria were 2 to 36 months of age with a documented temperature ≥ 39°C. Exclusion criteria were elopement, repeat visit, and underlying diagnosis with a predisposition to infection. Medical records were reviewed using a predefined, study-specific, data abstraction tool. Based on diagnosis and pathogen detection, visits were assigned to 3 groups, laboratory confirmed pathogen and focal or nonfocal diagnosis without confirmed pathogen. RESULTS. A total of 1091 visits met inclusion criteria. Fourteen percent had a pathogen detected, 56% had a focal diagnosis without a confirmed pathogen, and 30% had a nonfocal diagnosis without confirmed pathogen. CONCLUSIONS. In a cohort of febrile children 2 to 36 months of age, only 14% had a confirmed pathogen. New rapid viral diagnostic techniques may provide an opportunity to improve diagnostic certainty in young children presenting with fever.

### Perception and management of fever in infants up to six months of age: a survey of US pediatricans [^114787Zu]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is defined as an increase in the body's internal temperature to levels above the normal range. Fevers are usually the result of a viral or bacterial infection, but may also be caused by varied non-infectious conditions. In infants, fever warrants special attention as dehydration that may result from fever may compromise an infant's health more quickly than that of an adult, and may also be the sole indicator of certain life threatening conditions including meningitis and sepsis. Infants with fever are typically irritable and do not eat or sleep well. Because of the potentially serious causes of fever in infants, and the associated discomfort it elicits, fever is among the most common reasons parents seek medical attention for their infants.

Fever is commonly observed following vaccination. Vaccine-associated fevers usually begin within 24 hours of vaccine administration and last two to three days. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommend administration of up to 9 different vaccine antigens during the first six months of life, many of which may cause fever following administration. However, it should be noted that high fever (greater than 39.5°C) occurs in less than 1% of infants.

US practice guidelines for the management and treatment of febrile infants have been met with controversy. Differences of opinion among physicians regarding the recommended diagnostic response and the value of empiric antibiotic treatment have been documented, with hospital-based providers more often favoring reliance on testing and treatment than physicians in private office settings. Such work evaluating physicians' perception and approach to the management of fever in infants is now quite dated, however. Beliefs among some pediatricians have changed after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Because of the high efficacy of the pneumococcal vaccine against invasive infections of Streptococcus pneumoniae, some pediatricians have practiced less intensive diagnostic procedures for the standard work-up of fever.

This study provides current data on pediatricians' perception and management of fever in infants from birth to six months of age, including perceptions of severity according to body temperature and infant age. Preferred management or treatment strategies for different fever ranges, ages, and vaccination status, were surveyed. This study is designed to inform the readers on contemporary US pediatricians' perception and referral practices to ER and hospital admissions related to fever management in infants. It is not designed to provide guidance on treatment practices.

### Evaluation of child with fever without source: review of literature and update [^114Bm6GG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is one of the most common reasons for a visit to the primary care provider or the emergency department. Traditionally, clinicians have used various risk-stratification strategies to identify serious bacterial infections (SBI) without an obvious source in febrile children, because missed bacterial infections in such children can result in meningitis, sepsis, and death; therefore, early and accurate identification of SBIs is critical. Infants aged less than 60 to 90 days are at greatest risk of SBI. The epidemiology of SBI continues to evolve, especially after the successful introduction of conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

Most children receive emergency care by general emergency physicians and not in designated children's hospitals. There are unique considerations in the care of children that differ from the care of adults. Many management principles can be extrapolated from adult studies, but the unique pathophysiology of pediatric disease requires specialized attention and management updates. This article highlights ten impactful articles from the 2024 whose findings can improve the care of children in the Emergency Department (ED). These studies address pediatric cervical spine injury, resuscitation, infant fever, appendicitis, direct admissions, mental practice, and hypothermia.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® fever without source or unknown origin-child: 2024 update [^117EcqxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fever is the most common reason for the evaluation of pediatric patients in acute care settings. Patients for whom no source of infection is identified after a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are classified as having fever without source. Special considerations should be taken in the evaluation of neonates and neutropenic patients as they are at higher risk of serious bacterial infection. Patients with prolonged fever lasting > 3 weeks who have no identifiable source of fever are classified with fever of unknown origin and represent an additional subset of febrile pediatric patients that also require special consideration. This document summarizes the relevant literature and provides expert recommendations for the selection of the initial imaging in four common clinical scenarios in pediatric patients with fever without source or unknown origin. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Decreasing variation to enhance accurate identification of hypothermic infants in pediatric primary care [^1144btbh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia can be the first and only sign of sepsis in young infants, yet there is a paucity of standard recommendations for pediatric primary-care office management of those infants identified. The SMART aim of this study was to standardize the identification and care of infants age 0 to 49 days at risk of hypothermia in pediatric primary care by decreasing the percent of infants with temperatures ≤ 36.5°C from 24% to 10% within 2 years. Over the course of this project, variation in documented temperatures ≤ 36.5°C decreased from 24% to 7% of encounters. Temperatures ≤ 36.5°C were documented for 951 infants or 13.4% (1078 of 8020 encounters). Of the 951 infants with temperatures ≤ 36.5°C, 96.1% were rewarmed in the office. Thirty-one patients ultimately required hospitalization. Application of quality improvement in a primary-care office decreased low temperatures by standardizing care, empowering staff, and triaging at-risk infants to the most appropriate level of care.
