## Question

Blood test for chlamydia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a blood test for chlamydia and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "blood test" means in this context and whether it refers to serology versus molecular testing. Then, I should verify the current diagnostic gold standard for chlamydia and which specimen types are recommended. Next, I will examine the role and limitations of chlamydia serology, including its use in trachoma programs and research. After that, I should review point-of-care molecular options and their performance. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-based recommendations and provide a clear bottom line answer with practical next steps for clinicians and patients.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating different assays. When people ask for a "blood test", they may mean serology for antibodies or a molecular test performed on blood; however, for Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection, the diagnostic standard is nucleic acid amplification testing on urogenital or extragenital specimens, not serology on blood, and routine blood-based molecular testing is not recommended for diagnosing genital chlamydia [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4].

> I will now examine the diagnostic gold standard to anchor the discussion. NAATs on first-void urine in men and vaginal swabs in women are first-line, with excellent sensitivity and specificity; endocervical, urethral, rectal, and oropharyngeal specimens are also valid depending on exposure history, and NAATs are FDA-cleared for these specimen types, which is why they are the backbone of screening and diagnosis in current guidelines [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4] [^115sE4Dy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about serology; I should double-check its role. Serologic assays detecting IgG to chlamydial antigens such as Pgp3 reflect cumulative exposure over time rather than current active infection, so they are not appropriate for diagnosing acute genital chlamydia; their utility is primarily epidemiologic, including trachoma elimination surveillance and research on population-level transmission, not for individual clinical diagnosis of genital infection [^114CHe5r] [^115sE4Dy].

> Wait, let me verify whether any blood-based molecular approaches are used clinically. While research has explored PCR for C. trachomatis DNA in blood, this is not a validated or recommended approach for diagnosing genital chlamydia in routine care; the organism is typically localized to mucosal sites, and blood PCR has not demonstrated clinical utility for genital infection diagnosis, reinforcing that NAATs on site-specific specimens remain the standard [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4].

> Next, I should review point-of-care options, because sometimes "blood test" is used loosely to mean a rapid test. Modern molecular POCTs for chlamydia and gonorrhea provide high sensitivity and specificity and can deliver results in about 30 minutes, enabling same-visit diagnosis and treatment; however, they still rely on site-specific specimens such as vaginal swabs or urine rather than blood, and their performance characteristics approach laboratory NAATs when properly implemented [^112TvEZQ] [^1135aDQ7] [^115jMWts].

> I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. There is no validated or recommended blood test for diagnosing genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection; diagnosis should be made with NAATs using first-void urine or vaginal swabs as preferred specimens, with rectal and oropharyngeal testing when indicated by exposure, while serology remains a tool for epidemiology and research rather than clinical diagnosis of active infection [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4] [^114CHe5r].

> But wait, what if someone is asking because they already had a "chlamydia blood test" somewhere? I should confirm and clarify that such testing is not guideline-concordant for genital infection; if there is clinical suspicion or risk, order a NAAT on the appropriate specimen type and, if needed, test extragenital sites based on exposure history, and avoid making treatment decisions based on serology alone for acute infection [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4].

There is **no blood test** for diagnosing active chlamydia infection; the standard is **NAAT on urine or swabs** from the genital, rectal, or pharyngeal sites [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4]. Serology is **not recommended** for routine diagnosis because it cannot distinguish current from past infection and is not FDA-cleared for this purpose [^114CHe5r] [^115dPxn9]. Blood tests are only used to detect complications (e.g. PID) or co-infections, not to diagnose chlamydia itself [^116UqcGs].

---

## Current diagnostic standards for chlamydia

The **gold standard** for diagnosing chlamydia is nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), which detects C. trachomatis DNA/RNA with high sensitivity and specificity [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4]. Recommended **specimen types** include first-void urine for men and self- or clinician-collected vaginal swabs for women; rectal and pharyngeal swabs are used when exposure is suspected [^1165mEsB] [^1117JXhE].

---

## Limitations of blood tests for chlamydia

Blood tests are **not recommended** for routine chlamydia diagnosis because C. trachomatis is not typically present in the bloodstream during uncomplicated infection [^notfound]. Serological assays detect antibodies (IgG/IgM) that persist after clearance, so they cannot distinguish current from past infection and are not FDA-cleared for chlamydia diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where blood tests may be used

Although blood tests are not used to diagnose uncomplicated chlamydia, they may be indicated when complications or co-infections are suspected:

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**: Blood cultures or inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, ESR) may be used to assess severity or complications, not to diagnose chlamydia directly [^116UqcGs].

- **Disseminated infection**: Rare cases (e.g. reactive arthritis) may warrant blood tests to evaluate systemic involvement, but these are exceptions, not routine [^111ZAeaj].

- **Co-infections**: Blood tests may screen for HIV, syphilis, or hepatitis B/C when STI risk is present, but they do not detect chlamydia [^1117JXhE].

---

## Accuracy and reliability of blood tests for chlamydia

Serological tests have poor diagnostic accuracy for active chlamydia because antibodies persist after clearance and cross-react with other pathogens, leading to false positives and reduced specificity [^notfound]. No **FDA-cleared serological assays** exist for chlamydia diagnosis, underscoring their limited reliability [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current CDC and WHO guidelines **do not recommend blood tests** for routine chlamydia diagnosis; they endorse NAATs on urine or site-specific swabs as the standard [^113F8vYt] [^112XdQk4]. Serology is reserved for research or epidemiologic purposes, not clinical diagnosis [^114CHe5r].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

| **Method** | **Description** | **Accuracy** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NAAT | Detects C. trachomatis nucleic acids | High sensitivity/specificity | Gold standard for diagnosis [^113F8vYt] |
| Culture | Grows viable organisms | Lower sensitivity | - Research <br/> - Legal cases [^115dPxn9] |
| Antigen detection | Detects chlamydial antigens | Lower sensitivity | Not recommended for routine use [^116tJSpU] |
| Serology | Detects antibodies | Poor for active infection | Not recommended for diagnosis [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no blood test** for diagnosing active chlamydia infection; use NAATs on urine or site-specific swabs for accurate diagnosis [^113F8vYt]. Serology is not recommended for routine diagnosis due to poor accuracy and inability to distinguish current from past infection [^115sE4Dy]. Blood tests are only used for complications or co-infections, not for chlamydia itself [^116UqcGs].

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in April 2009 to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the diagnosis and management of STDs. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infection in adolescents and adults that were considered in development of the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on specimen types used for nucleic acid amplification testing for chlamydia diagnosis, considerations in screening men for chlamydia and repeat testing after infected men receive treatment, and the natural history of chlamydia.

The introduction of NAATs has revolutionised chlamydial diagnostics and these tests are now the standard of care. However, as with all new technologies, they have also presented new challenges. This review attempts to answer some of the questions that have been raised, particularly by groups about to embark on implementing a screening programme. Laboratory tests are continually changing but it is hoped that the paper provides a useful update of the current situation.

### Advancing the public health applications of Chlamydia trachomatis serology [^114CHe5r]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection. Trachoma is caused by ocular infection with C trachomatis and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. New serological assays for C trachomatis could facilitate improved understanding of C trachomatis epidemiology and prevention. C trachomatis serology offers a means of investigating the incidence of chlamydia infection and might be developed as a biomarker of scarring sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, serological assays have potential as epidemiological tools to quantify unmet need, inform service planning, evaluate interventions including screening and treatment, and to assess new vaccine candidates. However, questions about the performance characteristics and interpretation of C trachomatis serological assays remain, which must be addressed to advance development within this field. In this Personal View, we explore the available information about C trachomatis serology and propose several priority actions. These actions involve development of target product profiles to guide assay selection and assessment across multiple applications and populations, establishment of a serum bank to facilitate assay development and evaluation, and development of technical and statistical methods for assay evaluation and analysis of serological findings. The field of C trachomatis serology will benefit from collaboration across the public health community to align technological developments with their potential applications.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^1117JXhE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Box 9-A — Recommended STD screening for persons with HIV who are sexually active — notes that type-specific serologic testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection can be considered in persons with HIV with unknown herpes infection status, and that most STD screening occurs in clinical settings but some nonclinical settings have the capacity to screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia using self-collected urine, vaginal, rectal, and oropharyngeal specimens or syphilis using venous blood drawn by phlebotomy. For gonorrhea and chlamydia, use tests recommended by CDC for laboratory detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and using tests recommended by the most recent CDC STD Treatment Guidelines; optional specimen types for nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are first-catch urine from men and vaginal swabs from women collected in clinical settings, and in women with cervicitis, endocervical and vaginal specimens yield comparable NAAT results. Commercially available NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are not cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for urine, vaginal, or rectal specimens collected outside clinical settings, and the FDA has not cleared commercially available NAATs to test rectal specimens for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection or oropharyngeal specimens for gonorrhea, though some laboratories have established performance specifications for such specimens to meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act requirements for reporting results for clinical management. NAATs are the most sensitive and specific tests to detect Trichomonas vaginalis, and pregnant women should be screened for vaginal trichomoniasis at the same frequency as nonpregnant women (i.e., at their initial HIV care visit and annually thereafter). This section does not address screening for other conditions that may affect persons with HIV but have not been shown to facilitate HIV transmission to others, such as viral hepatitis, bacterial vaginosis, and human papillomavirus infections.

2.3 Quality assessment

The methodological quality of each included study was independently assessed by two reviewers (YZ and TTJ) using the QUADAS-2 (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies) tool. This checklist consists of four key domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard and flow and timing. Within each study, the domains were assessed in terms of risk of bias and the first three of these domains were assessed in terms of concerns about applicability. Risk of bias (involved all four domains) and applicability (involved three domains) were scored using low risk, high risk or unclear. Disagreements on determining risk between YZ and TTJ were discussed to achieve consensus.

3.3 Study quality

The proportion of studies that fulfill each QUADAS-2 criterion is summarised in Fig. S1. Of the 39 studies, 17 (43.6%) satisfy all of the criteria in the QUADAS-2. In the patient selection domain, one (2.6%) studyis classified at a high risk of bias for employing a case-control design. In the index test domain, 10 (25.6%) studies did not clearly report if the index test had been conducted and interpreted before the reference standard. In the reference standard domain, three (7.7%) study does not clarify if the reference standard results are interpreted without knowledge of infection status. In the flow and timing domain, no study is considered to be at high risk of bias. In terms of applicability no studies are considered to be at risk of bias for either patient selection, the reference standard or index test domains. As a result, the overall quality of the included studies was considered adequate, with the exception of only one study that demonstrated a high risk of bias.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^115jMWts]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Strategies that facilitate adherence to guidelines and inform immediate and appropriate treatment are urgently needed to have an effect on the current state of the STI pandemic. A new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared, molecular point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technology has been developed that is easy to use, supports rapid (30-minute) access to highly accurate chlamydia and gonorrhea detection, and can be performed by non–laboratory-trained personnel in clinical settings. We report the performance characteristics of this new assay and suggest potential applications designed to improve chlamydia and gonorrhea screening and diagnostic services.

### Screening and management of genital chlamydial infections [^112RyXNx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Chlamydial genital infection is common and asymptomatic in most cases. National screening efforts developed to educate practitioners, expand screening, and link testing to local health laboratories are not meeting the needs of populations at great risk of disease, including young racial/ethnic minority women and sexual minorities. The development and availability of newer diagnostics will likely make chlamydia testing more efficient and widely available for patients and providers. Practitioners are reminded to have a low threshold to offer testing and presumptive treatment to patients that are deemed at high risk of disease, particularly those who are challenging to engage in care.

### Choose to test: self-selected testing for sexually transmitted infections within an online service [^113vFpfV]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

The intervention was cost saving by reducing the total number of HIV and syphilis tests ordered, but numbers were too small to show whether reduced HIV testing might be associated with a reduction in diagnosis rates. Missed HIV diagnoses would have important cost implications for the local health service in terms of the management of the complications of late diagnosis of HIV or of HIV transmission. These costs have not been factored into the analysis.

It is concerning that most users chose not to access the information available and new strategies to encourage engagement and therefore informed decision-making are required.

Our data suggest that choice of test by service users is feasible and that some groups actively engage with it.

This is an observational study of a first iteration of a new service. It has important limitations including lack of information on the HIV and syphilis positivity of those who chose not to test for these infections and limited information about the sexual behaviour and therefore risk of infection among all participants. Further work is needed to understand how and why decisions to test are made, how to encourage the use of the evidence provided to inform choice of tests, and to further investigate the impact of choice of test on the diagnosis of HIV and syphilis in at-risk populations.

Key messages

Where testing choices are provided, the majority of users will choose HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea as recommended in guidelines.
Providing users with a choice of tests on an online sexual health service does not significantly affect the number of chlamydia or gonorrhoea diagnoses. Further work is required to understand the effect on diagnoses of HIV and syphilis.
User-led decision-making on test choice results in cost saving by reducing the number of blood test kits for HIV and syphilis taken, but the cost implications of possible missed HIV diagnoses due to reduced testing is unknown.

Clinical Question

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency, and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

Bottom Line

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rLhe3]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally but has been inadequately detected for intervention. Introduction of point-of-care tests (POCTs) for CT is critical for filling the intervention gaps. We conducted a systematical review and meta-analysis on diagnostic performance of POCTs for CT to assist in guiding the application of these assays in CT screening and detection.

Methods

We searched PubMed/Medline and Embase databases, from January 2004 to May 2021, for studies reporting the performance of POCTs for identifying CT using specimens collected from urethral, vaginal, cervical, anorectal, or pharyngeal site or of urine. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data for controlling the quality of data extraction. Any discrepancies in study selection and data extraction were resolved through consensus. We only included studies with sufficient data to estimate sensitivity and specificity, and used laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as the reference standard. The main outcomes were pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Summary estimates were calculated using a random-effects model and summary receiver operator curves (SROCs) were generated using the Moses-Littenberg method. STATA 14.0 and Meta-DiSc 1.4 were used for statistical analysis. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019140544.

Findings

Of 3,038 records identified, 39 studies (42,336 specimens) were included in the study, including 14 studies on evaluation of antigen detection (AD)-based and 25 on NAAT-based POCTs. The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR were 56% (95% CI 45%–67%), 99% (95% CI 98%–99%) and 86 (95% CI 46–163), respectively, for AD-based POCTs and corresponding values for NAAT-based POCTs were 94% (95% CI 91%–96%), 99% (95% CI 99%–99%) and 1,933(95% CI 1,018–3,669), respectively. The pooled sensitivity of AD-based POCTs varied across the types of specimens, indicating 46% for cervical swabs (95% CI 37%–56%; range 22.7%–71.4%), 52% for vaginal swabs (95% CI 34%–70%; range 17.1%–86.8%) and 57% for male urine (95% CI 36%–75%; range 20.0%–82.6%). For NAAT-based POCTs, the pooled sensitivity was 94% (95% CI 90%–96%) for cervical swabs, 94% (95% CI 86%–98%) for vaginal swabs, 95% (95% CI 91%–97%) for urine specimens and 93% (95% CI 87%–96%) for anorectal swabs.

Interpretation

NAAT-based POCTs for CT have a significantly better performance particularly in sensitivity for diagnosing the infection with CT than the AD-based POCTs. Screening strategy with AD-based POCTs may potentially result in a substantial under-detection of the infections.

### Screening for chlamydial infection [^112wSFff]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine data on the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection by a physician or other health care professional. Specifically, we examine the evidence that early treatment of chlamydial infection improves health outcomes, as well as evidence of the effectiveness of screening strategies in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and men, and the accuracy of tests used for screening. This review updates the literature since the last recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published in 1996.

Search Strategy

We searched the topic of chlamydia in the MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1994 to July 2000, supplemented by reference lists of relevant articles and from experts in the field. Articles published prior to 1994 and research abstracts were cited if particularly important to the key questions or to the interpretation of included articles.

Selection Criteria

A single reader reviewed all English abstracts. Articles were selected for full review if they were about Chlamydia trachomatis genitourinary infections in nonpregnant women, pregnant women, or men and were relevant to key questions in the analytic framework. Investigators read the full-text version of the retrieved articles and applied additional eligibility criteria. For all topics, we excluded articles if they did not provide sufficient information to determine the methods for selecting subjects and for analyzing data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We systematically reviewed three types of studies about screening in nonpregnant women that relate to three key questions: (1) studies about the effectiveness of screening programs in reducing prevalence rates of infection, (2) studies about risk factors for chlamydial infection in women, and (3) studies about chlamydial screening tests in women. Our search found too few studies on pregnant women to systematically review, although pertinent studies are described. We systematically reviewed two types of studies about screening in men: (1) studies about prevalence rates and risk factors for chlamydial infection in men and (2) studies about chlamydial screening tests in men.

Main Results

Nonpregnant women. The results of a randomized controlled trial conducted in a large health maintenance organization indicate that screening women selected by a set of risk factors reduces the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) over a 1-year period. Changes in population prevalence rates have not been well documented because few studies have employed a representative population sample. Age continues to be the best predictor of chlamydial infection in women, with most studies evaluating cut-offs at age younger than 25 years. Other risk factors may be useful predictors, but these are likely to be population specific. To determine the accuracy of screening tests for women, we retrieved and critically reviewed 34 articles on test performance. Results indicate that endocervical swab specimens and first-void urine specimens have similar performance when using DNA amplification tests and have better sensitivity than endocervical culture. Recurrent chlamydial infections in women have been associated with increased risks for PID and ectopic pregnancies. Pregnant women. The Second Task Force recommendations for screening pregnant women were based on two major studies demonstrating improved pregnancy outcomes following treatment of chlamydial infection. We identified no recent studies on this topic in our literature search. Very few studies describe risk factors for chlamydial infection in pregnant women. Nonculture testing techniques appear to perform well in pregnant women, although studies are limited. Men. No studies described the effectiveness of screening or early treatment for men in reducing transmission to women or in preventing acute infections or complications in men. Studies of prevalence rates and risk factors for chlamydial infection in men are limited. Age lower than 25 years is the strongest known risk factor cited so far. Results of urethral swab specimens compared to first-void urine specimens were similar for DNA amplification tests. DNA amplification techniques are more sensitive than culture.

Conclusions

Screening women for Chlamydia trachomatis reduces the incidence of PID, and it is associated with reductions in prevalence of infection in uncontrolled studies. No studies were found to determine whether screening asymptomatic men would reduce transmission or prevent acute infections or complications. Age is the strongest risk factor for men and women. A variety of tests can detect chlamydial infection with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, including new DNA amplification tests that use either endocervical swabs in women, urethral swabs in men, or first-void urine specimens from men and women.

### Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^112phBFv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We have provided new, statistically rigorous estimates for the duration of untreated chlamydia infection in men, synthesizing data from several studies. The estimates add to a growing understanding of chlamydia epidemiology and natural history, which is essential if we are to make improved public health decisions. Given the importance of knowing the duration of untreated infection for understanding the natural history of chlamydia and other infections, we recommend further study in both men and women, including extragenital infections. We recommend that large-scale screening programs retest individuals returning for treatment after testing positive, particularly those patients with long delays, who are the most informative cases. This needs to be considered urgently, before implementation of point-of-care testing closes the gap between testing and treatment, removing this opportunity to deepen our understanding and improve public health.

2.2 Study selection and data extraction

The full text of the studies deemed relevant were reviewed to determine eligibility. The studies were included using the following criteria: (1) any sexually active populations in any geographical location; (2) technology in POCT or near POCT format used as the index test for evaluating the performance in diagnosis of CT infection; (3) sufficient data, including the absolute numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables regarding sensitivity and specificity; (4) laboratory-based NAAT assay used as the reference standard; and (5) publications between January 2004 and May 2021. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) without defined outcome measure for validating the performance (i.e. defined reference assay); (2) insufficient data to construct contingency tables; (3) duplicated studies using the same index test and the same population; (4) case report, or review article; (5) inappropriate reference standard such as culture; and (6) inappropriate POCT such as gram stain or enzyme detection assay. In the case of any overlapping study, only the largest and most informative study was included. Two investigators (YZ, JL) independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to screen the titles and abstracts of studies retrieved to exclude the irrelevant articles. Subsequently, full-text publications were reviewed to decide whether the study fitted the eligibility criteria of the review. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and mutual agreement between the two investigators. For eligible studies, the following baseline characteristics of included studies were extracted by two investigators (YZ, JL) independently using the standardized form: first author's last name, year of publication, type of test, type of specimen, reference standard, sample size, economic category of the country where the evaluation was conducted, and data for determining the outcomes of interests (absolute number of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative results), as shown in Tables S1 and S2. If the exact value for each outcome was not clearly reported through the included studies, it was estimated from the related percentage. For each study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), compared with the reference standard, were calculated. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through consensus.

### Where to go to in Chlamydia control? From infection control towards infectious disease control [^114wujnP]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlamydia control strategies are based on the prevailing infectious disease paradigm that control of STIs is achieved by reducing the reproduction number (R₀) of Chlamydia trachomatis, the bacterium that causes chlamydia infection. The formula R₀ = βcD shows that the reproduction number can be reduced by preventing acquisition (reducing transmission efficiency β), limiting the partner change rate (c) and/or by reducing the duration of infectiousness (D). Behavioural interventions, such as increasing correct and consistent condom use, are primary prevention interventions to reduce transmission. Testing and treatment are secondary prevention interventions that aim to reduce the duration of infectiousness (D). As most chlamydia infections are asymptomatic, finding and treating these infections start with testing and case finding.

Early diagnosis and treatment should prevent onward transmission and individual adverse health outcomes. For HIV infection, this 'test and treat' strategy has proven to be a very effective and successful public health intervention. In the Netherlands, the number of annual new HIV diagnoses reduced by 72% in the last 10 years. However, no such trend exists for chlamydia, despite widespread opportunistic testing for asymptomatic infections (figure 1).

The Dutch National Action Plan on STI, HIV and Sexual Health 2017–2022 recommended an update of the strategies to prevent the burden of disease caused by infections with C. trachomatis ('chlamydia').

In November 2019, an invitational workshop brought together a range of national and international chlamydia experts to explore future avenues for chlamydia control in the Netherlands (see online supplemental file 1). In particular, we wanted to know the extent to which we should pursue testing for asymptomatic infections at both genital and extragenital sites. In this paper, we describe our problem analysis and the main outcome of the workshop.

We observed a total reduction in orders of 3083 blood test kits for HIV and syphilis (31%) between the two study periods with a 35% reduction in blood tests ordered by non-BME/non-MSM users and a 22% reduction in those for BME/non-MSM groups. There was very little difference in orders of tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea (< 2%) in the non-BME/non-MSM groups. We did observe a reduction in orders for chlamydia and gonorrhoea among MSM users as some chose not to test from some sites and some chose to test for HIV or syphilis only. Orders for rectal sample kits reduced by over 10% and blood tests orders were reduced by just under 6% among this group (online supplementary table 1).

To understand whether users made test choices on the basis of the information provided, we obtained data on the number of users accessing this information using web data analytics. We analysed instead a 6-month period from 1 June 2017 to 31 December 2017. During this period, just over 19 000 users visited the selection page, 15 512 users ordered a test and information on the test kits were accessed a total of 3873 times or by 20% of users.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^11136L1x]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — scope and accuracy findings state that the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons; key differences from the prior review were combining all populations into a single analytic framework, evaluating the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk, and focusing diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site-specific testing; because treatments were previously determined effective and well established, the review did not include a review of treatments. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections; convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk; and inadequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk. In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 76 136 participants using a risk score reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73, and one study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.

### Choose to test: self-selected testing for sexually transmitted infections within an online service [^1147Xyat]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the outcomes of user-led, choice of test within an online sexual health service.

Methods

We analysed routinely collected data from a free, online sexual health service in Essex, UK that enabled users to select their tests. The service website provided information on all sexually transmitted infections, recommended a testing package based on sexuality and ethnicity, and invited users to modify this if they chose. Data on orders were analysed for the 6 months before (May–October 2016) and after (October–April 2017) implementation.

Results

We compared 7550 orders from 6253 users before and 9785 orders from 7772 users after implementation. There was no difference in the proportion of chlamydia (p = 0.57) or gonorrhoea (p = 0.79) tests that were positive between the two periods. HIV and syphilis positives were too few in our sample during both periods for analysis. During implementation, men who have sex with men (530 users) were offered genital, rectal and oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing plus HIV and syphilis testing. In 17.2% of orders, users removed tests. Black or ethnic minority users excluding those who reported as men who have sex with men (805 users) were offered chlamydia, gonorrhoea and HIV testing. In 77.9% of orders, users added a test. All other users were offered chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests only. In 65.2% of orders, users added tests. We observed a reduction in orders of 3083 blood tests (31%).

Conclusion

Users engaged with the 'choose to test' intervention. Although a majority added tests, the intervention was cost saving by reducing the HIV and syphilis tests ordered.

### Comparison of platforms for testing antibody responses against theAntigen pgp3 [^115CED4X]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Antibody responses to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) antigens may be useful tools for surveillance of trachoma by estimating cumulative prevalence of infection within a population. Data were compared from three different platforms-multiplex bead array (MBA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow assay (LFA)-measuring antibody responses against the CT antigen protein plasmid gene product 3 (Pgp3). Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of specimens testing antibody positive from a set of dried blood spots from Tanzanian 1–9-year olds who were positive for CT nucleic acid of all nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive individuals (N = 103). The sensitivity of the LFA could not be determined because of the use of dried blood spots for this test; this specimen type has yet to be adapted to LFA. Specificity was defined as the proportion of sera from U.S. and Bolivian 1–9-year olds that had previously tested negative by the Chlamydia microimmunofluorescence (MIF) assay testing negative to Pgp3-specific antibodies (N = 154). The sensitivity for MBA and ELISA was the same-93.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.3–98.1). Specificity ranged across platforms from 96.1 (95% CI: 91.8–98.2) to 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2–100). ELISA performance was similar regardless of whether the plates were precoated or freshly coated with antigen. Sensitivity and specificity of control panels were similar if the cutoff was determined using receiver operator curves or a finite mixture model, but the cutoffs themselves differed by approximately 0.5 OD using the different methodologies. These platforms show good sensitivity and specificity and show good agreement between tests at a population level, but indicate variability for ELISA outcomes depending on the cutoff determination methodology.

Abstract.

Antibody responses to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) antigens may be useful tools for surveillance of trachoma by estimating cumulative prevalence of infection within a population. Data were compared from three different platforms — multiplex bead array (MBA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and lateral flow assay (LFA) — measuring antibody responses against the CT antigen protein plasmid gene product 3 (Pgp3). Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of specimens testing antibody positive from a set of dried blood spots from Tanzanian 1–9-year olds who were positive for CT nucleic acid of all nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive individuals (N = 103). The sensitivity of the LFA could not be determined because of the use of dried blood spots for this test; this specimen type has yet to be adapted to LFA. Specificity was defined as the proportion of sera from U.S. and Bolivian 1–9-year olds that had previously tested negative by the Chlamydia microimmunofluorescence (MIF) assay testing negative to Pgp3-specific antibodies (N = 154). The sensitivity for MBA and ELISA was the same — 93.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.3–98.1). Specificity ranged across platforms from 96.1 (95% CI: 91.8–98.2) to 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2–100). ELISA performance was similar regardless of whether the plates were precoated or freshly coated with antigen. Sensitivity and specificity of control panels were similar if the cutoff was determined using receiver operator curves or a finite mixture model, but the cutoffs themselves differed by approximately 0.5 OD using the different methodologies. These platforms show good sensitivity and specificity and show good agreement between tests at a population level, but indicate variability for ELISA outcomes depending on the cutoff determination methodology.

### Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^111NBRMb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Some of the most informative data on the duration of untreated infection comes from studies in which diagnosed cases were retested at a later date, having received no treatment between the 2 tests. If the time between testing and retesting is known, then the proportion of cases who had recovered in the interval provides information on the recovery rate. A recent report showed how this type of evidence from multiple studies could be synthesized to estimate the rate of chlamydia clearance and mean duration of infection in women. Here, we apply the same method to estimate the rate of chlamydia clearance in men.

Test interpretation and recommended actions

Anti-t-TG = anti-tissue transglutaminase FOB = faecal occult blood; PMSC = progressive motile sperm cells; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PSA = prostate specific antigen; STI = sexually transmitted infection; TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone.

Twelve (40%) tests (seven test types) recommended repeat testing after a negative test result. The three covid-19 tests (T20-T22) recommended repeat testing 1–2 days after a negative test result, whereas one also suggested "re-testing with a (more sensitive) molecular test (PCR) [polymerase chain reaction]" (T21). The HIV test (T8) recommended retesting 12 weeks after an initial negative test result owing to the potential for delayed seroconversion. Three of the four menopause tests (T2-T4) recommended retesting between one month and 60 days after a negative test result in the continued presence of symptoms. Both vitamin D tests (T27 and T28) indicated that the test could be used to monitor vitamin D levels to decide whether vitamin D supplements should be taken. The chlamydia test (T9) recommended "regular" testing, with no further details. One of two faecal occult blood tests (T13) recommended "annual use of the test over the age of 40", and the prostate cancer test (T15) recommended testing "regularly" between ages 50 and 75 years or in the case of a "family history".

Seven tests indicated treatment or health behaviour changes. The two vaginal infection tests (T10 and T11) recommended treatment should be obtained after a positive test result either over the counter or from a doctor, depending on the type of infection detected. The chlamydia test (T9) suggested that sexual partners should be tested if the test result was positive, and the HIV test (T8) suggested protection should be used if the test result was positive. The three covid-19 tests (T20-T22) all stated that rules and protective measures should be followed if the test results were positive. Two of the four menopause tests explicitly stated that results should not be used as the basis for discontinuing contraception (T3 and T4).

### Rapid point of care test for detecting urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in nonpregnant women and men at reproductive age [^116tJSpU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis (C trachomatis) is one of the most frequent sexually transmitted infections and a source of deleterious effects on the reproductive health of men and women. Because this infection is likely asymptomatic and is associated with subfertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pain, its presence needs to be confirmed. Technologies available for the diagnosis of C trachomatis infection can be classified into tests performed in a laboratory and rapid tests at the point of care (POC tests). Laboratory-based tests include culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), direct fluorescent antibody, nucleic acid hybridization, and transformation tests. Rapid tests include solid-phase EIA and solid-phase optical immunoassay. POC tests can be performed within 30 minutes without the need for expensive or sophisticated equipment. The principal advantage of this technology is the immediate presentation of results with the subsequent possibility to start the treatment of infected patients immediately.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point-of-care (POC) testing for detecting urogenital C trachomatis infection in nonpregnant women and men of reproductive age, as verified with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) as the reference standard.

Search Methods

In November 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched Web of Science, two trials registries and an abstract database. We screened reference lists of included studies for additional references.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of symptomatic or asymptomatic nonpregnant women and men reproductive age. Included trials should have prospectively enrolled participants without previous diagnostic testing, co-infections or complications and consecutively or through random sampling at primary or secondary care facilities. Only studies reporting that all participants received the index test and the reference standard and presenting 2 x 2 data were eligible for inclusion. We excluded diagnostic case-control studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Two review authors independently, and in duplicate, assessed eligibility, extracted data, and carried out quality assessment. We resolved differences through consensus or by involving a third review author. We assessed studies for methodological quality using QUADAS-2 and used meta-analysis to combine the results of studies using the bivariate approach to estimate the expected sensitivity and specificity values. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria and explored sources of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included a total of 19 studies, with 13,676 participants, that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of POC tests for C trachomatis infection in nonpregnant women and men of reproductive age, as verified with NAATs as the reference standard. Rapid tests were provided by the distributors in nine studies. Seven studies recruited a predominantly high risk or symptomatic population; the studies were conducted in America, Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania, with a median prevalence of 10% (range 8% to 28%); nine different brands were assessed. The mean sensitivity for rapid tests for detecting urogenital infection was 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.58; low-quality evidence) with a mean specificity of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99; moderate-quality evidence). We explored sources of heterogeneity by looking into differences in diagnostic accuracy according to the specimen (endocervical versus urine or vaginal), symptoms among participants (symptomatic versus asymptomatic), and setting (low/middle-income versus high-income countries). Likelihood ratio tests were not significantly different in terms of sensitivity or specificity by specimen (P = 0.27) or setting (P = 0.28); for this reason, these covariates do not appear to explain the observed variability. Included studies did not provide enough information to assess the 'presence of symptoms' covariate. We downgraded the quality of evidence because of some limitations in applicability and heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the results of this systematic review, the POC test based on antigen detection has suboptimal sensitivity but good specificity. Performance of this test translates, on average, to a 52% chance of mistakenly indicating absence of infection and a 2% chance of mistakenly pointing to the presence of this condition. Because of its deleterious consequences for reproductive health, and considering the current availability of safe and effective interventions to treat C trachomatis infection, the POC screening strategy should not be based on a rapid diagnostic test for antigen detection. Research in this topic should focus on different technologies.

Key Points

Question

How does a new point-of-care assay for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea compare with commercially available laboratory-based molecular diagnostics?

Findings

This cross-sectional study including 1523 women and 922 men found that a new molecular point-of-care assay was associated with excellent performance compared with laboratory-based molecular diagnostics for vaginal swab samples and has been cleared for use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Male urine samples were associated with good performance in this assay and are undergoing continuing evaluation.

Meaning

Highly sensitive, rapid chlamydia and gonorrhea testing at the point of care is now a possibility that can support same-day testing and treatment strategies.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^1113ymWY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The availability of a highly accurate POC assay for detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea that is easy to perform may encourage adoption of testing in clinical settings that have not previously adopted a routine screening process. One can now envision young women going into their physician's office for routine reproductive health care visits and being asked to provide a self-obtained vaginal swab sample for their routine sexual health screening. Destigmatizing STI testing by creating a positive, normative, and convenient process for this type of screening has the potential to move us toward the goal of 100% adherence to the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set recommendations, with an improvement in the sexual health of the entire population associated with the earlier identification of infections and a reduction in transmission probabilities. In light of the recently released STI surveillance data from the CDC, changes in process are needed, and the new POC assay described here can be an addition to our toolbox. Future research will need to evaluate the performance of this POC assay for use in rectal and oropharyngeal samples to support CDC guidelines for screening among people taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis and men who have sex with men.

### Recommendations for providing quality sexually transmitted diseases clinical services, 2020 [^116tssAb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory

Tests cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available for identifying STDs. Certain tests can be performed as point-of-care tests, either on site or through a clinical laboratory with rapid turnaround times. Providing results during the same clinic visit is ideal. Typically, these tests are waived by CLIA or are moderately complex. Use of commercially available NAATs for gonorrhea and chlamydia is cleared by FDA for genital tract specimens.

Laboratory tests for identifying STDs are important for screening and diagnostic purposes. Screening tests are the only method for identifying asymptomatic infections. To improve rates of recommended screenings, primary care and STD specialty care providers can implement structural-level policy interventions in clinical settings, such as standing orders for the registration staff, express visits, specimen panels, and reflex testing. For patients, a sexual history and risk assessment can help determine whether a screening test is necessary. For patients with STD-related symptoms, both a physical examination and laboratory testing are needed along with a sexual history and risk assessment to determine the possible cause of symptoms and provide an opportunity for the diagnosis of other, unrecognized infections. In STD specialty care settings, same-day diagnosis and treatment are core functions for both health care and public health outcomes. With rapid laboratory results, treatment delays are reduced, resulting in fewer complications, less onward transmission of STDs, less time spent tracking and verifying treatment for those who fail to return after a positive test result, and more prudent use of antimicrobials based on less empiric treatment. STD specialty care settings should offer same-day diagnostic testing and treatment for patients with STD-related conditions and for sex partners of patients with a diagnosed sexually transmitted infection. Laboratory recommendations are outlined (Box 6).

To prepare for the development of the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, the CDC convened a committee of expert consultants in June 2019 to discuss recent abstracts and published literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of sexually transmitted infections. This paper summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in adolescents and adults that were reviewed and discussed for consideration in developing the guidelines. The evidence reviewed mostly focused on efficacy of doxycycline and azithromycin for urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal CT infection, CT risk factors in women, performance of CT nucleic acid amplification tests on self-collected meatal specimens in men, and performance of newer CT point-of-care tests.

1 Introduction

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 127.2million new cases of CT occur globally every year and most of them come from the resource-limited countries. Untreated CT infection in women can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Among men CT infection is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis and epididymitis. CT infection in pregnant women can contribute to the incidence of adverse obstetric outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight. In addition, genital CT infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma development. Because over 70% of CT infections in women and 50% in men are asymptomatic, effective control of the infections often relies on screening for CT followed by treatment of the infected cases. Benefits of CT screening in women have been demonstrated a reduction in rates of PID, and prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes among pregnant women. Screening for CT is largely subject to the tests available and accessible to the target populations. Laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provide a highly accurate diagnosis but are usually neither affordable nor accessible in the developing countries because they require laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel and have a high cost. In addition, delay in report of the test results may lead to the impossibility to provide timely treatment intervention. In contrast, point-­of-­care tests (POCTs) can be used in either clinic or out-of-clinic settings and allow diagnosis and treatment decisions to be made at the same visit, ensuring the immediate treatment and preventing the losses of follow-ups.

A few published systematic reviews have summarized the accuracy of POCTs for the diagnosis of urogenital CT infections using vaginal, cervical, urethral or urine samples. However, most of the POCTs included into these reviews were mainly based on antigen detection in lateral flow format (AD-based POCTs). Since the publication of the latest review, many studies on performance of POCTs, particularly NAAT-based POCTs, have been published. Additionally, increasing rates of anorectal CT infections among men and women call for requirement of these diagnostics to be applied in rectal specimens. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to update the diagnostic performance of AD- and NAAT-based POCTs for diagnoses of urogenital, anorectal or oropharyngeal CT infections.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: an evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114Jac4n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United States, with an estimated 3 million new cases annually. In 2001, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that clinicians screen all sexually active women at increased risk for infection for Chlamydia trachomatis.

Purpose

To summarize a systematic evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF in preparation for an update of its 2001 recommendation.

Data Sources

English-language articles identified in PubMed between July 2000 and July 2005. Additional articles were identified by bibliographic reviews and discussions with experts. A total of 452 articles were identified.

Study Selection

Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for each of 3 key questions. For studies of screening in nonpregnant women at increased risk, review was limited to randomized, controlled trials. For other groups, both randomized, controlled studies and nonrandomized, prospective, controlled studies were included.

Data Abstraction

Using standardized forms, staff of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality abstracted data on study design, setting, sample, randomization, blinding, results, and harms.

Data Synthesis

Only 1 new study met inclusion criteria. This poor-quality study of the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection among nonpregnant women at increased risk found that screening was associated with a lower prevalence of chlamydial infection and fewer reported cases of pelvic inflammatory disease at 1-year follow-up.

Limitations

No new evidence was found on screening in pregnant women, nonpregnant women not at increased risk, or men.

Conclusions

A systematic review found a small amount of new evidence to inform the USPSTF as it updates its recommendations regarding screening for chlamydial infection. There are large gaps in the evidence about screening men to improve health outcomes in women.

### Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^112FTa3c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

We used a mixture-of-exponentials model for the duration of untreated chlamydia infection in men. The model allows for any new infection to take one of several courses, each with a different clearance rate. Each infection thus belongs to one category, or "class". Within each class, durations of infection are exponentially distributed with mean equal to the reciprocal of the clearance rate for that class. To determine the appropriate number of classes, we compared the fit to the data of models comprised of 1, 2, and 3 classes. We also investigated a model in which clearance rates had a continuous Gamma distribution, rather than falling into discrete classes. The model also recognizes different study types: clinic-based studies recruit individuals who present for testing, perhaps because symptoms have recently developed or because of contact with an infected person. They therefore represent recent exposures and incident infections. Screening studies recruit members of the general population, more representative of prevalent infections. The proportion of detected infections belonging to faster-clearing infection classes is lower in screening studies than in patients seeking care after exposure to infection because these short infections clear quickly and, thus, are less common in the pool of prevalent infections.

We used 3 published literature reviews to identify relevant studies in which chlamydia-infected men were retested at a later date, having received no treatment in the interim. We updated these searches to cover the period since the original review but found no further relevant evidence. The search strategy for these updates is provided online at. The studies provide information on natural (rather than antibiotic-induced) chlamydia clearance. In some cases, this formed the placebo or no-treatment arm of a comparison between different drugs; in others, it represented the delay between collecting a sample and the patient returning for treatment. In 1 case, patients were diagnosed during an army medical examination, and treatment was not actively sought by, or offered to, the asymptomatic patients.

Eight studies were included and 165 men were retested altogether, at a total of 18 time points after the original diagnostic test. Six studies (13 time points) were clinic-based and 2 (5 time points) were screening studies. Five studies (11 time points) used culture diagnosis methods; 3 (7 time points) used nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Six (12 time points) diagnosed infection using urethral swabs, and 2 (6 time points) used urine samples. The data are summarized in Table 1. Citations for the studies used are provided online with the search strategy.

### Confirming positive results of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for Chlamydia trachomatis: all NAATs are not created equal [^111KSsf4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended confirming positive screening tests for Chlamydia trachomatis when positive predictive values are < 90%. It is accepted that less sensitive tests (i.e., culture and immunoassays) should not be used to confirm the results of more sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). We show that the same principle applies when NAATs are used for confirmation.

### 2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^111BLPNQ]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to follow-up testing, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain repeated testing in 3–6 months to detect reinfection in young patients (< 25 years) testing positive for C. trachomatis.

### Service user experiences of using internet-based testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs): a qualitative study [^115bRKU3]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Internet-based testing for sexually transmitted infections allows individuals to order a self-sampling kit online, send samples to a central laboratory and receive their results electronically, reducing the need to attend a clinic unless for treatment. Its usage has grown rapidly in many high-income countries, such as England, where it now accounts for 44% of tests within the National Chlamydia Screening Programme. However, there is limited data on the experiences of service users, which may offer insights into low uptake and poor return rates among some high-incidence populations.

Methods

Participants were recruited via sexual health clinics and the website of an internet-based testing service. Purposive sampling was used to ensure a diversity of genders, sexualities and ethnic backgrounds were included. Semistructured interviews were conducted by phone, email and messenger services and explored participants' perceptions and experiences of both internet-based and clinic-based testing. Data underwent thematic analysis.

Results

We interviewed 17 participants. Internet-based testing appealed to many due to the privacy and convenience it offered over clinic-based testing. Although most were positive about their experience of internet-based testing, many found the process of finger-prick blood sampling extremely challenging and this contributed to concerns from some participants that test results may be inaccurate. A minority of participants missed the opportunity that clinic-based testing offered to discuss symptoms or concerns with staff. Participants overwhelmingly found the process of receiving test results by short message service (SMS) acceptable and preferable to alternatives.

Conclusions

Internet-based testing is viewed positively by most users but uptake may be improved if providers emphasise the privacy and convenience it offers, as well as the accuracy of self-sampling. Providers should also consider measures to address user concerns around blood sampling and access to specialist advice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to NAATs, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to use first-void urine specimens for men (up to 20 mL sampled ≥ 1 hour after previous micturition) and vulvo-vaginal swabs for women (either healthcare worker- or self-collected) as the first choice for diagnosis of urogenital chlamydial infections with NAATs.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to NAATs, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend to do not test semen specimens due to the good correlation between first-void urine positivity and semen positivity, the ease of obtaining first-void urine, and the difficulty in excluding that C. trachomatis detected in semen is not solely from the urethra.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113F8vYt]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician implementation — screening tests specifies to test for chlamydia and gonorrhea using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), with NAATs able to test urogenital and extragenital sites including urine, endocervical, vaginal, male urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal, and both infections can be tested at the same time with the same specimen; NAATs are usually used because their sensitivity and specificity are high, the US Food and Drug Administration approves NAATs for these specimen types, urine NAATs are at least as sensitive as endocervical, clinician- or self-collected vaginal, or urethral specimens, and the same specimen can test for both infections.

### Systematic reviews of point-of-care tests for the diagnosis of urogenitalinfections [^112o2ib5]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Background

WHO estimates that 131million new cases of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections occur globally every year. Most infections are asymptomatic. Untreated infection in women can lead to severe complications. Screening and treatment of at-risk populations is a priority for prevention and control.

Objectives

To summarise systematic reviews of the performance characteristics of commercially available point-of-care tests (POCT) for screening and diagnosis of urogenital CT infection.

Methods

Two separate systematic reviews covering the periods 2004–2013 and 2010–2015 were conducted on rapid CT POCTs. Studies were included if tests were evaluated against a valid reference standard.

Results

In the first review, 635 articles were identified, of which 11 were included. Nine studies evaluated the performance of eight antigen detection rapid POCTs on 10280 patients and two studies evaluated a near-patient nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on 3518 patients. Pooled sensitivity of antigen detection tests was 53%, 37% and 63% for cervical swabs, vaginal swabs and male urine, and specificity was 99%, 97% and 98%, respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the near-patient NAAT for all specimen types were > 98%and 99.4%, respectively. The second review identified two additional studies on four antigen detection POCTs with sensitivities and specificities of 22.7%-37.7%and 99.4%-100%, respectively. A new two-step 15min rapid POCT using fluorescent nanoparticles showed performance comparable to that of near-patient NAATs.

Conclusions

The systematic reviews showed that antigen detection POCTs for CT, although easy to use, lacked sufficient sensitivity to be recommended as a screening test. A near-patient NAAT shows acceptable performance as a screening or diagnostic test but requires electricity, takes 90min and is costly. More affordable POCTs are in development.

### An evaluation of an online STI service across london: reviewing uptake, utility and outcomes over a 4-year period [^1173Dv1v]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Return rates are reported for each testing episode, but the testing pattern for unique users is not considered in these outcomes. For example, SHL users may have tested recently with SHL or elsewhere for HIV and could explain why return rates for HIV blood samples are not as high as chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAATs. Triangulation of online STI testing data with clinic-based sexual health service data and unique users is needed to better understand HIV and STI testing patterns. It is important for future planning of OPSS services to consider the wastage of non-returned blood and NAATs kits. While SHL has the highest return rates, up to 32.3% of blood testing kits and 20.5% of NAATs are not being used. However, this needs to be balanced against the benefits of OPSS. For instance, 26% of users of the UK Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) national online HIV testing service had never previously tested for HIV, and 19.4% of users in our evaluation with either chlamydia or gonorrhoea negative or positive results had only used OPSS services.

### Protective immunity to Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection: evidence from human studies [^114nbq8Y]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background. Some screening and treatment programs implemented to control Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections and their complications have shown initial reductions in infection prevalence, followed by increases to preprogram levels or higher. One hypothesis is that treatment shortens duration of infection, attenuates development of protective immunity, and thereby, increases risk of reinfection. Methods. A literature review was undertaken to assess evidence supporting the concept of protective immunity, its characteristics, and its laboratory correlates in human chlamydial infection. The discussion is organized around key questions formulated in preparation for the Chlamydia Immunology and Control Expert Advisory Meeting held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April 2008. Results. Definitive human studies are not available, but cross-sectional studies show that chlamydia prevalence, organism load, and concordance rates in couples decrease with age, and organism load is lower in those with repeat infections, supporting the concept of protective immunity. The protection appears partial and can be overcome after reexposure, similar to what has been found in rodent models of genital infection. No data are available to define the duration of infection required to confer a degree of immunity or the time course of immunity after resolution of untreated infection. In longitudinal studies involving African sex workers, a group presumed to have frequent and ongoing exposure to chlamydial infection, interferon-g production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to chlamydial heat-shock protein 60 was associated with low risk of incident infection. In cross-sectional studies, relevant T helper 1-type responses were found in infected persons, paralleling the studies in animal models. Conclusions. The data support the concept that some degree of protective immunity against reinfection develops after human genital infection, although it appears, at best, to be partial. It is likely that factors besides population levels of immunity contribute to trends in prevalence observed in screening and treatment programs. Future studies of protective immunity in humans will require longitudinal follow-up of individuals and populations, frequent biological and behavioral sampling, and special cohorts to help control for exposure.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NfZcb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Statistical analysis

For each included study, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to express performance of the evaluated assay for diagnosing CT infection using laboratory-based NAAT as a reference standard. Heterogeneity across the included studies was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and the I² test. Heterogeneity was indicative when P-value < 0.05 (Q statistic) and/or I² > 50%, and then a random effects model was performed to calculate the performance estimates including the pooled sensitivity and specificity, and DOR which represents the overall diagnostic accuracy. A fixed effect model would be used when P-value0.05 (Q statistic) and I² 50%. We defined sources of heterogeneity a priori and we included the following factors: POCT type (AD-based versus NAAT-based), POCT specimen (cervical, vaginal, rectal or urine), and study setting (low/middle-income versus high-income countries). In addition, the estimate of summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curve was plotted and the area under SROC curve (AUC) served as a proxy of diagnostic accuracy. An area under the SROC curve between 0.90 and 1.00 is considered as excellent diagnostic accuracy, between 0.80 and 0.90 as very good, between 0.70 and 0.80 as good, between 0.60 and 0.70 as sufficient, between 0.50 and 0.60 as bad and less than 0.5 as not useful. Using the Moses–Littenberg method, Q* values were calculated from the SROC curve by the point where sensitivity equaled specificity and values of Q* near 1.0 indicate that SROC curves are snugged up near the desirable northwest corner where sensitivity and specificity are both 1.00. A two-sample Z-test was conducted to evaluate a significant difference in AUC and Q * values between two diagnostic modalities (AD-based POCTs using cervical specimens vs. AD-based POCTs using vaginal specimens), and P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Probability of publication bias was also considered and evaluated by Deeks et al. funnel plot, and P -value < 0.05 was considered indicative of publication bias. All analysis were performed by using STATA version 14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA), Meta-DiSc version 1.4 and Review Manager version 5.3. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019140544.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^116UqcGs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and endometritis — laboratory diagnosis and specimens are organized as follows: For mixed anaerobic organisms, vaginal microbiota, Enterobacterales, enterococci, Group A and B streptococci, Mycoplasma, and Actinomyces spp., diagnostic procedures include blood cultures to assess unusual causes of PID or endometritis, Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, and tissue for histological evaluation; optimum specimens include blood, 2 separate sets, 20 mL each (venipuncture collections), aspiration of endometrium, tubo-ovarian abscess and/or fallopian tube contents, and endometrial biopsy; transport guidance includes inject into blood culture bottles, RT; place in or inject into a sterile anaerobic container, RT, 30 min–1 h; sterile container, RT, 30 min; and formalin container, RT, 30 min–24 h. For Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is listed with urine or endocervical swab and laboratory-provided transport device, RT, 48 h. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV EIA-antibody is listed on serum with transport in a clot tube, RT, 24 h. A table note states Actinomyces spp. is an uncommon cause of PID.

### Detection of Treponema pallidum DNA during early syphilis stages in peripheral blood, oropharynx, ano-rectum and urine as a proxy for transmissibility [^115FCiXa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Performing TP-PCR on extra-genital samples could be useful as an additional diagnostic tool, especially to identify early incubating infections within the serological window phase. Blood samples are rarely PCR positive and thus may not be useful in routine screening. Urine samples, and anal and pharyngeal swabs are frequently routinely collected for STI screening for molecular diagnosis of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections. An additional TP-NAAT assay could possibly help to diagnose early syphilis infections in patients with non-reactive serological test results, who are nevertheless suspected of having syphilis. The diagnostic value of TP-DNA assays in routine STI screening of asymptomatic persons at increased risk for syphilis should be further evaluated in larger cohorts and other routine clinic settings.

In conclusion, we frequently found TP-DNA in peripheral blood, oropharyngeal, and ano-rectal swabs, and urine collected from MSM diagnosed with early syphilis. Detection of TP-DNA in these sample types provide a better understanding of the infectious nature of early syphilis stages.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113FQsWf]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — screening recommendations and applicability states: For sexually active women, including pregnant persons, screen for chlamydia if they are 24 years or younger or 25 years or older and at increased risk for infection (Grade: B), and screen for gonorrhea if they are 24 years or younger or 25 years or older and at increased risk for infection (Grade: B). For sexually active men, the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men (I statement). The recommendation applies to sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without signs and symptoms of chlamydia or gonorrhea infection, and is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF recommendation.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115JRoWG]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users) criteria as a benchmark for developing and introducing the most appropriate diagnostic tests for resource-constrained settings. Recently, two additional criteria of R (real-time connectivity) and E (ease of specimen collection and environmental friendliness) into the original ASSURED to create a new acronym of REASSURED. Although significant progress has been made in the POC diagnostic tests for syphilis, chlamydia, gonococcal infections, and trichomonas, no POC diagnostic tests that fully meet all these criteria have been completed to date. Most of AD-based POCTs for CT meet the following criteria: affordable, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, and equipment free, but the common drawback is the low sensitivity. The currently commercially available NAAT-based POCTs (such as Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG assay) are more sensitive and specific than antigen detection assays and meet many of the desirable characteristics defined by WHO for a POC devices, but affordability may be a critical concern for their introduction into the low-resource settings. To speed up the development of sexual transmitted infections (STI) POC diagnostic tests, the WHO organized an expert consultation to formulate the target product profiles (TPP) of the ideal POC diagnostic tests for CT and other STIs. TPP requires that the sensitivity of NAAT-based POCT for CT should be at least 90% and ideally 100%. The lowest specificity should be 98% and ideally 100%. The minimal acceptable time to result is up to 60 min and optimally 30 min or shorter. The currently commercially available NAAT-based POCTs for CT (such as Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG assay) in rectal swabs or urine specimens could meet the minimal requirement of the TPP in terms of the sensitivity and specificity. However, the run- time for the Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG assay is 90 min and the turn-around time between sample collection and getting the result of these POCTs is even longer. Recently, some new molecular POC diagnostic technology (such as the io CT/NG Assay, the Visby Medical Sexual Health Test and the rapid multiplex PCR assays.) has been developed and meets many of the requirements of the TPP for a POC device (sensitive, specific, rapid), which could represent important advances in the development of rapid diagnostics for sexually transmitted infections.

- symptoms or signs of urethritis in men

- cervical or vaginal discharge with risk factor for STI

- acute epididymo-orchitis in a male aged < 40 years or with risk factors for STI

- acute pelvic pain and/or symptoms or signs of pelvic inflammatory disease

- proctitis/proctocolitis according to risk

- purulent conjunctivitis in a neonate or adult

- atypical neonatal pneumonia

- persons diagnosed with other STI

- sexual contact of persons with an STI or pelvic inflammatory disease

- termination of pregnancy

- any intrauterine interventions or manipulations.

3.4 Diagnostic performance

Table 1 shows the data of sensitivity and specificity from 14 studies on AD-based POCTs and 25 on NAAT-based POCTs. The overall sensitivity ranged from 17.1% to 93.8% with a median of 51.6% for AD-based POCTs and from 50.0% to100.0% with a median of 95.6% for NAAT-based POCTs. The overall specificity was generally high for either AD-based (range 89.0%−100.0%) or NAAT-based POCTs (range 89.4%−100.0%). Table 2 shows the pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR estimates of AD-based POCTs and NAAT-based POCTs. According to the results, the overall estimates of pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR were 56% (95% CI 45%−67%), 99% (95% CI 98%−99%) and 86 (95% CI 46–163), respectively, for AD-based POCTs, and 94% (95% CI 91%−96%), 99% (95% CI 99%−99%) and 1933 (95% CI 1018–3669) for NAAT-based POCTs. AUCs were 0.941 (95% CI 0.858–1.024) and 0.996 (95% CI 0.991–0.999) for AD-based POCTs and NAAT-based POCTs, respectively; the pooled diagnostic accuracy (Q*) were 0.878 (95% CI 0.772–0.984) and 0.975 (95% CI 0.964–0.986), respectively (Fig. 2). The diagnostic sensitivity of NAAT-based POCTs was significantly higher than AD-based POCTs (P < 0.05).

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^115P8kwV]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae remain the 2 most frequently reported notifiable diseases in the United States despite decades of STI control efforts. We need new tools and strategies to make progress toward reducing these STIs that result in substantial personal and economic burden. One such important tool will be POC tests that support the provision of single-visit testing and treatment clinical services. Previously commercialized POC assays relied on antigen detection; while they had advantages compared with culture (eg, not requiring viable organisms and supporting testing and treatment) at the time they were developed and approved by the FDA, in the molecular era we now know that the sensitivity of these assays is likely as low as 40% to 60%. Furthermore, antigen-based assays were for chlamydia only, as there has never been an FDA-approved antigen assay for detection of gonorrhea. Therefore, public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, developed syndromic management guidelines to allow testing and treatment without the use of any diagnostic assays while simultaneously calling for improved POC tests. Syndromic management is known to be highly inaccurateand, by definition, does not support sexual health care, such as screening, among asymptomatic people.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116RtDFN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Description

Update of 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations about screening sexually active adolescents and adults for chlamydial infection.

Methods

The USPSTF weighed the benefits (improved fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and infection transmission) and harms (anxiety, relationship problems, and unnecessary treatment of false-positive results) of chlamydial screening identified in their 2001 recommendations and the accompanying systematic review of English-language articles published between July 2000 and July 2005.

Recommendations

Screen for chlamydial infection in all sexually active nonpregnant young women age 24 years or younger and for older nonpregnant women who are at increased risk. (A recommendation) Screen for chlamydial infection in all pregnant women age 24 years or younger and in older pregnant women who are at increased risk. (B recommendation) Do not routinely screen for chlamydial infection in women age 25 years or older, regardless of whether they are pregnant, if they are not at increased risk. (C recommendation) Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial infection for men. (I statement).

### Recommendations for the laboratory-based detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae – 2014 [^115dPxn9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report updates CDC's 2002 recommendations regarding screening tests to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections (CDC. Screening tests to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections-2002. MMWR 2002;51[No. RR-15]) and provides new recommendations regarding optimal specimen types, the use of tests to detect rectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections, and circumstances when supplemental testing is indicated. The recommendations in this report are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available tests, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. The performance of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) with respect to overall sensitivity, specificity, and ease of specimen transport is better than that of any of the other tests available for the diagnosis of chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Laboratories should use NAATs to detect chlamydia and gonorrhea except in cases of child sexual assault involving boys and rectal and oropharyngeal infections in prepubescent girls and when evaluating a potential gonorrhea treatment failure, in which case culture and susceptibility testing might be required. NAATs that have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections are recommended as screening or diagnostic tests because they have been evaluated in patients with and without symptoms. Maintaining the capability to culture for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis in laboratories throughout the country is important because data are insufficient to recommend nonculture tests in cases of sexual assault in prepubescent boys and extragenital anatomic site exposure in prepubescent girls. N. gonorrhoeae culture is required to evaluate suspected cases of gonorrhea treatment failure and to monitor developing resistance to current treatment regimens. Chlamydia culture also should be maintained in some laboratories to monitor future changes in antibiotic susceptibility and to support surveillance and research activities such as detection of lymphogranuloma venereum or rare infections caused by variant or mutated C. trachomatis.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^116cuUfY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the last several years, there have been sustained increases in rates of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) in the United States as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since 2013, the rate of chlamydia infection has increased by 25%, while the rate of gonococcal infection has increased by 74% despite the availability of highly sensitive and specific laboratory-based molecular diagnostic tools for detection of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This increase is concerning because these STIs can increase HIV transmissionand have the potential to increase rates of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and tubal factor infertilityamong untreated women. These preventable sequelae of untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea infections are estimated to cost the US health care system billions of dollars per year.

These increases in rates, despite national recommendations, for at least annual screening of women younger than 25 years, men who have sex with men, and people taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis, coincide with reductions in funding for STI control programs and specialized STI clinical services. As a result of the reduced capacity of STI clinics to provide services that include screening, primary care professionals are expected to cover the gap in services. However, according to the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, at least one-half of women in the eligible age range who have an encounter with the health care system are not screened per CDC guidelines.

Further exacerbating our inability to control these STIs is the current reliance on either patients returning to receive treatment after laboratory test results are available or patients receiving treatment based on epidemiologic prediction of the best treatment based on clinical signs and patient-reported symptoms. In the first case, there are delays of usually 7 to 10 days between the initial office visit and treatment based on laboratory test results, which introduces the potential during that interval for infections to be transmitted to sexual partners and provides an opportunity for the development of PID. To avoid these outcomes, many practices, including STI clinics and emergency departments, provide epidemiologic treatment, or syndromic management, for chlamydia and gonorrhea. This practice can lead to undertreatment and overtreatment of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Treating for chlamydia or gonorrhea when the organisms may not be present should be discouraged for good antibiotic stewardship.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — biological understanding and clinical presentation: Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in women, untreated infections may progress to PID-related complications such as chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, or infertility, and infection may also be transmitted to sex partners and newborn children; accurate screening tests and effective antibiotic treatments are available for chlamydia and gonorrhea. In men, gonococcal infections are more commonly symptomatic compared with women, and serious complications from infection are less common in men.

4 Discussion

Chlamydial infections are still a major public health problem globally and the importance of introducing POCTs as one of strategic components for prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections has been widely recognized, particularly in the resource-limited countries. Advancement of POCTs would allow the delivery of etiology-based diagnosis to move from centralised laboratory-based testing to a clinic-based approach closer to the setting in which patients seek healthcare or community-based approach through self-testing of target populations. Hence, these approaches with POCTs would offer an important opportunity to make a rapid diagnosis of the infections for treatment, and initiate partner notification or other interventions in the same clinic visit.

In 2017, Kelly et al.published a systematic review of rapid POCTs of CT in the urogenital tract, which included 12 studies on AD-based POCTs from 2006 to 2016, and 2 studies on NAAT-based POCTs (Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG) from 2012 to 2013. Since then, a couple of studies on evaluation of AD-based POCTs including the Chlamydia Rapid Test (CRT) Device in South Africa in 2016and the Cortez OneStep Chlamydia RapiCard™ insta test in Zimbabwe in 2017and more studies on NAAT-based POCTs including commercial NAAT-based POCT (Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG and binx CT/NG assay) and NAAT-based POCTs under development had been published. In our systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified 39 studies with 68 records assessing the performance of AD- or NAAT-based POCTs for diagnosis of CT infections in different anatomical sites in men and women, published over the past 17 years from January 2004 to May 2021.

### An evaluation of an online STI service across london: reviewing uptake, utility and outcomes over a 4-year period [^114e9ScR]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Setting

SHL provides Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), Neisseria gonorrhoea (gonorrhoea), HIV and Treponema pallidum (syphilis) testing to all users, and hepatitis B and C testing based on risk, to London residents aged 16 years or older.

Users register with SHL via a webpage. To obtain an STI test kit, the user completes an online consultation form covering demographics, sexual history, sexual behaviour, lifestyle and safeguarding questions. Consultation forms determine appropriateness for remote STI testing pathways. For example, if users had symptoms prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were redirected to clinic-based services. Once the user has completed the consultation form, they order an STI test kit and can collect it from a clinic-based sexual health service (a 'smartkit') or request postal delivery (postal kit).

The SHL consultation form and clinical service have evolved during the analysis period. Major changes were introduced in April 2019, March 2020 and March 2021 and details related to this analysis are in table 1 and the online supplemental appendix.

Table 1
SHL service changes and data management of variables

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) uses Roche Cobas from self-sampled urine, vaginal, anal and/or throat specimens. Blood testing uses Roche Elecsys Duo fifth-generation HIV test from self-obtained finger-prick sampling into a microtube vial (400–600 μL capillary blood required). HIV screening is provided by SHL and confirmation testing is referred to clinic-based services. Therefore, only reactive HIV test outcomes are reported in this analysis. If a HIV test result was inconclusive (eg, insufficient or equivocal), a second blood HIV test kit would be offered and dispatched to the user via a specific weblink. This is known as a HIV direct order. Syphilis and hepatitis B and C testing was excluded from this analysis. Results are communicated via an online web portal, text message and/or email (depending on service user preferences) and by phone for reactive blood test results, with linkage into clinic-based services depending on the user preference.

High risk concerns in equipment include (A) dipsticks having no orientation mark (potentially resulting in people using the wrong end of the dipstick (T1); fig 2 I); (B) no labelling of T (test) and C (control) marks on the dipstick or the instructions, and so the results could be read wrong (T1, T8, T9, T14; fig 2 I, K, S); (C) no sterile pot provided in an infection based test (T12); (D) marks on lateral flow test cassette not being explained (T15-T17); (E) errors in the labelling of the thyroid pipette within the IFU (T24), which meant it was not clear how much blood should be collected (fig 3 F, G).

The sampling process (F) for using plastic pipettes to collect capillary finger prick samples was regarded as a high risk concern in eight tests because it did not guarantee adequate blood samples (T15-T17, T24-T28). Five study team members tried to follow the instructions to collect these samples, but only one was successful, with inadequate blood volumes, samples quickly congealing, and bubbles in the pipette (fig 2 A-D). The sampling instructions (G) were inadequate or challenging: the direction for the chlamydia test (T9), to "swab through the vagina as far as the neck of the womb" (fig 3 C), could risk false negatives if self-sampling was inadequate; visual directions on how to collect a midstream urine sample (H) required for a bacterial test (T1, T3/T4, T23) were inadequate.

Increased STBBI detection rates

Prior to the intervention bundle, only 3/200 (1.5%) new intakes were diagnosed with an STBBI. This included two HCV and one CT diagnosis, despite only 13% (25/200) undergoing screening for at least one STBBI. Postintervention, 8% (27/349) of the 349 new intakes tested positive for an STBBI, revealing 18 HCV, 4 CT, 4 untreated syphilis and 1 hepatitis B diagnosis within the 3-month period. This occurred with only 49% (170/349) of new intakes being screened for at least one STBBI.

Type of screening performed — full screening, blood testing only or urine testing only

In the preintervention period, only 2% (4/200) of new intakes had full blood (HIV, syphilis, HCV and HBV) and urine (CT/GC) screening, compared with 16% (56/100) postintervention (figure 4). Preintervention, only 12% (24/200) of new intakes completed full blood work contrasting with 32% (111/349) postintervention. Additionally, preintervention, only 3% (5/200) of new intakes had their urine tested for GC/CT, while postintervention, this increased to 33% (115/349).

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VGpxH]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The advantage of this study is that it is a comprehensive meta-analysis of published studies on evaluating performance of POCTs for detecting the antigen or nucleic acid of CT using the different types of specimens and/or specimens collected from the different anatomical sites. However, our study has several limitations to be mentioned. First, only two major databases (PubMed and EmBase) were selected for searching the published studies and the search terms might not comprehensive enough, which may lead to an incomplete literature retrieval. Second, no study on evaluating AD-based POCTs on urethral swabs was found from the literature retrieval although such specimens had been recommended for detection of CT infection among males. In addition, our study did not address the sensitivity and specificity of community-based CT testing with either AD- or NAAT-based POCTs. Application of POCTs in this purpose might have different test characteristics.

In conclusion, evidence from our systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that the diagnostic performance of NAAT-based POCT is significantly better than that of AD-based POCT, especially in terms of the diagnostic sensitivity across specimens collected from different anatomic sites. Our study also highlights several areas that merit further studies. In addition to an ideal performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, further evaluation on cost-effectiveness of NAAT-based POCTs are needed because affordability has crucial implications for scaling-up this technology particularly in areas with low resources but a heavy burden of CT infection. Further efforts to address the sensitivity of the current AD-based POCTs by improving quality of specimen collection and/or result reading may be also valuable.

Box 1
Glossary of terms

GLOSSARY

Several terms describe treatment or management of individuals in whom there is significant clinical suspicion that infection may be present but without confirmed diagnosis. The specific meanings may overlap somewhat depending on context and more than one factor may be present, for example, reported contact with an infected person plus symptoms.

Presumptive treatment

Treatment given before confirmed diagnosis is made based on symptoms and clinical evaluation.

Epidemiological treatment

Treatment given based on epidemiological evidence, for example, reported sexual contact with an infected person, but could also be a particular risk group during an outbreak (symptoms usually absent).

Syndromic management

Similar to presumptive treatment, but refers to treatment in the presence of symptoms or signs indicative of infection.

Both epidemiological treatment and syndromic management are forms of presumptive treatment.

Overtreatment

Treatment of individuals for an infection who subsequently are found to test negative for that infection.

Point of care test (POCT)

A test in which the specimen can be processed and results given to the patients within the same clinic visit, that is, the specimen is not sent off-site to a laboratory for testing (also called rapid tests or near-patient tests); may be based on different methods of detection with variable test performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111ZAeaj]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden and harms note that chlamydial and gonococcal infections are often asymptomatic in men but may result in urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis; uncommon complications include reactive arthritis and disseminated gonococcal infection; urogenital positivity among men who have sex with men was 6% for chlamydia and 7% for gonorrhea across 11 jurisdictions in 2019; infections at extragenital sites are typically asymptomatic; and these infections may increase risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Potential harms of screening include false-positive or false-negative results as well as labeling and anxiety. Current practice data indicate that a review of claims from 4296 patients (2000 to 2003) found a large proportion of patients with high-risk sexual behaviors did not receive STI or HIV testing during their visit, and billing codes for 1074 high-risk patients showed men were less likely than women to be tested for chlamydia (20.7% vs 56.9%) and gonorrhea (20.7% vs 50.9%), but more likely to be tested for HIV (79.3% vs 38.8%) and syphilis (39.1% vs 27.6%).

### Screening for genital Chlamydia infection [^111KQp9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Screening of sexually active young adults to detect and treat asymptomatic infections might reduce chlamydia transmission and prevent reproductive tract morbidity, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which can cause tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of chlamydia screening versus standard care on chlamydia transmission and infection complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in men.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, DARE, PsycINFO and Web of Science electronic databases up to 14 February 2016, together with World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult women (non-pregnant and pregnant) and men comparing a chlamydia screening intervention with usual care and reporting on a primary outcome (C. trachomatis prevalence, PID in women, epididymitis in men or incidence of preterm delivery). We included non-randomised controlled clinical trials if there were no RCTs for a primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or adjudication by a third reviewer. We described results in forest plots and conducted meta-analysis where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to estimate risk ratios (RR with 95% confidence intervals, CI) in intervention vs control groups. We conducted a pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, PID incidence, according to the risks of selection and detection bias.

Main Results

We included six trials involving 359,078 adult women and men. One trial was at low risk of bias in all six specific domains assessed. Two trials examined the effect of multiple rounds of chlamydia screening on C. trachomatis transmission. A cluster-controlled trial in women and men in the general population in the Netherlands found no change in chlamydia test positivity after three yearly invitations (intervention 4.1% vs control 4.3%, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09, 1 trial, 317,304 participants at first screening invitation, low quality evidence). Uptake of the intervention was low (maximum 16%). A cluster-randomised trial in female sex workers in Peru found a reduction in chlamydia prevalence after four years (adjusted RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98, 1 trial, 4465 participants, low quality evidence). Four RCTs examined the effect of chlamydia screening on PID in women 12 months after a single screening offer. In analysis of four trials according to the intention-to-treat principle, the risk of PID was lower in women in intervention than control groups, with little evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94, I² 7%, 4 trials, 21,686 participants, moderate quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis, the estimated effect of chlamydia screening in two RCTs at low risk of detection bias (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17) was compatible with no effect and was lower than in two RCTs at high or unclear risk of detection bias (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83). The risk of epididymitis in men invited for screening, 12 months after a single screening offer, was 20% lower risk for epididymitis than in those not invited; the confidence interval was wide and compatible with no effect (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.42, 1 trial, 14,980 participants, very low quality evidence). We found no RCTs of the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy and no trials that measured the harms of chlamydia screening.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence about the effects of screening on C. trachomatis transmission is of low quality because of directness and risk of bias. There is moderate quality evidence that detection and treatment of chlamydia infection can reduce the risk of PID in women at individual level. There is an absence of RCT evidence about the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy. Future RCTs of chlamydia screening interventions should determine the effects of chlamydia screening in pregnancy, of repeated rounds of screening on the incidence of chlamydia-associated PID and chlamydia reinfection in general and high risk populations.

### Potential for point-of-care tests to reduce Chlamydia-associated burden in the United States: a mathematical modeling analysis [^113isJA8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and Analyses

We sampled 200 model simulations from the posterior distribution of the calibrated model and 40 values from the distribution of PID risk, resulting in 8000 parameter combinations used in this analysis. We assumed POCT would replace all chlamydia testing after the last year of model calibration, and the outcomes were estimated at equilibrium (40 years after POCT implementation) to quantify the intervention's maximum impact. We compared each POCT scenario against the model-estimated status quo, estimating the existing chlamydia prevention efforts. In the status quo, we maintained screening at 2015 levels, as estimated in the calibrated model, and used a constant population size. We report the relative prevalence reduction, yearly infections averted, and yearly incident PID averted for women using means and 95% credible intervals [CrIs]. Women aged 15–24 years are most affected by chlamydia and were the focus of the analysis.

We completed 2 analyses: in Analysis 1, we implemented POCT without changing the screening rate; and in Analysis 2, we assumed that POCT was implemented with a modest increase in the screening rate, facilitated by other interventions (eg, testing outside the clinic setting). We varied some of the uncertainties that can influence the impact of POCT, the first 2 of which pertain to the point-of-care test characteristics and the last 2 of which pertain to population characteristics:

The sensitivity of the point-of-care test was varied between 90–99%.
The POCT turnaround time, and how it impacts patients' willingness to wait for test results, was examined. In its most idealized form, POCT could remove 100% of LTFUs and treatment delays. This assumes the POCT results are generated quickly enough for everyone to receive their results and treatment during the same patient visit. A 20-minute wait time for POCT is the WHO goal, but only 60% of women screened for chlamydia indicated that they would be willing to wait for that amount of time, and 30% responded that they would be willing to wait 40 minutes. In Analysis 1, we varied the proportion receiving immediate treatment between 30–100%. In Analysis 2, where increased screening was implemented, 30–60% received immediate treatment.
The baseline levels of LTFU in the population in the absence of POCT were varied between 5–20% (Table 1).
The baseline level of an average treatment delay in the absence of POCT was varied between 1–3 weeks (Table 1).

### Potential for point-of-care tests to reduce Chlamydia-associated burden in the United States: a mathematical modeling analysis [^11126JAr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

(.)

Point-of-care testing (POCT) refers to testing done at or near the site of the patient's care, where the result leads to immediate diagnosis and treatment and, consequently, improvements in the patient's care. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the lack of POCT for sexually transmitted infections (STI) to be an obstacle for global STI prevention. Previous analyses, using static models, indicated that POCT for chlamydia infections could reduce the costs and incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), compared to standard testing, in the United States and in the United Kingdom. The lifetime risk of chlamydia and associated reproductive health outcomes remain at high levels in the United States, yet the population-level impact of POCT, accounting for transmission dynamics of chlamydia and current levels of chlamydia prevention, has not been evaluated.

A common feature in candidate POCT assays has been lower sensitivity, compared to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). In high-burden settings with limited access to screening, POCT with moderate sensitivity may yield significant benefits. In the United States, NAATs with high sensitivity is the standard in diagnosing chlamydial infection, and chlamydia screening has been widely implemented. Reduced test sensitivity may increase the risk of PID, as suggested in a retrospective cohort study in which women with negative antigen-based results had 17% higher odds of being diagnosed with PID over the next year, compared to women with negative NAAT results. However, POCT could bring additional benefits in settings where delays between diagnosis and treatment, as well as the loss to follow-up (LTFU) of diagnosed individuals prior to treatment, are common. Despite national guidelines recommending annual chlamydia screening in sexually active women < 25 years old, annual chlamydia screening was estimated as 47–58% among sexually active women enrolled in different healthcare plans in the United States in 2017. POCT, coupled with other interventions, could facilitate wider access to chlamydia testing.

### Potential for point-of-care tests to reduce Chlamydia-associated burden in the United States: a mathematical modeling analysis [^115US3ZN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Point-of-care testing (POCT) assays for chlamydia are being developed. Their potential impact on the burden of chlamydial infection in the United States, in light of suboptimal screening coverage, remains unclear.

Methods

Using a transmission model calibrated to data in the United States, we estimated the impact of POCT on chlamydia prevalence, incidence, and chlamydia-attributable pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) incidence, assuming status quo (Analysis 1) and improved (Analysis 2) screening frequencies. We tested the robustness of results to changes in POCT sensitivity, the proportion of patients getting treated immediately, the baseline proportion lost to follow-up (LTFU), and the average treatment delay.

Results

In Analysis 1, high POCT sensitivity was needed to reduce the chlamydia-associated burden. With a POCT sensitivity of 90%, reductions from the baseline burden only occurred in scenarios in which over 60% of the screened individuals would get immediate treatment and the baseline LTFU proportion was 20%. With a POCT sensitivity of 99% (baseline LTFU 10%, 2-week treatment delay), if everyone were treated immediately, the prevalence reduction was estimated at 5.7% (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.9–8.2%). If only 30% of tested persons would wait for results, the prevalence reduction was only 1.6% (95% CrI 1.1–2.3). POCT with 99% sensitivity could avert up to 12 700 (95% CrI 5000–22 200) PID cases per year, if 100% were treated immediately (baseline LTFU 20% and 3-week treatment delay). In Analysis 2, when POCT was coupled with increasing screening coverage, reductions in the chlamydia burden could be realized with a POCT sensitivity of 90%.

Conclusions

POCT could improve chlamydia prevention efforts if test performance characteristics are significantly improved over currently available options.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1127PEXj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant intoxication and withdrawal — laboratory testing: Laboratory testing can detect some acute issues and complications, but no research was identified on ordering routine or as-needed testing in patients presenting with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal; the CGC agreed that some tests may be considered based on symptomatology and presence of risk factors, and clinicians should consider a CBC (complete blood count), a CMP (comprehensive metabolic panel); liver function tests (LFTs); and markers for muscle breakdown (creatine kinase [CK], lactate), cardiac injury (troponin), and renal injury (BCR, urine albumin). When ordering a CBC, clinicians should be alert to neutrophil levels in patients with cocaine intoxication or withdrawal. Levamisole is a common adulterant in the cocaine supply and can cause immunosuppression — in particular, neutropenia — and small vessel vasculitis, and the degree of clinical concern varies by region and over time. While there is no direct evidence regarding infectious disease screening as part of the comprehensive assessment, these tests help identify common comorbid conditions; the higher prevalence of HIV, hepatitis, and STIs in patients who use stimulants justifies testing, and clinicians should consider all sites of sexual exposure, which may include urogenital, pharyngeal, and/or rectal, when testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea. For some patients, the impact of routine laboratory testing could be substantial given the benefit of early detection and treatment for some conditions, whereas for some diagnoses the effect of early detection and treatment is less substantial.

### Evaluation of the performance of a point-of-care test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^112TvEZQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Rates of chlamydial and gonococcal infection continue to increase in the United States, as do the associated costs of untreated infections. Improved diagnostic technologies that support testing and treating in 1 clinical visit are critical to advancing efforts to control the rates of chlamydial and gonococcal infection.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical performance of a point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A noninterventional, cross-sectional clinical study was conducted from September 18, 2018, through March 13, 2019, at sexually transmitted infection (STI), HIV, family planning, and obstetrics and gynecology clinics where STI screening is routine, using a convenience sample and comparing commercially available assays with a new 30-minute POC assay. Patients included were those eligible for STI screening or diagnostic testing who had not taken antibiotics effective against chlamydia or gonorrhea within the previous 28 days. Four vaginal swab samples were collected from women and a first-catch urine sample was obtained from men.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A composite infection status was used to classify participants as infected if 2 or more comparator results were positive, as not infected if 2 or more comparator samples were negative, and as unevaluable if 1 result was invalid and the other 2 results did not agree with each other.

Results

Swab samples from 1523 women (median age, 27 years [interquartile range, 17–37 years]), 817 (53.6%) of whom presented with symptoms, and 922 men (median age, 29 years [interquartile range, 17–41 years]), 308 (33.4%) of whom were symptomatic, were tested. For chlamydia, sensitivity of the new POC assay was 96.1% (95% CI, 91.2%-98.3%) for women and 92.5% (95% CI, 86.4%-96.0%) for men. For gonorrhea, sensitivity estimates were 100.0% (95% CI, 92.1%-100.0%) for women and 97.3% (95% CI, 90.7%-99.3%) for men. For chlamydia, specificity of the new POC assay was 99.1% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.5%) for women and 99.3% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.7%) for men. For gonorrhea, specificity estimates were 99.9% (95% CI, 99.5%-100%) for women and 100% (95% CI, 95.5%-100%) for men. Non-laboratory-trained personnel performed 94.8% of all tests (2318 of 2445) during the study.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that self-obtained vaginal swab samples were associated with performance equivalent to laboratory-based molecular diagnostics, which can support use of this POC assay in many settings. The availability of an easy-to-use, rapid (30-minute) molecular test for accurate detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea has the power to facilitate testing and treatment in a single patient visit for these STIs.

Trachoma, caused by repeated ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is targeted for global elimination as a public health problem (EPHP) by 2030. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined EPHP based on clinical signs of trachoma, and significant progress has been made globally, with 18 countries validated to have achieved EPHP as of July 2024. As countries approach and achieve EPHP, programs are considering the use of complementary measures of C. trachomatis infection to monitor population-level transmission –. Potential approaches include nucleic acid amplification-based tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serologic assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in young children. Unlike PCR-detectable infection, which is transient, IgG responses provide a measure of previous infection that is sensitive as populations approach trachoma elimination. Previous studies of IgG responses to C. trachomatis have characterized Pgp3 and CT694 antigens as highly immunogenic. Consistent shifts in population-level age-specific seroprevalence and seroconversion rates (SCR) to these antigens among children correspond with changes in prevalence of trachoma. Multiplex IgG assays lend themselves to inexpensive, concurrent surveillance of multiple diseases, including trachoma. A key challenge remains: can surveys of serological responses reliably determine if C. trachomatis transmission falls below levels that require population-level trachoma interventions?

Infectious disease eligibility — individuals found to be positive for syphilis, N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be treated, retested, and deferred from use as a GC until after documentation that treatment was successful and no longer considered to be infectious before being reconsidered; individuals with false-positive results for syphilis using non-treponemal assays that are confirmed to be negative using a treponemal-based assay are eligible to be used as GCs; and women or their partners who test positive for active infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) (positive urine or throat culture or paired serum samples demonstrating a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody and IgM antibody at least 30% of the IgG level) should be excluded from serving as a carrier until signs of active infection are no longer present.

Abstract

Objectives

Since 2018, Sexual Health London (SHL) has provided remote sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing services to London residents over 16 years of age. SHL was an asymptomatic screening service. In 2020, SHL widened access to non-urgent symptomatic testing. We undertook a 4-year evaluation on the uptake of SHL's online testing pathway and outcomes, including the association of positive chlamydia and gonorrhoea nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) outcomes with user demographics and user utility.

Methods

This is a retrospective data analysis of routine SHL clinical data from 8 January 2018 to 31 March 2022 of all STI test kit orders, focusing on HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhoea outcomes. Descriptive analysis on uptake of each stage of SHL's clinical care pathway is provided, including HIV testing outcomes. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the association between SHL user-completed online consultation information, SHL uptake and chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAAT results (negative or positive).

Results

During the evaluation period, there were 1 476 187 orders made by 670 293 unique users. The return rate for chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAATs was 79.5% and 67.6% for HIV blood samples. The positivity rate from sufficient samples was 4.5% for chlamydia, 1.6% for gonorrhoea and 0.3% reactivity for HIV. There were increased odds of a positive chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAAT result in non-cisgender women, those with a high number of STI orders, non-UK born and those who collected an STI test kit from a clinic-based service.

Conclusions

To date, this is the largest number of orders in an evaluation of online postal sexual health infection testing in the UK, and highest return rate of samples, suggesting acceptability of SHL for STI testing. Positivity rates for chlamydia and gonorrhoea NAAT tests are lower than national figures, which may reflect asymptomatic screening prior to 2020 and testing of non-urgent symptoms since 2020.
