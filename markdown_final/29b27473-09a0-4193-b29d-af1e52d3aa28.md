## Question

When to get a ct sinus with contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain a contrast-enhanced CT of the paranasal sinuses and how to choose between contrast-enhanced CT, non-contrast CT, and MRI in different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that most inflammatory sinus disease should be imaged without contrast. Then, I should verify the high-yield indications for contrast-enhanced CT, namely suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis, suspected invasive fungal sinusitis, and sinonasal malignancy. Next, I will consider the comparative roles of contrast-enhanced CT versus MRI when complications are suspected. After that, I should review the protocol nuances and timing, including fine-cut CT for surgical planning and the concept of a baseline unenhanced scan when contrast is used. Finally, I will integrate pediatric and immunocompromised considerations and synthesize a concise, decision-oriented algorithm, while double-checking that each point aligns with guideline-level sources.

> Let me first confirm the general rule: for uncomplicated inflammatory sinus disease, imaging should be non-contrast, because bone detail is what we need and contrast confers little diagnostic advantage while adding risks such as allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity, and the ACR Appropriateness Criteria and multiple society guidelines endorse non-contrast CT as the standard modality for most rhinosinusitis indications [^113Reku6] [^11656gdy] [^111sGbsf] [^114wmwCT].

> Now, I need to identify the three primary scenarios where contrast-enhanced CT of the sinuses is warranted: suspected orbital or intracranial complications of acute bacterial sinusitis, suspected invasive fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised hosts, and suspected sinonasal neoplasm where we need to assess soft-tissue extent, perineural spread, or marrow invasion. Let me verify each against guideline-level sources to ensure accuracy [^113GaBNL] [^1174QzrA] [^113eLkYK].

> For suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis, I should confirm that contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended when there are red flags such as proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, severe headache, focal neurologic deficits, or cranial nerve palsies. Pediatric guidance and adult updates both support emergent contrast-enhanced imaging in this context, and the IDSA also prioritizes contrast-enhanced CT when suppurative complications are suspected, given the need to detect abscesses and drainable collections that alter management and may require surgery [^113GaBNL] [^115u5tC1] [^113ixKeN].

> For suspected invasive fungal sinusitis, wait, let me verify whether MRI is actually preferred. The practice parameter update says MRI with contrast is preferred when complications are suspected, but hold on, in many emergency settings MRI is not immediately available, so a modified contrast-enhanced CT protocol, such as a split-bolus single-phase technique, can provide near-equivalent soft-tissue detail and simultaneous vascular assessment when time is critical. Noncontrast CT may still show bony erosion and peri-antral fat stranding, but contrast improves delineation of extrasinus spread and vessel involvement that change surgical and medical management [^11656gdy] [^1174QzrA] [^116VVR5a] [^115FR8Mi].

> For suspected sinonasal malignancy, I should confirm that both contrast-enhanced CT and MRI with and without contrast are recommended to define extent, bony destruction, perineural spread, and marrow involvement. NCCN head and neck imaging principles explicitly endorse contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI with and without contrast for maxillary and ethmoid sinus tumors, and they note that MRI better characterizes soft-tissue spread and marrow invasion, while CT complements with cortical bone and cartilage assessment [^113eLkYK] [^112QXM6p] [^113aRKNf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CT versus MRI when complications are suspected. I should compare their strengths and practicalities. CT offers rapid acquisition, high spatial resolution for bone and drainable collections, and avoids sedation in most children, whereas MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast for intracranial and orbital complications, marrow invasion, and perineural spread but may require sedation and is less available emergently. The pediatric AAP guidance notes both are acceptable and suggests MRI when CT is nondiagnostic or concern persists, which aligns with ACR and emergency radiology perspectives emphasizing complementary use [^113GaBNL] [^115FR8Mi] [^115vfwnG].

> Next, I should review surgical planning scenarios. Let me verify that preoperative CT for functional endoscopic sinus surgery should be a fine-cut, non-contrast sinus protocol to define critical landmarks and variants, with the caveat that if contrast-enhanced CT was already obtained for complications or mass workup, it can be leveraged for planning if the quality is adequate. AAO-HNSF surgical guidelines explicitly recommend fine-cut CT acquisition and highlight the frequency of outside scans being inadequate for image guidance, reinforcing the need for standardized preoperative protocols [^113Yc5AY] [^116V6W3P] [^1147Buh7].

> I need to ensure protocol nuances are addressed. When contrast is used, obtaining a baseline non-contrast series before administering iodinated contrast allows accurate interpretation of enhancement and hemorrhage, and using a fine-cut coronal dataset with multiplanar reconstructions optimizes surgical mapping. This is standard in preoperative sinus CT workflows and remains sensible even when contrast is added for complications or mass evaluation [^112wPRf3] [^114EKUDd].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific points. Children with suspected orbital or intracranial complications warrant emergent contrast-enhanced CT, whereas routine imaging for uncomplicated ARS/ABRS should be avoided given high background rates of sinus abnormalities and radiation concerns. Immunocompromised children with febrile neutropenia do not need routine sinus CT without localizing signs, and dose-reduction techniques should be prioritized when CT is indicated [^113GaBNL] [^111dQG91] [^116cQkbe] [^112wPRf3].

> But wait, what if I am dealing with chronic rhinosinusitis without complications? I should double-check that CT without contrast remains the modality of choice for diagnosis confirmation, extent assessment, and preoperative planning, with MRI reserved for special cases where soft-tissue characterization is paramount or CT is contraindicated. AAFP and ACR both endorse non-contrast CT as first-line in CRS, and surgical guidance reiterates the centrality of high-quality fine-cut CT for ESS planning [^111sGbsf] [^114wmwCT] [^116V6W3P].

> In summary, I should confirm that contrast-enhanced CT of the sinuses is indicated for three principal scenarios: suspected orbital or intracranial complications of acute bacterial sinusitis, suspected invasive fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised patients, and suspected sinonasal malignancy. In the first scenario, contrast-enhanced CT is often the fastest first test, but MRI can be added or substituted based on availability and clinical concern, while for malignancy, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are complementary and should be obtained as dictated by staging needs. For all other inflammatory indications, non-contrast CT is the standard, and surgical planning should be done with a fine-cut non-contrast sinus protocol unless a high-quality contrast study already exists [^113GaBNL] [^11656gdy] [^113eLkYK] [^111sGbsf] [^113Yc5AY].

Contrast-enhanced CT of the sinuses is indicated when **complications of sinusitis are suspected** (orbital cellulitis/abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, intracranial extension) [^113GaBNL] [^11656gdy], when **sinonasal tumors are suspected** (to assess extent, perineural spread, marrow involvement) [^113eLkYK] [^112eZ4LC], or when **invasive fungal sinusitis is suspected** in immunocompromised patients [^1174QzrA] [^111UPRFS]. Routine use is not recommended for uncomplicated sinusitis due to radiation and contrast risks [^11656gdy]; **non-contrast CT suffices** for chronic or recurrent disease, surgical planning, or mucocele evaluation [^114wmwCT] [^116V6W3P] [^112eZ4LC]. MRI with contrast is preferred for intracranial/orbital complications when available [^11656gdy] [^115FR8Mi].

## Indications for contrast-enhanced CT of the sinuses

### Suspected complications of sinusitis

Orbital complications — such as **preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess, or cavernous sinus thrombosis** — warrant contrast-enhanced CT to define the extent of infection and guide intervention [^113GaBNL] [^115vfwnG]. Intracranial complications — including **epidural or subdural empyema, brain abscess, meningitis, or venous sinus thrombosis** — require contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for accurate assessment and management planning [^113ixKeN] [^113GaBNL] [^115FR8Mi].

---

### Suspected sinonasal tumors

For suspected sinonasal tumors, contrast-enhanced CT is used to evaluate tumor extent, **perineural spread**, **bone erosion**, and involvement of adjacent structures (orbit, skull base, intracranial compartment) [^113eLkYK] [^113aRKNf]. It also helps **differentiate tumor from mucocele** or other benign lesions and is essential for surgical planning and oncologic management [^115FR8Mi].

---

### Suspected invasive fungal sinusitis

In suspected invasive fungal sinusitis, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated in immunocompromised patients to detect **bony erosion**, **extrasinus extension**, and **intracranial/orbital involvement** [^111UPRFS] [^113Reku6] [^116VVR5a].

---

## Clinical scenarios where contrast-enhanced CT is not routinely indicated

Contrast-enhanced CT is generally **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis**: Diagnosis is clinical; imaging is not indicated unless complications are suspected [^114GKRcd] [^113GaBNL].

- **Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)**: Non-contrast CT is preferred to assess disease extent, bony anatomy, and surgical planning [^114wmwCT] [^111sGbsf].

- **Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS)**: Non-contrast CT is sufficient to evaluate recurrent disease and guide management [^114wmwCT] [^113cx3DW].

- **Mucocele evaluation**: Non-contrast CT is typically adequate to identify and characterize mucoceles [^112eZ4LC] [^114wmwCT].

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

| **Clinical scenario** | **Contrast-enhanced CT** | **Non-contrast CT** | **MRI** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated sinusitis | Not indicated | Preferred | Not indicated |
| Orbital complications | Indicated | Limited | Preferred |
| Intracranial complications | Indicated | Limited | Preferred |
| Sinonasal tumors | Indicated | Limited | Preferred |
| Invasive fungal sinusitis | Indicated | Limited | Preferred |
| Chronic rhinosinusitis | Not indicated | Preferred | Limited |

## Risks and limitations of contrast-enhanced CT

- **Radiation exposure**: Increased risk, particularly in children and young adults [^113GaBNL] [^112wPRf3].

- **Contrast-related risks**: Allergic reactions, nephrotoxicity, and anaphylaxis [^1165susX].

- **False positives**: Enhancement of inflamed mucosa can mimic malignancy or complications, necessitating clinical correlation [^114VESDS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **Pediatric guidelines**: Contrast-enhanced CT recommended for suspected orbital or intracranial complications of sinusitis [^113GaBNL] [^115XiHSm].

- **Adult guidelines**: Contrast-enhanced CT indicated for suspected complications, tumors, or invasive fungal infections; non-contrast CT preferred for uncomplicated sinusitis or surgical planning [^112eZ4LC] [^114wmwCT].

- **ACR appropriateness criteria**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI recommended for suspected complications, tumors, or invasive fungal infections; non-contrast CT preferred for uncomplicated inflammatory disease [^113Reku6] [^115FR8Mi].

---

Contrast-enhanced CT of the sinuses is indicated for suspected **complications of sinusitis**, **sinonasal tumors**, and **invasive fungal infections**, while non-contrast CT is preferred for uncomplicated sinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and surgical planning. MRI is preferred for intracranial and orbital complications when available.

Principles of imaging — initial workup and modality selection: Imaging assessment of primary site can be performed with CT of the soft tissues of the neck or MRI of the neck. CT is performed with contrast; CT imaging of the chest can be performed with or without contrast, as clinically indicated, and MRI is performed with and without contrast, unless contraindicated. CT is complementary to MRI for head and neck cancers to evaluate cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion, to evaluate cartilage invasion, and to evaluate bony erosion/destruction. MRI is preferred over CT if there is a need to evaluate the extent of bone marrow invasion or in patients with extensive dental amalgam that may obscure the anatomy on CT, to assess skull base invasion and cranial nerve involvement, to evaluate skull base or intracranial or orbital invasion and to differentiate tumor from obstructed sinuses, and if there are cranial nerve symptoms or if radiographic perineural tumor spread is a possibility. To achieve complete evaluation of the primary and any nodal disease, CT or MRI of the neck should image the anatomy from the skull base to the thoracic inlet, and for certain conditions, such as involved lymph nodes in the low neck or cancers that frequently involve the upper mediastinum (such as thyroid cancer), the imaging should extend to the carina.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sinonasal disease: 2021 update [^115FR8Mi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This article presents guidelines for initial imaging utilization in patients presenting with sinonasal disease, including acute rhinosinusitis without and with suspected orbital and intracranial complications, chronic rhinosinusitis, suspected invasive fungal sinusitis, suspected sinonasal mass, and suspected cerebrospinal fluid leak. CT and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with sinonasal disease. Given its detailed depiction of bony anatomy, CT can accurately demonstrate the presence of sinonasal disease, bony erosions, and anatomic variants, and is essential for surgical planning. Given its superior soft tissue contrast, MRI can accurately identify clinically suspected intracranial and intraorbital complications, delineate soft tissue extension of tumor and distinguish mass from obstructed secretions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Value of CT sinography and analysis of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis for abdominal wall sinus [^112gUQ9n]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Misdiagnosis analysis of vesico-cutaneous Fistula

In this study, one patient was misdiagnosed with a vesico-cutaneous fistula due to increased fluid attenuation in the bladder, manifesting the entry of the contrast agent. The presence of contrast agent in the bladder was possibly formed by the concentration of blood containing a small amount of contrast agent through the kidneys. And the agent may enter the blood through surrounding micro-vessel and peritoneum (which has strong absorption capacity). Inflammatory cells in the sinus tract wall can produce vascular endothelial growth factor, which leads to an increase in tiny blood vessels and increased permeability of the blood vessel wall. Moreover, micro-vessel around the sinus tract may be damaged by inflammation or iatrogenic procedures, making it easier for the contrast agent to enter the blood. Thus, to avoid the misdiagnosis of vesico-cutaneous fistula, we recommend shortening the time interval between CT imaging and contrast agent injection. Furthermore, in patients with ambiguous diagnosis, CT urography may be helpful in ruling out the fistula.

### Unilateral sinus disease: what is, and is not odontogenic sinusitis? [^116dUbbb]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of unilateral sinus disease (USD) is broad, and while concerning etiologies like sinonasal neoplasia, invasive fungal sinusitis, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea should always be considered, most cases are due to noninvasive inflammatory or infectious conditions. To diagnose USD appropriately, clinicians must integrate the clinical history and examination, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and possibly MRI. Odontogenic sinusitis (ODS) is the most common cause of unilateral maxillary sinus opacification on CT, with 45% to 75% of such cases being odontogenic in nature. This study provides USD diagnostic considerations and reinforces the diagnostic approach to ODS.

Objective

The purpose of this essay is to present a systematic approach to the use of coronal, axial, and sagittal images for CT evaluation of the sinuses before functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Conclusion

We present a systematic approach to the use of coronal, axial, and sagittal images in CT evaluation before FESS. Each imaging plane is valuable for displaying anatomic variants, which can predispose a patient to recurrent disease and affect the surgical approach, and critical variants, which can make surgery hazardous.

### Inefficiencies in computed tomography sinus imaging for management of sinonasal disease [^111cbrQm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective A subset of patients with sinonasal disease who obtain a diagnostic computed tomography (CT) sinus scan may require repeat preoperative CT due to the inadequacy of diagnostic CT for image-guided sinus surgery (IGSS). This leads to increased CT utilization, health care costs, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. The objective of this study is to determine the frequencies of diagnostic CT sinus studies that were inadequate for IGSS and repeat CT studies for purposes of IGSS. Study Design A retrospective chart study was performed between May 2012 and August 2013. Setting Tertiary care rhinology practice. Subjects and Methods New patients with any sinonasal diagnosis who presented with CT sinus scans acquired from outside institutions were included. CT scans were considered inadequate for IGSS for any of the following reasons: > 1.5-mm slice thickness, oblique axial planes due to gantry tilt, and incompletely defined or missing IGSS anatomic landmarks. Results Of 183 patients, 85 (46%) presented with diagnostic CT sinus scans that were inadequate for IGSS. Seventy-one patients met indications for IGSS, of which 37 (52%) required repeat CT due to an IGSS-inadequate diagnostic scan. Conclusion The frequency of repeat preoperative CT sinus imaging may be high at tertiary care centers where IGSS is performed. A standardized IGSS-adequate CT sinus protocol may avoid the need for repeat preoperative scans. Potential advantages include improved efficiency, decreased health care costs, and reduced ionizing radiation exposure to the patient.

Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography

In the pediatric age group, CT should be used with caution and indications should always be carefully weighed in view of radioprotection issues. Dual-energy CT and spectral CT or, if not available, multi-detector row CT scanners adopting dose-reduction techniques should be employed. Special consideration should be devoted to reducing the dose for indications in which the primary anatomy of interest does not require the same level of image quality as routine brain CT scans, such as craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus follow-up.

Indications for CT include:

Craniofacial and spinal trauma.
Syndromic craniosynostosis and craniofacial malformations.
Search for intracranial calcifications.
Temporal bone and skull base abnormalities.
Presurgical assessment for nasal/paranasal sinus surgery.
CT angiography: hemorrhagic stroke, vascular malformations.
Vertebral bone abnormalities, especially for preoperative assessment of scoliosis.
Unavailability of MRI (i.e. technical failure).

As a rule and with the exception of the above indications, CT scanning should not be routinely used as a first-line imaging modality for brain and spine evaluation in children. However, CT can help clarify findings in case of equivocal MRI results.

Acquisition of the volume of interest occurs on the axial plane and is followed by orthogonal coronal, sagittal or three-dimensional reformats, as required. It is fundamental to always analyze not just the soft-tissue window but also the bone window.

Iodinated contrast material for intravenous injections can be used to clarify or further investigate findings whenever necessary. The contrast media concentration should be 300 mg/ml and a 2 ml/kg patient weight dose should be used. The contrast material is injected intravenously, either manually or via a power injector. The latter should be used for CT angiography procedures. Contrast-enhanced acquisitions should be preceded by an unenhanced study, otherwise findings may not be correctly interpreted, a typical instance being the differentiation of a spontaneous hyperdensity (i.e. hemorrhage) from pathological enhancement (i.e. blood-brain barrier disruption).

### Imaging of the paranasal sinuses [^111WbpLD]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses is often performed in a purely clinical fashion, without the need for imaging. However, in certain instances imaging may be deemed valuable or even necessary in helping to solve a diagnostic dilemma, confirm a suspected diagnosis, evaluate the extent of a known condition, or assess for an underlying cause of the condition. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in confirming a suspected diagnosis or providing additional information regarding causes or complications. CT and MRI play complementary roles in evaluating the rare tumors that may involve the paranasal sinuses.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^11656gdy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography for rhinosinusitis — protocol, contrast use, and radiation are outlined as follows: Modern CT examinations are obtained with 3-mm coronal slices, and modern scanners typically obtain thin (< 1 mm) axial slices that are reformatted in the coronal plane, with thin-section (ie, 1 mm) axial CT images used for computer applications. Technical advances have lowered exposure, with radiation doses of 0.13 mSv reported from screening sinus CT scans, which is significantly lower than a conventional head CT (2 mSv). There is a limited role for contrast-enhanced sinus CT imaging; the vast majority of cases of inflammatory sinus disease should be imaged without intravenous contrast. For inflammatory sinus disease complications, MRI with contrast is preferred over contrast-enhanced sinus CT, and most sinus tumors ultimately should be evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRI; if MRI cannot be obtained, pre- and postcontrast sinus CT studies could be considered.

### The integral role of radiology in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis infections [^116VVR5a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

COVID-19–ASSOCIATED RHINO-OCULAR/RHINO-OCULO-CEREBRAL MUCORMYCOSIS

The diagnosis of COVID-19–associated rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis is made by a combination of clinical and imaging parameters. Endoscopy with histopathology is required to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging is helpful in suggesting the diagnosis and delineates the extent, which is essential for surgical management of the patient. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contribute to the management. CT helps delineate the extent of bony and soft tissue involvement, whereas MRI shows the involvement of sinuses, orbits, cavernous sinuses, palate, skull base, and intracranial structures with more clarity. Noncontrast CT of paranasal sinuses is the initial investigation of choice to evaluate suspected cases of COVID-19 associated rhino-oculo-cerebral mucormycosis. In cases with suspected intracranial or orbital involvement, contrast enhanced MRI of the maxillofacial region will allow precise assessment of the soft tissue extension. The area of coverage should include the cavernous sinuses also. Brain MRI with and without contrast may be performed in patients with suspected intracranial spread.

### Diagnostic reference levels and median doses for common clinical indications of CT: findings from an international registry [^117GUc4D]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Indication for CT examination

The indication for each CT examination was determined by applying natural language processing techniques to the study description and protocol name included in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. This included searching for explicit terms and classifying exams using the most specific and highest dose category. In the EUCLID study, ten common clinical indications for undergoing CT were identified. These EUCLID clinical indications or categories include (1) sinus to asses for sinusitis and polyps; (2) stroke, which we aligned with a routine brain examination, and imaging of the brain to assess for hemorrhage; (3) cervical spine for trauma; (4) coronary calcium scoring; (5) lung cancer, which we aligned with routine chest examinations, as well as cancer diagnosis and staging, and not screening; (6) pulmonary embolism; (7) coronary angiography; (8) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suspected or evaluation of known; (9) colic/abdominal pain, which we aligned with imaging for suspected kidney stones; and (10) abdominal pain, suspected appendicitis, which we aligned with routine abdomen. EUCLID category of "stroke" most closely aligns with a routine head CT performed to exclude hemorrhage, so brain perfusion scans and cerebrovascular CT angiograms were excluded.

Dose metrics

Results are provided for complete CT examinations including all scans performed as part of the examination (e.g. a complete examination would include all imaging acquisitions and might include one scan with and one without intravenous contrast). Bolus scans were identified and the dose was included in the total exam dose, but these scans were not considered when determining examination phase. Results are reported for volumetric CT-dose index (CTDI vol) reflecting the average radiation exposure per section and the dose-length product (DLP) reflecting the total radiation output for the examination. Patient diameter was defined as the average of the water equivalent diameter from each CT acquisition over the entire imaging range and used to adjust radiation doses by size.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSinusitis-child [^115WTpmN]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is common in children that usually resolves spontaneously. Imaging is not part of the standard of care for initial diagnosis, however may be necessary in cases with persistent or chronic sinusitis to guide surgical intervention, or to rule out intracranial and vascular complications of sinusitis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the leading imaging modalities. In this article, appropriateness in use of imaging modalities are discussed under common/clinically relevant scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### International consensus statement on allergy and rhinology: rhinosinusitis [^1164Xe82]. International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ICAR-RS 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain CT in all patients meeting symptom-based criteria for CRS with a lack of objective clinical findings on anterior rhinoscopy or nasal endoscopy, as well as for preoperative planning. Consider obtaining CT instead of nasal endoscopy for confirming CRS.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^1178tGrc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) — algorithm highlights: Chronic rhinosinusitis consists of signs and symptoms compatible with rhinosinusitis persisting at least 12 weeks, and evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan to clarify the extent of disease and specific location or locations of obstruction. The CT scan ideally should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management; and consider evaluation by otolaryngologist.

### ESR essentials: acute infections of the head and neck-practice recommendations by the European society of head and neck radiology [^1169ym1a]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute head and neck infections are common in the population and can have serious complications. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to avoid morbidity and mortality. Imaging is not indicated for uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis, otomastoiditis, or limited face and neck soft tissue infections (such as tonsillar or odontogenic infections). However, the presence of facial swelling, severe pain, neurological symptoms, and eye signs suggests a complicated infection and warrants emergency imaging. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality due to its wide availability and ability to show edema and drainable abscesses in the soft tissues, as well as bone resorption. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefits from superior soft tissue contrast, so it may be additive for the demonstration of orbital, skull base, and intracranial complications, as well as neck soft tissue involvement. Complications, such as orbital or intracranial extension, vascular thrombosis, and mediastinal involvement, should be noted on imaging. Follow-up imaging may be required based on clinical grounds and should mention residual disease and surgical drains. KEY POINTS: In uncomplicated head and neck infections, emergency imaging is not needed. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated in complicated sinus and ear infections. In neck soft tissue infections, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^115AK4tY]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging for rhinosinusitis — indications and limitations are summarized as follows: The major indication of sinus MRI is to evaluate the complications related to sinus disease or to determine the presence and map the location of a sinus tumor, and MRI provides superior imaging of the adjacent soft tissues compared with CT owing to improved soft tissue resolution. Magnetic resonance imaging should not be performed to evaluate for uncomplicated sinus inflammatory disease; the role is reserved for CT. Although MRI may display even the most subtle sinus mucosal thickening, the trace sinus mucosal thickening that can be observed with MRI is often not clinically relevant, and more serious rhinosinusitis, including excessively inspissated sinus disease and even extensive fungal disease, may not be seen at MRI. For differentiating a mucocele from a tumor, an MRI can easily differentiate between a mucocele and a tumor; although a mucocele may enhance along its periphery at MRI, it does not enhance within its center, and MRI is preferred for this purpose.

### Making decisions about radiological imaging in pregnancy [^113Z1MtM]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Headache

A 35 year old woman attends an out-of-hours GP service with headache and vomiting that started suddenly, 24 hours earlier. She is 17 weeks pregnant and has no headache history. She has diplopia but no fever or meningism. Vital observations and urine dipstick are unremarkable. The GP recommends urgent assessment in the emergency department and advises that this will likely include imaging. The patient wishes to discuss imaging options.

Headache in pregnancy is common and usually the result of primary headache disorders (eg, tension headache or migraine).

After 20 weeks' gestation, pre-eclampsia is also a common cause and associated with hypertension with or without proteinuria.

Consider urgent radiological investigations if there is clinical suspicion of a life threatening diagnosis (eg, subarachnoid haemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis).

CT is quick, widely available, can readily detect acute haemorrhage, and post contrast imaging is possible. MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting most intracranial pathology; however, it is slower, less readily available, more prone to artefact, and post contrast imaging (using gadolinium) is generally not recommended in pregnancy(table 1).

If CT is clinically indicated and would be the usual first choice in a non-pregnant patient, the authors recommend not delaying CT (ie, avoid considering MRI as first line purely on the basis of fetal risk).

Advise the patient that the radiation dose to the fetus from CT scanning of the head is negligible (table 2).

If CT is negative, further investigation with MRI, post contrast CT, or lumbar puncture may be required, depending on the suspected diagnosis.

### Comparison of CT and MR imaging in ischemic stroke [^116hjMS4]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

CT and MR angiography

Imaging the vessels, the origin of all stroke pathology, is an essential part of the stroke protocol and follows the initial native CT. Imaging of the vertebral and carotid arteries, preferably from the aortic arch to the circle of Willis, its major branches and the initial branches beyond, should be covered. Angiography improves diagnostic precision, providing insight into the source of dysfunction, and may lead the management towards intervention. Both CT and MR angiography may be used, each maintaining some advantages and disadvantages.

When the state-of-the-art CT scanners are employed, a single bolus of contrast agent is sufficient to achieve both angiography and perfusion images. Thus, CT angiography requires the application of a contrast agent, but its resolution is always better than that of MR angiography. However, in detecting the occlusion of a larger artery such as the middle carotid artery (MCA), both CT and MR angiography are usually straightforward (Fig. 1). MCA occlusion is the most common target of interventional stroke treatment. MR brain angiography in the stroke protocol is non-contrast in most cases and is based on the inflow of fresh spins into the imaging slice, called the time-of-flight (TOF) technique. One limitation of MR angiography is that the aortic arch is not covered. Another non-contrast technique, phase-contrast angiography, is rarely used in stroke management, but is a valuable tool in detecting venous sinus thrombosis, which often leads to stroke. CT angiography source data may also be used for an estimation of the final infarct volume, similar to DWI in MRI. Furthermore, using this technique it is possible to distinguish patients at risk of infarct growth according to the status of the collateral circulation.

### Radiologic imaging in the management of sinusitis [^115ARY3P]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common diseases treated by primary care physicians. Uncomplicated sinusitis does not require radiologic imagery. However, when symptoms are recurrent or refractory despite adequate treatment, further diagnostic evaluations may be indicated. Plain radiography has a limited role in the management of sinusitis. Although air-fluid levels and complete opacification of a sinus are more specific for sinusitis, they are only seen in 60 percent of cases. Noncontrast coronal computed tomographic (CT) images can define the nasal anatomy much more precisely. Mucosal thickening, polyps, and other sinus abnormalities can be seen in 40 percent of symptomatic adults; however, clinical correlation is needed to avoid overdiagnosis of sinusitis because of nonspecific CT findings. Use of CT is typically reserved for difficult cases or to define anatomy prior to sinus surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot define bony anatomy as well as CT. MRI is only used to differentiate soft-tissue structures, such as in cases of suspected fungal infection or neoplasm. Referral will occasionally be needed in unusual or complicated cases. Immunocompromised persons and smokers are at increased risk for serious sinusitis complications.

### Value of CT sinography and analysis of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis for abdominal wall sinus [^112YZXCY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis analysis of ECF

An ECF is defined as an abnormal communication between the gastrointestinal tract and skin. Management of ECF is a complex problem. Therefore, it is essential to determine whether the sinus tract involves in the intestine. Unlike an intestinal fistula caused by acute gastrointestinal perforation, in which free intra-peritoneal air can be detected, an ECF caused by an abdominal wall sinus tract is difficult to diagnose by a conventional CT scan, and sometimes it is not easy to distinguish from the fistulas which drain intra-abdominal collection. In this study, when using CT sinography to diagnose ECF, the diagnostic accuracy was 95.3%, with two missed cases and one misdiagnosed case.

The direct diagnostic sign of ECF from CT sinography is entry of the injected contrast medium through the sinus into the intestine. In our study, the false-positive rate of this diagnostic standard was zero, but the false-negative rate was rather high. Reasons for the missed diagnosis of ECF include: (1) the non-absorbable mesh implanted during hernia repair erodes in the intestine and adheres tightly; (2) The intestinal wall defect area is surrounded by inflammatory tissue and does not communicate with the sinus tract; (3) The origin of the fistula may be edematous or clogged with necrosis, thus preventing the contrast agent from entering the intestine; (4) The injection volume is insufficient due to the patient's pain and other discomfort; (5) The injection pressure is insufficient, in order to avoid unnecessary damage (such as causing false passages). To make up for missed diagnoses due to the latter three reasons, we also used an important indirect sign when diagnosing ECF, that is, the presence of air bubbles in the deep area of the sinus tract, which was caused by gas leakage in the defect area of the intestinal wall. This indirect sign effectively improved the accuracy of ECF diagnosis, but it also led to a false-positive case. We speculated that, the gas may have been formed by gas-forming bacteria, or entered through the opening of the sinus tract. For cases where the bowel defect is surrounded by inflammatory tissue, hindering the communication between the damaged bowel and the sinus tract, CT enterography may improve the diagnostic accuracy. It may feature as the diffusion of high attenuation contrast agent out of the intestine lumen.

### Clinical consensus statement: appropriate use of computed tomography for paranasal sinus disease [^113fHH8s]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus statement on the appropriate use of computed tomography (CT) for paranasal sinus disease.

Subjects and Methods

A modified Delphi method was used to refine expert opinion and reach consensus by the panel.

Results

After 3 full Delphi rounds, 33 items reached consensus and 16 statements were dropped because of not reaching consensus or redundancy. The statements that reached consensus were grouped into 4 categories: pediatric sinusitis, medical management, surgical planning, and complication of sinusitis or sinonasal tumor. The panel unanimously agreed with 13 of the 33 statements. In addition, at least 75% of the panel strongly agreed with 14 of 33 statements across all of the categories.

Conclusions

For children, careful consideration should be taken when performing CT imaging but is needed in the setting of treatment failures and complications, either of the pathological process itself or as a result of iatrogenic (surgical) complications. For adults, imaging is necessary in surgical planning, for treatment of medical and surgical complications, and in all aspects of the complete management of patients with sinonasal and skull base pathology.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115XiHSm]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be diagnosed when the patient develops signs or symptoms of orbital and/or central nervous system (intracranial) involvement. Mild cases of preseptal cellulitis (eyelid < 50% closed) may be treated on an outpatient basis with appropriate oral antibiotic therapy (high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for comprehensive coverage) for acute bacterial sinusitis and daily follow-up until definite improvement is noted. If the patient does not improve within 24 to 48 hours or if the infection is progressive, it is appropriate to admit the patient to the hospital for antimicrobial therapy. If proptosis, impaired visual acuity, or impaired and/or painful extraocular mobility is present on examination, the patient should be hospitalized, and a contrast-enhanced CT should be performed. A contrast-enhanced CT scan (preferably coronal thin cut) of the head, orbits, and sinuses is essential to confirm intracranial or intraorbital suppurative complications; in such cases, intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately, and an MRI may also be desirable in some cases of intracranial abnormality. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for intraorbital complications include vancomycin (to cover possible methicillin-resistant S aureus or penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae) and either ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, or piperacillin-tazobactam; for intracranial complications, coverage for anaerobes (ie, metronidazole) should also be considered and should be started in all cases of intracranial complications if ceftriaxone is prescribed. Patients with small orbital, subperiosteal, or epidural abscesses and minimal ocular and neurologic abnormalities may be managed with intravenous antibiotic treatment for 24 to 48 hours while performing frequent visual and mental status checks, but in patients who develop progressive signs and symptoms, such as impaired visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia, elevated intraocular pressure (> 20 mm), severe proptosis (> 5 mm), altered mental status, headache, or vomiting, as well as those who fail to improve within 24 to 48 hours while receiving antibiotics, prompt surgical intervention and drainage of the abscess should be undertaken. Antibiotics can be tailored to the results of culture and sensitivity studies when they become available.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112ZHi1h]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — nasal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) evaluation are described. Examination of the nasal cavity can be performed using a flexible or rigid endoscope paying specific attention to the middle turbinate and middle meatus, and when possible, evaluation of the superior turbinate and meatus or sphenoethmoidal recess may also provide information about posterior disease. Edema is often characterized by a boggy or swollen appearance and a lighter shade of pink or white mucosa, and inflammation could also manifest with polyps in the nasal cavity or middle meatus. Risk of nasal endoscopy is minimal but can include bleeding and patient discomfort. In a meta-analysis comparing nasal endoscopy with paranasal sinus CT for diagnosing CRS, 16 observational and retrospective studies reported a high correlation (P < .0001, 95% CI 0.7685–0.9401) between the two exams. Nasal endoscopy has limitations in CRS without polyposis due to difficulty visualizing inside the sinus cavities, whereas CT can distinguish obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex and opacification/mucosal thickening of sinus cavities; paranasal CT without contrast is the gold standard in the evaluation of CRS over MRI.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114H7xx4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN T-Cell Lymphomas — ISRT for ENKL states that for optimal treatment planning, both contrast-enhanced CT and contrast-enhanced MRI are essential, and an FDG-PET/CT scan is necessary to define nodal disease. The GTV is defined based on combined information obtained on endoscopy, CT, MRI, and FDG-PET/CT. The ISRT CTV should include the entire involved cavity and adjacent structures due to the high risk for submucosal spread, with specific inclusions such as: for unilateral anterior or mid-nasal cavity, the CTV should include the bilateral nasal cavities, ipsilateral maxillary sinus, and bilateral anterior ethmoids; for bilateral nasal cavity involvement, the CTV should include both maxillary sinuses; if there is posterior nasal cavity involvement, the nasopharynx should be included in the CTV; if there is anterior ethmoid involvement, the posterior ethmoids should be included in the CTV; all involved paranasal sinuses, any areas of soft tissue extension, and any involved nodes should be included in the CTV, and prophylactic irradiation is not required for uninvolved lymph nodes. Experience combining newer chemotherapy regimens with smaller ISRT fields is limited and the likelihood of local failure with these smaller fields is not known. The PTV is an additional expansion of the CTV that accounts only for setup variations, and the OARs should be outlined for optimizing treatment plan decisions. The treatment plan is designed using conventional, 3-D conformal, or IMRT techniques using clinical treatment planning considerations of coverage and dose reductions for OARs, and IMRT is strongly preferred to minimize dose to nearby OARs. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117CQ5dc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Key action statements for adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — Offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11).

### Hemodynamic studies on brain CT perfusion imaging with varied injection rates [^116qgHv1]. Clinical Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine a contrast medium injection rate that ensures both accuracy for data and safety for operation by comparing hemodynamic parameters of brain CT perfusion imaging with varied injection rates.

Methods

Twenty-four healthy volunteers were divided into three groups based on contrast medium injection rates (4.5, 6.0, and 7.5 ml/s). For all subjects, CT perfusion scanning was started at 4 s after antecubital venous bolus of contrast media injection. A perfusion-analyzing software package was used to produce a time-density curve in the anterior cerebral artery and the superior sagittal sinus and calculate the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the gray matter and the white matter. The hemodynamic indices were compared among the three groups, and statistical analysis was carried out using the F test.

Results

The time for the arterial rise to reach the peak value for the 7.5-ml/s group was only 0.2 s ahead of the initiation time for the rise of the superior sagittal sinus. The differences of rCBF in the gray matter and the white matter among the three groups were statistically significant. rCBF in the gray matter and the white matter for the 7.5-ml/s group was 52.8 mL × min⁻¹ 100 g⁻¹. (± 3.1) and 21.9 mL × min⁻¹. 100 g⁻¹ (± 2.4), respectively.

Conclusions

The use of the 7.5-ml/s injection rate can meet the prerequisite of the maximum slope model, and the resulting rCBF can be very close to that measured by positron emission tomography. Therefore, 7.5 ml/s was an ideal contrast medium injection rate.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1147Buh7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical planning — computed tomography (CT) imaging provides functional and practical information for surgery, whereas plain films provide little or no definitive information; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone has limitations but can complement CT when soft-tissue assessment is needed. The American College of Radiology (ACR) endorses a maxillofacial CT without contrast as typically appropriate for surgical candidates, and nearly all members of the GDG endorsed a fine-cut protocol with cuts ideally at 1 mm or finer, with radiologist input on parameters such as image acquisition at 1 mm cuts with 50% slice overlap. Surgeons review their patients' images themselves in advance, and CT interpretation assesses mucosal thickening and anatomic abnormalities; although the degree of mucosal thickening may not always correlate with symptoms or directly influence decisions, it provides useful information about disease severity and extent that guides the overall surgical approach.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117E9R2j]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chest and sinus CT in children with chronic cough — technology parameters, incidental findings, and when to scan: Chest CT "using fine collimation of < 1 mm… is more sensitive than spirometric indices", and classical HRCT used spacing "every 10–20 mm" whereas current scanners have " ≥ 64 multidetector rows (MDCT)" with spacing "every 1–2 mm". In chronic cough (> 4 weeks), paranasal sinus CT "abnormalities were found in 66%", yet asymptomatic children show "high rates (18–82%) of incidental sinus abnormalities". One prospective study found "50% of 137 children aged < 13 years" had sinus CT consistent with sinusitis despite being asymptomatic, and in asymptomatic children haziness is "52%" on conventional radiographs and "75%" on digital Water views. Guidance states the American Academy of Pediatrics "recommends undertaking sinus CT only when orbital or central nervous complications are suspected (ie, not routinely)", the Infectious Diseases Society of America "does not recommend routine radiological assessment", and US otolaryngology consensus specified CT "only before considering endoscopic sinus surgery".

### The critical care management of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage: a contemporary review [^114MnXFZ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or contrast-enhanced CT is also commonly employed in the acute setting, combined with noncontrast CT, as a strategy to detect active contrast extravasation into the hematoma (spot sign — discussed later). Additionally, once ICH is confirmed, additional imaging (e.g. CTA, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA)) is recommended to search for the underlying etiology (Additional file 1: Table S1), such as vascular malformations and brain tumors (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). If cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is suspected because of radiological findings such as unusual hematoma location, relative increased edema volume, or abnormal signal in the cerebral sinuses, CT venography or magnetic resonance venography should be performed.

In hypertensive patients older than 65 years with a well-circumscribed hematoma located in the basal ganglia or thalamus, the yield of such studies is low (2–3%) and the decision not to proceed with further diagnostics tests may be reasonable. In young non-hypertensive patients, the following findings may warrant additional work-up: presence of isolated intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage, noncircular hematoma shape, disproportionately excessive edema, lobar location, identification of space-occupying lesion, enlarged vessels or calcifications along the margins of the ICH, and hyperattenuation within a dural venous sinus or cortical vein along the presumed venous drainage path. DSA remains the gold standard for identifying underlying vascular lesions (e.g. cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations), but CTA has shown an accuracy of 89–100% for determining secondary causes of ICH. A recent study comparing CTA with DSA in nonhypertensive patients younger than 45 years old demonstrated excellent negative and positive predictive values of CTA and CT venography (97.3% and 100%, respectively) to establish or exclude vascular causes of ICH.

Acute rhinosinusitis — management of incomplete response and escalation: For resolved uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, no further evaluation is needed, but for partial response clinicians should continue antibiotic treatment for another 10 to 14 days or consider a different antibiotic. For poor response, which worsens after 3 to 5 days, consider broadening microbial coverage or switch to a different antimicrobial that covers resistant bacteria, and rhinosinusitis that fails to improve after 21 to 28 days of initial antibiotic treatment might be due to pathogens not adequately covered by prior antibiotics, nasal polyps, tumor, or noncompliance. Reinforce comfort and prevention measures, consider a sinus CT scan if not already done with more detailed evaluation of underlying risk factors, and consider consultation with an allergist‑immunologist or an otolaryngologist for immunodeficiency, unusual pathogens, allergic factors, or structural abnormalities.

### Imaging findings of the orbital and intracranial complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^1167ZBaM]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and their imaging characteristics

Imaging considerations

The transition from uncomplicated URI to acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is not straightforward. There is considerable overlap between the symptoms and clinical findings of both entities. Imaging has not been shown to be helpful in distinguishing acute bacterial rhinosinusitis from viral URI. In children younger than 3 years with untreated, uncomplicated, rhinosinusitis or in patients of any age who have an uncomplicated cold for less than 10 days, imaging is not indicated. Especially in the paediatric population soft tissue swelling of the paranasal sinuses on CT and MRI is very common. Extensive mucosal thickening is present in up to 68% of cases. Generally, rhinosinusitis is a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms. However, distinguishing self-limiting infection from rhinosinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications can be challenging. If complications are clinically suspected contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) and/or MRI (ceMRI) of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained. To date, there are no head-to-head comparisons of the diagnostic accuracy of ceCT to ceMRI in evaluation of complicated rhinosinusitis in children. Since bony sinus anatomy can be best depicted by CT, CT is often the imaging modality of first choice. In addition CT is widely available, fast, and provides high spatial resolution images. Because of the speed of the acquisition, sedation is usually not required. An important disadvantage of ceCT is the use of ionizing radiation. Especially in children, exposure to radiation should be kept at a minimum. An important disadvantage of ceMRI is that it requires patient sedation in young children. In addition, MRI may not be available around the clock in all hospitals. However, some reports have illustrated that abnormalities responsible for the clinical symptoms are better seen on ceMRI. This seems to be especially true for intracranial complications. In patients that do not require sedation, ceMRI may be preferred over ceCT. If ceCT shows no abnormalities, but the patient has persisting symptoms suspicious for orbital or intracranial complications ceMRI should be obtained.

### Dose and image quality evaluation of a dedicated cone-beam CT system for high-contrast neurologic applications [^114DyG7A]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the dose and image quality performance of a dedicated cone-beam CT (CBCT) scanner in comparison with an MDCT scanner.

Materials and Methods

The conventional dose metric, CT dose index (CTDI), is no longer applicable to CBCT scanners. We propose to use two dose metrics, the volume average dose and the mid plane average dose, to quantify the dose performance in a circular cone-beam scan. Under the condition of equal mid plane average dose, we evaluated the image quality of a CBCT scanner and an MDCT scanner, including high-contrast spatial resolution, low-contrast spatial resolution, noise level, CT number uniformity, and CT number accuracy.

Results

For the sinus scanning protocol, the CBCT system had comparable high-contrast resolution and inferior low-contrast resolution to those obtained with the MDCT scanner when the doses were matched (mid plane average dose 9.2 mGy). The CT number uniformity and accuracy were worse on the CBCT scanner. The image artifacts caused by beam hardening and scattering were also much more severe on the CBCT system.

Conclusion

With a matched radiation dose, the CBCT system for sinus study has comparable high-contrast resolution and inferior low-contrast resolution relative to the MDCT scanner. Because of the more severe image artifacts on the CBCT system due to the small field of view and the lack of accurate scatter and beam-hardening correction, the utility of the CBCT system for diagnostic tasks related to soft tissue should be carefully assessed.

### CT scan… [^116Ah4s8]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The multiple X-ray measurements taken from different angles are then processed on a computer using tomographic reconstruction algorithms to produce tomographic images of a body. CT scans can be used in patients with metallic implants or pacemakers, for whom magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. Some designs use two X-ray sources and detector arrays offset by an angle, as a technique to improve temporal resolution.
- Dual source CT is an advanced scanner with a two X-ray tube detector system, unlike conventional single tube systems. These two detector systems are mounted on a single gantry at 90° in the same plane. Dual source CT scanners allow fast scanning with higher temporal resolution by acquiring a full CT slice in only half a rotation. Fast imaging reduces motion blurring at high heart rates and potentially allowing for shorter breath-hold time.

This is particularly useful for ill patients having difficulty holding their breath or unable to take heart-rate lowering medication. CT perfusion imaging CT perfusion imaging is a specific form of CT to assess flow through blood vessels whilst injecting a contrast agent. Blood flow, blood transit time, and organ blood volume, can all be calculated with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. This type of CT may be used on the heart, although sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormalities are still lower than for other forms of CT. This may also be used on the brain, where CT perfusion imaging can often detect poor brain perfusion well before it is detected using a conventional spiral CT scan. This is better for stroke diagnosis than other CT types. Head CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect infarction, tumors, calcifications, haemorrhage, and bone trauma.

Of the above, hypodense structures can indicate edema and infarction, hyperdense structures indicate calcifications and haemorrhage and bone trauma can be seen as disjunction in bone windows. Neck Contrast CT is generally the initial study of choice for neck masses in adults. CT of the thyroid plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. CT scans often incidentally find thyroid abnormalities, and so is often the preferred investigation modality for thyroid abnormalities. Lungs A CT scan can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the lung parenchyma, the tissue of the lungs. It is particularly helpful because normal two-dimensional X-rays do not show such defects. A variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality.

For evaluation of chronic interstitial processes such as emphysema, and fibrosis, thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstructions are used; often scans are performed both on inspiration and expiration. This special technique is called high resolution CT that produces a sampling of the lung, and not continuous images. Bronchial wall thickening can be seen on lung CTs and generally implies inflammation of the bronchi. Angiography Computed tomography angiography is a type of contrast CT to visualize the arteries and veins throughout the body. This ranges from arteries serving the brain to those bringing blood to the lungs, kidneys, arms and legs. An example of this type of exam is CT pulmonary angiogram used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. It employs computed tomography and an iodine-based contrast agent to obtain an image of the pulmonary arteries.

Diagnosis and Imaging

Many meningiomas are diagnosed when patients become symptomatic from either mass effects or seizures. On non-contrast computed tomography (CT), up to 25% of meningiomas will have some degree of calcification, which may be sometimes associated with slower tumor growth and lower WHO grade. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality for confirming the radiographic diagnosis with most meningiomas being isodense to cortex on all sequences, and approximately 50% may be associated with some perilesional edema. Secretory, microcystic, angiomatous, and lymphoplasmacyte-rich meningiomas are histologic subtypes known to cause a disproportionately large degree of edema relative to tumor size and may portend increased risk of postoperative complications. Almost all meningiomas avidly enhance with gadolinium contrast and up to 72% have a dural tail. Whether the dural tail consistently contains neoplastic meningioma cells requiring treatment or simply represents reactive or inflammatory dural thickening is controversial. Vascular imaging, often CT- or MR-angiogram (CTA, MRA) and/or CT/MR-venogram (CTV, MRV) can help assess the involvement of nearby vascular structures for treatment planning, which is particularly important around the skull base or dural venous sinuses. Formal cerebral angiography is more rarely performed but may be indicated if noninvasive vascular imaging provides insufficient information or if preoperative embolization is planned. There remains controversy around whether preoperative embolization reliably leads to decreased blood loss intraoperatively and its use may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Therefore, preoperative embolization is not a recommended strategy for all meningiomas and decisions surrounding its use must be made on a case-by-case basis.

### Value of CT sinography and analysis of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis for abdominal wall sinus [^112F4RBi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Image analysis

The CT images were blindly and independently re-assessed by two experienced radiologists (XC D and YC Y) with 5- and 18-years work experience, respectively. Whether the sinus tract was confined to the abdominal wall or had invaded the abdominal cavity, and whether there was fistula formation (including enterocutaneous fistula, vesico-cutaneous fistula, etc.) were evaluated.

Diagnostic criteria for sinus tract involvement in the abdominal cavity: the parietal peritoneum adjacent to the sinus tract was discontinuous, and the contrast agent entered the abdominal cavity; or the peritoneal line-like structure was unclear, and the boundary between the intraperitoneal exudation and the sinus was indistinct. The diagnosis criteria for enterocutaneous fistula (ECF): the contrast agent entered the intestine from the sinus tract; or it did not enter the intestine, but air bubbles were detected in the deep infection area of the sinus, and the sinus tract had an unclear boundary with the intestine. The diagnostic criteria for vesico-cutaneous fistula: the boundary between the sinus and bladder was indistinct, and density of fluid in the bladder increased due to entry of the contrast agent.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS, Cary, NC, USA) and MedCalc software (MedCalc Software Ltd. Flanders, Belgium). Intraoperative findings (based on methylene blue dye) were used as the gold standard to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CT sinography in evaluating whether the sinus tract invaded the abdominal cavity (including fistula formation), and whether a fistula occurred. The agreements of CT sinography–surgical results and inter-observer were assessed using weighted-kappa statistics. A Kappa value above 0.81 was considered almost perfect agreement, 0.61–0.80 was considered substantial agreement, 0.41–0.60 was considered moderate agreement, and 0.21–0.40 was considered fair agreement. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults — begin with "Adult patient with suspected CRS", then "Verify that signs/symptoms meet CPG diagnostic criteria", "Assess candidacy for ESS", "Assess additional disease characteristics of CRS", and "Assign appropriate individualized medical therapy". For infection assessment, ask "Does patient have evidence of purulence?"; if yes, "May prescribe antibiotics", and if no, "Do not prescribe antibiotics". Education and imaging planning include "Educate patient about realistic long-term expectations", determine "Has patient had a recent adequate sinus CT scan?" — if yes, "Avoid arbitrary guidelines for mucosal thickening", and provide "Educate patient about postoperative care expectations". Surgical approach should "Tailor extent of surgery to patient's disease, not solely mucosal thickening measurements", and disease-directed steps use "Does the patient have polyps, fungus, osteitis, erosion?" — if yes, "Perform wide exposure ± tissue removal", and if no, "Perform surgery as required of disease state". Postoperative evaluation states "Assess outcomes at 3–12 months postop", followed by "Continue follow up and care as needed".

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is considered the imaging modality of choice for invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS); however, it is not feasible to perform emergency CEMRI especially in the setting of COVID-19. The CECT protocol for evaluation of suspected IFS can be modified by using split-bolus, single-phase CT as it provides an optimal soft tissue demonstration of sinonasal disease; extrasinus spread to orbit, and intracranial involvement along with simultaneous opacification of the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus. The extent of bone erosion can also be well delineated on the multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) in the bone window. Further a structured reporting format can help provide optimal surgical guidance in cases of IFS.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Imaging sphenoid diseases [^115cD2gR]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this review we provide comprehensive analysis of the imaging features of diseases affecting the sphenoid sinus, including a large and heterogeneous spectrum of pathologies such as sinusitis, pseudotumours, bony pathologies, and tumours. Clinical symptomatology related to sphenoid pathologies is often non-specific and patient clinical examination and endoscopic investigations are not definitive; thus, radiological imaging is mandatory for diagnosis. Strengths and limitations of both morphological and functional imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and combined positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) have been considered and integrated into a well-defined clinical context in order to recognise specific imaging features and to underline their clinical relevance for an early and accurate diagnosis. An overview of several sphenoid conditions is herein selected with a didactic objective including both common and less common diseases.

Imaging techniques to evaluate sinuses — modality indications specify that CT without contrast is used to evaluate extent of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and complications of rhinosinusitis; evaluate sinus anatomy, including anatomy of outflow tracts, nasal turbinate anatomy, and nasal septal deviation or spur; evaluate sinus variants (eg, infraorbital ethmoid [Haller] cells, frontal bulla and cells, agger nasi cells, sphenoethmoidal [Onodi] cells); evaluate for a mucocele; evaluate recurrent acute rhinosinusitis; and for operative stereotactic navigation image guidance during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). CT with contrast/MRI with contrast are used to evaluate for the complications of rhinosinusitis, such as orbital and intracranial extension; evaluate for presence, location, and extent of a sinus tumor and for extra-sinus involvement, such as orbital and intracranial extension; differentiate a mucocele from a tumor; rule out a structural, neoplastic, or inflammatory process originating outside paranasal sinuses; and evaluate allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS).

### ACR appropriateness criteria sinonasal disease [^113Reku6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Sinonasal imaging is performed in 2 major clinical scenarios: inflammatory rhinosinusitis or suspected mass lesion. Rhinosinusitis affects more than 16% of the US population annually. It poses an immense economic burden, accounting for more than 26 million outpatient visits annually and costing more than $4.3 billion annually in direct medical expenses. Most cases of uncomplicated acute and subacute rhinosinusitis are diagnosed clinically and should not require any imaging procedure. CT of the sinuses without contrast is the imaging method of choice in patients with recurrent acute sinusitis or chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis cannot be diagnosed on the basis of imaging findings alone. CT scan findings should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and endoscopic findings. MRI is currently used for evaluation of sinus disease as a complementary study in cases of aggressive sinus infection with ocular/intracranial complications, potential invasive fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised patients or in the evaluation of a sinonasal mass. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Lung and sinus fungal infection imaging in immunocompromised patients [^111UPRFS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Imaging is a key diagnostic modality for suspected invasive pulmonary or sinus fungal disease and may help to direct testing and treatment. Fungal diagnostic guidelines have been developed and emphasize the role of imaging in this setting. We review and summarize evidence regarding imaging for fungal pulmonary and sinus disease (in particular invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis and pneumocystosis) in immunocompromised patients.

Objectives

We reviewed data on imaging modalities and findings used for diagnosis of invasive fungal pulmonary and sinus disease.

Sources

References for this review were identified by searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase and Web of Science through 1 April 1 2023.

Content

Computed tomography imaging is the method of choice for the evaluation of suspected lung or sinus fungal disease. Although no computed tomography radiologic pattern is pathognomonic of pulmonary invasive fungal disease (IFD) the halo sign firstly suggests an angio-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis while the Reversed Halo Sign is more suggestive of pulmonary mucormycosis in an appropriate clinical setting. The air crescent sign is uncommon, occurring in the later stages of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. In contrast, new cavitary lesions should suggest IFD in moderately immunocompromised patients. Regarding sinus site, bony erosion, peri-antral fat or septal ulceration are reasonably predictive of IFD.

Implications

Imaging assessment of the lung and sinuses is an important component of the diagnostic work-up and management of IFD in immunocompromised patients. However, radiological features signs have sensitivity and specificity that often vary according to underlying disease states. Periodic review of imaging studies and diagnostic guidelines characterizing imaging findings may help clinicians to consider fungal infections in clinical care thereby leading to an earlier confirmation and treatment of IFD.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hVHRc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnostic confirmation — The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography, and this is a strong recommendation based on cross-sectional studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B and a high level of confidence in evidence, with benefit of improved diagnostic certainty for CRS and fewer false-positive diagnoses; risks, harms, and costs relate to the diagnostic modalities themselves; patient preferences have a large role in choice of the confirmatory modality; and the policy level is Strong Recommendation. MRI can be used to document sinonasal disease if already available, but CT scanning is the preferred imaging modality, and a quality improvement opportunity is to make care safer by reducing overdiagnosis of CRS based on self-reported symptoms.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — imaging to distinguish from viral upper respiratory infection (URI) is guided by Key Action Statement 2A: Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies (plain films, contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT], MRI, or ultrasonography) to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI (Evidence Quality: B; Strong Recommendation). The aggregate evidence quality is "B; overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies", and exclusions are "Patients with complications of sinusitis". Studies report high rates of abnormalities on imaging in children: "Sixty-two percent of patients overall had physical findings or history consistent with an upper respiratory inflammatory process, and 55% of the total group showed some abnormalities on sinus imaging; 33% showed pronounced mucosal thickening or an air-fluid level", and another series "performed MRI in children with URIs and confirmed the high frequency (68%) of major abnormalities seen in the paranasal sinuses". Imaging abnormalities considered diagnostic include "diffuse opacification, mucosal swelling of at least 4 mm, or an air-fluid level", yet "an abnormal image cannot confirm the diagnosis"; "Therefore, it is not necessary to perform imaging in children with uncomplicated episodes of clinical sinusitis", since "the majority of studies will be significantly abnormal" when the sinuses are imaged in children with uncomplicated URI.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116xoKv1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) with symptoms more than 12 weeks is evaluated and managed using an algorithm that begins with evaluation (sinus CT and/or nasal endoscopy, consider culture, consider evaluation for aeroallergens — especially perennial aeroallergens — and other environmental triggers, and consider evaluation for immunodeficiency), followed by initial treatment with topical steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and an oral steroid, with consideration of an oral antibiotic (culture-based, if possible). After the decision point "Treatment successful?", the Yes branch leads to follow up to consider further evaluation of underlying risk factors and to continue individualized medical therapy; the No branch leads to additional treatment and evaluation including sinus CT if not done before (MRI for special cases), consideration of an alternate oral antibiotic, culture if not done before, consideration of immunodeficiency if not done before, consultation by an otolaryngologist for surgery, consideration of aspirin desensitization for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), consideration of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), continuation of topical steroid and nasal saline irrigation, and management of comorbid asthma if present. Additional notes state that nasal examination may show mucosal erythema, edema, and purulent secretions in addition to polyps; evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan, and the CT scan should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; nasal polyps are relatively uncommon in children, and their presence should prompt evaluation for possible CF; and patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management.

Indications for contrast media administration

Physicians saw the strongest indication for ICM administration in septic patients for focus search with (1) a CT of the abdomen and (2) a whole-body CT (Fig. 3). Participants with a work experience of > 11 to ≤ 20 years were more likely to approve ICM administration when conducting a focal search by CT of the abdomen (98.4%, n = 60/61) and even more likely when performing a whole-body CT (100.0%, n = 60/60) (Table 1). More physicians from radiology than from other departments considered a CT of the abdomen (90.3%, n = 28/31) and a whole-body CT (90.3%, n = 28/31) as valid indications for ICM administration (Table 1). A clear preference was not evident regarding CT examinations performed to look for chest infections. Here, 56.3% (n = 201/357) of all participants preferred an unenhanced CT examination, whereas 43.7% (n = 156/357) would request CECT. A closer look at the statistically significant differences in responses among physicians from different medical specialties revealed that radiologists' and surgeons' desire for contrast administration was striking for both a CT of the abdomen and a whole-body CT in septic patients (Fig. 4). Other specialties were more likely to opt for preferable rather than definite performance of a CECT. Additionally, surgeons more frequently saw a preferable or definite indication for a CECT of the chest than any other specialties. Of note, radiologists did not once select a definite indication for an unenhanced CT in any of the three CT examination options (Fig. 4). While, overall, the request of a CECT was strongly supported for examinations of the neck and legs, unenhanced scans were preferred for examining teeth and paranasal sinuses (Fig. 3).

### An imaging checklist for pre-FESS CT: framing a surgically relevant report [^114SJgRX]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The reference standard for preoperative imaging in functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is multiplanar high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Surgeons require a precise preoperative anatomical road map, and hence it is essential for radiologists to be familiar with the normal three-dimensional sinonasal anatomy and the normal variants encountered in this region. Sagittal imaging has recently emerged as an important tool to visualize additional details in this critical anatomical region. Radiologists also need to report these examinations with special focus on the surgeon's expectations. Constant communication between the radiologist and the surgeon helps to resolve specific issues and improve the overall quality of reports. This results in better preoperative patient counselling and in predicting postoperative improvement in clinical status. This review provides a basic structured format for reporting pre-FESS CT, which can be tailored to meet individual requirements. The CT reporting format follows the order in which the sinonasal structures are approached during surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116V6W3P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 7 — imaging in candidates for sinus surgery specifies that for an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a CT scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning. Evidence strength: Recommendation based on limited and mostly observational reports, surgeon preference, and availability of imaging with a majority of evidence of moderate quality and moderate correlation with surgical outcomes, and the level of confidence in the evidence is high. Benefits include delineating sinonasal anatomy as part of surgical planning, identifying anatomical variants, ensuring that a proper CT is obtained that fully evaluates the paranasal sinuses to provide adequate information for the surgeon and avoid the need to repeat CT scans, and delineation of the extent of disease and/or coexistent pathology; risks, harms, and costs are additional radiation from a CT and cost of scans, with a benefits-harm assessment noting a preponderance of benefit and a trade-off between slice thickness and radiation exposure. Value judgments note that CT imaging provides an anatomic roadmap for safe surgery; not all CT scans have the requisite resolution for optimal surgery and some may provide inferior information if not obtained with a specific paranasal sinus protocol; image guidance is not mandatory. Intentional vagueness states the specifics of "fine cuts" are not specified, but the general consensus of the GDG is that 1–mm cuts or finer are ideal. Exceptions include revision surgery, for which a current CT scan is required regardless of time frame, and patients who would not pursue sinus surgery. Supporting text states that CT remains the gold standard for planning all types of sinus surgery.

### Computed tomography of the head… [^116539RW]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

Computed tomography of the head uses a series of X-rays in a CT scan of the head taken from many different directions; the resulting data is transformed into a series of cross sections of the brain using a computer program. CT images of the head are used to investigate and diagnose brain injuries and other neurological conditions, as well as other conditions involving the skull or sinuses; it used to guide some brain surgery procedures as well. CT scans expose the person getting them to ionizing radiation which has a risk of eventually causing cancer; some people have allergic reactions to contrast agents that are used in some CT procedures. Uses Computed tomography has become the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability.

The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. Proper therapeutic management of brain injury is based on correct diagnosis and appreciation of the temporal course of the disease process. CT scan detects and precisely localizes the intracranial hematomas, cerebral contusions, edema and foreign bodies. Even in emergency situations, when a head injury is minor as determined by a physician's evaluation and based on established guidelines, CT of the head should be avoided for adults and delayed pending clinical observation in the emergency department for children. Many people visit emergency departments for minor head injuries. CT scans of the head can confirm a diagnosis of skull fracture or brain bleeding, but even in the emergency department, such things are uncommon and not minor injuries, so CT of the head is usually not necessary.

Clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of using CT of the head in emergency settings only when indicated, which would be at the indication of evidence-based guidelines following the physical examination and a review of the person's history. Concussion is not a routine indication for having brain CT or brain MRI and can be diagnosed by a healthcare provider trained to manage concussions. People with concussions usually do not have relevant abnormalities about which brain imaging could give insight, so brain imaging should not routinely be ordered for people with concussions. If there is concern about a skull fracture, focal neurological symptoms present or worsening symptoms, then CT imaging may be useful. MRI may be useful for people whose symptoms worsen over time or when structural pathology is suspected. CT of the head is sometimes used for people who have sudden hearing loss.

However, when there are not other neurological findings, a history of trauma, or a history of ear disease, CT scans are not useful and should not be used in response to sudden hearing loss. CT of the head is also used in CT-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions. Orbital views for eye-related disorders Special views focusing on the orbit of the eye may be taken to investigate concerns relating to the eye. CT scans are used by physicians specializing in treating the eye to detect foreign bodies, fractures, abscesses, cellulitis, sinusitis, bleeding within the skull, proptosis, Graves disease changes in the eye, and evaluation of the orbital apex and cavernous sinus.

Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) imaging evaluation — PET/CT scans also lead to changes in treatment in 41% of patients; MRI of the head tends to be superior for evaluation of the sinuses and orbits, compared to PET/CT, and MRI of the brain and spine is useful for identification of asymptomatic neurologic involvement. Based on symptoms and organ involvement, further imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as the sinuses with a CT scan can be performed, and imaging of the brain, orbit, spine, and sella turcica with or without pituitary evaluation in the event of AVP deficiency using MRI can be performed; imaging studies should be performed with contrast unless contrast is contraindicated. PFTs and TTE may be needed in the event of pulmonary RDD, thyroid and testicular US can also be performed if clinically indicated, and dermatology and ophthalmology evaluations should be considered in appropriate patients due to toxicities associated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSinonasal disease [^115PcCWY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Imaging of sinonasal pathology may occur for assessment of rhinosinusitis or mass lesions. Rhinosinusitis is prevalent in up to 16% of the US population with annual economic burdens estimated at 22 billion dollars. Rhinosinusitis is characterized as acute or chronic based on symptom duration; if four or more episodes occur annually, the term recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is used. In acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis when inflammatory change remains in the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, imaging may not be required. Distinction between viral or bacterial rhinosinusitis is a clinical diagnosis, and imaging should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and endoscopic findings. Sinus CT imaging is appropriate per clinical judgment in associated complications including headache, facial pain, swelling, orbital proptosis, or cranial nerve palsies. In maxillary sinusitis, teeth may require assessment because 20% may be odontogenic in origin. MRI may be complementary in aggressive infections with intraocular/intracranial complications, invasive fungal sinusitis, or sinonasal masses. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Imaging studies — sinus imaging indications and modality selection are specified as follows: "Summary Statement 4: Perform a CT scan when imaging of the sinuses is indicated. It is required before surgical intervention or when complications of rhinosinusitis are suspected. (StrRec, A)". For unilateral chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), "Summary Statement 5: Radiographic imaging is recommended in a patient with unilateral CRS to exclude a tumor or anatomic defect or foreign body. (Rec, C)". For soft tissue detail and complications, "Summary Statement 6: Perform MRI if soft tissue resolution is required, such as with a suspected tumor or in patients with complications. If a CT scan depicts a soft tissue mass, the patient should then be referred to an ear, nose, and throat physician. (Rec, B)". Additionally, "The diagnosis of ABRS is generally made based on history and physical examination", and imaging is useful "when acute complications are suspected, the response to initial management is poor, or when the diagnosis is in question".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^1165susX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — imaging: Clinicians should not routinely perform sinonasal imaging in patients presenting with symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of AR; this is a recommendation against based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile identifies aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, based on observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as high, and the policy level as recommendation. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure, reduction of cost, and reducing variation in care, while risks include inaccurate or missed diagnosis of pathology with similar presenting symptoms; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted because the word routine was used to allow for circumstances where the patient history may warrant imaging for evaluation of another problem besides AR. Supporting text states there are no radiological findings specifically diagnostic for AR, that radiographic imaging is unwarranted in patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AR, and that plain film radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans expose patients to ionizing radiation which may result in future radiation-induced cancers; iodinated contrast carries the risk of allergic anaphylactic reactions and nephrotoxicity.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^116uAHPm]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — clinical indicators of orbital and intracranial complications: The most common complication of acute sinusitis involves the orbit in children with ethmoid sinusitis who are younger than 5 years, and orbital complications should be suspected when the child presents with a swollen eye, especially if accompanied by proptosis or impaired function of the extraocular muscles; orbital complications have been divided into 5 categories: sympathetic effusion, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Intracranial complications of acute sinusitis, which are substantially less common than orbital complications, are more serious, with higher morbidity and mortality than those involving the orbit; they should be suspected in the patient who presents with a very severe headache, photophobia, seizures, or other focal neurologic findings and include subdural empyema, epidural empyema, venous thrombosis, brain abscess, and meningitis; typically, patients with intracranial complications of acute bacterial sinusitis are previously healthy adolescent males with frontal sinusitis. There have been no head-to-head comparisons of the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced CT scanning to MRI with contrast in the evaluation of orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis in children.

American Academy of Pediatrics acute bacterial sinusitis — imaging for suspected orbital or central nervous system complications: Clinicians should obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the paranasal sinuses and/or an MRI with contrast whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications of acute bacterial sinusitis (Evidence Quality: B; Strong Recommendation). In general, the contrast-enhanced CT scan has been the preferred imaging study when complications of sinusitis are suspected; however, the most recent appropriateness criteria endorse both MRI with contrast and contrast-enhanced CT as complementary examinations, and MRI with contrast should be performed when there is persistent clinical concern or incomplete information has been provided by the contrast-enhanced CT scan. Aggregate evidence quality is B; overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit and a strong recommendation; benefits include determining presence of abscesses that may require surgical intervention and avoiding sequelae, while harms include exposure to ionizing radiation for CT scans and need for sedation for MRI.

### International consensus statement on nomenclature and classification of the congenital bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy, for clinical, surgical, interventional and research purposes [^115GH5V8]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) offers additional functional, anatomical, perfusion and myocardial viability information, has greater spatial resolution, and is an ionizing radiation-free technique that is preferred over CT angiography (CTA) imaging when possible in younger patients and those who will likely have multiple interval imaging studies over their lifetime. Contrast-enhanced (gadolinium-based) CMR or cine CMR (without contrast media) is indicated when morphology and/or diameter of the aortic sinuses, STJ, ascending aorta or arch cannot be assessed accurately or fully by echocardiography, for serial evaluation of aortic size and morphology — at least yearly in patients with BAV with > 45-mm diameters or with a family history of aortic dissection — and when echocardiography-derived aortic diameters are discrepant with those obtained using CMR, in which case CMR should be the modality of choice for interval aortic imaging.

### A questionnaire survey reviewing radiologists' and clinical specialist radiographers' knowledge of CT exposure parameters [^112SRGA3]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

CT protocols

The ACR recommends that the lead radiologist, lead CT technologist and medical physicist should converge to design all new or modified protocol settings, to ensure both radiation dose and image quality are appropriate. However, it is clear from this work that compliance amongst both groups here is low. The surveyed radiologists still perform this task predominantly single-handedly (50%), with only 14% of those surveyed reporting to be in compliance with ACR recommendations. In Ireland, while the majority of respondents report that such decisions are made by a combination of the radiologist and CSR (55%), only one site (5%) also includes physicists in this process. It would seem an obvious benefit to include representatives from each of the three professions during such a process to safeguard patients and also improve quality processes.

Worryingly, a significant number of responding CSRs do not alter CT parameters based on either anatomical region (57%) or study indication (48%), indicating that patients may potentially be exposed to higher doses than necessary contrary to the ALARA principle. Varying parameters according to study indication has already been demonstrated to permit significant reductions in dose, especially for examinations with high inherent contrast where high image quality is not required, such as renal stone protocols, lung nodule follow-up or sinus examinations. Likewise each anatomical region has differing levels of contrast between the various organs, so naturally distinct CT protocols are required to optimise image quality in each.

A larger proportion of the radiologists were identified as having concerns about CT doses in comparison to Irish CSRs, possibly as a result of recent literature and cases in the USA where radiation incidents have gotten large academic and public media exposure in recent years. Although no radiologist respondents commented further on this, CSRs did reference the increased use of multiple and repeat scans and higher doses involved with use of thinner slice scanning. A number of CSRs had no concerns regarding their doses, largely due to recent audits that were carried out. This emphasises the value of regular QA programmes, which can promote high standards and ensure patient safety as well as instilling confidence in CT users.

### Contrast bolus timing in CT-angiography and CT-perfusion: insights from a large clinical dataset [^111qZAor]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimized CTA timing

Optimal arterial contrast enhancement of arteries in CTA requires an acquisition shortly before or at the arterial peak, which is not always the case in clinical practice. The optimized CTA timing was tested by several approaches. First, we simulated the theoretical CTA arterial attenuation curve by comparing the CTA scan time with the AIF derived from CTP. While doing so, the different injection schemes (14s duration at 5 mL/s for CTA and 6.6s duration at 6 mL/s for CTP) were also taken into account.

We simulated the theoretical CTA arterial attenuation curve by convolving the CTP AIF with a box function with a width of 7.4s, corresponding to the difference between CTA and CTP injection durations. Of note, the chosen width of 7.4s was only an approximation; since the injection schemes are not fully rectangular in practice, we consider this sufficient for the current analysis. The difference between the actual CTA scan time and the peak of the simulated CTA arterial attenuation curve was calculated (Δ CTA).

We hypothesized that CTA scans were triggered either too early, accurately, or too late. To confirm this assumption, we chose 30 scans based on Δ CTA (10 scans with greatest negative Δ CTA, 10 scans with Δ CTA = 0, and 10 scans with greatest positive Δ CTA) for the visual assessment of the optimal CTA timing. Two experienced interventional neuroradiologists independently assessed arterial and venous contrast enhancement in these 30 scans. Intravascular enhancement in the right distal ICA and M1 and in the right transverse and sigmoid sinus were rated separately on 5-point Likert scales (0 = no enhancement, 1 = contrast agent barely conceivable, 2 = weak enhancement, 3 = good enhancement, 4 = perfect enhancement). Endoluminal Hounsfield units (HU) were measured in the right distal ICA and right transverse sinus in the aforementioned 30 patients.

### Value of CT sinography and analysis of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis for abdominal wall sinus [^111WvrA8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An abdominal wall sinus tract is an infectious fibrous blind channel that leads to the skin, with or without extension into the abdominal cavity. It is a troublesome complication that occurs mainly after hernia and abdominal wall surgery. The occurrence of a sinus tract is related to many factors: surgical factors (i.e. mesh implantation, contaminative incision), postoperative factors (i.e. incision infections, poor drainage) and patient factors (i.e. smoking, obesity, and diabetes). Without sufficient treatment, the sinus tract can involve the intestine as well as other hollow organs to form a fistula. Its treatment methods vary, depending on the depth of sinus invasion and disease duration. Simple superficial tissue infections can be cured by local drainage or local anesthetic debridement combined with systemic antibacterial drugs; however, if the debridement treatment over-expands, the wound area will be further enlarged and healing will be delayed. For deep sinus tracts, especially when the mesh is infected or the deep abscess does not communicate with the external sinus tract, inadequate conservative treatment may lead to a further deepened sinus tract, increased infection, and even fistula formation. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess the depth and extent of sinus invasion and fistula formation before treatment for personalized treatment plans.

CT imaging is a commonly used preoperative examination method, which can clearly show the course of the sinus tract and its relationship with surrounding tissues, as well as potential causes and important complications. However, CT scans without the use of a contrast agent are of limited value in diagnosing fistula, and determine whether a deep abscess is connected to the sinus tract. In recent years, some radiologists injected a contrast agent into the sinus/fistula before CT scans to evaluate anal fistulas, and found that CT sinography can reveal all types of anal fistulas and peri-anal fistulas. CT sinography was also used to assess the shape and scope of the sternal sinus, and whether it penetrated the sternum into the mediastinum. However, few studies have been done on the value of CT sinography in assessing abdominal wall sinus tracts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the accuracy of CT sinography in assessing the extent of sinus invasion, and to analyze the reasons for missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113cx3DW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

CT imaging in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is used to confirm diagnosis and guide surgery; a diagnosis may also be confirmed by CT scanning or MRI, but MRI for diagnostic confirmation is discouraged because of increased cost and hypersensitivity in comparison to CT without contrast. CT scanning can help quantify the extent of inflammatory disease and improves diagnostic accuracy because imaging findings correlate with the presence or absence of CRS, and although CT findings do not necessarily correlate with symptom severity, they offer an objective method for monitoring recurrent or chronic disease. CT of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained when endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is considered or planned in patients with CRS or RARS, and the study will provide anatomic detail necessary to guide the surgery. Multidetector CT offers advantages over single‑detector imaging because other planes can be reconstructed from one scan; multidetector CT imaging may reduce total radiation dose and is acceptable to use not only for diagnosis but also for surgical intervention. MRI as an alternative to CT has noted higher costs, longer procedure times, and higher false‑positive rates; ultrasound has limited diagnostic utility for CRS, though in resource‑constrained environments it has shown improved diagnostic accuracy compared to plain film X rays or as a precursor to CT as a screening tool.

### Approach to a patient with diplopia in the emergency department [^1144CxNH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diplopia can be the result of benign or life-threatening etiologies. It is imperative for the emergency physician to be proficient at assessing diplopia and recognize when urgent referral or neuroimaging is required.

Objective

The first part of this review highlights a simple framework to arrive at the appropriate disposition of diplopic patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The second part of this review provides more detail and further management strategies.

Discussion

ED strategies for assessment of diplopia are discussed. Management strategies, such as when to image, what modality of imaging to use, and urgency of referral, are discussed in detail.

Conclusions

Unenhanced plain computed tomography (CT) of the head or orbits is largely not useful in the work-up of diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for ocular motor nerve palsies. Due to limited resources in the ED, patients with isolated fourth and sixth nerve palsies with the absence of other neurological signs on examination should be referred to Neurology or Ophthalmology for further work-up. All patients presenting with an acute isolated third nerve palsy should be imaged with CT and CT angiography of the brain to rule out a compressive aneurysm. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the brain and orbits would be indicated in suspected orbital apex syndrome or a retro-orbital mass, thyroid eye disease, or ocular trauma. CT and CT venogram should be considered in cases of suspected cavernous sinus thrombosis. In any patient over the age of 60 years presenting with recent (1 month) history of diplopia, inflammatory markers should be obtained to rule out giant cell arteritis.

### Multiple cerebral sinus thromboses complicating meningococcal meningitis: a pediatric case report [^111oo3cR]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In the event of a prothrombotic diagnosis, the patient's family should be advised to administer drugs (antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents) in situations that could lead to thrombosis. In fact, patients recovering from CVT are at risk of recurrence or other thrombotic event. It should be explained to patients that testing of their first degree relatives for heritable thrombophilia will allow the detection of affected but asymptomatic family members.

Because of its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis of CVT may be delayed and even missed. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion when treating any child with an acute central nervous system infection and presenting neurological signs and symptoms despite administration of appropriate therapy.

Imaging should be considered to rule out intracranial complications. The currently available diagnostic tools include head CT, MRI and MR venogram. Of these, head CT is the most commonly performed examination when sinus thrombosis is suspected. Diagnostic sensitivity is increased with the addition of a postcontrast CT. The empty delta sign, a classic signature of CVT, is present on post-contrast CT in 10% to 30% of cases. On head CT with contrast, the empty delta sign may be seen as a triangular pattern of contrast enhancement surrounding a central region which lacks contrast enhancement in the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus. A dense cord sign (hyperdense fresh blood clot) is seen on noncontrast head CT in 1% to 5% of cases. A previous normal result, even if performed just a few days prior, should not influence the clinician's decision to repeat the exam. In case of CVT, follow-up imaging of the venous sinuses is generally performed in order to check thrombosis evolution. The mainstay of CVT treatment is anticoagulation and supportive care. The purpose of anticoagulant therapy is to limit the propagation of an existing clot and to prevent the formation of further thrombi. Previous studies have reported encouraging data on the safety of anticoagulation therapy in children with CVT and on improved cognitive outcome. Although definitive evidence of effectiveness is lacking, there is a general consensus that anticoagulation with unfractionated intravenous heparin or subcutaneous LMWH is appropriate treatment for acute CVT. The treatment most used for infants and children is LMWH for 7–10 days (120–180 UI/kg twice a day in children up to 1 year of age, and 100 UI/Kg twice a day in older patients) followed by oral anticoagulants or antiplatelets generally for 3–6 months. Therapy is generally discontinued 6 months after the acute phase but may be prolonged after hematological evaluation depending on the patient's age and clinical condition. Instructions to the family at patient's discharge include the necessity to continue anticoagulation after the acute phase in order to prevent CVT recurrence.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^11774cUw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 7 — evaluation criteria for ESS without radiologic evidence of disease in a sinus — outlines selected scenarios in patients with guideline-established CRS undergoing ESS. In such patients, there may be very carefully selected patient-specific scenarios when ESS could include a sinus that does not have any radiologic evidence of mucosal thickening. Reasons include when the sinus is interposed between radiologically diseased sinuses and not addressing it could compromise ESS, when the patient's CRS puts them at high risk for recurrence and revision ESS due to postoperative osteitic changes, when the radiologically diffuse nature suggests a sinus without radiologic evidence is likely to have active CRS, and when ESS on adjacent sinuses may risk postoperative function of the nondiseased sinus. The table additionally states that these concepts and this key action statement do not condone surgery on patients with normal sinus computed tomography scans.

### Clinical consensus statement: balloon dilation of the sinuses [^1122Wcyv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilation patient selection — consensus requires objective CT-based inflammation and pre-procedure imaging: There was consensus that objective evidence of inflammation on CT imaging was necessary in addition to sinonasal symptoms for a patient to be deemed appropriate to undergo a SOD procedure, and the panel reached consensus that CT scanning of the sinuses is a requirement before SOD can be performed. SOD was considered inappropriate for patients with CT scans showing no evidence of sinus mucosal inflammation and/or ostial occlusion, despite the presence of sinonasal symptoms. However, evidence of inflammation or other findings on a CT scan was not deemed sufficient alone to make a patient a candidate for balloon dilation, and both symptoms and objective evidence of sinonasal disease are needed; a CT scan is necessary before proceeding with surgical management.

### Explainable deep learning algorithm for identifying cerebral venous sinus thrombosis-related hemorrhage (CVST-ICH) from spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage using computed tomography [^117CoeNF]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage with a mortality rate exceeding 30% in the first month, typically results from small vessel disease caused by hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Early blood pressure control and minimally-invasive surgical hematoma clearance are currently recommended to achieve hemostasis. In contrast, CVST-ICH is attributed to thrombosis and congestion in cerebral venous system. Therefore, anticoagulation is required immediately while hemostatic therapy can be fatal.

Nearly half of CVST patients experience intracerebral hemorrhage, indicating severe venous congestion, resulting in a mortality of approximately 40% within the first month, even under intensive care. Therefore, a quick identification between the two hemorrhagic disorders is urgently needed in clinical settings.

Non-contrast computed tomography is always the initial imaging modality as patients with intracerebral hemorrhage presenting in emergency room. If secondary hemorrhage is suspected, subsequent standard care procedures involve the selection of further CT angiography (CTA)/CTV, MR angiography (MRA)/MRV, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), based on initial CT and clinical information, with prioritization until a diagnosis is made. For CVST-ICH, while non-contrast CT is essential for initial assessment, its sensitivity for CVST is only 0.48–0.73, with a specificity of 0.50–0.98. CE-MRV offers improved sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.99) but is only applied if necessary and usually inaccessible in urgent settings. Improving CT's ability to detect CVST is crucial for guiding further diagnostic steps such as CTV or CE-MRV.

### Revisiting the interpretation of positive sinus CT findings: a radiological and symptom-based review [^11336vWK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

It is widely believed that a high percentage of normal, healthy patients without sinusitis symptoms have abnormal findings on sinus CT. Experiences of the authors of this study suggest otherwise.

Study Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Subjects and Methods

Head/sinus CT scans of 50 consecutive patients from each of three study groups were reviewed. Group 1 consisted of patients without any sinus symptoms. Group 2 consisted of patients with acute headache symptoms. Group 3 consisted of patients with complaints consistent with chronic sinusitis. CT scans were evaluated with the Lund-Mackay scoring system.

Results

In the asymptomatic patient group (group 1), six (3%) patients had positive sinus CT scan findings, compared with 11 (5.5%) in the acutely symptomatic group (group 2), and 32 (64%) in the chronically symptomatic group (group 3). In the chronically symptomatic group (group 3), 64 percent of patients were allergic compared with 18% of the acute headache group (group 2) and 8 percent of the asymptomatic patient group (group 1).

Conclusion

Results of this study suggest that symptomatic sinus patients are much more likely to have positive sinus CT scan findings than asymptomatic patients. Conversely, normal healthy patients should not be expected to have abnormal sinus CT scans.

### Cone beam CT paranasal sinuses versus standard multidetector and low dose multidetector CT studies [^111mYLDv]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a promising modality for quick outpatient imaging with lower radiation dose and less metal artifact when compared to conventional CT (MDCT) scans. This article will be providing evidence on the diagnostic and treatment-planning applications of CBCT in sinus imaging, mainly, in patients with chronic sinusitis for surgical planning, which retrospectively assessed 21 patients over a period of one year at Queen Elisabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. The main objective was to compare the absorbed dose of radiation from CBCT and conventional CT, and to compare the clarity and image quality for important structures in sinus anatomy in patients with sinus disease meriting CT scan imaging. Results of the mean effective dose of twenty-one consecutive CBCTs of paranasal sinuses were 0.27 mSv (range 0.05–0.48 mSv). This dose was approximately 40% lower when compared to a similar cohort of standard MDCT examinations and 30% lower when compared to low dose sinus CT scans. The visualization of high-contrast bone morphology on CBCT was comparable to standard sinus CT, allowing clear delineation of the principal surgically relevant osseous structures. Soft tissue visibility was however limited. We concluded that, CBCT scan provides a fast and efficient alternative to conventional CT with substantial radiation dose reduction and low dose MDCT techniques. However for more advanced sinus disease, conventional CT scan is preferable.

Objectives

The main objective was to compare the absorbed dose in the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and conventional CT and to compare the clarity and image quality for important structures in sinus anatomy.

Design

Retrospective scan review.

Setting

We compared both the image characteristics and the effective dose used in CBCT and conventional MDCT sinus imaging, performed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham over a 1 year period.

Participants

Patient with sinus disease meriting CT scan imaging.

Main Outcome Measure

Comparison of effective dose exposure and image quality.

Results

The mean effective dose of twenty one consecutive CBCTs of paranasal sinuses performed in our institution over a one year period was 0.27 mSv (range 0.05–0.48 mSv). The dose was approximately 40% lower when compared to a similar cohort of standard MDCT examinations and 30% lower when compared to low dose sinus CT scans. The visualization of high-contrast bone morphology on CBCT was comparable to standard sinus CT, allowing clear delineation of the principal surgically relevant osseous structures. Soft tissue visibility was however limited.

Conclusion

Cone beam CT scan is a quick and efficient alternative to conventional CT with substantial radiation dose reduction over conventional and low dose MDCT techniques. However for more advanced sinus disease, conventional CT scan is preferable.

### Emergency radiologic approach to sinus disease [^115vfwnG]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sinus disease is commonly encountered, especially in the acute care setting. Imaging can support a diagnosis of sinusitis, help identify an etiology, and delineate intracranial and extracranial complications. Suspicion of complicated rhinosinusitis is an indication for contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with patient risk factors that predispose to uncommon but aggressive forms of sinus disease such as invasive fungal sinusitis. Lastly, many conditions, ranging from benign to malignant, can mimic rhinosinusitis clinically and on imaging. Radiologists can help by recognizing these entities and facilitating appropriate referral and follow-up. This article reviews the breadth of sinus disease commonly encountered in the emergency setting, potential complications, and mimics.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115u5tC1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — imaging for acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) should be avoided in uncomplicated cases, as "clinicians should not obtain radiologic imaging for patients presenting with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected". Imaging is "unnecessary for diagnosis in patients who meet clinical diagnostic criteria (Table 4) for ABRS", and plain sinus radiography shows only moderate accuracy — "sensitivity (76%) and specificity (79%) compared with sinus puncture in diagnosing ABRS". Imaging cannot distinguish viral from bacterial disease since "Sinus involvement is common in documented viral URIs, making it impossible to distinguish ABRS from VRS based solely on imaging studies". When complications are suspected, "CT imaging of the sinuses is appropriate… based on severe headache, facial swelling, cranial nerve palsies, or forward displacement or bulging of the eye (proptosis)", and "Complications of ABRS are best assessed using iodinated contrast-enhanced CT or gadolinium-based MR imaging", with "Suspected complications… the only indication for MR imaging of the paranasal sinuses in the setting of ABRS". CT may be used if dental origin is suspected: "CT imaging may also be considered for patients in whom there is a suspicion for odontogenic sinusitis", which "may be the cause of 15% of ABRS cases". Radiation exposure is a limitation, where inappropriate technique "may deliver over 10 times the dosage compared with plain film radiography", though "CT dosage can be lowered to 2 times the dose of plain radiography". For in-office cone-beam CT, "the indications… are the same as for traditional scanners, and their role in diagnosing or managing uncomplicated ABRS is limited and should not be routinely performed".
