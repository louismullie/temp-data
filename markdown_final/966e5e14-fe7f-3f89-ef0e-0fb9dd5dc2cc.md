## Question

Hemodynamically unstable patient after motor vehicle accident with persistent hypotension despite fluids and FAST evidence of retroperitoneal fluid.

A 33-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of trauma from a motor vehicle accident. His pulse is 122/min and rapid and thready, the blood pressure is 78/37 mm Hg, the respirations are 26/min, and the oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy, with cold and clammy skin. Abdominal examination shows ecchymoses in the right flank. The external genitalia are normal. No obvious external wounds are noted, and the rest of the systemic examination values are within normal limits. Blood is sent for laboratory testing and urinalysis shows 6 RBC/HPF. Hematocrit is 22% and serum creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL. Oxygen supplementation and IV fluid resuscitation are started immediately, but the hypotension persists. The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination shows a retroperitoneal fluid collection. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast
B. Take the patient to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy
C. Obtain a retrograde urethrogram
D. Perform a diagnostic peritoneal lavage

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a hemodynamically unstable trauma patient with persistent hypotension despite fluids and a positive FAST showing retroperitoneal fluid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether this represents hemorrhagic shock requiring emergent source control. Then, I should verify what FAST can and cannot detect, especially regarding retroperitoneal bleeding. Next, I will review guideline-based algorithms for unstable trauma with suspected intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. After that, I need to weigh each answer choice against those algorithms and the patient's stability. Finally, I will confirm the single best action and outline immediate adjuncts and contingencies, including pelvic considerations and damage-control principles [^b2ec683f] [^15552ceb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture: the patient is in hemorrhagic shock with SBP 78/37 mmHg, tachycardia, altered mentation, and cold, clammy skin, and the hematocrit of 22% supports substantial blood loss; persistent hypotension after initial fluids signals ongoing bleeding and the need for definitive hemorrhage control rather than more fluids or diagnostic delays [^b2ec683f] [^95ba357e].

> Wait, let me verify what FAST actually tells us here. FAST is designed to detect free intraperitoneal fluid, not retroperitoneal hematomas, and it has low sensitivity for retroperitoneal bleeding; importantly, a positive FAST in an unstable patient is highly specific for hemoperitoneum and should trigger operative exploration, but retroperitoneal fluid on FAST is not a standard FAST finding and suggests a retroperitoneal source of bleeding that FAST cannot reliably characterize or localize, so I should not anchor on FAST alone for retroperitoneal decisions [^ea6b3e76] [^3b2e0e1f] [^b2ec683f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should align with algorithms. In hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma, a positive FAST mandates emergent laparotomy for source control, and if FAST is negative but instability persists, we still pursue bleeding control with consideration of retroperitoneal sources, particularly pelvic hemorrhage, using binder, preperitoneal packing, and angioembolization as indicated; CT is not appropriate in unstable patients because it delays definitive therapy, and DPL is obsolete in this context [^b2ec683f] [^15552ceb] [^cf5a834e].

> I will now examine each option against this framework. Option A, CT with contrast, is incorrect because it will delay operative control in an unstable patient; CT is reserved for stable patients or for completing evaluation after initial hemorrhage control, not as a next step in ongoing shock [^15552ceb] [^b2ec683f]. Option C, retrograde urethrogram, is a distraction; urethral injury evaluation does not address the life threat of retroperitoneal hemorrhage and should not delay source control in shock [^notfound]. Option D, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, is outdated and adds no value when FAST already suggests intra-abdominal pathology and the patient needs operative management; DPL has been largely replaced by FAST in modern algorithms [^4d9d8fa0] [^b2ec683f].

> Let me think about Option B, exploratory laparotomy, and make sure I'm not missing a better first move. Given persistent shock with a positive FAST (even if the fluid is retroperitoneal rather than intraperitoneal), the safest, guideline-concordant next step is immediate laparotomy to identify and control the bleeding source; retroperitoneal hematomas from blunt trauma are managed selectively, but instability overrides conservatism and mandates exploration, with the caveat that if a Zone II hematoma is encountered and is not expanding or pulsatile, it may be left undisturbed, whereas instability or active bleeding warrants exploration and repair [^b2ec683f] [^1007b504] [^c587f91d].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is pelvic rather than intraperitoneal; should I pivot to pelvic-specific hemorrhage control first? I should double-check: in unstable patients with suspected pelvic hemorrhage, contemporary pathways endorse simultaneous or near-simultaneous pelvic stabilization with a binder or sheet, activation of massive transfusion, and early angioembolization or preperitoneal packing if instability persists; however, in the absence of a clear pelvic fracture or isolated pelvic source and with a positive FAST suggesting an abdominal process, exploratory laparotomy remains the most appropriate initial definitive step to identify and control the bleeding source, with pelvic maneuvers initiated in parallel as indicated [^cf5a834e] [^999dc00b] [^06e2e05b].

> I should confirm immediate actions to take en route to the OR: activate massive transfusion, apply a pelvic binder if pelvic instability is suspected, continue damage-control resuscitation with blood products, and avoid excessive crystalloids; these steps reduce time to hemorrhage control and mitigate the lethal triad while preparing for operative exploration [^cf5a834e] [^86a10e3b].

> In summary, I need to ensure the decision is consistent with evidence and guidelines: persistent hemorrhagic shock with a positive FAST, even when the fluid is retroperitoneal, mandates emergent exploratory laparotomy for source control; CT, urethrography, and DPL are inappropriate next steps in this unstable scenario, and pelvic-specific hemorrhage control should be layered in parallel when indicated [^b2ec683f] [^15552ceb] [^1007b504].

---

The correct answer is **B. Take the patient to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy**. In a hemodynamically unstable trauma patient with persistent hypotension despite fluids and a positive FAST showing retroperitoneal fluid, the most appropriate next step is **immediate operative exploration** to identify and control the source of bleeding [^b2ec683f]. Retroperitoneal fluid in this context suggests a major retroperitoneal hemorrhage — often from renal or pelvic vessels — which can be rapidly fatal if not addressed surgically [^d12e1c4e]. CT scan is contraindicated in unstable patients because it delays definitive care, and DPL is not indicated when FAST is already positive [^15552ceb]. A retrograde urethrogram is not urgent and should not delay hemorrhage control [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of retroperitoneal fluid on FAST

Retroperitoneal fluid on FAST in a hemodynamically unstable patient is highly concerning and indicates **significant retroperitoneal hemorrhage** — most commonly from renal or pelvic vessel injuries [^d12e1c4e]. Retroperitoneal bleeding can be massive and rapidly fatal due to the large potential space and limited natural tamponade, making early recognition and intervention critical [^b999acfa].

---

## Indications for exploratory laparotomy in trauma

According to the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST), **immediate exploratory laparotomy is indicated** in hemodynamically unstable patients with a positive FAST, regardless of the specific location of fluid [^b2ec683f]. The rationale is that a positive FAST in an unstable patient signifies ongoing intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage requiring surgical control [^b2ec683f].

---

## Contraindications to CT scan in unstable patients

CT scanning is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients because it **delays definitive surgical management** and can worsen outcomes [^notfound]. The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma explicitly recommends against CT in unstable patients, emphasizing the need for rapid hemorrhage control [^notfound].

---

## Role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)

DPL is generally not indicated when FAST is positive, as FAST already confirms the presence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid [^notfound]. DPL is primarily used when FAST is negative but clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal injury remains high, and it is not designed to evaluate retroperitoneal hemorrhage [^notfound].

---

## Role of retrograde urethrogram

A retrograde urethrogram is used to evaluate urethral integrity in suspected urethral injury, typically identified by blood at the meatus, perineal ecchymosis, or a high-riding prostate [^notfound]. In this scenario, there is no clinical evidence of urethral injury, and performing a retrograde urethrogram would **unnecessarily delay life-saving surgery** [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's hemodynamic instability, persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, and a positive FAST showing retroperitoneal fluid, the most appropriate next step is **immediate exploratory laparotomy** to identify and control the source of bleeding [^b2ec683f]. CT scan, DPL, and retrograde urethrogram are not appropriate in this unstable patient and would delay definitive care [^15552ceb].

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^b2ec683f]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Focused Assessment Sonography in Trauma (FAST)—in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, FAST is performed to detect intraabdominal free fluid suggestive of hemoperitoneum, and a positive FAST allows quick triage to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy; because FAST has high specificity, an unstable trauma patient with a positive FAST goes to the OR. FAST has acceptable sensitivity (69–98 percent) for detection of free fluid and lower sensitivity (63 percent) for detection of solid organ injury, and obtaining serial FAST examinations increases overall sensitivity (72–93 percent). In stable patients, FAST has limited sensitivity for detecting the presence of an injury that might require intervention, and not all injuries detectable by FAST require intervention.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^156d222f]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A recent retrospective review examined the role of FAST as a screening tool for identifying intra-abdominal injuries. A total of 1671 blunt-trauma patients were assessed over 1.5 years, and intra-abdominal injuries were confirmed in 146 patients using CT and/or laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included injuries to the liver, spleen, kidneys and bowels. Among 114 haemodynamically stable patients, FAST was positive in 25 patients, with a sensitivity of 22%. FAST was positive in 9 of 32 haemodynamically unstable patients, with a sensitivity of 28%. Free peritoneal fluid and splenic injury were associated with a positive FAST on univariate analysis and were independent predictors of a positive FAST on multiple logistic regression. An updated Cochrane review from 2015, including RCTs, assessed the effect of diagnostic algorithms using ultrasonography, including FAST examinations, in the emergency department relative to early, late and overall mortality of patients with suspected blunt abdominal trauma. Four studies were identified, but the trials were of overall poor to moderate methodological quality. Mortality data were pooled from three trials involving 1254 patients; the risk ratio (RR) in favour of the FAST arm was 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50–2.00]. FAST-based pathways reduced the number of CT scans [random-effects model risk difference (RD) − 0.52, 95% CI − 0.83 to − 0.21], but the meaning of this result remained unclear. It is unlikely that FAST will ever be investigated by means of a confirmatory, large-scale RCT; therefore, this review may provide the best available evidence for clinical practice guidelines and management recommendations. From the few published head-to-head studies, it appears that negative ultrasound scans are likely to reduce the incidence of multidetector CT (MDCT) scans, which, given the low sensitivity of FAST (or reliability of negative results), may adversely affect the diagnostic yield of the trauma survey. At best, ultrasound has no negative impact on mortality or morbidity.

### Positive FAST without hemoperitoneum due to fluid resuscitation in blunt trauma [^ada34eb9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination is an important screening tool in the evaluation of blunt trauma patients.

Objectives

To describe a case of a hemodynamically unstable polytrauma patient with positive FAST due to fluid resuscitation after blunt trauma.

Case Report

We describe a case of a hemodynamically unstable polytrauma patient who underwent massive volume resuscitation prior to transfer from a community hospital to a trauma center. On arrival at the receiving institution, the FAST examination was positive for free intraperitoneal fluid, but no hemoperitoneum or significant intra-abdominal injuries were found during laparotomy. In this case, it is postulated that transudative intraperitoneal fluid secondary to massive volume resuscitation resulted in a positive FAST examination.

Conclusion

This case highlights potential issues specific to resuscitated trauma patients with prolonged transport times. Further study is likely needed to assess what changes, if any, should be made in algorithms to address the effect of prior resuscitative efforts on the test characteristics of the FAST examination.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^15552ceb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Haemodynamically stable patients, or patients who can be stabilised during initial resuscitation, with an unidentified bleeding source, but not in need of immediate bleeding control, should undergo further investigation of the chest, abdominal cavity and pelvic ring, which can be major sources of acute blood loss following traumatic injury. Besides clinical examination, imaging studies, including ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), as well as laboratory tests, including blood gas analysis and coagulation profiles, together with functional assays, are recommended diagnostic modalities during the primary survey.

As CT scanners are increasingly being advocated and integrated into modern resuscitation units and emergency departments, this technique may replace conventional radiographic imaging and ultrasound as diagnostic measures during the primary survey. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of these immediate measures are dependent on sophisticated pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. Proximity of the CT scanner to the resuscitation room in the emergency department has been shown to have a significant positive effect on the probability of survival for the severely injured patient. Distances of more than 50 m had a significant negative effect on outcome and should be considered when new emergency departments are planned and constructed. If a CT scanner is not available in the emergency department, CT scanning implies transportation of the patient to the CT room; therefore, the clinician must evaluate the implications and potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Transfer times to and from all forms of diagnostic imaging need to be considered in the context of haemodynamic stability. During transport, all vital signs should be closely monitored and resuscitation measures continued. If performed quickly within a well-structured environment and by a well-organised trauma team, CT seems to be safe, feasible and justified, even in severely injured haemodynamically unstable patients. Among haemodynamically unstable haemoperitoneum patients, 17.2% had no documented intraperitoneal injury and over half of the patients were treated without emergent surgical intervention.

Imaging

Recommendation 7

We recommend the use of focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) ultrasound for the detection of free fluid in patients with torso trauma. (Grade 1C)

We recommend early imaging using contrast-enhanced whole-body CT (WBCT) for the detection and identification of type of injury and potential source of bleeding. (Grade 1B)

### Do we really rely on fast for decision-making in the management of blunt abdominal trauma? [^5772b11a]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma examination (FAST) is currently taught and recommended in the ATLS(®), often as an addendum to the primary survey for patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Although it is non-invasive and rapidly performed at bedside, the utility of FAST in blunt abdominal trauma has been questioned. We designed this study to examine our hypothesis that FAST is not an efficacious screening tool for identifying intra-abdominal injuries.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with confirmatory diagnosis of blunt abdominal injuries with CT and/or laparotomy for a period of 1.5 years (from 7/2009 to 11/2010). FAST was performed by ED residents and considered positive when free intra-abdominal fluid was visualized. Abdominal CT, or exploratory laparotomy findings were used as confirmation of intra-abdominal injury.

Results

A total of 1671 blunt trauma patients were admitted to and evaluated in the Emergency Department during a 1½ year period and 146 patients were confirmed intra-abdominal injuries by CT and/or laparotomy. Intraoperative findings include injuries to the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bowels. In 114 hemodynamically stable patients, FAST was positive in 25 patients, with a sensitivity of 22%. In 32 hemodynamically unstable patients, FAST was positive in 9 patients, with a sensitivity of 28%. A free peritoneal fluid and splenic injury are associated with a positive FAST on univariate analysis, and are the independent predictors for a positive FAST on multiple logistic regression.

Conclusion

FAST has a very low sensitivity in detecting blunt intraabdominal injury. In hemodynamically stable patients, a negative FAST without a CT may result in missed intra-abdominal injuries. In hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patients, with clear physical findings on examination, the decision for exploratory laparotomy should not be distracted by a negative FAST.

### The fast is positive, now what? Derivation of a clinical decision rule to determine the need for therapeutic laparotomy in adults with blunt torso trauma and a positive trauma ultrasound [^15106bdc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The object of this study was to derive a clinical decision rule for therapeutic laparotomy among adult blunt trauma patients with a positive abdominal ultrasound for trauma (FAST) examination.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the trauma registry and medical records of all critical trauma patients who underwent a FAST examination in the emergency department (ED) in a university Level I trauma center over a 3-year period. Blunt trauma patients aged >16 years who had a positive FAST examination (defined as the presence of intraperitoneal fluid) were eligible. We selected seven clinical and ultrasound variables available during ED resuscitation for analysis: age, presence of an episode of hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 torr in the ED), presence of abdominal tenderness, chest injury, pelvic fracture, femur fracture, and FAST fluid location (right upper quadrant [RUQ] only; RUQ plus other location; other location only). The primary outcome variable was whether a laparotomy was performed and whether this laparotomy was needed to provide the definitive surgical intervention ("therapeutic laparotomy"). We analyzed the variables using binary recursive partitioning analysis to create a decision rule.

Results

There were 2336 FAST examinations performed during the study period, resulting in 230 (9.8%) positive examinations in patients meeting inclusion criteria. There were 135 patients who had therapeutic laparotomies and 95 who did not need laparotomy. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics. In the recursive partitioning analysis, the first node in the decision tree was the presence of fluid in the RUQ. Of the 144 patients with RUQ fluid, 105 (73%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 64%-80%) required therapeutic laparotomy. Of the 86 patients without RUQ fluid, 30 (35%, 95% CI 25%-46%) nevertheless required therapeutic laparotomies, and the variables blood pressure, femur fracture, abdominal tenderness, and age further divided these patient into high- and low-risk groups. Of the 12 patients without RUQ fluid who had normal blood pressures, no femur fractures, no abdominal tenderness, and were aged 60 years and younger, none (95% CI 0%-22%) required therapeutic laparotomy. In conclusion, given a positive FAST examination, the presence of fluid in the RUQ is an important predictor of the need for therapeutic laparotomy.

Conclusion

In the absence of fluid in the RUQ, there are other clinical variables that may allow for the development of a clinical decision rule regarding the need for therapeutic laparotomy.

Diagnostics

FAST

The primary goal in the initial management of abdominal trauma is to detect and treat life-threatening injuries, in the majority of cases bleeding-related, as quickly as possible. The method of choice for rapid evaluation of the abdomen for free fluid is the Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST). In European trauma centers, sonography has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage as the primary screening test for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. FAST can be performed simultaneously with resuscitation efforts during the initial trauma management and only takes 2 minutes to perform. For this reason, it also is useful in hemodynamically unstable patients. FAST is especially useful for detecting the presence or absence of a hemoperitoneum, a herald of significant organ injury with a sensitivity of 90–93%. However, FAST has a low sensitivity for detecting and grading splenic injury. Injuries to bowel and mesentery without hemoperitoneum and retroperitoneal hematomas also may be missed by FAST. In addition to this, FAST is unable to detect the presence of active hemorrhage. For patients who are hemodynamically stable, a FAST detecting hemoperitoneum should lead to a CT scan for further evaluation of the nature and extent of injury.

When the FAST is negative for hemoperitoneum, debate exists regarding whether a CT scan is required. Estimates for the presence of intra-abdominal injuries in the absence of hemoperitoneum on FAST can be as high as 29% [,–].

Most trauma centers that use FAST as a primary screening modality rely on the assumption that any missed injuries are low-grade lesions without serious clinical consequence. However, some studies demonstrated that the use of FAST examination as a screening tool for blunt abdominal injury in the hemodynamically stable trauma patient results in underdiagnoses of intra-abdominal injuries. Routine CT scan frequently reveals additional injuries, which results in a change of treatment in 6.4–16% of these patients. [,–] This may have an impact on treatment and outcome in trauma patients. Therefore, hemodynamically stable patients with a negative FAST and a high clinical suspicion for splenic injury, for example, a seat belt sign or upper abdominal pain, should undergo routine CT scanning.

### Hemodynamically "Stable" patients with peritonitis after penetrating abdominal trauma (...) [^4e119140]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Following penetrating abdominal trauma, peritonitis should be a trigger for emergent operation regardless of vital signs, because hemodynamic “stability” does not reliably exclude significant hemorrhage. Vascular injury, subsequent hypotension, blood transfusion, and complicated postoperative course are common in this population. Hemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma are presumed to have active hemorrhage and are emergently taken to the operating room for laparotomy. Though also taken for urgent laparotomy, hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma with peritonitis are usually assumed to have a hollow visceral perforation and may or may not have significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Our hypothesis was that despite initial presentation, hemodynamically stable patients with peritonitis following penetrating abdominal trauma may have significant ongoing hemorrhage and catastrophic intra-abdominal injuries requiring emergent surgical intervention. Patients were hemodynamically stable, had a normal initial hemoglobin level, and had positive FAST results 31% of the time, prior to laparotomy. Many authors have previously described the unreliable nature of the heart rate and blood pressure in trauma patients, 9-11 most describing a relative bradycardia associated with hypotension after trauma. Most recently, Victorino et al12 examined 14 325 trauma patients, of whom 489 were hypotensive.

They found that heart rate was neither sensitive nor specific for identifying patients with hypotension, concluding that tachycardia was not a reliable sign of hypotension after trauma. Other diagnostic tools that are often used to evaluate acutely injured patients include hemoglobin level and the FAST examination. A hematocrit level drawn immediately in the emergency department has been evaluated for both blunt and penetrating trauma. Snyder13 evaluated 524 trauma patients with an initial spun hematocrit level and found that a level of 35% or less more often required an operation. Once again, congratulations on a thoughtful study that adds to our understanding of these injuries and better prepares us to successfully manage them. Now he comes to the emergency department with a blood pressure of 100, and the inexperienced surgeon thinks that is a normal blood pressure; in reality the patient is in severe hypotension.

So there are many reasons for the unreliability of the initial vital signs.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^2eef2d9b]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The accuracy of PHUS was adequate with high sensitivity and specificity for pneumothorax, free intraabdominal fluid and haemoperitoneum in a systematic review of three retrospective and six prospective observational studies including 2889 trauma patients. Five studies reported at least one change in management. A more recent systematic review of 16 studies including 3317 trauma patients confirmed the feasibility/potential of PHUS, with seven studies evaluating treatment and transport impact, but with large inconsistencies in protocols, variables and outcomes, precluding a meta-analysis of the data.

In-hospital, POCUS, with its best-known application FAST, remains central to the primary ATLS survey for the detection of haemorrhage in pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities, with high specificity but overall variable to low sensitivity. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for detecting/excluding free fluids, organ/vascular or other injuries compared with reference imaging and/or operative/autopsy findings were 0.74 and 0.96 in a review and meta-analysis of 34 studies with 8635 patients and any type of blunt civilian injury. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies and the reported accuracy of POCUS varied greatly, depending on study populations and body areas affected. In general, a negative POCUS in the context of abdominal trauma cannot exclude injury and must be verified in any case against a standard reference, for example, CT. In a secondary analysis of prospective data from 317 hypotensive patients (< 90 mmHg systolic blood pressure) of the Prospective, Observational, Multicentre, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) RCT, 22 FAST-negative patients required laparotomy within 6 h of admission; thus, in hypotensive patients with haemorrhage, significant intraabdominal haemorrhage must be suspected. From a series of small studies in mixed populations, it was concluded that POCUS may have a higher sensitivity in the context of chest and cardiac injuries. The classic FAST protocol can be augmented with an additional transverse scan of the pubic symphysis (FAST-PLUS protocol), with a high CT correlation with unstable pelvic injury. Rolling patients to the right may increase FAST sensitivity by converting false-negatives into true positive examinations.

### Fluid resuscitation of trauma patients: how fast is the optimal rate? [^85a5c2b6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines recommend an initial rapid infusion of fluid (1-2 L) in trauma and hemorrhage victims as a diagnostic procedure to aid treatment decisions. Although patient response to initial fluid resuscitation is the key to determining therapeutic strategies, the appropriate rate of infusion is not clearly defined. Ninety-nine adult (age >16 years) blunt trauma victims with hypotension were enrolled. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to hemodynamic state after initial fluid resuscitation and requirement of surgical intervention. Total volume and rate of infusion differed significantly between the groups (P < .05). Patients requiring fluid administration at higher rate were all hemodynamically unstable and required immediate surgical intervention. Moreover, rate of infusion was the best predictor of the patients who required immediate surgical intervention. Moderate fluid infusion rate should be considered to allow identification of the patient's response to initial fluid resuscitation.

### Predictive value of a false-negative focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) result in patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury [^89d41ad2]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although there is an abundance of literature on the diagnostic value of FAST, and its suboptimal sensitivity is widely recognized (in part dependent on the training of the FAST operator and the volume of free intra-peritoneal fluid, if any), the value of a false-negative FAST (i.e. a negative FAST in a patient who actually has abdominal injury) in predicting outcome remains unclear. It is hypothesized that a false-negative FAST reflects a lower risk of (hemodynamically) significant organ damage than a true positive FAST, and that the outcome of the former group will be more favorable than the latter in terms of the need for a subsequent interventional radiologic procedure or laparotomy, and death. Such information may provide evidence-based data to determine whether abdominal CT is still necessary after negative FAST, to establish the utility of FAST in triaging patients when staff and CT availability are (temporarily) limited, and to demonstrate the value of FAST as a stand-alone tool when CT is not available. It may also help to determine which cases require more intense observation, and it can be useful to inform patients about their prognosis. A previous study reported patients with abdominal injury and a false-negative FAST result to be substantially less likely to require therapeutic laparotomy with an odds ratio [OR] of 0.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19–0.52). Although these results support our hypothesis, more research is necessary to confirm these preliminary results.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury and a false-negative FAST have a more favorable prognosis than those with a true-positive FAST. Note that traumatic abdominal injury was defined as organ injury or pathologic free fluid in the intra- or retroperitoneal space, and that a negative FAST result in a patient with retroperitoneal injury was also considered “false-negative” for the purpose of this study.

### The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) in hypotensive injured patients frequently fails to identify the need for laparotomy: a multi-institutional pragmatic study [^d10cb0d9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) has become commonplace as a rapid diagnostic modality for the initial evaluation of patients with torso injuries in the USA.An extensive body of literature on the use of FAST in trauma exists, and it has been recommended in the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) course.

In many trauma centers, a FAST (or a variant of FAST that includes additional views) is used as a screening examination for patients presenting with suspected torso injury.Although hemodynamically unstable patients with a positive FAST typically undergo immediate laparotomy without confirmatory imaging studies, those with a FAST that does not reveal free fluid often undergo additional diagnostic studies. This practice is in part based on previous data suggesting that patients with an indeterminate, often referred to as ‘negative’, FAST infrequently have injuries requiring emergent surgical intervention.Clinically, it has been observed that the ability to accurately perform and interpret the FAST has been less precise.

As randomised trials evaluating the ability of FAST to identify the need for laparotomy have not been performed, the available evidence comes from observational and retrospective studies. The Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study accrued injured patients in 2009–2010 that received one or more blood transfusions.Although the intended purpose of PROMMTT was to evaluate optimal blood product transfusion ratios, the extensive data collected has allowed for the study of other aspects of the acute management of injured patients, including FAST. In this study, we used the PROMMTT data set to evaluate the ability of FAST to identify hypotensive injured patients that received an emergent or urgent therapeutic laparotomy.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^efbab0a1]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The hypotensive patient (systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg) presenting free intra-abdominal fluid according to FAST is a potential candidate for early surgery if he or she cannot be stabilised by initiated fluid resuscitation, according to a retrospective study of 138 patients by Farahmand and colleagues. A similar conclusion can be drawn from a prospective blinded study of 400 hypotensive blunt trauma victims (systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg) showing that specific levels of intra-abdominal fluid detected by FAST in these patients was an accurate indicator of the need for urgent surgery. In addition, a retrospective study by Rozycki and colleagues of 1,540 patients (1,227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma) assessed with FAST as an early diagnostic tool showed that the ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% when the patients were hypotensive.

A number of patients who present free intra-abdominal fluid according to FAST can safely undergo further investigation with multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Under normal circumstances, adult patients need to be haemodynamically stable when MSCT is performed outside of the emergency room. In the retrospective study of 1,540 patients (1,227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma) who were assessed early with FAST, a successful non-operative management was achieved in 24 (48%) of the 50 patients who were normotensive on admission and had true positive sonographic examinations. These results justified an MSCT scan of the abdomen rather than an immediate exploratory laparotomy. In a review article, Lindner and colleagues also concluded that the haemodynamically stable patient should undergo MSCT scanning regardless of the findings from ultrasound or clinical examination.

Retroperitoneal hemorrhage (RPH) arises in < 0.5% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention, but is associated with high risks of morbidity and mortality. More than 50% of medical malpractice claims against interventional cardiologists are related to death and hemorrhage from vascular injury; delays in diagnosis and treatment are common. The current approach to RPH is characterized by "too little" to diagnose and "too late" to manage patients in extremis. Immediate CTA allows rapid diagnosis and triage to appropriate endovascular therapy, without delay.

Clinical Management

Clinical management in the resuscitation room was at the discretion of the trauma team leader along French guidelines. A mandatory workup consisted in: (1) assessment of clinical context according to ATLS guidelines, with abnormal findings reported in patients’ medical records; (2) E-FAST by a board-certified member of the trauma team as soon as possible after arrival in the resuscitation room; (3) chest and pelvic radiographs as indicated according to the clinical assessment by the trauma team leader, with indication and any abnormality were reported in the patient’s medical record.

All clinicians performing the E-FAST were experienced board-certified trauma clinicians, either registrar or consultant level, with at least 2 years of experience in trauma management. The E-FAST is part of the formal 5-year training curriculum in anesthesia and critical care in France. The E-FAST was to be performed as soon as possible and to not exceed 15 minutes. It consisted of: standard FAST of the hepatorenal, splenorenal, Douglas, and subcostal windows to detect intrabdominal free fluid and pericardial effusion; thoracic FAST of the bilateral lung base, apical, and anterior chest windows to detect pleural effusion (hemothorax) and lung sliding; pubic FAST to detect symphyseal widening (ie, greater than 25 mm); TCD to detect low cerebral blood flow in patients with a suspicion of traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score below 14) with bilateral measurement of pulsatility index and diastolic blood flow velocity on the mean cerebral artery. Pulsatility index of 1.4 or blood flow velocity of 20 cm/s or lower was considered abnormal.The integral information obtained from the clinical workup (ie, clinical context, E-FAST, and radiography) along with the circumstantial information should prompt the responsible trauma team leader at his or her discretion to initiate any of the following therapeutic actions before the WBCT: abstention from any action, pelvic binder placement, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta insertion, needle or thoracostomy decompression and/or chest drain, decompression of pericardial tamponade (drain or open), hemorrhage control thoracotomy, damage control laparotomy, targeted angioembolization, and cerebral blood flow improvement (ie, initiate fluid bolus, norepinephrine administration, or osmotherapy).

Case presentation

Case 1

A 65-year-old female was involved in a motor vehicle crash as a pedestrian approximately three hours prior to presentation. The patient, while walking, was struck by a mid-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) and propelled six meters. There was no evidence of crushing or dragging. She experienced a brief loss of consciousness lasting ten minutes without associated vomiting. Upon regaining consciousness, she complained of abdominal pain but denied chest pain. Her family transported her to the hospital’s emergency department (ED) by private vehicle. Physical examination demonstrated that the patient was in a sem-conscious state and exhibited signs of distress. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was determined to be E3V4M5. Her blood pressure (BP) measured 80/56 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remained at 95% during the administration of 5 L/min of oxygen via a face mask. Abrasions were observed on the occipital region, left clavicle, and hip. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation findings were unremarkable. The abdomen was soft with mild tenderness, and the patient maintained full motor strength in all extremities.

Emergency laboratory results disclosed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 81 g/L, a blood lactate level (Lac) of 3.7mmol/L, a base excess (BE) of − 4.6mmol/L, a pH of 7.33, an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, and an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 51.1 s. Immediately after admission to the ED, the patient’s blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels declined. A bedside Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) examination showed negative findings. In strict accordance with the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the patient underwent endotracheal intubation. Restrictive fluid resuscitation was initiated, accompanied by an infusion of norepinephrine at a rate of 0.15 µg/kg/min to sustain the systolic blood pressure at 80 mmHg.

Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST)

The FAST examination has developed into a key instrument in the acute evaluation of trauma patients with suspected abdominal and thoraco-abdominal injuries. FAST techniques are being used with reduced examination times and a focused assessment of specific clinical issues using only a few standardised cross-sectional planes. As a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach to the detection of haemorrhages in the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities in the emergency department, FAST represents a cornerstone of the primary ATLS survey [,–]. Volume status can be assessed non-invasively using ultrasound of the inferior vena cava. Several studies have indicated the specificity and accuracy, but low sensitivity, of initial FAST for detecting and excluding free intraperitoneal fluid as well as intra-abdominal injuries in both penetrating and blunt abdominal trauma. Liu and colleagues found a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of initial ultrasound examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. In a retrospective registry study, free fluid or organ injury was detected in 72.4% of patients using FAST versus 84.3% using CT, yielding a sensitivity of 92% for initial FAST. In another retrospective study that included 1540 hypotensive patients (1227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma), ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specificity close to 100% for free intra-abdominal fluid. The double-line sign, which has been described as a wedge-shaped hypoechoic area in the Morison pouch, bounded on both sides by echogenic lines during FAST, may represent a false-positive finding for free intraperitoneal fluid with an overall prevalence of 27%.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^d12e1c4e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The hypotensive patient (systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg) presenting free intra-abdominal fluid according to ultrasonography or CT is a potential candidate for early surgical intervention if he or she cannot be stabilised by initiated fluid resuscitation. A retrospective study by Rozycki and colleagues of 1540 patients (1227 blunt, 313 penetrating trauma) assessed with ultrasound as an early diagnostic tool showed that the ultrasound examination had a sensitivity and specificity close to 100 % when patients were hypotensive.

A number of patients who present with free intra-abdominal fluid according to ultrasound can safely undergo further investigation using MSCT. Under normal circumstances, adult patients need to be haemodynamically stable when MSCT is performed outside of the emergency room. Haemodynamically stable patients with a high-risk mechanism of injury, such as high-energy trauma or even low-energy injuries in elderly individuals, should be scanned after ultrasound for additional injuries using MSCT. As CT scanners are integrated in resuscitation units, whole-body CT diagnosis may replace ultrasound as a diagnostic method.

MSCT is the gold standard for the identification of retroperitoneal haemorrhage (RPH). After injection of i.v. contrast solution, CT identified RPH in all cases (100 %) and may show the source of bleeding (40 %) by extravasation of contrast media.

Haemodynamically unstable patients with significant intrathoracic, intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding may need urgent intervention. In these cases with thoracic trauma and chest bleeding the insertion of a chest tube is the first surgical step, usually just prior to acute damage control thoracotomy. Surgical bleeding control is necessary in unstable patients presenting with haemoperitoneum. Patients with pelvic trauma and significant retroperitoneal haematoma may need external compression, retroperitoneal packing or urgent radiologic embolisation for pelvic haemorrhage control.

Haemoglobin

Recommendation 10

We recommend that a low initial Hb be considered an indicator for severe bleeding associated with coagulopathy. (Grade 1B)

We recommend the use of repeated Hb measurements as a laboratory marker for bleeding, as an initial Hb value in the normal range may mask bleeding. (Grade 1B)

### Will this hemodynamically unstable patient respond to a bolus of intravenous fluids? [^26cee854]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance Fluid overload occurring as a consequence of overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may adversely affect outcome in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients. Therefore, following the initial fluid resuscitation, it is important to identify which patients will benefit from further fluid administration. Objective To identify predictors of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of inadequate organ perfusion. Data Sources and Study Selection Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to predict fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adult patients who were defined as having refractory hypotension, signs of organ hypoperfusion, or both. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration.

A low central venous pressure was associated with fluid responsiveness, but a CVP greater than the threshold made fluid responsiveness less likely. Respiratory variation in vena cava diameter measured by ultrasound predicted fluid responsiveness in a subgroup of patients without spontaneous respiratory efforts. Patients with less vena cava distensibility were not as likely to be fluid responsive. Conclusions and Relevance Passive leg raising followed by measurement of cardiac output or related parameters may be the most useful test for predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adults.

The usefulness of respiratory variation in the vena cava requires confirmatory studies. Bentzer P, Griesdale DE, Boyd J, MacLean K, Sirounis D, Ayas NT. Will This Hemodynamically Unstable Patient Respond to a Bolus of Intravenous Fluids. JAMA. 2016; 316: 1298–1309. doi:

Imaging findings

Signs of intestinal perforation (extraluminal gas, intra-abdominal fluid)

Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is an initial step in assessment of hemodynamically unstable patients with blunt abdominal injury. It primarily detects the presence of free fluid but identifies free air only in 8% of the cases with traumatic bowel perforation. Abdominal CT scan is performed in hemodynamically stable patients and the findings considered diagnostic for bowel perforation are contrast extravasation and/or extra-luminal air. Fluid between the mesentery, thickening of bowel wall are also common CT signs.

More subtle but important concerns for injury is the presence of thickened segments of bowel wall, associated mesenteric hematomas and free fluid in the pelvis without evidence of a solid organ injury consistent with a bleeding source. In the current approach of non-operative management (NOM) of stable patients with solid organ injury, the presence of fluid without solid organ injury should warrant consideration for laparotomy/laparoscopy to evaluate for possible visceral perforation.

### Acute management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma patients: time for a change? Multicenter review of recent practice [^5f1d87df]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hemorrhage-related mortality (HRM) associated with pelvic fractures continues to challenge trauma care. This study describes the management and outcome of hemodynamically unstable patients with a pelvic fracture, with emphasis on primary intervention for hemorrhage control and HRM.

Methods

Blunt trauma patients [Injury Severity Score (ISS) >or=16] with a major pelvic fracture (Abbreviated Injury Score, pelvis >or=3) and hemodynamic instability [admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) <or=90 mmHg or receiving >or=6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs)/24 hours) were included into a 48-month (ending in December 2003) multicenter retrospective study of 11 major trauma centers. Data are presented as the mean +/- SD.

Results

A total of 217 patients (mean age 41 +/- 19 years, 71% male, ISS 42 +/- 16) were studied. The admission SBP was 96 +/- 37 mmHg and the Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) 11 +/- 5. Patients received 4 +/- 2 liters of fluids including 4 +/- 4 units of PRBCs in the emergency room (ER). In total, 69 (32%) patients died, among whom the HRM was 19%; 29% of the deaths were due to pelvic bleeding. Altogether, 120 of the 217 (55%) patients underwent focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) or diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL); 60 of the 217 (28%) patients were found to have pelvic binding in the ER. In all, 53 of 109 (49%) patients had no bleeding noted at laparotomy, 26 of 106 (25%) had no abdominal findings, and 15 of 53 (28%) had had no prior abdominal investigation (FAST/DPL/computed tomography). Angiography was positive in 48 of 58 (83%) patients. The HRM was highest in patients with laparotomy as the primary intervention (29%) followed by the angiography group (18%), the combined laparotomy/pelvic fixation group (16%), and the pelvic fixation-only group (10%).

Conclusion

HRM associated with major pelvic trauma is unacceptably high especially in the laparotomy group. Hence, nontherapeutic laparotomy must be avoided, concentrating instead on arresting pelvic hemorrhage. Standards of care must be implemented and abided by.

### Appropriateness of initial course of action in the management of blunt trauma based on a diagnostic workup including an extended ultrasonography scan [^f9b032be]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

An observational study from Los Angeles in 1311 patientsreported a low sensitivity of a workup combining E-FAST and chest radiographs to detect clinically significant blunt chest injuries with a significant proportion of missed injuries. The study did not assess how this workup factored into decision-making. The authors ultimately recommended the systematic use of WBCT. Finally, a retrospective French cohort of 756 patients with trauma reported a higher diagnostic performance of lung ultrasonograph over chest radiograph to detect pneumothorax and hemothorax and an acceptable sensitivity of abdominal ultrasonograph to detect intraabdominal free fluid. A therapeutic benefit for the E-FAST assessment was rare (2% to 10%) but was considered appropriate in all but 1 case.

The present data confirm a low frequency of immediate therapeutic actions steered by the resuscitation room workup despite a high traumatic load (mean ISS of 24 and more than 78% of patients with an ISS above 15). The most frequent therapeutic decision was abstention in 46% (233 of 510 patients), followed by optimization of cerebral blood flow in 32% (166 of 510 patients). Pelvic binder, thoracic decompression, thoracotomy, laparotomy, and embolization occur quite infrequently, between 0.4% and 10%. Unstable patients requiring immediate, lifesaving therapeutic actions are rare. Less than 10% of all resuscitation room trauma admissions are in shock and require hemorrhage control intervention.The rates observed in our study are in agreement with previous reports.To what extent the initiated therapeutic actions translate into clinical benefit for the patient remains a challenging question.

Introduction

Injury is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing world. Up to 20% of severe trauma patients are diagnosed with severe abdominal injury, and this is associated with a mortality rate of around 20%. Concealed hemorrhage is a major cause of death after trauma, and missed abdominal injuries are a frequent cause of morbidity and late mortality in patients who survive the early period after injury. Imaging plays an important role in patients with suspected abdominal injury.

Ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging modality that does not use any ionizing radiation, and can be performed in the emergency department simultaneously with other aspects of resuscitation. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is an abbreviated, protocolized form of ultrasonography to rapidly screen for the presence of free intra-abdominal fluid as an indirect sign of abdominal injury. However, a normal FAST does not exclude injury. A meta-analysis that investigated the value of FAST for the detection of free intra-abdominal fluid in a total of 19,666 trauma patients reported a pooled sensitivity of 74.2% and a pooled specificity of 97.6%. These data underline that FAST in trauma is helpful to rule in, but not to rule out, free intra-abdominal fluid.

Meanwhile, computed tomography (CT) is considered the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of hemodynamically stable patients. Early repeated CT in initially non-operated patients with blunt bowel and mesenteric injuries has also been reported to improve the sensitivity of lesion detection requiring surgical repair and the security of patient selection for nonoperative treatment. However, a disadvantage of CT is the use of potentially harmful ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast agents. Nevertheless, with the use of optimized protocols (such as biphasic CT with iterative reconstruction techniques) and appropriate selection criteria for CT scanning, these issues can be somewhat mitigated. Another potential disadvantage of CT is that the patient may have to be moved away from the resuscitation area, as a result of which it is generally not appropriate for the evaluation of hemodynamically instable patients. Because of these issues, and the fact that the use of FAST is endorsed by the European guidelines on the treatment of patients with severe/multiple injuries, FAST still has a routine role in the evaluation of trauma patients in many institutions, including ours.

### Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage: efficacy of conservative management and embolisation [^5ace6f12]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study showed that conservative management of SRH may be effective in most patients, even in those who are haemodynamically unstable but therapeutic anticoagulated. It supports the notion that resuscitation and optimisation of coagulation are the most vital components of treatment in SRH. Embolisation had varying success in our cohort, with significantly higher mortality; however, this was likely because patients who underwent embolisation were more commonly those with acute shock, high transfusion volumes, and active haemorrhage on CT. As shown in other studies, mortality in SRH is high, and goals of treatment should include addressing the coagulopathy and not just arrest of haemorrhage.

### History of pelvic fracture management: a review [^32dd2d4d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Classification-guided management (20 th /21 st century)

The first clinically relevant systematic classification of pelvic fractures, based on the mechanism of injury, was described by Pennal and Sutherland in 1961. This system defines three distinct categories of pelvic ring injuries: (1) avulsion fractures, (2) ‘stable’ fractures, and (3) ‘unstable’ fractures, and attempts to correlate injury severity with outcomes. Dunn and Morris later revisited the non-operative concept for the management of pelvic ring injuries and dislocations, based on the Pennal/Sutherland classification system.

In 1980, Pennal and Tile introduced the aspect of fracture stability to the original Pennal/Sutherland classification and incorporated mechanisms and vectors of injury. The Pennal/Tile classification furthermore served as a basis for therapeutic decision-making and management protocols of pelvic ring injurie. Currently used classification systems are largely based on the seminal publications by Tile, Pennal, and Sutherland. For example, the AO/OTA classification for pelvic ring injuries is mainly based on Marvin Tile’s original classification system from 1980, and the classification by Young & Burgess is based on the original Pennal/Sutherland description from 1961. Both the Tile and Young & Burgess classification systems are still widely used in the 21 st century for decision-making and guidance of therapeutic protocols in the acute management of patients with pelvic ring disruptions.

By the middle part of the 20 th century, with a growing number of high-speed motor vehicle accidents, it had become clear that pelvic fractures were involved in a significant number of fatal injuries, mostly related to exsanguinating retroperitoneal hemorrhage. At this time, resuscitation strategies were in their infancy, and there was ongoing debate regarding the appropriate sequence and surgical priorities in the acute management of pelvic hemorrhage. The role of the orthopaedic surgeon in the acute management and resuscitation of patients with pelvic ring disruptions continued to grow in the second half of the 20 th century. External fixation of pelvic ring injuries was introduced and applied increasingly in the early management of hemodynamically unstable patients. The underlying theory was that external fixation might decrease ongoing blood loss by eliminating motion at the fracture site. In addition, by reducing ‘open book’ injuries, external fixation was thought to reduce the intrapelvic volume and to help reducing retroperitoneal blood loss.

### Evaluation of gastrointestinal injury in blunt abdominal trauma "FAST is not reliable": the role of repeated ultrasonography [^78b60d80]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Spiral CT scans were performed with 10-mm collimation and a table speed of 10 mm/sec. Images were reconstructed at 7-mm intervals. In adults, a total of 120 ml of Iohexol (Omnipaque, 300 mg/50 cc) was administered intravenously at a rate of 3-4 ml/sec. Another experienced radiologist interpreted all of the abdominal CT scans.

The routine protocol in our center is that every patient with suspected abdominal trauma should undergo FAST. Except for those patients that further delaying to intervene to undergo FAST is not possible and the patients need to directly go to the operation room. Those patients with unstable hemodynamics and observable fluid in the peritoneal cavity should immediately undergo laparotomy. Patients with stable hemodynamics and positive sonography will undergo conservative management and close observation.

Those with negative clinical signs and negative FAST are not followed by any other diagnostic methods. But in those patients with negative FAST and constant abdominal pain and stable hemodynamic due to shortage of intravenous contrast material in our center they have to undergo repeated FAST after 12 to 24 hours.

The results of FAST technique were compared with surgical results. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity and 95% confidence interval were calculated and used for determining the diagnostic accuracy.

### Emergency diagnostic paracentesis to determine intraperitoneal fluid identity discovered on bedside ultrasound of unstable patients [^ea67c382]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with hypotension may be evaluated with a FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) examination as recent literature has suggested its utility in the unstable patient. Those who are found to have intraperitoneal fluid on the FAST examination may have solid organ injury from unknown trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hemorrhaging ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or other disease process responsible for intra-periteal blood. However, because ultrasound does not assist in fluid identification, it is possible that the fluid present is not blood, but ascites. Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid. In each case the fluid was sampled and proposed management changed due to fluid identification.

### ATLS (R) and damage control in spine trauma [^20807dc4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

So far, MRI plays no role in polytrauma diagnostics. This is primarily due to the fact of long exam duration and limited intervention potential during the positioning inside the apparatus. In addition, regarding damage control principles, diagnostics should not delay indispensable therapeutic approaches and quick stabilization of e.g. long bone fractures is preferential to spinal trauma diagnostics.

Modern CT-Scanner with up to 32 or 64 scales are capable of obtaining a full body scan (head to pelvis) including contrast medium imaging of chest and abdominal organs in less than 3 minutes. Another fact in favour for CT-Scanning is the high rate of missed retroperitoneal injury like pancreatic or kidney lacerations as well as significant vessel injuries, all of which are often missed in the quick assessment for intraabdominal bleeding using ultrasound in the FAST ® protocol. The CT-Scan is undoubtedly superior concerning this matter [-]. The significance of CT-Scanning for polytrauma diagnostics has even resulted in installation of Scanners in the emergency room at various of the 108 level I and 209 level II trauma centres in Germany.

In the case of unstable hemodynamics assessed in the prehospital phase and primary survey, a different diagnostic and therapeutic approach has to be considered. If e.g. intraabdominal mass bleeding is confirmed by FAST ® ultrasound and immediate surgery is necessary to restore sufficient circulation, secondary survey -associated CT-Scan has to be delayed. On an individual basis the surgeon in charge has to decide whether the patient is directly transferred to the operating room. The rest of the polytrauma CT-Scan protocol should be done following emergency surgery and stabilization of the patient's condition before transfer to the ICU.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society and international association of trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) recommendations: paper 1: initial care-pre and intraoperative care until ICU, including non-operative management [^6475f4f4]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Rapid transfer to appropriate level of care with minimal fluid therapy or transfusions and attempts at bleeding control are the mainstay of prehospital trauma care. Tranexamic acid may be administered as per local policies. Advanced airway interventions should be restricted to selected patients and long‐distance transfers.

B. Trauma operative and non‐operative definitive care

2. Surgical approach—operative decision‐making

The surgical approach to a trauma patient is guided by the physiology primarily and secondarily by the organ injuries identified. Selective NOM (SNOM) is standard of care for hemodynamically normalized blunt injuries. For most penetrating trauma in the majority of centers operative intervention is the approach of choice, especially for those with physiological impairment with ‘damage control resuscitation and damage control surgery’ utilized as needed with definitive care more readily actioned with modern hemostatic resuscitation. In selected patients at selected centers with extensive penetrating trauma experience in correctly evaluated imaged patients, who are physiologically normal or improving, some evidence suggests NOM to be acceptable. For blunt trauma, especially those meeting polytrauma criteria consideration is given to initial use of ‘damage control’ philosophies and the use of various hemorrhage control adjuncts to temporize the patient while restoration of physiology is undertaken. Adjuncts may include temporary vascular shunting, other procoagulant products, or other adjuncts to prevent contamination or to control bleeding.

Most of the evidence for abdominal and chest damage control is from retrospective studies although the findings are similar in multiple centers across a number of countries, from the USA to South Africa. Orthopedic damage control in polytrauma patients is well established with better definition of the population and clinical guidelines in a recent major study. Biomarkers to guide therapy include lactate and interleukin 6.

One main challenge remains the management of penetrating injuries to junctional areas where the ‘cavity of choice’ is less clear (e.g. thoraco‐abdominal—bleeding from both chest and into the abdomen and penetrating cervical trauma with bleeding also from the chest). Using FAST‐ultrasound screening, along with chest X‐ray, is a reliable method to choose the correct cavity. The other junctional area is the transition from abdomen/pelvis to the groins, since this may require either laparotomy or extra‐anatomical vascular access to control the bleeding, with the additional risk of limb ischemia complicating the clinical picture; however, this appears to be a less common issue in blunt trauma management.

### Hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures: recent care and new guidelines [^7c452215]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Consistent care of hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients is a major management issue. It was uncertain whether the introduction of newly developed clinical practice guidelines would require much change in current delivery of care at our institution. Assessment of recent care was undertaken and compared with the newly developed evidence-based best practice guidelines. A multidisciplinary project team developed clinical practice guidelines for determination of early optimum management of hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures. The guidelines recommend a definitive management plan to arrest hemorrhage within 30 minutes. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage should be assessed with diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) and/or focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). Early noninvasive stabilization of the pelvis followed by angiography within 90 minutes are recommended if intra-abdominal hemorrhage is not found. Recent care was assessed in a historical cohort of patients, identified in a prospectively maintained trauma registry, between June 1999 and December 2001. Investigations, interventions, and times were then compared with the new guidelines. The delivery of care to 30 patients (mortality 37%, mean ISS 37.8 +/- 20.9) was studied. Compared with the new guidelines, the abdominal assessment rate with DPA and/or FAST was 53% and early (< 90 minutes) angiography rate was 38%. A form of pelvic external stabilization was applied in 27% of cases. Noninvasive pelvic stabilization was not performed at all. The recent care of hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients was not in line with newly developed guidelines. There is an opportunity to markedly improve the rates of initial assessment of the abdomen, pelvic stabilization, and early angiography.

### Field trial of hypotensive versus standard resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock after trauma (hypoResus) [^3176510f]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Primary Aim: To determine the feasibility and safety of hypotensive resuscitation for the early treatment of patients with traumatic shock compared to standard fluid resuscitation. Primary Hypotheses: The null hypothesis regarding feasibility is that hypotensive resuscitation will result in the same volume of early crystalloid fluid administration compared to standard crystalloid resuscitation. The null hypothesis regarding safety is that hypotensive resuscitation will result in the same percent of patients surviving to 24 hours after 911 call received at dispatch compared to standard fluid resuscitation. Early resuscitation is defined as all fluid given until 2 hours after arrival in the Emergency Department or until hemorrhage control is achieved in the hospital, whichever occurs earlier.

Overview This multi-center pilot trial is designed to determine the feasibility and safety of hypotensive resuscitation for the early resuscitation of patients with traumatic shock compared to standard fluid resuscitation. Blunt and penetrating trauma patients with a prehospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg will be eligible. The primary outcomes of the study will be volume of prehospital and in-hospital fluid administered from time of injury until 2 hours into the hospital stay or until hemorrhage is controlled to test feasibility and 24 hour survival for the safety hypothesis. Secondary outcomes will include measures of protocol adherence, 24 hour fluid volume, 24 hour blood product requirements, ventilator days, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, admission base deficit, development of renal failure, admission hematocrit and admission coagulation parameters.

The primary goals of this pilot study will be to determine if the described model will result in different early fluid volumes being delivered to the two groups and to determine if these differing volumes impact mortality. If this pilot study shows that hypotensive resuscitation is feasible and safe, a larger trial will be planned to determine the efficacy of hypotensive fluid resuscitation. Secondary Hypotheses: The null hypotheses are that protocol adherence is low and that hypotensive resuscitation versus standard resuscitation will result in the same amount of total fluid volume and total blood product requirements within 24 hours from 911 call received at dispatch, the same base deficit, hematocrit and coagulation parameters on admission to the ED, number of days on a ventilator, duration of hospital stay, ICU length of stay, and incidence of renal failure.

### Hocus pocus: advanced point-of-care ultrasound from the trauma bay to the surgical ICU [^3b2e0e1f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of FAST

The FAST examination does carry some limitations.

The FAST examination requires a critical volume of free abdominal fluid to yield a positive result. Desai et al identified the critical fluid volume as 444–668 mL, depending on the patient’s position.
Additionally, retroperitoneal fluid is often undetectable with FAST. A negative result does not exclude intra-abdominal bleeding and should prompt a repeat FAST or further imaging if clinical concern persists.
Similarly, in penetrating trauma patients, the FAST examination may be negative. However, this does not rule out significant injury, such as that to a hollow viscus. A high index of suspicion should be maintained using other clinical signs.
The cardiac window of the FAST examination may be unreliable in the setting of decompression of a pericardial effusion into the left hemithorax as may occur in penetrating trauma. This would therefore provide a false-negative cardiac window when assessing for pericardial fluid. Evaluation in the left upper quadrant in this instance may demonstrate fluid above the diaphragm, indicating a left hemothorax. Alternatively, hemothorax may be noted by seeing fluid deep into the descending aorta in the cardiac window.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^cf5a834e]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

If the patient is haemodynamically unstable and in haemorrhagic shock, the urgent treatment goal is rapid achievement of haemostasis. An initial strategy, performed while DCR is ongoing and before proceeding to arteriography, relies on the insertion of an intra-aortic occlusion balloon and/or extra-peritoneal pelvic packing. If haemodynamic instability persists, a laparotomy for haemostasis should be performed without delay. In a haemodynamically stable patient, contrast-enhanced systematic CT is required to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the lesions prior to surgery.

The initial therapy for pelvic fractures includes control of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding by pelvic closure as a first step. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to control haemorrhage from pelvic fractures, but pelvic closure may also be achieved using a pelvic binder, a pelvic C-clamp or improvised methods such as a bed sheet. Based on the available literature, pelvic circumferential compression devices are widely used in the initial management of patients with suspected pelvic bleeding. There is evidence to suggest that external compression reduces disrupted pelvic rings. However, some complications have been reported following the application of pelvic circumferential compression devices. Until this can be clarified, judicious application of pelvic circumferential compression devices will continue to be recommended. In addition to the pelvic closure, fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of the haematoma, pre-, extra- or retroperitoneal packing may reduce or control the venous bleeding. Pre-peritoneal packing is used to decrease the need for pelvic embolisation and may be performed simultaneously, or soon after, initial pelvic fracture stabilisation. The most commonly embolised vascular bed and therefore the most studied is the pelvis. Pelvic packing could potentially aid in early intra-pelvic bleeding control and provide crucial time for more selective haemorrhage management.

### What is the utility of the focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam in penetrating torso trauma? [^b81ebfb0]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

A recent Cochrane Review has demonstrated that emergency ultrasonography decreases the amount of computerised tomographic scans in blunt abdominal trauma.13 However, there is no systematic review that has evaluated the utility of the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma(FAST) exam in penetrating torso trauma. We systematically reviewed the medical literature for the utility of the FAST exam to detect free intraperitoneal blood after penetrating torso trauma.

Methods

We searched PUBMED and EMBASE databases for randomised controlled trials from 1965 through December 2009 using a search strategy derived from the following PICO formulation of our clinical question:

Patients

patients (12+ years) sustaining penetrating trauma to the torso.

Intervention

FAST exam during their initial trauma workup. Comparator: either local wound exploration (LWE),computerised tomography (CT), diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), or laparotomy.

Outcome

intraperitoneal and pericardial free fluid. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed.Qualitative methods were used to summarise the study results.

Analysis

Sensitivities and specificities were compared using a Forest Plot (95% CI) calculated by Revman 5 (Review Manager Version 5.0. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration,2008) between the FAST exam and definitive diagnostic modalities such as LWE, CT, DPL, or laporotomy.

Results

We identified eight observational studies (n=565 patients) that met our selection criteria. The prevalence of a positive FAST exam after penetrating trauma was fairly low ranging from 24.2% to 56.3%.The FAST exam for penetrating trauma is a highly specific (94.1–100.0%), but not very sensitive (28.1–100%) diagnostic modality.

Conclusion

From the review of the literature, a positive FAST exam has a high incidence of intraabdominal injury and should prompt an exploratory laparotomy. However, a negative initial FAST exam after penetrating trauma should prompt further diagnostic studies such as LWE, CT, DPL, or laparotomy.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^06e2e05b]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients—initial resuscitation and hemorrhage control follow a stepwise algorithm: When patients are hemodynamically unstable as a result of hemorrhage, a massive transfusion protocol should be activated, and while initiating resuscitative efforts a temporary pelvic binder or circumferential sheet should be positioned around the greater trochanters; a rapid assessment to exclude other bleeding sources is required using portable X rays of the chest and pelvis. To rule out intraabdominal hemorrhage, a Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) scan or diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) should be performed; if intraabdominal hemorrhage is diagnosed, hemodynamically unstable patients should be taken to the operating room for exploration and should be considered for pelvic fracture external fixation. If intraabdominal hemorrhage is not diagnosed by FAST or DPA, patients should undergo pelvic stabilization with either a temporary pelvic binder or sheet followed by surgical stabilization and preperitoneal packing, with stability provided by an external fixator giving greater support for pre-peritoneal packs and, if time allows, better hemorrhage control if fixation is achieved prior to packing. Patients who remain hemodynamically unstable following pelvic stabilization and those with preperitoneal packing in place should undergo angiography and potential embolization, and for patients truly in extremis solely from pelvic bleeding a potential alternative initial intervention is Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA), for which early experience in lieu of or in addition to preperitoneal packing has shown promising results.

### Predictive value of a false-negative focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) result in patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury [^7a7c951d]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study was approved by the local institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The University Medical Center Groningen is a tertiary care level 1 trauma center in the north-east of The Netherlands. Any trauma patient with a suspicion of abdominal injury or in whom abdominal injury cannot be ruled out prior to arrival in the emergency room of the hospital undergoes a FAST examination. All trauma patients who underwent FAST between January 2018 and February 2020 were potentially eligible for inclusion. Patients were included if they had confirmed organ injury or pathologic free fluid in the intra- or retroperitoneal space on CT or surgery. Patients with a true-negative FAST (i.e. negative FAST without organ injury or pathologic free fluid in the intra- or retroperitoneal space on CT or surgery), patients with a false-positive FAST (i.e. positive FAST without organ injury or pathologic free fluid in the intra- or retroperitoneal space on CT or surgery), patients with an inconclusive FAST, and patients with free intra-abdominal fluid on FAST that could be due to pre-existing conditions as recorded in their medical files and known to the healthcare providers upon arrival of the patient in the hospital were excluded.

Clinical variables

Medical records were reviewed to retrieve patient age and gender, mechanism of injury, whether code red was assigned (indicating the highest level of urgency and possible major hemorrhage), basic vital parameters upon arrival in the hospital including hemoglobin level (subsequently classified as low or normal/high according to local reference values), heart rate, systolic blood pressure, shock index (i.e. ratio between heart rate and systolic blood pressure), and shock index class (class 1 [no shock]: shock index < 0.6; class 2 [mild shock]: shock index ≥ 0.6 to < 1.0; class 3 [moderate shock]: shock index ≥ 1.0 to < 1.4; and class 4 [severe shock]: shock index ≥ 1.4), presence of extra-abdominal injury, time between FAST and abdominal CT (if performed), and hospitalization days. In addition to these clinical variables, the need for an interventional radiologic procedure, laparotomy, or death due to abdominal injury was also extracted from the medical records.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^409a5460]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic challenge and an important source of internal bleeding. FAST has been established as a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach for detection of intra-abdominal free fluid in the emergency room. Large prospective observational studies determined a high specificity (range 0.97 to 1.0) and a high accuracy (range 0.92 to 0.99) but low sensitivity (range 0.56 to 0.71) of initial FAST examination for detecting intra-abdominal injuries in adults and children [-]. Shackford and colleagues assessed the accuracy of FAST performed by non-radiologist clinicians (that is, surgeons and emergency physicians who were certified for FAST by defined standards) for detecting a haemoperitoneum in 241 prospectively investigated adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma (except for n = 2 with penetrating injuries) during a four year period. These findings were confirmed by Richards and co-workers in a four year prospective study of 3,264 adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Similar conclusions were drawn by the same group of investigators in a paediatric population, based on a prospective study on 744 consecutive children 16 years old or younger who underwent emergency FAST for blunt abdominal trauma. Liu and colleagues conducted a one year prospective comparison on the diagnostic accuracy of CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), and sonography in 55 adult patients with blunt abdominal trauma. The authors found a high sensitivity (0.92), specificity (0.95), and accuracy (0.93) of initial FAST examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. Although CT scan and DPL were shown to be more sensitive (1.0 for DPL, 0.97 for CT) than sonography for detection of haemoperitoneum, these diagnostic modalities are more time-consuming (CT and DPL) and invasive (DPL).

### Predictive value of a false-negative focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) result in patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury [^97a1352e]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the value of a false-negative FAST in predicting outcome in trauma patients with confirmed abdominal injury. Our results show that a false-negative FAST is suggestive of a better outcome than a true-positive FAST in confirmed traumatic abdominal injury. This finding seems plausible, because traumatic abdominal injury without any detectable free intra-abdominal fluid on FAST likely indicates a lower risk of clinically relevant organ damage and/or hemodynamic instability that would require invasive treatment and increase mortality risk. Of interest, the time between FAST and abdominal CT was significantly longer in patients with a false-negative FAST than in patients with a true-positive FAST. This may suggest that a low flow of or delayed bleeding may be responsible for false-negative FAST results. Importantly, however, a negative FAST may still miss patients at risk of an unfavorable outcome: 4 out of 40 patients (10%) without free intra-abdominal fluid on ultrasonography eventually required an interventional radiologic procedure (n = 2) or laparotomy (n = 2), although it should also be mentioned that there were no deaths due to abdominal injury in the group of patients with a negative FAST. Furthermore, FAST lost its significance on multivariate analysis, in which contrast extravasation on CT remained as the only significant predictor of an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, FAST cannot substitute for abdominal CT in patients with suspected traumatic abdominal injury, and adequacy of staff and CT scanner availability should be ensured for these patients.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^d8450467]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Tourniquets should be left in place until surgical control of bleeding is achieved ; however, this time span should be restricted as much as possible. Improper or prolonged placement of a tourniquet can lead to complications such as nerve paralysis and limb ischaemia ; however, these effects are rare. Some publications suggest a maximum application time of 2 h. Reports from military settings describe cases in which tourniquets have remained in place for up to 6 h with survival of the extremity. Much recent discussion has centred on the translation of this evidence to civilian practice, as little published evidence exists. Bleeding from most civilian wounds can be controlled using local pressure; however, uncontrolled external bleeding from either blunt or penetrating limb injury should be controlled with a tourniquet.

Patients with severe high-energy and complex pelvic trauma, haemodynamic instability and massive blood loss belong to the most severe and highly lethal group of trauma patients, and their management is time-sensitive and challenging. Global mortality in polytraumatised patients presenting with pelvic ring fractures remains high (33%) despite improvements in management and treatment algorithms. The pelvis can create a multifocal haemorrhage, including significant retroperitoneal haematoma, which may not be easily compressible or possible to manage using traditional surgical methods. Treatment of pelvic ring fractures requires re-approximation of bony structures to address mechanical instability, damage-control resuscitation (DCR) to restore haemostasis, assessment for associated injuries and triage of investigations. In addition, multimodal haemorrhage control [external fixation and compression (damage-control orthopaedics), retroperitoneal packing (damage-control surgery), urgent radiologic angioembolisation or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA)] by multidisciplinary trauma specialists (general surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, endovascular surgeons/interventional radiologists) is required [,–].

### Is the FAST exam reliable in severely injured patients? [^0227abf6]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Highly sensitive and accurate for the detection of injuries requiring intervention in haemodynamically unstable patients, FAST may underestimate intra-abdominal injuries in stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma. Diminished accuracy of ultrasound has been reported in different cohorts of multiple injured patients. We hypothesised that multiple injured patients with a high Injury Severity Score (ISS) will have a decreased accuracy of FAST for the assessment of blunt abdominal trauma.

Methods

Data from the trauma registry of a Level 1 trauma centre were retrospectively reviewed. All haemodynamically stable blunt trauma patients who underwent both FAST and CT scan of abdomen from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2005 were included in the cohort. All patients were divided into three groups according to their ISS: Group 1 included patients with an ISS from 1 to 14, Group 2 included patients with an ISS from 16 to 24, and Group 3 consisted of patients with ISS>or=25.

Results

3181 patients with blunt abdominal trauma included into the study were divided into the three groups according to the ISS. The mean ISS was 7.9+/-3.97, 19.6+/-2.48 and 41.3+/-11.95 in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The accuracy of ultrasound was 90.6% in the group of patients with the highest ISS (>or=25) compared with 97.5 and 97.1 for Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001). Similarly, ultrasound had a significantly lower sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for patients in Group 3 compared with the first two groups (p<0.001). There was a significantly lower sensitivity in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (p<0.001), but no differences in specificity, accuracy, PPV or NPV were demonstrated.

Conclusion

Patients with high ISS are at increased risk of having ultrasound-occult injuries and have a lower accuracy of their ultrasound examination than patients with low and moderate ISS.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^8ce65da5]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

The severely injured patient arriving to the hospital with continuous bleeding or deep haemorrhagic shock generally has a poor chance of survival unless early control of bleeding, proper resuscitation, and blood transfusion are achieved. This is particularly true for patients who present with uncontrolled bleeding due to multiple penetrating injuries as well as patients with multiple injuries and unstable pelvic fractures with ongoing bleeding from fracture sites and retroperitoneal vessels. The common denominator in these patients is the exhaustion of physiological reserves with resulting profound acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy. In the trauma community, this is also called the 'bloody vicious cycle' or the 'lethal triad.' In 1983, Stone and colleagues described the techniques of abbreviated laparotomy, packing to control haemorrhage and of deferred definitive surgical repair until coagulation had been established. Since then, a number of authors have described the beneficial results of this concept, which is now called 'damage control' [,,,,-]. Damage control consists of three components. The first component is an abbreviated resuscitative laparotomy for control of bleeding, the restitution of blood flow where necessary, and the control of contamination. This should be achieved as quickly as possible without spending unnecessary time on traditional organ repairs that can be deferred to a later phase. The abdomen is packed and temporary abdominal closure is performed. The second component is intensive care treatment, focused on core rewarming, correction of the acid-base imbalance, and coagulopathy as well as optimising the ventilation and the haemodynamic status. Further diagnostic investigations are also frequently performed during this phase. The third component is the definitive surgical repair that is performed only when target parameters have been achieved [,-].

Despite the lack of controlled randomised studies comparing damage control to traditional surgical management, a retrospective review by Stone and colleagues presents data in favour of damage control for the severely injured patient presenting signs of coagulopathy during surgery. Rotondo and colleagues found similar results in a subgroup of patients with major vascular injury and two or more visceral injuries, and Carrillo and colleagues demonstrated the benefit of damage control in patients with iliac vessel injury. In addition, a cumulative review of 961 patients treated with damage control reported overall mortality and morbidity rates of 52% and 40%, respectively.

Management of pelvic fractures with associated hemorrhage—key messages for stable patients state that hemodynamically stable patients with pelvic fractures should undergo cross-sectional imaging to evaluate the extent of the injury and for the presence of pelvic hemorrhage, and that patients with evidence of contrast extravasation on imaging and either significant hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability should undergo formal angiography and potential angioembolization.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^1fd9a7b8]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

Blunt abdominal trauma represents a major diagnostic challenge and an important source of internal bleeding. FAST has been established as a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic approach for the detection of intra-abdominal free fluid in the emergency room [-]. Large prospective observational studies determined a high specificity and accuracy but low sensitivity of initial FAST examination for detecting intra-abdominal injuries in adults and children [-]. Liu and colleagues found a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of initial FAST examination for the detection of haemoperitoneum. Although CT scans and DPL were shown to be more sensitive than sonography for the detection of haemoperitoneum, these diagnostic modalities are more time-consuming (CT and DPL) and invasive (DPL).

The role of CT scanning of acute trauma patients is well documented [-], and in recent years imaging for trauma patients has migrated towards multi-slice CT (MSCT). The integration of modern MSCT scanners in the emergency room area allows the immediate assessment of trauma victims following admission. Using modern MSCT scanners, total whole-body scanning time may be reduced to less than 30 seconds. In a retrospective study comparing 370 patients in two groups, Weninger and colleagues showed that faster diagnosis using MSCT led to shorter emergency room and operating room time and shorter ICU stays. Huber-Wagner and colleagues also showed the benefit of integration of the whole-body CT into early trauma care. CT diagnosis significantly increases the probability of survival in patients with polytrauma. Whole-body CT as a standard diagnostic tool during the earliest resuscitation phase for polytraumatised patients provides the added benefit of identifying head and chest injuries and other bleeding sources in patients with multiple injuries.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^b00f59ec]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound—focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is a routine and critical part of the initial evaluation of all trauma patients, but in obese patients the increased depth of subcutaneous fat and its sound-attenuating characteristics present a significant challenge in obtaining diagnostic FAST imaging; use of lower frequency probes facilitates tissue penetration and better identification of deep structures but contributes to lower resolution, and the propensity toward blunt chest injuries in this population can also complicate image acquisition when extra-thoracic air is present. When FAST is compromised by the effects of morbid obesity, computed tomography (CT) imaging remains the best alternative in hemodynamically stable patients, whereas conventional radiographs, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, or exploratory laparotomy are all viable alternatives in unstable patients where FAST image quality is insufficient to guide clinical decision-making.

### Acute management and outcome of multiple trauma patients with pelvic disruptions [^9eacd9a1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disruptions of the pelvic ring represent 2% to 3% of all fractures. The injury mechanisms most likely to cause a pelvic fracture are high-speed road traffic accidents and falls from high altitude. In multiple-trauma patients, the incidence of pelvic injuries is increased, and pelvic hemorrhage may result from bony bleeding or disruptions of the surrounding perivesical or presacral venous plexus, but also arterial pelvic vessels have been implicated as a significant factor leading to exsanguination and death [-]. The reported mortality rates differ largely from 5% to 50% and are dependent not only on the type of pelvic-ring fracture but also on the severity of associated injuries involving the abdomen, chest, and central nervous system [-]. Although, according to recent literature, a distinct decrease of mortality rate is found in patients with a combination of severe pelvic disruptions and hemodynamic instability or with so-called "complex pelvic injuries," it still remains unacceptably high. Complex pelvic injuries are defined as all pelvic fractures (acetabulum, pelvic ring, and sacrum) with pelvic soft-tissue injuries (that is, open fracture including Morel-Lavallée lesion, disruption of pelvic vessels including retroperitoneal hematoma, and urogenital and neurologic injuries directly related to the pelvic fracture). For these seriously injured patients, a multitude of scientific investigations and as many management guidelines exist [-]. Most of the latter focus on the patient's time in the emergency department (ED) or trauma room, and examples of actual guidelines are the "Complex Pelvic Fracture Module," as part of the trauma algorithm by Tscherne and Pohlemann (Figure 1) and the ATLS Pelvic Fracture Algorithm (Advanced Trauma Life Support). Both pelvis-specific trauma algorithms recommend early hemorrhage control and massive fluid resuscitation. Thereby, hemorrhage control is achieved through mechanical immobilization of the pelvic ring by external counterpressure with the aid of a pelvic binder, a pelvic C-clamp, or an external fixator. In certain cases, ongoing pelvic hemorrhage may require pelvic packing and/or angioembolization. In contrast to the emergency department or trauma room well-established management guidelines, data on the prehospital management of pelvic fractures and its relation to outcome is rarely reported in the literature. This is rather regrettable because of the upcoming evidence that limiting the amount of fluids given by following a strategy of permissive hypotension during the initial resuscitation period may improve trauma outcomes [-]. Although the German Pelvic Injury Register (PIR) represents the only nationwide database specifically focusing on pelvic trauma, unfortunately, a scarcity exists of records of the prehospital phase, and the trauma room and intensive care unit (ICU) data are fewer. Conversely, the TraumaRegister DGU (TR) includes all these missing data, but all included injuries, even the pelvic fractures, are coded by using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). A further difficulty is appearing from the fact that, in contrast to the Tile/OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma Association) classification that is used in the PIR, the AIS is not adopted in recent trauma algorithms nor is it in clinical use. We report herein for the first time on matching these two anonymous trauma databases to create an intersection set that benefits from complementary data of each register, respectively. We focus on not-yet-described differences in fluid management for different Tile/OTA types of pelvic-ring fractures in the initial resuscitation period (that is, prehospital phase and time from arrival in the trauma room until admission to the ICU). We would also like to find out whether, apart from the "complex pelvic fractures," the mechanically unstable pelvic-ring fractures type B/C, according Tile's/OTA classification, form a distinct entity that must be considered separately within future pelvic-trauma algorithms.

Diagnostic scan protocols

Focused assessment by sonography in trauma

The FAST examination is the foundational trauma ultrasound study and is an integral part of the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol, supporting the primary survey. Its purpose is to identify the presence or absence of pericardial fluid, free intraperitoneal fluid, or pleural fluid. Fluid in any of these areas typically appears anechoic and, in the context of trauma, should be presumed to be blood. Specifically, in the setting of blunt trauma (in which this protocol was first studied), a positive FAST examination along with hemodynamic instability should prompt rapid surgical intervention.

The convex array probe is placed sequentially in the following positions.

Subxiphoid: provides a four-chamber cardiac view.
Right thoracoabdominal area (mid-axillary line): evaluates Morrison’s pouch and the right pleural base.
Left thoracoabdominal area (mid-to-posterior axillary line): assesses the splenorenal space and the left pleural base.
Pelvic space: evaluates for free pelvic fluid.

If the subxiphoid view is not feasible due to body habitus or injury, the pericardium can be assessed using the left parasternal long-axis view.

FAST examination reliability

The reliability of FAST has been extensively studied:

A meta-analysis of 62 studies reported an overall sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 99.2%. Sensitivity improves in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, highlighting its utility in guiding surgical intervention, especially in penetrating trauma.
A review of eight observational studies found high specificity (94.1%–100%) for detecting injuries in penetrating trauma, supporting its role in determining the need for resource-intensive interventions such as resuscitative thoracotomy.
A single-center study of 187 trauma arrest patients found that the absence of pericardial effusion and cardiac motion correlated with zero survivability.

Levels of evidence and grade of recommendations

Among these societies’ delegates, the OC named the Scientific Committee (SC, 9 members) and the Jury Panel (JP, 9 members) in which each society was represented. The SC had the responsibility of creating 3 presentations according to the retrieved literature to answer the 3 questions selected by the OC.

The three questions were:

1. Which hemodynamically unstable patient needs a preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP)?

2. Which hemodynamically unstable patient needs an external fixation (EF)?

3. Which hemodynamically unstable patient needs emergent angiography (AG)?

The OC reviewed the retrieved papers and selected the most appropriated as related to the three topics. Studies not directly addressing the management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma were excluded (elective procedures, stable patients, reviews studies). Manual cross-reference search of the relevant studies was performed by the OC and the related relevant papers were also retrieved. The selected papers were subsequently sent to the members of the SC in late December 2012, helping in the review of the literature. The SC and the OC shared the presentation in late February and completed the work in early March 2013. At the conference was also invited a representative of a voluntary association the Italian Association of Blood Volunteers (Associazione Volontari Italiani del Sangue, AVIS), as a representative of the civil society. During the day of the conference (April 13 th 2013) the SC presented in the morning the whole review of the literature and in the afternoon the statements for each of the three questions. The JP, who was previously aware of the content of presentations and statements, discussed with the audience the results and formally approved the statements. Furthermore an algorithm for the whole management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma was proposed during the conference. In the subsequent months the discussion took place by email and the overall content of the conference was definitely approved by all the members of the three committees. The Scientific Societies gave the last approval and permission for submission and publication.

### Evaluation and management of blunt solid organ trauma [^b84d3e8f]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Trauma is a leading cause of death in patients under the age of 45 and generally associated with a high kinetic energy event such as a motor vehicle accident or fall from extreme elevations. Blunt trauma can affect every organ system and major vascular structure with potentially devastating effect. When we consider abdominal solid organ injury from blunt trauma, we usually think of the liver, spleen, and kidneys. However, all of the abdominal organs, including the pancreas and adrenal glands, may be involved. Blunt hepatic trauma is more commonly associated with venous bleeding rather than arterial injury. Stable venous injury is often managed conservatively; when the patient is hemodynamically unstable from venous hepatic injury, operative management should be first-line therapy. When the injury is arterial, endovascular therapy should be initiated. Blunt trauma to the spleen is the most common cause of traumatic injury to the spleen. Management is controversial. In our institution unstable patients are taken to the operating room, and stable patients with Grades IV-V injuries and patients with active arterial injury are taken for endovascular treatment. Renal injuries are less common, and evidence of arterial injury such as active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm is warranted before endovascular therapy. Pancreatic trauma is uncommon and usually secondary to steering wheel/handlebar mechanism injuries. Adrenal injuries are rare in the absence of megatrauma or underlying adrenal abnormality.

### Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage: efficacy of conservative management and embolisation [^8a503e7c]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of conservative management and embolisation in patients with spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage.

Methods

Single-centre retrospective case–control study of patients with spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage treated conservatively or with embolisation. Patients aged ≥ 18 years were identified from CT imaging reports stating a diagnosis of retroperitoneal haemorrhage or similar and images reviewed for confirmation. Exclusion criteria included recent trauma, surgery, retroperitoneal vascular line insertion, or other non-spontaneous aetiology.

Datapoints analysed included treatment approach (conservative or embolisation), technical success, clinical success, and mortality outcome.

Results

A total of 54 patients met inclusion criteria, who were predominantly anticoagulated (74%), male (72%), older adults (mean age 69 years), with active haemorrhage on CT (52%). Overall mortality was 15%. Clinical success was more likely with conservative management (36/38) than embolisation (9/16; p < 0.01), and all-cause (1/38 vs 7/16; p < 0.01) and uncontrolled primary bleeding (1/38 vs 5/16; p < 0.01) mortality were higher with embolisation. However, embolised patients more commonly had active bleeding on CT (15/38 vs 13/16; p < 0.01), shock (5/38 vs 6/16; p < 0.04), and higher blood transfusion volumes (mean 2.2 vs 5.9 units; p < 0.01). After one-to-one propensity score matching, differences in clinical success (p = 0.04) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.01) remained; however, difference in uncontrolled primary bleeding mortality did not (p = 0.07).

Conclusion

Conservative management of SRH is likely to be effective in most patients, even in those who are anticoagulated and haemodynamically unstable, with variable success seen after embolisation in a more unstable patient group, supporting the notion that resuscitation and optimisation of coagulation are the most vital components of treatment.

### Initial care of the patient with blunt polytrauma [^99161e5e]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

The initial care of the patient with blunt polytrauma involves a systematic search for causes of hemodynamic instability. Bleeding most often occurs in the pleural space, peritoneal cavity, and retroperitoneum. Orthopaedic injuries also can contribute to instability after blunt trauma. Blood loss from open fractures may be substantial, and exposure with direct vessel control should be performed early. Pelvic fractures can be associated with severe retroperitoneal bleeding. The treatment of patients with complex pelvic fractures includes closing the pelvic space with a binding device, and early pelvic angiography with embolization. Care of patients with multiple organ and bone injuries requires coordination by one trauma team leader. This physician oversees the resuscitation and sets treatment priorities, including the type and amount of time allowed for fracture stabilization. In many cases, nonorthopaedic injuries will need to be addressed before definitive fracture care. However, optimal care typically involves a coordinated multispeciality approach that sometimes includes concurrent operative procedures. Patients with severe physiologic derangements may require damage control techniques to decrease blood loss and operative time. Understanding the overall care of patients who are injured critically will facilitate the integration of the orthopaedic surgeon into the trauma team.

### Pelvic free fluid in asymptomatic pediatric blunt abdominal trauma patients: a case series and review of the literature [^82f09ab6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

With focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examinations being performed more commonly on pediatric trauma patients, emergency providers will encounter a positive FAST examination in patients with benign abdominal examinations. This poses a diagnostic dilemma for the provider when deciding whether to obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis, observe the patient, or admit the patient.

Case Report

We report a series of pediatric patients involved in blunt abdominal trauma who had small pelvic free fluid on FAST but a benign abdominal examination. Three patients were managed without CT scan and 2 with CT scan. All patients did well and were discharged home. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Free intra-abdominal fluid may be physiologic in both male and female pediatric patients. Clinical examination and hemodynamic stability should be taken into account when deciding to order a CT scan. We review the literature and highlight new protocols that may decrease CT utilization and ionizing radiation exposure, though further studies in this specific population are needed.

### Trust the FAST: confirmation that the FAST examination is highly specific for intra-abdominal hemorrhage in over 1, 200 patients with pelvic fractures [^a79fc376]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination in patients with pelvic fractures has been reported as unreliable. We hypothesized that FAST is a reliable method for detecting clinically significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage in patients with pelvic fractures.

Methods

All patients with pelvic fractures over a 10-year period were reviewed at a Level I trauma center. The predictive ability of FAST was assessed by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value against the criterion standard of either computed tomography (CT) or laparotomy findings. The FAST examination was considered "false negative" if findings at laparotomy indicated traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Likewise, the FAST examination was considered "false positive" if either CT or findings at laparotomy indicated no intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Hemodynamic instability scores were calculated for all patients.

Results

There were 1,456 patients with pelvic fractures and an initial FAST reviewed; 1,219 (83.7%) underwent FAST and either CT or operative exploration. Median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 26-56 years) and mean Injury Severity Score was 18.5 ± 12.3. The sensitivity and specificity for FAST in this group of patients with pelvic fracture was 85.4% and 98.1%, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 78.4% and 98.8%, respectively. Of 21 patients with a false-positive FAST, 15 (71.4%) were confirmed with a negative CT scan, and 6 (28.6%) underwent laparotomy without findings of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Of 13 patients with a false-negative FAST, all were identified with positive findings at the time of laparotomy. The specificity of the FAST examination remained high regardless of hemodynamic instability score grade.

Conclusion

The false positive rate of FAST examination for intra-abdominal hemorrhage is 1.1%. These data suggest that a positive FAST in this clinical scenario should be considered to represent intra-abdominal fluid. This series contradicts prior reports that FAST is unreliable in patients with pelvic fracture.

### Clinical review: initial management of blunt pelvic trauma patients with haemodynamic instability [^b999acfa]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic trauma can lead to severe, uncontrollable haemorrhage and death related to prolonged shock and multiple organ failure. Massive retroperitoneal haematoma should be assumed to be present in cases of post-traumatic haemodynamic instability associated with pelvic fracture in the absence of extrapelvic haemorrhagic lesions. This review describes the pathophysiology of retroperitoneal haematoma in trauma patient with blunt pelvic fracture, considering the roles of venous and arterial bleeding. Efficacy and safety of haemostatic procedures are also discussed, and particular attention is given to the efficacy of pelvic angiographic embolization and external pelvic fixation. A decision making algorithm is proposed for the treatment of trauma patients with pelvic fracture that takes haemodynamic status and associated lesions into account.

### An update on nonoperative management of the spleen in adults [^dc53a793]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Monitoring the patient

Conventional patient monitoring includes the tracking of vital signs, performance of serial physical examinations, and obtaining several hemoglobin levels, all of which can be helpful in determining if the patient is hemodynamically normal and if bleeding is a concern. In addition to these assessments, a determination should be made if there are any trends toward hemodynamic instability such as a rising heart rate or a rise in diastolic blood pressure indicating a narrow pulse pressure. These trends, if identified early, may indicate that the patient may be bleeding and has failed nonoperative management. Although some studies report the frequency with which these evaluations and tests are performed, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guidelines report that there are not enough evidenced-based studies to justify a recommendation.Other areas that have shown variation in practice include frequency of abdominal examinations, repeat imaging, and the optimal time to mobilize the patient.

These require follow-up imaging of the kidneys and ureters.

### Predictive value of a false-negative focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) result in patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury [^4e80c6f9]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The present study had some limitations. First, it was performed in a tertiary care center in Europe, where the majority of abdominal traumas results from a blunt mechanism and penetrating lesions are less frequent. Only 2 of 97 cases (2.1%) suffered from penetrating trauma in the present study. The results may be different in other non-European countries in which the incidence of gunshot or stab wounds is higher. Second, the results of this study are only applicable to settings in which FAST is used as an upfront screening tool in all patients with possible abdominal injury, and not in institutions in which FAST is only performed in hemodynamically unstable patients and CT is done instead of FAST in hemodynamically stable patients. Third, FAST was performed by 27 different radiology residents in this study, which may have introduced observer bias that could not be accounted for. However, this reflects clinical practice. Fourth, FAST cannot discriminate between free intra-abdominal fluid due to trauma and pre-existent ascites that may have numerous causes, and 5 of such cases (3 with cirrhosis, 1 with cardiac failure, and 1 with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt) had to be excluded from our study. This potential pitfall should be taken into account when performing FAST in trauma patients. Fifth, standard B-mode ultrasonography was used in this study, whereas newer techniques such as contrast-enhanced ultrasonography may have the potential to improve the detection of traumatic injury. However, whether or not such an approach is feasible in trauma patients remains unclear. Sixth, the number of patients was too low to perform subgroup analyses according to the type of abdominal injury and to determine if healthcare providers can take the time to perform CT and avoid emergent laparotomy in patients with a negative FAST. Seventh, our study included 15 children (i.e. aged 17 years or younger) of whom 3 (20.0%) with a false-negative FAST and 82 adults (i.e. aged 18 years or older) of whom 37 (45.1%) with a false-negative FAST. Unfortunately, the number of cases was too low to statistically compare the outcome of children to that of adults with a false-negative FAST. Eighth, the decision to perform additional abdominal CT after FAST was based on the (trauma) surgeon’s clinical judgment, for which no clear criteria could be defined. Ninth, we did not have any dedicated software or other tools to reproducibly quantify the amount of free intra-abdominal fluid on CT, whereas this may be another variable potentially related to false-negative FAST results and favorable outcome. Nevertheless, in resource-constrained regions where CT is not available (and the amount of free intra-abdominal fluid cannot be measured on CT), the FAST examination may be the only imaging tool on which management decisions are based. Tenth, only the presence of and not the severity of injuries was considered in the analysis of results.

Clinical Vignette

A 35 year-old female is injured in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which her car is struck on the driver's side by a distracted driver. The patient is unable to self-extricate from the vehicle and she is confused at the scene. She comes directly to the trauma bay via EMS and a binder is placed in transit for suspicion of a pelvic ring injury. Upon presentation she has a GCS of 14 due to confusion, and an initial pressure of 87/50. Workup does not disclose an associated head, chest or abdominal injury and the anteroposterior pelvis radiograph demonstrates a windswept pelvis injury pattern. Despite being transfused 4 units of whole blood, her hypotension does not improve. Please describe your institution's advanced resuscitation protocol and management of this scenario, and provide the rational and support for it.

### Non operative management of abdominal trauma-a 10 years review [^77fc21db]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Material and methods

This is a ten year (January 2001 to December 2011) retrospective analysis of successful implementation of NOM for blunt abdominal trauma at a Tertiary Trauma Care Center in Oman. Oman has one of the highest incidences of Road traffic accidents in the world. Almost all the patients were victims of road traffic accidents. Being National trauma center, our hospital receives patients from all primary and secondary care hospitals in Oman, in addition to direct admission through accident and emergency.

On arrival all the patients were assessed and resuscitated if necessary, in accordance with ATLS protocol. History including the mechanism of injury formed an important part of the evaluation. All the patients underwent FAST/Abdominal sonography. Stable patients with positive FAST were further evaluated with chest, abdomen and pelvic CT scan. Patients with other associated injuries were examined by the respective specialists with close coordination. Patients with heart rate of <110/min, systolic BP of >90 mm Hg on arrival or following initial resuscitation were considered stable. Prior to the inclusion of the patients in the study an ethical clearance was sought from the competent authority of the Khoula Hospital, Oman. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient/close relatives for publication of this report and any accompanying images.

Among 5400 polytrauma patients, 1285 were diagnosed to have abdominal injuries. On secondary survey, based on hemodynamic stability, clinical findings and investigations, 1071(83%) patients were selected for NOM. The exclusion criteria for rejecting NOM in 214(17%) patients were signs of exsanguination, persistent hemodynamic instability and no response to initial resuscitation or obvious bowel injury. All stable patients were treated nonoperatively. The severity of head injury, associated orthopedic injuries, a high injury severity score or a higher radiological grading of the visceral injuries or multiple solid organ trauma were not considered as an exclusion criteria in haemodynamically stable patients.

NOM patients were admitted to HDU/ICU, closely monitored with repeated clinical assessment. The protocol included evaluation of vitals, Pulse, BP, temperature, urine output, 12 hourly hemoglobin, and hematocrit (HCT) estimation for the first 72 hrs. Follow up ultra sound abdomen or CT scan were done only if hemoglobin dropped despite 3 units of blood transfusion, progressive distension of abdomen, signs of infection, vomiting, hematuria or tachypnea. To detect occult bowel injuries, not able to diagnose otherwise, diagnostic peritoneal tap was notably successful.

### Preperitoneal packing versus angioembolization for the initial management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fabd8110]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This project is the first to explore the differences between the AE and PPP cohort in a systematic fashion. Although the differences between AE and PPP or the indications for both are unlikely to be novel to a traumatologist, the significant clinical and physiological differences between the two groups found in this review is novel. While the role for each intervention cannot be fully explored, it is clear that, based on current literature, one should not be seen to be superior to another. To reduce the risk of missing studies, an overly broad search strategy was used to aid in identifying all possible studies pertaining to this topic.

Although commonly sprouted as the key recommendation in systematic reviews, a randomized controlled trial is exceedingly difficult in this cohort, bordering on impossible. In lieu, higher-quality prospective cohorts with standardized reporting are required.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^1007b504]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Renal trauma operative indications—Zone II retroperitoneal hematoma guidance prioritizes selective exploration. The primary indication of an underlying renal injury is the presence of a Zone II retroperitoneal hematoma. Do not disturb nonexpanding Zone II retroperitoneal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma, and take patients to CT imaging after laparotomy if hemodynamically stable. Explore Zone II hematomas after blunt trauma if the hematoma is ruptured, pulsatile, expanding, or in a patient with ongoing hemodynamic instability. After penetrating trauma, Zone II retroperitoneal hematomas may be explored because of the increased likelihood for clinically significant injury to the kidney or ureter that requires repair. Surgical intervention is required in patients who undergo imaging prior to exploration and are found to have hilar avulsions or extensive injuries of the renal pelvis or proximal ureter. Conservative or endourologic (minimally invasive) techniques can often be used as first-line options, and retroperitoneal exploration can generally be avoided in hemodynamically stable patients with renal parenchymal injuries without hilar involvement or other previously stated indications for exploration.

### Exsanguination in trauma: a review of diagnostics and treatment options [^95ba357e]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock who only transiently respond or do not respond to fluid therapy and/or the administration of blood products have exsanguinating injuries. Recognising shock due to (exsanguinating) haemorrhage in trauma is about constructing a synthesis of trauma mechanism, injuries, vital signs and the therapeutic response of the patient. The aim of prehospital care of bleeding trauma patients is to deliver the patient to a facility for definitive care within the shortest amount of time by rapid transport and minimise therapy to what is necessary to maintain adequate vital signs. Rapid decisions have to be made using regional trauma triage protocols that have incorporated patient condition, transport times and the level of care than can be performed by the prehospital care providers and the receiving hospitals. The treatment of bleeding patients is aimed at two major goals: stopping the bleeding and restoration of the blood volume. Fluid resuscitation should allow for preservation of vital functions without increasing the risk for further (re)bleeding. To prevent further deterioration and subsequent exsanguinations 'permissive hypotension' may be the goal to achieve. Within the hospital, a sound trauma team activation system, including the logistic procedure as well as activation criteria, is essential for a fast and adequate response. After determination of haemorrhagic shock, all efforts have to be directed to stop the bleeding in order to prevent exsanguinations. A simultaneous effort is made to restore blood volume and correct coagulation. Reversal of coagulopathy with pharmacotherapeutic interventions may be a promising concept to limit blood loss after trauma. Abdominal ultrasound has replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage for detection of haemoperitoneum. With the development of sliding-gantry based computer tomography diagnostic systems, rapid evaluation by CT-scanning of the trauma patient is possible during resuscitation. The concept of damage control surgery, the staged approach in treatment of severe trauma, has proven to be of vital importance in the treatment of exsanguinating trauma patients and is adopted worldwide. When performing 'blind' transfusion or 'damage control resuscitation', a predetermined fixed ratio of blood components may result in the administration of higher plasma and platelets doses and may improve outcome. The role of thromboelastography and thromboelastometry as point-of-care tests for coagulation in massive blood loss is emerging, providing information about actual clot formation and clot stability, shortly (10min) after the blood sample is taken. Thus, therapy guided by the test results will allow for administration of specific coagulation factors that will be depleted despite administration with fresh frozen plasma during massive transfusion of blood components.

### Management of pericardial fluid in blunt trauma: variability in practice and predictors of operative outcome in patients with computed tomography evidence of pericardial fluid [^e672c3ac]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The objectives of this study were to assess current variability in management preferences for blunt trauma patients with pericardial fluid, and to identify characteristics associated with operative intervention for patients with pericardial fluid on admission computed tomography (CT) scan.

Methods

This was a mixed-methods study of blunt trauma patients with pericardial fluid. The first portion was a research survey of members of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma conducted in 2016, in which surgeons were presented with four clinical scenarios of blunt trauma patients with pericardial fluid. The second portion of the study was a retrospective evaluation of all blunt trauma patients 14 years or older treated at our Level I trauma center between January 1, 2010, and November 1, 2015, with pericardial fluid on admission CT scan.

Results

For the survey portion of our study, 393 surgeons responded (27% response rate). There was significant variability in management preferences for scenarios depicting trace pericardial fluid on CT with concerning hemodynamics, and for scenarios depicting hemopericardium intraoperatively. For the separate retrospective portion of our study, we identified 75 blunt trauma patients with pericardial fluid on admission CT scan. Seven underwent operative management; six of these had hypotension and/or electrocardiogram changes. In multivariable analysis, pericardial fluid amount was a significant predictor of receiving pericardial window (relative risk for one category increase in pericardial fluid amount, 3.99, 95% confidence interval, 1.47-10.81) but not of mortality.

Conclusion

There is significant variability in management preferences for patients with pericardial fluid from blunt trauma, indicating a need for evidence-based research. Our institutional data suggest that patients with minimal to small amounts of pericardial fluid without concerning clinical findings may be observed. Patients with moderate to large amounts of pericardial fluid who are clinically stable with normal hemodynamics may also appear appropriate for observation, although confirmation in larger studies is needed. Patients with hemodynamic instability should undergo operative exploration.

### Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage: efficacy of conservative management and embolisation [^74d4dd60]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy of conservative management and embolisation in patients with spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage.

Methods

Single-centre retrospective case-control study of patients with spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage treated conservatively or with embolisation. Patients aged≥18 years were identified from CT imaging reports stating a diagnosis of retroperitoneal haemorrhage or similar and images reviewed for confirmation. Exclusion criteria included recent trauma, surgery, retroperitoneal vascular line insertion, or other non-spontaneous aetiology. Datapoints analysed included treatment approach (conservative or embolisation), technical success, clinical success, and mortality outcome.

Results

A total of 54 patients met inclusion criteria, who were predominantly anticoagulated (74%), male (72%), older adults (mean age 69 years), with active haemorrhage on CT (52%). Overall mortality was 15%. Clinical success was more likely with conservative management (36/38) than embolisation (9/16; p<0.01), and all-cause (1/38 vs 7/16; p<0.01) and uncontrolled primary bleeding (1/38 vs 5/16; p<0.01) mortality were higher with embolisation. However, embolised patients more commonly had active bleeding on CT (15/38 vs 13/16; p<0.01), shock (5/38 vs 6/16; p<0.04), and higher blood transfusion volumes (mean 2.2 vs 5.9 units; p<0.01). After one-to-one propensity score matching, differences in clinical success (p=0.04) and all-cause mortality (p=0.01) remained; however, difference in uncontrolled primary bleeding mortality did not (p=0.07).

Conclusion

Conservative management of SRH is likely to be effective in most patients, even in those who are anticoagulated and haemodynamically unstable, with variable success seen after embolisation in a more unstable patient group, supporting the notion that resuscitation and optimisation of coagulation are the most vital components of treatment.

### Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage: efficacy of conservative management and embolisation [^64380b09]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study supports the notion that most patients with SRH can be safely treated conservatively [,,–]. While most patients treated conservatively were haemodynamically stable, conservative treatment was also successful in the 13.2% of patients initially unstable, 100% of whom were taking therapeutic anticoagulation. This is comparable to results in the study by Warren et al. where the majority of anticoagulated patients with SRH were successfully managed with transfusion and cessation/reversal of anticoagulation, including patients with shock. These findings suggest that embolisation in SRH may be best reserved for patients with ongoing bleeding despite adequate reversal of anticoagulation agents, or patients who were not anticoagulated to begin with and are haemodynamically unstable.

Groups in the present study were not congruent, with embolised patients more likely to have been unstable and/or received a high blood resuscitation volume, and were not matched even after propensity score matching, particularly regarding blood transfusion volume. The lower success rate in the embolisation group was likely contributed to by underlying coagulopathy, which has been shown to develop in the setting of major blood loss. Extrapolating from trauma literature, the most effective way to treat and prevent coagulopathy in acute blood loss is large volume transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. However, large volume transfusion has been associated with multi-organ failure and infection, which may account for the high rate of bacteraemia and high mortality in this SRH group.

SRH has traditionally been thought to occur predominantly in elderly patients on anticoagulation medications, with an overall low incidence but high mortality. The mean age of 69 years in the present cohort is closely concordant with previous reports, as are the percentages of patients with therapeutic anticoagulation (70%), INR ≥ 2.0 (30%) significant renal impairment (eGFR < 30; 22%), and two or more antihypertensive medications at the time of SRH (35%), reflecting the typically elderly and medically comorbid cohort. Of recent interest, COVID-19 infection was present in two non-fatal cases and has been suggested as a possible risk factor given the coagulopathy and vasculopathy of the novel coronavirus. The overall mortality of 15% in the present cohort is comparable to the range of 12% to 22% in recent published series with similar rates of embolisation.

### Predictive value of a false-negative focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) result in patients with confirmed traumatic abdominal injury [^64ebdb82]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, trauma patients with confirmed abdominal injury and a false-negative FAST have a better outcome than those with a true-positive FAST. FAST may be valuable for risk stratification and prognostication in patients with a high suspicion of abdominal injury when CT has not been performed yet or when CT is not available.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute blunt abdominal trauma [^f78e31a6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Acute blunt abdominal trauma—screening for intra-abdominal injury using clinical indicators and laboratory values is described with diagnostic performance and CT utilization impact: Injuries qualifying for intra-abdominal injury included any contusion or laceration of an intra- or retroperitoneal viscus and/or the presence of free intra- or retroperitoneal fluid, and major injuries were defined as those requiring surgery or embolization, as well as splenic grade III injury or liver grade III injury or higher. Eighty-five of 714 patients evaluated had positive CT scan results, thirty-nine had major injuries, and 26 required surgery or embolization. Using clinical indicators (Glasgow Coma Scale score <14, guarding, tenderness) and laboratory values (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate aminotransferase [SGOT/AST] >50 IU/L, hematocrit level <36, and WBC count >10,000 mm3) as a screen for intra-abdominal injury, the study showed a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 19%, PPV of 14%, NPV of 99%, and LLR of 1.2; knowledge of the FAST examination results could have biased clinician documentation of clinical indicators and falsely increased the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Application of this screening test would have accounted for a reduction of 117 CT scans for patients in the study and would have misdiagnosed 1 patient with intra-abdominal injury.

### Multidisciplinary management of thoracic aortic injury with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture in the elderly [^86fd9590]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Early mortality in BTAI patients was primarily driven by inadequate tissue perfusion and hemodynamic instability. Acute injuries were associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, underscoring the significance of timely diagnosis and intervention. Although diagnosing BTAI was challenging, various imaging modalities could aid in its detection. For suspected trauma, Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) is the preferred screening method in many emergency departments globally. FAST often reveals hypoechoic areas of free fluid in the chest cavity; however, in our first patient, the FAST yielded negative results, suggesting that a negative FAST does not rule out vascular injury, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients. The use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) necessitates specialized training and is highly operator-dependent. Additionally, this procedure is contraindicated in patients with neck injuries and absolutely contraindicated in those with esophageal injuries. In a 9-year retrospective study, Goarin et al. compared TEE with angiography and CT in 209 patients with blunt trauma. They reported a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100% for TEE in diagnosing injuries. However, TEE has limited visualization of the proximal ascending aorta and its major branches, potentially overlooking injuries such as partial rupture of the subclavian artery. TEE is theoretically suitable for hemodynamically unstable patients with a high suspicion of isolated aortic injury or those unfit for transfer to the radiology department for chest CT or aortic arch angiography. Although TEE can be performed at the bedside on potentially unstable patients, appropriate airway management may be required prior to the procedure. Chest X-ray is a rapid and convenient method for the early diagnosis of aortic injury, with mediastinal widening being the most crucial radiographic sign. However, the sensitivity and specificity of chest X-rays are often suboptimal. Studies have shown that approximately 7.3–44% of patients with aortic injury may have a normal mediastinum, increasing the risk of delayed diagnosis. For remote, non-trauma centers, it can serve as one of the diagnostic tools for suspicion and referral to advanced trauma centers. The gold standard for diagnosing BTAI is chest CTA, with a sensitivity of 95–100% and a negative predictive value of 99–100%. Although many trauma patients initially undergo “pan-scans,” including chest CT, the timing of contrast administration may not be optimal for generating a formal chest CTA. However, as demonstrated in our reported patients, we recommend performing a full aortic angiography based on a comprehensive understanding of the patient’s injury mechanism. High-energy trauma and hemodynamically unstable patients may benefit from a full aortic CTA evaluation to exclude uncontrolled active bleeding as much as possible. While digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can provide comparable diagnostic efficacy to CTA for the thoracic and abdominal aorta, it is not the preferred method due to its invasiveness.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^7d37d5ed]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to patients with pelvic trauma, retroperitoneal packing, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to perform temporary extraperitoneal packing when bleeding is ongoing and/or when angioembolization cannot be achieved promptly. Consider combining extraperitoneal packing with open abdominal surgery when necessary.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^ea6b3e76]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) in suspected genitourinary trauma indicates that a positive FAST exam may indicate the presence of intraperitoneal bladder rupture. However, the FAST exam is neither sensitive nor specific in identifying GU trauma, and it is not suitable for the identification of fluid in the retroperitoneal space, which can be related to renal, ureteral, or extraperitoneal bladder injuries.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^3eef03ac]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal imaging in blunt abdominal trauma—Contrast-enhanced MDCT with multiplanar reformation is the best practice for screening the patient with blunt abdominal trauma. FAST has acceptable sensitivity (69–98 percent) for detection of free fluid and lower sensitivity (63 percent) for detection of solid organ injury in adults. A negative FAST does not rule out intraabdominal injury. An existing indication for laparotomy is the only absolute contraindication for radiographic assessment of the abdomen. Criteria for predicting children at very low risk for intraabdominal injury exist to determine the necessity of abdominal CT.

### Management guidelines for penetrating abdominal trauma [^63945c93]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal management of patients with penetrating abdominal injuries has been debated for decades, since mandatory laparotomy (LAP) gave way to the concept of "selective conservatism."

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed and summarized.

Results

A proposed management guideline for patients with penetrating abdominal trauma was created.

Conclusion

Indications for immediate laparotomy (LAP) include hemodynamic instability, evisceration, peritonitis, or impalement. Selective nonoperative management of stable, asymptomatic patients has been demonstrated to be safe. Adjunctive diagnostic testing-ultrasonography, computed tomography, local wound exploration, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy-is often used in an attempt to identify significant injuries requiring operative management. However, prospective studies indicate that these tests frequently lead to nontherapeutic LAP, and are not cost-effective.

### Should endovascular approach be the first line of treatment for retroperitoneal bleeding with hemodynamic shock following percutaneous intervention? A case series [^34b62c76]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report a series of consecutive patients that developed retroperitoneal hemorrhage (RPH) and persistent hypotension treated with endovascular approach.

Background

RPH is a rare complication of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions associated with high morbidity and mortality. The standard approach to treat this complication has been a conservative management for stable patients, and urgent vascular surgery for those with persistent hypovolemic shock. Percutaneous endovascular treatment has evolved as an alternative treatment option.

Methods

We implemented a management algorithm for patients with suspected RPH and persistent hypotension which embraced systematic use of emergency endovascular evaluation and treatment following clinical assessment without the use of non-invasive diagnostic testing. We report a series of 8 consecutive patients that developed RPH with persistent hypotension.

Results

Successful percutaneous treatment was achieved in all cases with the use of a covered stent. No patient required vascular surgery. The average blood transfusion was 3.4±2.7 units per patient. There were no deaths; one patient experienced acute stent thrombosis that was successfully treated via endovascular approach. At 1-year follow-up, no further events were reported.

Conclusion

The incorporation of a standardized protocol using only clinical evaluation followed by emergency percutaneous approach without delays attributed to non-invasive diagnostic work-up showed to be feasible and associated with favorable outcomes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

GRADE system to evaluate the level of evidence and recommendation

The discussion of the present guidelines has been realized through the Delphi process. A group of experts in the field coordinated by a central coordinator was contacted separately to express their evidence-based opinion on the different questions about the hemodynamically and mechanically unstable pelvic trauma management. Pelvic trauma patterns were differentiated into hemodynamically and mechanically stable and unstable ones. Conservative and operative management for all combinations of these conditions were evaluated. The central coordinator assembled the different answers derived from the first round and drafted the first version that was subsequently revised by each member of an enlarged expert group separately. The central coordinator addressed the definitive amendments, corrections and concerns. The definitive version about which the agreement was reached consisted in the published guidelines.

Mechanisms of injuries

Principal mechanisms of injuries that cause a pelvic ring fracture are due to a high energy impact as fall from height, sports, road traffic collision (pedestrian, motorcyclist, motor vehicle, cyclist), person stuck by vehicles. Ten to fifteen percent of patients with pelvic fractures arrive to the ED in shock and one third of them will die reaching a mortality rate in the more recent reports of 32%. The causes of dying are represented in the major part by uncontrolled bleeding and by patient’s physiologic exhaustion.

### Selective computed tomography and angioembolization provide benefits in the management of patients with concomitant unstable hemodynamics and negative sonography results [^adb03001]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The FAST (focused assessment of sonography for trauma) examination can rapidly identify free fluid in the abdominal or thoracic cavity, which is indicative of hemorrhage requiring emergency surgery in multiple-trauma patients. In patients with negative FAST examination results, it is difficult to identify the site of the hemorrhage and to plan treatment accordingly. We attempted to delineate the role of selective computed tomography (CT) and transarterial angioembolization (TAE) in the management of such unstable patients.

Methods

From January 2005 to April 2011 patients with concomitant unstable hemodynamics and negative FAST examination results were identified. Their demographic and time to start of embolization were recorded. The initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) in emergency department patients was compared with the SBP after TAE.

Results

A total of 33 patients were enrolled, and 85% required TAE. SBP improved significantly after TAE. There were 18 patients who received TAE without CT scan because the site of hemorrhage was obvious. Fifteen patients received a CT scan during the time required for angiography preparation. Ten of them received subsequent TAE based on the CT scan findings, and the treatment plan was changed in the other five patients. There was no significant difference between patients with or without a CT scan with respect to the time interval between arrival and starting embolization.

Conclusions

Transarterial angioembolization is suggested in the management of patients with concomitant unstable hemodynamics and negative FAST examination results. During the time interval required for angiography preparation, a CT scan can be performed. This approach provides valuable information for further decision making without delaying definitive treatment.
