## Question

Treatment for calcifilaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of calciphylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and wound care. Then, I should verify mineral metabolism management and what to stop. Next, I will examine evidence for disease-modifying therapies like sodium thiosulfate, hexasodium fytate, cinacalcet, and bisphosphonates. After that, I need to consider hypercoagulability and anticoagulation. I will then address pain control in ESRD, review adjunctive modalities such as hyperbaric oxygen, debridement strategy, and novel agents, and finally assess special populations and summarize the approach with an eye toward evolving evidence and trial opportunities.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: establish a multidisciplinary team and initiate wound care with infection control because calciphylaxis carries high sepsis-related mortality and wounds are typically exquisitely painful and prone to progression. Daily photographs and specialist wound care are advisable while ensuring timely empiric antibiotics for suspected infection, then de-escalate to targeted therapy as cultures return [^116wgX8P] [^113KRxs4] [^116zyXCp].

> I need to check mineral metabolism next and promptly reverse contributors: stop calcium-based phosphate binders, active vitamin D analogs, and any warfarin, since vitamin K antagonism suppresses matrix Gla carboxylation and is associated with calciphylaxis. If anticoagulation is necessary, switch to heparin or a DOAC per FDA labeling guidance to remove the vitamin K–dependent calcification driver, while tightly controlling calcium and phosphate using non–calcium binders, calcimimetics as appropriate, and dietary restriction [^115UiUoV] [^111DZx4b] [^111g4CfW] [^116zyXCp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sodium thiosulfate being standard of care; I should verify the highest-quality evidence. A 2023 JAMA Network Open meta-analysis across 19 retrospective cohorts found no significant benefit of intravenous sodium thiosulfate for skin lesion improvement or survival, and several attempted randomized trials were terminated early, so STS remains off-label with uncertain benefit despite plausible chelation and antioxidant mechanisms and historical enthusiasm in case series [^114nixFq] [^115fbtkZ] [^114VkZfU] [^112XQqdD]. But wait, what if we're missing a responder subgroup? Given persistent clinical signals in some cohorts, I would still consider IV STS, typically 25 g infused over 1 hour after hemodialysis three times weekly, for 2–4 weeks, reassessing pain and lesion evolution for a signal of response within days to a couple of weeks before deciding continuation, and using antiemetics proactively for nausea [^115qL1TW] [^115d9Dee] [^111WMGiv].

> Let me consider hexasodium fytate, an inositol hexaphosphate salt designed to inhibit hydroxyapatite crystallization. In the CALCIPHYX phase 3 trial, hexasodium fytate did not meet its alternate primary endpoints of wound score or pain, yet showed numerically fewer deaths, fewer calciphylaxis-related hospitalizations, and more days alive and out of hospital, suggesting potential clinically meaningful effects on hard outcomes; thus, if available in trial or expanded access settings, it is reasonable to consider in hemodialysis patients, ideally alongside best-practice wound care and mineral control [^112miRs9] [^113v1guf] [^1125oNye] [^112ZKPyV].

> Next, I should review calcimimetics, particularly cinacalcet. While not a treatment for established calciphylaxis, post hoc analyses from EVOLVE suggest a substantial reduction in calciphylaxis incidence with cinacalcet in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and cinacalcet remains appropriate to control PTH-driven mineral dysregulation that likely worsens vascular calcification. If used, I will monitor for hypocalcemia and adjust calcium/phosphate binders accordingly [^1149zS2L] [^116zyXCp].

> I will now examine bisphosphonates, especially for adynamic bone disease where they can paradoxically worsen vascular calcification, so I should confirm bone turnover before use. When high turnover is present, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate such as pamidronate or zoledronic acid may reduce bone resorption and possibly extraosseous calcification, whereas in low-turnover states I should avoid them and consider anabolic strategies instead [^111WMGiv] [^115ywyx7] [^113et4qg].

> But wait, what about thrombophilia and anticoagulation? Calciphylaxis shows microvascular thrombosis, so in selected patients with hypercoagulability or progressive ischemia, therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH can be considered after balancing bleeding risk, with small case series suggesting possible benefit. If warfarin was a trigger, I should stop it and substitute a heparinoid or DOAC as clinically indicated, guided by hematology input [^115d9Dee] [^1157UZTX] [^111g4CfW].

> Pain management is pivotal, so let me verify renal dosing constraints and a practical multimodal plan. I should avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol, and codeine due to neurotoxic metabolites in ESRD, and instead favor fentanyl or buprenorphine, titrating cautiously and using transdermal or continuous subcutaneous infusion; for neuropathic pain, gabapentin after dialysis or low-dose pregabalin can be added with dialysis-day adjustments; for inflammatory pain flares, short-course NSAIDs may be considered in coordination with nephrology if residual renal function is not critical, with PPI gastroprotection; methadone can be a specialist option for refractory pain, and early palliative care involvement helps with breakthrough algorithms and taper planning as wounds heal [^1133xnWv] [^117ECnZU] [^115Yppy5].

> I should double-check adjunctive therapies that might support wound healing. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has retrospective data associating increased sessions with improved survival and wound scores when added to sodium thiosulfate, and mechanistically may improve tissue oxygenation in ischemic ulcers; I would consider HBOT when available and feasible, typically 2.0–2.5 ATA for about 90 minutes, aiming for 20–30 sessions when tolerated [^114nc2H5] [^114PH5SF].

> For debridement, I need to ensure a conservative, selective approach given bleeding and progression risk. Chemical or biologic debridement with maggot therapy can reduce bioburden while preserving tissue, and case-based data suggest maggots debride effectively without provoking hemorrhage, whereas surgical debridement should be reserved for clearly necrotic, infected tissue with meticulous hemostasis and staged plans [^11778cdX] [^11482v5T].

> Let me review emerging and niche therapies with low-level evidence. Intralesional sodium thiosulfate can be considered for focal, painful lesions when IV STS is not tolerated or as adjuncts, with small series showing lesion resolution; tissue plasminogen activator has been used for refractory thrombotic vasculopathy with mixed results and bleeding risk; cryopreserved amniotic membrane has been reported to promote epithelialization and reduce pain in recalcitrant ulcers; vitamin K supplementation may be reasonable in patients previously on warfarin to support matrix Gla protein carboxylation, though evidence is limited and it should not replace stopping the vitamin K antagonist [^113L5Eqk] [^113vQXQS] [^1117ZXy2] [^113h3Hds] [^115ywyx7].

> I should confirm the approach in special populations. In nonuremic calciphylaxis, stop warfarin if present and consider STS, anticoagulation, and treatment of underlying triggers such as malignancy, liver disease, or autoimmune disease. In peritoneal dialysis, low-dose fractionated STS regimens have been described and may be better tolerated. For penile calciphylaxis, prompt urologic and plastic surgery involvement, debridement or reconstruction, and STS are key, with mortality remaining high. For patients with high-turnover bone disease, cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy can be decisive, whereas in low-turnover states, anabolic therapy and avoidance of calcitriol/calcium load may be preferred [^113Mqn9z] [^116uw6EL] [^113ApHZV] [^112yjLRN] [^111mvYdQ] [^115ywyx7].

> Hold on, I should verify prognosis and goals of care early. Contemporary cohorts suggest disease-specific 1-year mortality near 29%, better than historical 45–80%, but with high morbidity from pain, infections, and hospitalizations. Early advance care planning, palliative care consultation, and patient-reported outcome tracking are essential to align treatment intensity with patient goals and to mitigate suffering [^113axKw5] [^117Ezd5o] [^116x75pS].

> Finally, let me synthesize the practical algorithm and make sure nothing critical is missing. Immediately initiate meticulous wound care with infection control, remove calcium/vitamin K antagonists, and normalize mineral metabolism. Consider IV sodium thiosulfate for a limited trial while acknowledging the neutral meta-analytic data, or enroll in trials of hexasodium fytate. Layer calcimimetic therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism, reserve bisphosphonates for high-turnover states, add therapeutic anticoagulation selectively, and employ aggressive, ESRD-appropriate multimodal analgesia with early palliative involvement. Use HBOT and debridement strategies judiciously, and reassess frequently for clinical response, typically within 1–2 weeks, adjusting the plan accordingly. Throughout, coordinate nephrology, dermatology, wound care, pain/palliative care, and surgery, and discuss clinical trial participation when possible to advance evidence and potentially access novel therapies [^116wgX8P] [^113KRxs4] [^115d9Dee] [^114nixFq] [^112miRs9] [^1133xnWv] [^114nc2H5].

---

Calciphylaxis management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^116wgX8P] with aggressive wound care, infection control, and pain management [^116Dxjm1] [^116yQA7E], alongside correction of calcium–phosphate–PTH abnormalities [^111WMGiv] and removal of triggers such as warfarin [^115UiUoV] and calcium-based binders [^1122vu4s]. Sodium thiosulfate is the **most commonly used medical therapy** [^115Dpc6u], but high-quality evidence is limited and recent meta-analyses show no clear benefit in survival or wound healing [^114nixFq] [^1132WV18]; it remains off-label and should be individualized [^114nixFq]. Cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy are options for secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111WMGiv], while bisphosphonates, hyperbaric oxygen, and anticoagulation are adjuncts with variable evidence [^115d9Dee] [^114nc2H5] [^111WMGiv]. Early diagnosis, risk-factor modification, and coordinated care are essential to reduce high mortality and morbidity [^113axKw5] [^114kVcVF].

---

## General principles of management

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve nephrology, dermatology, wound care, pain management, nutrition, and palliative care [^116wgX8P] [^112YgXSK].

- **Early diagnosis and intervention**: Prompt recognition and treatment improve outcomes [^114kVcVF] [^115vHMuj].

- **Risk factor modification**: Address modifiable risks such as hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and medication triggers [^111WMGiv] [^111g4CfW].

---

## Wound care and infection control

Wound care and infection control prioritize **aggressive wound management** with regular debridement, moist dressings, and infection surveillance [^113KRxs4] [^112Ft1TE]. Antibiotic therapy is guided by culture results to treat confirmed or suspected infections, with particular vigilance for sepsis [^113Fm9u8].

---

## Pain management

Pain management should employ a **multimodal analgesia** approach, incorporating opioids, gabapentinoids, and adjuvants tailored to renal function and pain severity [^1133xnWv] [^117ECnZU]. Early palliative care involvement is recommended to address severe pain and quality-of-life needs [^117Ezd5o] [^117ECnZU].

---

## Correction of calcium-phosphate-PTH abnormalities

- **Phosphate control**: Use non-calcium-based binders (sevelamer, lanthanum) and dietary phosphate restriction [^1112hopA].

- **Calcium control**: Avoid calcium-based binders and vitamin D analogs; use low-calcium dialysate in dialysis patients [^1122vu4s] [^1112hopA].

- **Parathyroid hormone control**: Cinacalcet is first-line; parathyroidectomy for refractory hyperparathyroidism [^1139K7DP] [^111mvYdQ].

## Medical therapies

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sodium thiosulfate | Calcium chelation; antioxidant | Moderate; mixed RCT/meta-analytic data | - Off-label <br/> - Commonly used <br/> - Monitor for metabolic acidosis [^115xzJu6] |
| Cinacalcet | Calcimimetic; lowers PTH | Moderate | Useful in secondary hyperparathyroidism [^1149zS2L] |
| Bisphosphonates | Inhibit bone resorption; reduce calcium release | Low | Consider in high-turnover bone disease [^111WMGiv] [^113et4qg] |
| Hyperbaric oxygen therapy | Improved tissue oxygenation; wound healing | Low | Adjunctive; variable availability [^114nc2H5] [^114PH5SF] |
| Anticoagulation | Address thrombophilia; microthrombi | Low | - Controversial <br/> - Use selectively [^1157UZTX] [^115d9Dee] |

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

- **Hexasodium fytate (SNF472)**: In phase 3 trials; targets vascular calcification [^112miRs9] [^1149zS2L].

- **Intralesional sodium thiosulfate**: Case reports suggest benefit for localized lesions [^113L5Eqk] [^113vQXQS].

- **Maggot therapy**: Biodebridement alternative to surgical debridement [^11778cdX] [^11482v5T].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Mortality remains high at **45–80% at 1 year**, though recent data suggest improvement with modern care [^113axKw5] [^113Fm9u8]. Morbidity is substantial, with **chronic pain, nonhealing wounds, and recurrent hospitalizations** [^116x75pS]. Early, aggressive, multidisciplinary care **improves outcomes** [^114kVcVF] [^115vHMuj].

---

Calciphylaxis treatment is **multidisciplinary**, emphasizing wound care, infection control, pain management, and correction of mineral metabolism, with sodium thiosulfate as the most common off-label therapy despite limited evidence [^116wgX8P] [^114nixFq].

### Calciphylaxis [^116Dxjm1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a condition with a generally poor prognosis about which relatively little is known. Possible improvement in prognosis is noted if the diagnosis can be made early to avoid progression of soft tissue lesions and resulting complications. The mainstays of therapy are wound care and therapy aimed at controlling infection and the progression of disease. Parathyroidectomy seems to benefit some patients, but controversy remains as to the extent of overall patient benefit and scenarios for its appropriate use.

### A retrospective review of outcomes after hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of calciphylaxis [^114nc2H5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a thrombotic vasculopathy characterized by painful necrotic ulcerations. There are no Food and Drug Administration approved therapies despite high mortality.

Objective

To compare mortality and wound healing outcomes in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in addition to intravenous sodium thiosulfate (IV STS) versus patients who received IV STS only. Findings were stratified by dialysis status and modality.

Methods

93 patients were included, with 57 patients in the control group (IV STS) and 36 patients in the treatment group (HBOT + IV STS). Mortality data were analyzed with traditional survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard models. Longitudinal wound outcomes were analyzed with mixed effects modeling.

Results

Univariate survival analyses showed that full HBOT treatment was associated with significantly (P = 0.016) longer survival time. Increasing number of HBOT sessions was associated with improved mortality outcomes, with 1, 5, 10 and 20 sessions yielding decreasing hazard ratios. There was also a significant (P = 0.042) positive association between increasing number of HBOT sessions and increased wound score.

Limitations

Data collection was retrospective.

Conclusion

HBOT may have a role in the treatment of calciphylaxis with benefits demonstrated in both mortality and wound healing. Larger prospective studies are needed to identify which patients would most benefit from this intervention.

### Treatment of cutaneous calciphylaxis with sodium thiosulfate: two case reports and a review of the literature [^116wmJvM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Cutaneous calciphylaxis is a potentially fatal condition characterized by calcium deposition in dermal arterioles and the subsequent development of livedo reticularis, plaques, and extremely painful ulcers. This condition may be present in up to 4% of end-stage renal disease patients. Several treatments, which mainly attempt to control calcium phosphate metabolism, are available for this condition. We describe two patients treated with sodium thiosulfate with good results. Moreover, we also performed a PubMed literature search of sodium thiosulfate treatment for calciphylaxis. We found 41 cases of which most (> 90%) presented a rapid and sustained resolution, indicating this drug is a very good candidate for the treatment of this condition.

### Calciphylaxis in secondary hyperparathyroidism… [^1139K7DP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Calciphylaxis is a rare, severe complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Patients present with painful, violaceous, mottled skin lesions of the upper and lower extremities, which become necrotic and produce nonhealing ulcers. Gangrene of fingers and toes frequently requires amputation, produces nonhealing wounds, and can lead to sepsis and death. We reviewed the clinical course of five patients with calciphylaxis treated in our institution. The three men and two women had secondary hyperparathyroidism from chronic renal failure. All patients had severe pruritus, painful ulcers, and severe hyperphosphatemia with elevated serum calcium-phosphate product, but the serum parathyroid hormone levels were only moderately elevated. Most patients had medial calcification of medium and small blood vessels, and some had soft-tissue calcification visible on roentgenography.

Treatment consisted of local wound care, antibiotics, phosphate-binding agents, and parathyroidectomy. Two patients died of uncontrollable sepsis. The three survivors had dramatic improvement of pain and ulcers after parathyroidectomy. Calciphylaxis is a limb- and lifethreatening complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis can be made by recognizing the characteristic painful skin lesions, ulcers, and gangrene of the digits, and patients should be treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy.

### Outcomes and mortality in calciphylaxis: a multicenter update [^113axKw5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current understanding of calciphylaxis pathogenesis and treatment has advanced, with lower mortality.

Objective

To provide an updated report of calciphylaxis risk factors and outcomes in a large and diverse multicenter American validated cohort.

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective observational study across six major academic institutions. Adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of calciphylaxis 1/1/2006–12/31/2022 were included.

Results

A total of 268 patients were included. Nephrogenic cases comprised 84.62% (209) of patients, while non-nephrogenic cases comprised 15.38% (38) of patients. Seventy-five patients (27.98%) died of calciphylaxis-related causes. One-year and two-year disease-specific mortality was 28.88% and 29.92%, respectively. Penile lesions (penile vs distal: HR 11.90, 95% CI 2.44–44.85, p = 0.04), history of atrial fibrillation (HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.36–4.35, p < 0.01), and dialysis at diagnosis (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.10–3.95, p = 0.03) were associated with higher mortality while distal lesions were associated with lower mortality (distal vs proximal: HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18–0.62, p = 0.04).

Limitations

Limitations of this study included its retrospective nature, limited representation of non-White or Black ethnicities, and outsized representation of one academic center.

Conclusion

While differences in survival emerged between institutions, the overall one-year disease-specific mortality of 28.88% is lower from historic (45–80%), suggesting better patient outcomes with time.

### Successful treatment of calciphylaxis by a multidisciplinary approach [^1112hopA]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old woman performing peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease presented with a painful leg ulcer. The investigation revealed an elevated parathyroid hormone level and the histological examination of the biopsy tissue from the ulcer revealed medial calcification of the arterioles, consistent with calciphylaxis. The patient developed additional ulcers in the lower limbs and treatment with antibiotics, cinacalcet, sevelamer, sodium thiosulfate, low calcium dialysate and hyperbaric oxygen therapy was instituted. The patient had a favourable outcome and after 9 months the ulcers had healed and the parathyroid hormone level reached the normal range. Calciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening disorder associated with a mortality of 60–80%. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood hence there is no consensus in the treatment of this pathology.

### Maggot therapy for calciphylaxis wound debridement complicated by bleeding [^11482v5T]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calciphylaxis is a rare disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Reported 1-year mortality is up to 80%, with sepsis as the leading cause of death. Although most cases occur in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, nonuremic cases also occur. Maggot therapy for wound debridement in calciphylaxis has been reported, but the literature is limited.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^112ZKPyV]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety outcomes

Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in each part of the study are summarised in Table 2. Treatment emergent adverse events led to treatment discontinuation for fewer patients in the hexasodium fytate group (2/38 [5%]) than the placebo group (6/33 [18%]). The proportion of patients during the double-blind period with calciphylaxis-related infections (1/38 [3%] versus 7/33 [21%]), calciphylaxis-related events leading to hospitalisation (2/38 [5%] versus 11/33 [33%]) and death (1/38 [3%] versus 5/33 [15%]) were lower in patients randomised to hexasodium fytate versus placebo (Fig. 3, panels A–D). During the 12-week open-label and 4-week follow-up periods, there were no further calciphylaxis-related events leading to hospitalisation.

### Long-term intravenous sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of a patient with calciphylaxis [^115xzJu6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a disabling and life-threatening complication that primarily affects patients who are dialysis dependent. This disease entity is characterized by calcification, intimal hypertrophy, and thrombosis of small vessels, which results in necrotizing, nonhealing ulcers. The development of these lesions portends a grim prognosis, as they are often accompanied by severe and sometimes fatal infectious complications. Although several strategies aimed at treating and preventing this affliction have been reported in the literature, the outcome for most patients with calciphylaxis remains quite poor. We describe an anuric hemodialysis patient who developed severe calciphylaxis that proved refractory to conventional treatment. Following extensive debridement of several wounds, intravenous sodium thiosulfate was utilized as an adjunctive therapy four times a week. Within 6 months, excellent wound healing ensued as well as a dramatic improvement in the lesions that were not previously resected. Aside from occasional nausea, these treatments were well tolerated, despite the development of an anion gap metabolic acidosis. After 34 months of continued treatment the patient remains free from disease recurrence and has demonstrated no untoward effect of prolonged therapy. In an effort to delineate the pharmacokinetics of this drug in a hemodialysis patient, serum thiosulfate levels were obtained 15 minutes after infusion as well as before and after subsequent dialysis treatments. Consistent with prior studies in anuric canines, we found measurable quantities of the drug more than 50 hours after treatment, in addition to a markedly elevated half life of 478 minutes. However, given the lack of significant toxicity, as well as a dramatic clinical improvement, we feel that sodium thiosulfate may have an important adjunctive role in the treatment of calciphylaxis in dialysis patients.

### A case of nonuremic calciphylaxis of the penis responding to sodium thiosulfate therapy [^116uBNQG]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of penile calciphylaxis cases have overwhelmingly been reported in the setting of end-stage renal disease. This case highlights the importance of keeping calciphylaxis on differential diagnosis even in the absence of severe renal compromise and other common presenting features. Additionally, documentation of the patient's presentation and favorable clinical course reinforces both the diagnostic utility of radiographic imaging in the absence of positive histopathologic findings and the use of STS as a therapeutic approach for NUC. More research and clinical trials are required to determine optimal imaging protocols in diagnostic work-up.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115S6nm1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Intravenous STS was not associated with skin lesion improvement or survival benefits in patients with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis in this meta-analysis. A future large and well-designed randomized clinical trial is warranted to establish the effect of STS on calciphylaxis. In addition, we also call for large prospective studies to investigate the patient characteristics that may be associated with improvement upon treatment with STS. Identification of such factors will allow judicious application of STS to patients with calciphylaxis and will guide the patient selection criteria of future clinical trials.

### Sodium thiosulfate as first-line treatment for calciphylaxis… [^114GjvkT]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The case report by Robinson et al1 concerning a woman with a renal transplant whose calciphylaxis was successfully treated with cinacalcet hydrochloride is interesting but must be interpreted with caution. We present herein our experience with a 45-year-old woman who underwent renal transplantation 10 years ago for treatment of nephropathy of undetermined origin. The patient's renal function deteriorated because of chronic allograft nephropathy and uncontrolled diabetes. On her left leg, she developed ulcerations surrounded by livedoid borders that rapidly became painful and resistant to local wound care. Despite treatment with analgesics and antibiotics, her condition worsened, and she developed septic shock requiring amputation of her left leg. A week later, ulcerations appeared on the right leg. Serum phosphate and calcium levels were high.

A diagnosis of calciphylaxis was suspected, and treatment was begun with 30 mg/d of cinacalcet hydrochloride, a calcimimetic medication, along with intestinal calcium-free phosphate binders and hemodialysis with normocalcic dialysate 3 times per week.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^115Yppy5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Paracetamol was the preferred first-choice adjuvant agent for management of all types of pain, more so by renal physicians (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Five out of 75 respondents (6.6%) undertook other procedures such as epidural analgesia and nerve blocks to manage pain. Most of the respondents (83%) felt the presence of infection impacted on the effectiveness of analgesia.

The perceived types of pain experienced by patients with calciphylaxis are illustrated in Fig. 4. The majority of respondents (72%), irrespective of speciality undertook advance care planning discussions often or most of the time. 28% of respondents used a pain scale, the most commonly used tool was the pain analogue scale (0–10) used by nine of the 20 respondents who used a tool (seven renal and two palliative care physicians).

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Lc5y8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials in this field, we gathered data only from cohort studies to do the analysis. Bias could arise from multiple sources, which was tested by the ROBINS-I tool. Of note, except for 2 studies (An et aland Omer et al) that contributed the most weight to the analyses, the remaining studies were small and many had zero events of interest. Preexisting conditions could be unbalanced, as shown in Table 1. Important confounders, such as age, sex, and therapies like hyperbaric oxygen therapy were not balanced between the 2 groups. Moreover, information regarding potential additional therapies administered to patients was not consistently available, making reliable comparisons between STS and other therapies impossible. Our analysis might be underpowered and could yield residual confounding. Furthermore, lesion improvement may not be assessed uniformly throughout the studies. Another important outcome, pain intensity improvement, was not analyzed because it has not been consistently reported.

### Calciphylaxis epidemiology, risk factors, treatment and survival among French chronic kidney disease patients: a case-control study [^113Fm9u8]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also called calciphylaxis, is a rare but devastating disease involving patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). CUA causes painful skin lesions that evolve to ulcerative lesions at risk of superinfection and sepsis, with a poor prognosis. One year survival rates vary between 45 to 55%. CUA management lacks strong recommendations and therefore is heterogeneous. Reported risk factors of CUA are female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and ESRD. Dysregulation of calcium-phosphate metabolism also participates to its development. Histopathological findings of skin lesions mostly associate thromboses and vessel calcifications. We decided to conduct the first study on CUA in the French population. Our main objective was to describe diagnosis management, treatment and outcome of CUA in ESRD and stage 4–5 CKD patients. Secondary objectives were to analyze risk factors of developing calciphylaxis and influencing patient survival in the dialyzed cohort.

### A case report of severe calciphylaxis-suggested approach for diagnosis and treatment [^115ywyx7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a life-threatening complication in patients with kidney disease. It is also called "calcific uremic arteriolopathy", reflecting the main findings of medial calcification and intimal hyperplasia in skin biopsies of calciphylaxis patients. The lesions are usually very painful and ulcerations and necrosis can develop. Besides the involvement of skin, visceral and muscle arteries can be affected. Complications, particularly septic episodes are common and explain the high mortality rate of about 45–80%. The diagnosis is based on the clinical features in combination with known risk factors, i.e. renal insufficiency, obesity, female gender, hyperparathyroidism and disturbed bone metabolism, therapy with vitamin K antagonists, inflammatory states, and diabetes mellitus. A skin biopsy can prove presence of calciphylaxis; however, it is usually dispensable and even can set a new nidus for calciphylaxis. Imaging studies can strengthen the diagnosis of calciphylaxis and help to assess the extent of muscular and inner organ involvement. The pathophysiology of calciphylaxis is largely unknown. A disturbed calcium-phosphate homeostasis in association with an altered bone metabolism (either high or low turnover) is probably one of the important factors.

Current treatment recommendations rely on weak evidence and therapy failures are common. Supportive wound management, antibiotic therapy, and analgesics are certainly an important part of the therapy. Cessation of calcium supplements and medication that increases serum calcium levels such as thiazide diuretics and active vitamin D compounds is generally recommended. Avoiding vitamin K antagonists or even supplementation of vitamin K has been suggested based on the role of vitamin K in the γ-carboxylation of proteins that regulate local calcium crystal deposition. The broad array of suggested treatment options is probably a reflection of the uncertain efficacy: sodium thiosulfate, bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, emergency parathyroidectomy, plasma exchange and optimization of the dialysis treatment. Moreover, some of these therapies are powerful effectors of the bone metabolism, particularly bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, and parathyroidectomy which can drastically reduce bone turnover. For thiosulfate, no direct effects on bone turnover have been reported so far. With our case, we want to highlight an important, but so far less considered aspect for an individual treatment strategy: the assessment of the underlying bone metabolism by a bone biopsy to adjust the treatment strategy accordingly.

Outcomes

The study investigator made the clinical diagnosis of calciphylaxis at screening, and at least one calciphylaxis lesion with full thickness ulceration was required for inclusion. A central wound rating group reviewed wound images (photos and videos) collected by sites to confirm that lesions were ulcerated and due to calciphylaxis and to evaluate wound appearance over time.

The central wound rating group assessed wounds quantitatively with the 13-item Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) and qualitatively (improved, worsened, or stayed the same). Because the BWAT was originally developed to assess pressure ulcers and there are no validated assessment tools for calciphylaxis-related wounds, we also used an 8-item modification (BWAT-CUA) adapted specifically for this study to attempt to assess prototypical features of calciphylaxis.

Patients self-reported wound-related pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients also completed a 17-item Wound–QoL (Quality-of-Life) questionnaire at study visits to rate impairments during the previous 7 days and a daily pain medication diary.

The study had two alternate primary efficacy outcomes, each considered of equal clinical relevance: BWAT-CUA score for the primary lesion and Pain VAS score. The four secondary efficacy outcomes, evaluated hierarchically, were as follows: Wound-QoL score; total BWAT score for the primary lesion; qualitative wound image evaluation for the primary lesion; and opioid use. Safety outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and calciphylaxis wound-related adverse events (when reporting adverse events, investigators indicated whether they thought an event was calciphylaxis wound-related).

### Evolution of treatment strategies for calciphylaxis [^111WMGiv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment strategies for calciphylaxis are limited by inadequate understanding of its pathophysiology. Mortality reaches 80%, due to progressive skin ischemia, necrosis and infections. In addition to calcium and parathyroid disorders, hypercoagulability can have a role: primary thrombotic disorders as well as secondary, such as proposed warfarin procoagulant effects. Traditional care addresses the calcium-phosphate-PTH axis: minimizing calcium intake, calcimimetics, cautious vitamin D analogs, strict phosphate control, and surgical parathyroidectomy if necessary. Newer approaches focus on extraosseous mineralization: dissolution of calcium deposits, altering osteoprotegerin and NF-κB pathways, and treating macrophage or cytokine-mediated inflammation. Sodium thiosulfate has reported success, and is thought to be due to enhanced calcium solubility and dialysis clearance. Bisphosphonates may have efficacy by lowering bone turnover or a variety of vascular tissue mechanisms. The literature for both agents is very limited, and optimal dosing regimens remain unclear. Patients responsive to a medication will have decreasing pain in days and lesions beginning to heal within approximately 2 weeks. Due to high mortality, early use of combination therapy is advocated, although specific protocols have not been well established. The often dramatic improvements in case-based literature are very encouraging and will hopefully lead to more rigorous studies.

Calcinosis Cutis/Calciphylaxis

Owing to the potential for ulcerations to develop and expand rapidly, as well as an extremely poor 1‐year mortality rate [60], drug discontinuation should be recommended for patients with calcinosis cutis. Treatment with oral or topical calcium channel blockers, intravenous immunoglobulin, and compounded or intralesional sodium thiosulfate may be initiated. For calciphylaxis, treatments generally include three‐times‐a‐week dosing at 3‐ to 4‐week intervals with intravenous sodium thiosulfate or intralesional sodium thiosulfate diluted 1:1 with 1% lidocaine to minimize the pain [60, 61, 62]. Patients should be screened for additional hypercoagulation disorders [63]. In addition, monitoring calcium and phosphate levels with phosphate binders, consideration for anticoagulation, and use of bisphosphonates may be considered. Dermatologic or endocrine consultations are warranted upon occurrence of grade 3 events and for patients who do not respond to therapy.

### Calciphylaxis: emerging concepts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^114mDSGg]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a small vessel vasculopathy involving mural calcification with intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and thrombosis. This syndrome occurs predominantly in individuals with renal failure and results in ischemia and necrosis of skin, subcutaneous fat, visceral organs, and skeletal muscle. The syndrome causes significant morbidity in the form of infection, organ failure, and pain. Mortality rates are high. In individuals with renal failure, risk factors for the development of calciphylaxis include female sex, Caucasian race, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Many cases occur within the first year of dialysis treatment. Several recent reports demonstrate that prolonged hyperphosphatemia and/or elevated calcium x phosphorus products are associated with the syndrome. Protein malnutrition increases the likelihood of calciphylaxis, as does warfarin use and hypercoagulable states, such as protein C and/or protein S deficiency. Recent advances in diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies have helped in the management of patients with calciphylaxis.

### Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of calciphylaxis: a case series [^114PH5SF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis, also referred to as calcific uraemic arteriolopathy, is a syndrome associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and causes necrotic skin ulcers, often leading to a fatal outcome. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO(2)) therapy has been used to enhance wound healing, but its role in the treatment of calciphylaxis is unclear.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective study of patients on renal replacement therapy with biopsy-proven calciphylaxis who were treated with HBO(2) between March 1997 and February 2000.

Results

Five patients were treated with HBO(2): three patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and two were on chronic haemodialysis therapy. None of the patients had uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism and none underwent parathyroidectomy. The patients each received 25–35 treatments of HBO(2) at 2.5 atmospheres for 90 min per treatment. Two of these patients had complete resolution of extensive necrotic skin ulcers, with no adverse effects of HBO(2) therapy. Both had improvement in wound area transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P(tc)O(2)) with administration of 100% oxygen when measurements were taken at normobaric and hyperbaric pressures. In the other three patients receiving HBO(2), the skin lesions did not resolve. P(tc)O(2) was measured in two of these patients, neither of whom showed improvement with 100% oxygen administered at normobaric pressure.

Conclusions

The data support a role for HBO(2) in the treatment of some patients with calciphylaxis, particularly as in the absence of uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism there are few therapeutic options.

### Complete resolution of calciphylaxis after kidney transplantation [^111tp8AP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis, a life-threatening and disabling complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, occurs most frequently in those treated with maintenance dialysis, whether it be hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The impact of kidney transplantation on calciphylaxis lesions is not clear. The general consensus is to treat calciphylaxis adequately prior to transplantation with either medical therapy or parathyroidectomy, as indicated. We describe the case of a patient on peritoneal dialysis therapy who had severe calciphylaxis lesions that failed to resolve upon pretransplantation medical treatment and that then resolved after kidney transplantation.

### Nonuremic calciphylaxis manifesting with diffuse dermal angiomatosis [^113coow7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limited reliable tools to aid in the diagnosis of NUC. We recommend maintaining a high degree of clinical suspicion for NUC in patients with appropriate clinical features. Biopsy sensitivities range from 20% to 86%, influenced by factors such as biopsy location and technique. Often, biopsies are nondiagnostic due to inadequate sampling or nonspecific histologic features. Although incisional biopsies are recommended, these may not be appropriate when considering patient comfort, infection risk, and wound healing. Plain films, computed tomography, and ultrasound can be useful diagnostic modalities, along with contrast-based vascular imaging to detect calcification. Given our patient's acute renal injury, contrast-based imaging was not pursued.

This case suggests that empiric calciphylaxis treatment can be initiated in the correct clinical context. Treatments for calciphylaxis are limited. The efficacy of STS has been demonstrated widely, although no randomized controlled trials exist. The use of STS in NUC has also been demonstrated and is associated with a survival benefit. Our patient's improvement on STS builds on this prior evidence. STS is thought to act as a chelating agent, dissolving calcium deposits in the blood vessels. It is also proposed to have antioxidant properties, ultimately restoring nitric oxide production in endothelial cells to promote vasodilation. Another proposed mechanism includes hydrogen sulfide, an STS metabolite, exerting vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, and analgesic effects. Gastrointestinal side effects can preclude patients from receiving optimal doses, and supportive therapies, such as antiemetics, are often required.

NUC carries high morbidity and mortality risks yet remains difficult to diagnose. This case asserts that DDA may be considered a diagnostic clue in presentations suspicious for NUC and prompt the timely initiation of therapies.

### Nonuremic penile calciphylaxis treated with pentoxifylline [^113j4P3X]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Pentoxifylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, promotes vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vascular beds and inhibits leukocyte-derived free radicals, limiting ischemia-related tissue damage. Its use in peripheral vascular disease has been well documented, and few case reports describe successful treatment of calciphylaxis with pentoxifylline, resulting in complete remission of skin lesions. No reports exist documenting this as a treatment option for penile calciphylaxis; thus, this case adds to this body of literature for patients with penile involvement.

Prognosis and outcomes for patients with calciphylaxis remain poor. In patients without significant chronic kidney disease, 6-month survival is 72% with septicemia from infected wounds as the leading cause of death. Penile calciphylaxis has a mortality rate of 69% within 6 months. These statistics underscore the importance of wound care and prompt treatment of skin lesions to reduce mortality. Beyond survival, calciphylaxis causes significant morbidity, including severe pain, chronic wounds, and recurrent hospitalizations. Our patient experienced ongoing pain, despite improvement in skin lesions, and had recurrent hospitalizations before initiating pentoxifylline.

In conclusion, pentoxifylline may be a viable treatment option for penile nonuremic calciphylaxis, particularly in patients who have failed prior treatments or are unable to safely use intralesional or intravenous sodium thiosulfate. While this case highlights the potential efficacy of pentoxifylline, larger studies are needed to validate its effectiveness and establish its role in the treatment of calciphylaxis.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^115UiUoV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Calciphylaxis

Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.

### Lack of evidence does not justify neglect: how can we address unmet medical needs in calciphylaxis? [^115vFbYf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Calcific uraemic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is a rare disease predominantly occurring in comorbidity with dialysis. Due to the very low frequency of CUA, prospective studies on its management are lacking and even anecdotal reports on treatment remain scarce. Therefore, calciphylaxis is still a challenging disease with dismal prognosis urgently requiring adequate strategies for diagnosis and treatment. In an attempt to fill some of the current gaps in evidence on various, highly debated and controversial aspects of dialysis-associated calciphylaxis, 13 international experts joined the 1st Consensus Conference on CUA, held in Leuven, Belgium on 21 September 2015. The conference was supported by the European Calciphylaxis Network (EuCalNet), which is a task force of the ERA-EDTA scientific working group on Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorders (CKD-MBD). After an intense discussion, a 9-point Likert scale questionnaire regarding 20 items on calciphylaxis was anonymously answered by each participant. These 20 items addressed unsolved issues in terms of diagnosis and management of calciphylaxis. On the one hand, the analysis of the expert opinions identified areas of general consensus, which might be a valuable aid for physicians treating such a disease with less experience in the field. On the other hand, some topics such as the pertinence of skin biopsy and administration of certain treatments revealed divergent opinions. The aim of the present summary report is to provide some guidance for clinicians who face patients with calciphylaxis in the current setting of absence of evidence-based medicine.

### Calciphylaxis from nonuremic causes: a systematic review [^116uw6EL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a well-described entity in end-stage kidney disease and renal transplant patients; however, little systematic information is available on calciphylaxis from nonuremic causes. This systematic review was designed to characterize etiologies, clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, and prognosis of nonuremic calciphylaxis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A systematic review of literature for case reports and case series of nonuremic calciphylaxis was performed. Cases included met the operational definition of nonuremic calciphylaxis-histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis in the absence of end-stage kidney disease, renal transplantation, or acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy.

Results

We found 36 cases (75% women, 63% Caucasian, aged 15 to 82 yr) of nonuremic calciphylaxis. Primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, alcoholic liver disease, and connective tissue disease were the most common reported causes. Preceding corticosteroid use was reported for 61% patients. Protein C and S deficiencies were seen in 11% of patients. Skin lesions were morphologically similar to calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Mortality rate was 52%, with sepsis being the leading cause of death.

Conclusion

Calciphylaxis should be considered while evaluating skin lesions in patients with predisposing conditions even in the absence of end-stage kidney disease and renal transplantation. Nonuremic calciphylaxis is reported most often in white women. Mineral abnormalities that are invoked as potential causes in calcific uremic arteriolopathy are often absent, suggesting that heterogeneous mechanisms may contribute to its pathogenesis. Nonuremic calciphylaxis is associated with high mortality, and there is no known effective treatment.

### Subtotal parathyroidectomy: a possible treatment for calciphylaxis [^112jscye]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder in patients with chronic renal failure that is characterized by ischemic necrotic skin lesions. The prognosis is grave and mortality is high (80%). The precise mechanism of calciphylaxis is still unknown, but in addition to chronic renal failure, elevated parathyroid hormone levels appear to play a role. The role of parathyroidectomy in treating affected patients is questionable. In this article, we describe the case of a patient with chronic renal failure who developed rapidly progressive subcutaneous calcifications and ulcerations in the lower extremities. These lesions regressed following subtotal parathyroidectomy. We also review the literature on calciphylaxis, with a focus on treatment options.

### Sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of non-uremic calciphylaxis [^116myAcN]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a metastatic calcification-induced vasculopathy that results in the occlusion of small blood vessels. Although calciphylaxis is normally associated with end-stage renal disease, calciphylaxis from non-uremic origin occurs as well. While the number of reports continues to increase, a standard treatment for non-uremic calciphylaxis has yet to be established. Sodium thiosulfate (STS), which has been proven to be effective in the treatment of uremic calciphylaxis, shows promise; however, reports of its use in non-uremic cases are limited. We describe a case of non-uremic calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal and parathyroid function who had complete resolution of disease after treatment with STS, and we review similar cases in the published work. Based on the successful outcomes detailed in this case series, STS appears to be an effective therapy for non-uremic calciphylaxis.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^117ECnZU]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Clinical practice recommendations for the management of calciphylaxis associated pain

Pain caused by calciphylaxis is nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory in nature as it is a result of metastatic microcalcification and tissue necrosis. Choice of analgesia in patients with calciphylaxis is further complicated by ESRD and renal replacement therapy. The authors are not aware of any published guidance on pain management in this group. Therefore, the following guidance extrapolates from first principles and existing literature pertaining to the management of pain in patients with severe and end stage renal impairment but taking into account the unique challenge that calciphylaxis presents in terms of the severity of the pain as described by the physicians surveyed in this paper and the potential for opioid toxicity described by survey respondents as well as the expert opinion of the authors who are palliative medicine physicians (one working in renal palliative care) and renal physicians (one with an expertise in calciphylaxis).

The authors suggest the following pragmatic approach in this population.
Always refer to either the local palliative medicine team and / or pain team when calciphylaxis is suspected. This is because it is often a diagnosis of exclusion and pain control is difficult in this group and needs a specialist approach from the outset because of the additional morbidity associated with the use of inappropriate analgesia.
Tissue viability service/wound care specialist referral is essential and daily serial medical photography with consent is advised.
Ideally admit the patient to a renal unit or to a hospice for symptom control.
Where the patient has capacity, start advance care planning conversations. If the patient does not have capacity and that capacity cannot be enabled, start planning care using the principles of best interests. This is because of the high mortality associated with this condition. It is important to discuss the considerable risk of dying and poor prognosis with the patient and their family.
Consider enrolment in a clinical trial.

### A case report of severe calciphylaxis-suggested approach for diagnosis and treatment [^113et4qg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Similar to observations from Sugimto et al. iPTH levels dropped shortly after teriparatide administration. This probably reflects a negative feedback of endogenous PTH generation in response to teriparatide administration. Teriparatide (rhPTH 1–34) in turn, is not detected by the iPTH laboratory test. We can only speculate why an endogenous PTH level of greater than 300 pg/mL at admission was associated with adynamic bone metabolism and in turn, why application of teriparatide should be efficient in this situation. First, endogenous PTH can be oxidized in uremia which is associated with decreased biological activity. Further, administration of teriparatide leads to a considerable increase in 1–34 PTH levels up to 10fold above the upper normal physiologic PTH concentrations.

Our case demonstrates that identification of the underlying bone metabolism is of crucial importance for an appropriate and specific treatment of calciphylaxis. Laboratory results cannot sufficiently reflect the status of bone turnover which has been reported before. In our case, initial iPTH and BAP analyses were suggestive of normal or high turnover but the bone biopsy clearly showed adynamic bone disease. Therefore, we believe that in most cases with calciphylaxis a bone biopsy should be considered to avoid erroneous and potentially harmful treatments. For example, in our patient parathyroidectomy, treatment with bisphosphonates or cinacalcet would have aggravated adynamic bone disease and thus, probably impaired the calciphylaxis.

Our suggestion therefore is a gradual approach that should be evaluated in further studies (Fig. 4). Initially, general actions should include stopping of medication that can precipitate hypercalcemia, normalization of high serum calcium and phosphate levels, administration of sodium thiosulfate. Plasma exchange might be considered but procedural risks including infections should be balanced against potential benefits. As early as possible, a bone biopsy should be considered to determine the type of bone disorder. Ideally, assessment of bone metabolism includes tetracycline labelling. However, the labelling procedure delays early diagnosis and directed treatment and thus, should be decided individually. Once the bone disorder is characterized bone metabolism can be corrected – either by reducing or increasing bone turnover – to prevent further deterioration of calciphylaxis.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^112miRs9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The major limitation of CALCIPHYX was the small sample size related primarily to its application in a rare disease. Thinking that an event-driven trial would be infeasible, we employed two patient-centred alternate primary efficacy outcomes, neither of which had been prospectively validated in calciphylaxis. This trial was conducted in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Further studies are warranted in other susceptible patient groups including those receiving peritoneal dialysis and those with advanced, non-dialysis-requiring chronic kidney disease.

In sum, among patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis with calciphylaxis, a 12-week intervention with hexasodium fytate did not yield improvements in the alternate primary efficacy outcomes — a quantitative, unvalidated, assessment of the primary calciphylaxis lesion and a patient-reported visual analogue scale for pain — and did not achieve its prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes. However, results of the safety analysis showed numerically lower rates of death and calciphylaxis-related events in patients treated with hexasodium fytate, which were further supported by post-hoc, hypothesis-generating, intention-to-treat analyses of composite endpoints, including days alive and out of hospital.

Conclusion

This review has been an attempt to increase our basic understanding of VOC and its mechanisms in the patient with metS, T2DM, CKD, CHD, and the syndrome of CPLX. By improving our understanding of the mechanisms in play we may be better equipped to prevent many of the complications associated with VOC.

VOC is an exciting and complicated field of study and while our understanding of this process has undergone considerable improvement regarding its mechanisms and understanding during the past few years, there remain many questions to be solved and newer therapies proposed to help decrease the morbid – mortal complications of this actively regulated process.

The recent publications of case reports regarding the use of STS to treat the complications of VOC and the syndrome of CPLX may result in the necessary clinical trials and the important scientific animal experiments to fully evaluate and understand its effect. Additionally these early published clinical results should instigate the necessary studies to better understand the mechanisms of this emerging treatment for calciphylaxis and its possible role in treating VOC in patients with CHD, atherosclerosis and atheroscleropathy in metS, and T2DM. Additionally, this emerging treatment may have significant applications for diabetic patients with CKD, ESRD. and VOC.

Earlier diagnosis of the patient at risk for the development of VOC is important so that a global risk reduction program can be initiated in order to control for the multiple metabolic toxicities by applying the therapeutic RAAS acronym (table 4) for the treatment and prevention of complications. While this remains a daunting task for clinicians it can be undertaken by a team effort approach involving our multiple resources and sub-specialties in medicine.

### We Do too many parathyroidectomies for calciphylaxis [^112TZdPY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis, a disorder of dermal arteriolar calcification with a distinct predilection for patients with advanced kidney disease, remains an enigmatic condition that challenges clinicians. Observations regarding positive associations between levels of circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the risk of calciphylaxis, combined with experimental data suggesting a pathogenic role of secondary hyperparathyroidism in vascular calcification, have led to the assumption that reducing PTH levels will improve the outcomes in patients with calciphylaxis. This editorial communicates the contemporary data regarding surgical parathyroidectomy as a treatment option for these patients. We raise concerns regarding the quality of available data and discuss the direction of future comparative effectiveness research in this field.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nixFq]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Calciphylaxis is a rare disease with high mortality mainly involving patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sodium thiosulphate (STS) has been used as an off-label therapeutic in calciphylaxis, but there is a lack of clinical trials and studies that demonstrate its effect compared with those without STS treatment.

Objective

To perform a meta-analysis of the cohort studies that provided data comparing outcomes among patients with calciphylaxis treated with and without intravenous STS.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using relevant terms and synonyms including sodium thiosulphate and calci* without language restriction.

Study Selection

The initial search was for cohort studies published before August 31, 2021, that included adult patients diagnosed with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis and could provide a comparison between patients treated with and without intravenous STS. Studies were excluded if they reported outcomes only from nonintravenous administration of STS or if the outcomes for CKD patients were not provided.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects models were performed. The Egger test was used to measure publication bias. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Skin lesion improvement and survival, synthesized as ratio data by a random-effects empirical Bayes model.

Results

Among the 5601 publications retrieved from the targeted databases, 19 retrospective cohort studies including 422 patients (mean age, 57 years; 37.3% male) met the eligibility criteria. No difference was observed in skin lesion improvement (12 studies with 110 patients; risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85–1.78) between the STS and the comparator groups. No difference was noted for the risk of death (15 studies with 158 patients; risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70–1.10) and overall survival using time-to-event data (3 studies with 269 participants; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57–1.18). In meta-regression, lesion improvement associated with STS negatively correlated with publication year, implying that recent studies are more likely to report a null association compared with past studies (coefficient = -0.14; p = 0.008).

Conclusions and Relevance

Intravenous STS was not associated with skin lesion improvement or survival benefit in patients with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis. Future investigations are warranted to examine the efficacy and safety of therapies for patients with calciphylaxis.

### Proximal calciphylaxis treated with calcimimetic' cinacalcet' [^112WSQGx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare condition affecting patients suffering from end-stage renal failure, characterised by cutaneous ischaemia and necrosis. The management of calciphylaxis is challenging owing to the lack of optimal medical therapy, although parathyroidectomy has shown some benefit. We present a case of severe proximal calciphylaxis treated with a small dose of the calcimimetic 'Cinacalcet'.

### Calciphylaxis: risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment [^116zyXCp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare but devastating condition that has continued to challenge the medical community since its early descriptions in the scientific literature many decades ago. It is predominantly seen in patients with chronic kidney failure treated with dialysis (uremic calciphylaxis) but is also described in patients with earlier stages of chronic kidney disease and with normal kidney function. In this review, we discuss the available medical literature regarding risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of both uremic and nonuremic calciphylaxis. High-quality evidence for the evaluation and management of calciphylaxis is lacking at this time due to its rare incidence and poorly understood pathogenesis and the relative paucity of collaborative research efforts. We hereby provide a summary of recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary team for patients with calciphylaxis.

### Diffuse dermal angiomatosis with clinical features simulating calciphylaxis in the setting of end-stage renal disease [^112jYh9f]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been postulated that patients with calciphylaxis may first develop diffuse dermal angiomatosis-like changes when ischemia is still low grade. This may indicate impending development of frank calciphylaxis because of worsening ischemia. If this is the case, prompt management of low-grade ischemia may prevent development of life-threatening sequelae. A stepwise approach for distinction of diffuse dermal angiomatosis from calciphylaxis in the context of end-stage renal disease is presented (Fig 3).

CT, Computed tomography; DDA, diffuse dermal angiomatosis; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; PXE, pseudoxanthoma elasticum. ∗∗Arteriolor, perieccrine, intersititial, or elastic fiber calcification.

Management of both diffuse dermal angiomatosis and calciphylaxis focuses on cessation of vascular ischemia or inflammation. In diffuse dermal angiomatosis, revascularization often results in resolution. Underlying causes of tissue hypoxia — peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis, smoking, and macromastia — should be addressed. Vascular surgery may be considered to improve arterial blood flow. Well-established guidelines for the management of calciphylaxis are lacking, but the consensus is that a multidisciplinary approach is required. Wound management can be approached with surgical debridement, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, or negative-pressure dressings. Given the severe pain associated with calciphylaxis, narcotic analgesics are often required. Medical management is based on stabilization of calcium, phosphorous, and parathyroid hormone levels; hemodialysis; optimization of nutrition; and surveillance for superinfection, with prompt institution of directed antimicrobial therapy.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VkZfU]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, to our knowledge the largest to date on this topic, we compared patients with CKD and calciphylaxis treated with STS and those without, and we observed no improvement in skin lesions or overall survival.

In case reports and multi-case reports, the effective rates for STS treatment were 67% and 84.4%, respectively. Complete and partial wound healing was observed in 80.3% of the patients receiving STS in case reports and case series, and 72.1% of those patients in cohort studies. However, the mortality rate remained high. In the largest cohort study of 172 patients treated with STS for calciphylaxis, the mortality rate was 35% at 1 year and 42% for the entire follow-up. Udomkarnjananun et alpooled data from 129 patients experiencing calciphylaxis in cohort studies with or without controls and found no difference in the risk of amputation, worsening of lesions, and death between patients treated with and without STS. Our study included more recently published studies and more patients than the former analysis. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were done to explore how various study characteristics may have factored into results. Notably, worse outcomes were observed in studies only focusing on dialysis patients. These findings raise questions regarding the role of STS in treating patients with calciphylaxis. However, treatment details about STS were not available from most of the studies and cannot be controlled by investigators. Notably, an overall survival improvement in patients with calciphylaxis has been reported with an effective therapeutic regimen of STS for not less than 2 weeks or with a cumulative dose of no less than 150 g. Meanwhile, negative correlation between skin lesion improvement and publication year implies a publication bias where successful treatment with STS was more likely to be published in the past, while more recently nonresponders have also been published. Thus, well-designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish STS's effect on calciphylaxis.

However, recruitment of patients remains a challenge since calciphylaxis is a rare disease with life-threating nature. CALISTA trial, a phase 3 trial designed to examine the effect of IV STS on acute calciphylaxis-associated pain was terminated early. An ongoing trial BEAT-CALCI is currently comparing STS, magnesium, and vitamin K treatments for patients with calciphylaxis.

Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a cutaneous ischemic small vessel vasculopathy seen in 1 to 4% of patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. It is associated with extreme pain and a 60 to 80% mortality rate in the setting of few and frequently ineffective therapeutic options, although this may be changing based on reports of success with newer therapies.

Data Synthesis

Skin lesion improvement and survival were tabulated and synthesized quantitatively by performing a random-effects empirical Bayes model. Continuous correction was automatically applied when both arms had zero events. Categorical data were analyzed using log risk ratio (RR) or log hazard ratio. Meta-regression was performed to examine the impact from publication year on treatment-related effect sizes. Funnel plot and the Egger test were used to measure the publication bias. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 test. An I 2 index greater than 50% indicated obvious to high heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test effect size measurements and single studies. Stata IC version 16 (StataCorp) was used for statistical analyses. The latest update of analysis was on February 6, 2023.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^11297eM4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

Protocol details are available online atand; a summary of the CALCIPHYX study design was published previously. Adult patients on maintenance haemodialysis for at least 2 weeks who had at least one ulcerated calciphylaxis lesion and a pain visual analogue score ≥ 50/100 provided informed written consent to participate and entered the randomisation. Refer to the protocol for the full list of eligibility criteria. The study included a screening period during which pain medication, wound care, and other background care regimens were stabilised; a 12-week, randomised, double-blind treatment period; a 12-week, open-label treatment period; and a 4-week follow-up period after completion of study treatment (Figure S1).

Ethics

We conducted this international, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. The study was also conducted in accordance with applicable regional, national, and local regulatory and legal requirements. Before the start of the study, the protocol and other relevant documents were approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee for each study centre and relevant regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive hexasodium fytate 7 mg/kg or matching placebo. Study drug was administered intravenously over 2.5–3 h during haemodialysis sessions. Patients, investigators, and the analysis team were fully masked to treatment allocation before database lock. To maintain masking, trial medication appearance, packaging, and labelling were identical in both the active treatment and placebo groups, and unique kit codes were used. Off-label use of intravenous sodium thiosulphate was permitted during the study, as were all other usual care treatments except bisphosphonates or intralesional sodium thiosulphate. Randomisation was stratified by use of intravenous sodium thiosulphate.

### A case report of severe calciphylaxis-suggested approach for diagnosis and treatment [^116DbueW]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The initial histomorphometric analysis revealed low turnover osteopathy, an unexpected result in view of the moderately high iPTH and a BAP in the upper normal range. Consequently, daily dialysis with low calcium and citrate anticoagulation was initiated to induce hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, with the aim to minimize extraosseous calcium crystal deposition and to stimulate bone turnover by hypocalcemia-triggered PTH synthesis. After 7 weeks of this intensified treatment an increased iPTH and BAP was observed.

Our subsequent trial with teriparide was well tolerated, resulted in a reduction of pain, and was not associated with increases in serum calcium despite reduced dialysis intensity. At the end, bone turnover was significantly activated as illustrated by a sustained increase of BAP and the histologic findings in the post-mortem bone biopsy. It is certainly difficult to conclude which of the treatments (intensified dialysis or teriparatide) was the major contributor to the improved bone metabolism. Increases in iPTH and BAP were already observed with intensified dialysis alone. It remains speculative whether bone activation by teriparatide helped to maintain stable calcium levels. Because of the short observation time after initiation of teriparatide we were unable to evaluate the long-term evolution of BAP under this treatment. Also, we could not determine whether alternative treatment schedules (i.e. once per week;) would have been more beneficial. It should be noted that occurrence of calciphylaxis has been reported during teriparatide treatment; yet it is unknown if reduced or increased bone turnover was present in these patients. Of course, high turnover bone disease would be a contraindication for teriparatide. Also, reliable control of serum calcium and awareness of potential deterioration of calciphylaxis is mandatory in any patient receiving this treatment.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^1149zS2L]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Favourable effects of hexasodium fytate on vascular calcification are plausible based on prior experience. In a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 274 patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis with coronary artery calcification at baseline (but without calciphylaxis), hexasodium fytate significantly attenuated the progression of coronary artery and aortic valve calcification relative to placebo and was safe and well tolerated. The role of vascular calcification in calciphylaxis has been described for more than 60 years, but the precise pathogenesis continues to be investigated and elucidated. In patients undergoing haemodialysis, progressive calcification of skin arterioles, typically in areas with abundant adipose tissue such as the abdomen and thighs, can result in subintimal fibrosis and thrombosis, arteriolar occlusion, ischaemia, and progressive necrosis, which cause the painful skin ulcerations of calciphylaxis. The Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial investigated the effects of cinacalcet on cardiovascular outcomes associated with vascular calcification in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. A multivariable analysis of EVOLVE safety data showed that randomisation to cinacalcet resulted in a 75% lower risk of calciphylaxis (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10–0.67), suggesting that the risk of calciphylaxis may be reduced when vascular calcification is attenuated. Cinacalcet has not been evaluated as a treatment for calciphylaxis.

Hexasodium fytate, an intravenously administered salt of naturally occurring IP6, was specifically developed to treat dystrophic calcification including calciphylaxis by binding to hydroxyapatite with high affinity, thereby preventing formation and growth of the hydroxyapatite crystals responsible for medial calcification. Hexasodium fytate does not chelate free calcium, supporting its specificity to modulate vascular calcification. Binding of hexasodium fytate to hydroxyapatite occurs rapidly (within minutes) and persists for days, which allows for administration of hexasodium fytate 3 times weekly during haemodialysis. Many other treatments are commonly administered empirically to treat calciphylaxis, including bisphosphonates, sodium thiosulphate, vitamin K, phosphate binders, and calcimimetics, but none target hydroxyapatite formation and growth, and none have been shown to improve outcomes compared with placebo in a clinical trial. Before this study, available data on calciphylaxis and its treatment were limited to observational and single-arm interventional studies, and as a result, treatment strategies for calciphylaxis are unproven and vary widely.

### An update on calciphylaxis [^112YgXSK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy and uremic small artery disease with medial wall calcification and intimal hyperplasia, is a multifactorial cutaneous vascular disease characterized by chronic, painful, non-healing wounds that occur frequently in patients with chronic kidney disease, predominantly in those with end-stage renal disease. The pathogenesis remains unclear, and the development of calciphylaxis lesions depends on medial calcification, intimal fibrosis of arterioles and thrombotic occlusion. Despite an increase in reports of calciphylaxis in the literature and clinical recognition of demographic characteristics and risk factors associated with calciphylaxis, it remains a poorly understood disease with high morbidity and mortality. In this review, we analyze and summarize the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis and pathophysiology, histopathology, differential diagnosis, diagnostic workup and treatment modalities for calciphylaxis. Because of the lack of consensus regarding the optimal approach to and treatment of this disorder, a high degree of clinical suspicion, early diagnosis, and multimodal and multidisciplinary treatment in collaboration with dermatology, nephrology, wound care, nutrition and pain management specialties may improve survival in patients with calciphylaxis.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112JoNiQ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium thiosulphate (STS) has been widely reported as a potential treatment for calciphylaxis. The majority of the literature focuses on wound healing, however, Noureddine et al. reported that sodium thiosulphate attenuated pain in 71% of patients in a retrospective case series of 14 patients. In a recent phase 2 trial SNF472, an intravenous formulation of myoinositol hexaphosphate has shown to improve wound healing, pain and quality of life in patients with calciphylaxis on haemodialysis. Both SNF472 and STS are not traditional analgesics, however, the effect of these potentially disease modifying drugs on wound healing and consequently wound associated pain is an important patient reported outcome, which is now being reflected in the prominence of quantitative pain evaluation in clinical trial settings. A Phase 3 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of STS on calciphylaxis associated pain is currently in progress (NCT03150420). The change in Pain Visual Analog Scale is a primary outcome measure in a Phase 3 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of SNF472 on pain as well as wound healing (NCT04195906). The use of these agents within pain guidelines has not been routinely recommended as trial data is awaited.

Our survey also showed a variable approach to specialist referral to the pain or palliative care team. These findings are similar to observations in the literature. A systematic review of 12 calciphylaxis studies concluded that there was no formal study of palliative care in patients with calciphylaxis, illustrating the need for the development of a calciphylaxis specific patient-reported outcome measure which would help to prompt earlier and more frequent palliative care consultations. The utility of palliative care consultations in the end of life care of 24 ESRD patients with calciphylaxis was reported by Olarinan et al. This study showed palliative care physicians were consulted in only 50% of the patients, with 54% receiving intensive care admission during the terminal phase of their illness. A very high rate of admission to intensive care despite the very poor prognosis highlights the need for a change in practice which promotes early referral, advance care planning and patient centred interventions. Less than 10% of the members replied, which might be expected with a rare condition and may influence the results of the survey.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1122vu4s]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcaemic uremic arteriolopathy or calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The reported incidence in haemodialysis patients is variable and largely reliant on registry data with reported incidences of 0.04% in Germany and 0.35% in the United States. The mortality rate can be as high as 60–80%. It is characterised by the onset of a painful violaceous rash which progresses to ischaemic necrotic ulcers. The lesions are predominantly centrally distributed in areas of high adiposity (e.g. abdomen and thighs).

Pain is a hallmark of this disease and can be extremely difficult to control. Pain resulting from calciphylaxis is classically an acute ischaemic pain resulting from tissue damage as a consequence of arteriolar occlusion causing hypoperfusion, ischaemia and infarction of tissues. As with all acute pain the severity and characteristics of the pain will vary from patient to patient. The acute pain may be a continuous background pain or evoked by movement or procedures. In addition to the background level of pain there may be episodes of unprovoked exacerbations of breakthrough pain. Opioids have been a key component in managing pain.

Current management of calciphylaxis involves a multimodal approach including medical (stopping medications which have been associated with increased risk e.g. calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, vitamin K antagonists, and starting new medication e.g. sodium thiosulphate, cinacalcet, and antibiotics), surgical (e.g. parathyroidectomy, wound debridement, and amputation) and modification of dialysis regimens such as varying dialysate calcium concentrations and increasing dialysis frequency.

Available evidence suggests that pain management in calciphylaxis is unsatisfactory with differing practice across the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. A knowledge and practice survey was conducted to obtain information on physicians current practice of the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The aim of the data collection was to describe practice patterns and in light of this data develop a practice guideline for pain management in patients with calciphylaxis. The guidelines described are the first step in developing a rationale for managing complex pain in a group of frail patients with multiple comorbidities.

### Calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal function: response to treatment with sodium thiosulfate [^116iGUcZ]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening cause of skin necrosis. The condition is primarily reported in patients with end-stage renal disease, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment has mainly been empirical. We report a case of calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal function and hypoparathyroidism, who responded to treatment with sodium thiosulfate. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the use of sodium thiosulfate to treat calciphylaxis in a patient with normal renal function.

### Maggot therapy for calciphylaxis wound debridement complicated by bleeding [^11778cdX]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Calciphylaxis is associated with several conditions. Our patient's calciphylaxis risk factors included obesity, alcoholic liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, and being a white woman. Although no standardized or US Food and Drug Administration–approved calciphylaxis treatments exist, reported therapies include intravenous or intralesional STS, hyperbaric oxygen, pentoxifylline, low-dose tissue plasminogen activator, bisphosphonates, vitamin K, and debridement. After extensive discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient, we conducted the first use of maggot therapy debridement at our institution.

Maggot therapy involves the application of live, pathogen-free green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) larvae to debride wounds. Although maggots were used during the Civil War, clinical trials began in 1990. Currently, maggot therapy is US Food and Drug Administration regulated and used primarily for diabetic and pressure ulcers. Applied at 10/cm 2 for up to 72 hours, the larvae liquefy and ingest 15 g/d of necrotic tissue, expanding 4 to 5 times in the process. As such, excessive pressure and occlusive dressings that restrict oxygen flow should be avoided. Maggots can decrease wound size an average of 4.1 cm and 33% by 4 weeks. Although trials are limited, 3 randomized and 5 nonrandomized studies found that maggot therapy is significantly more effective than hydrogels and hydrocolloid for ulcer debridement.

Benefits of maggot therapy include debridement, disinfection, enhanced wound healing, avoidance of surgical complications, and lower costs than surgical debridement. Larvae-secreted enzymes including trypsin and carboxypeptidase liquefy necrotic tissue, whereas antibacterial treatments such as phenylacetyl aldehyde kill bacteria. Along with these secretions, maggots' physical movements stimulate granulation tissue. Maggot therapy preserves healthy tissue while minimizing risks of infection and calciphylaxis propagation during surgical debridement. Surgical debridement in calciphylaxis is controversial. One retrospective study found improved survival in patients undergoing surgical debridement; however, uncontrolled differences in disease severity and selection for patients with limited disease may have affected results. Another case reported calciphylaxis worsening after surgery. Chemical rather than surgical debridement may be preferable for noninfected, stable calciphylaxis lesions with dry eschar.

### Use of cryopreserved human amniotic membrane in the treatment of skin ulcers secondary to calciphylaxis [^113h3Hds]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare condition characterized by skin ulceration and necrosis as a result of vascular calcification of the small and medium blood vessels of skin and subcutaneous tissues. It mainly occurs in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and sometimes leads to complications with a fatal outcome. In this report, we describe the case of a 67-year-old male patient with end stage renal disease presenting painful skin ulcers on his lower limbs. The lesions had progressively grown and were associated to severe pain and decreased quality of life. The ulcers did not respond to conventional treatments and the patient underwent skin biopsy of these lesions obtaining anatomopathological findings compatible with calciphylaxis. In this report, we present an innovative treatment for skin ulcers secondary to calciphylaxis using cryopreserved amniotic membrane (AM) as a dressing in order to promote epithelialization of the wounds. After four applications, healing of the main ulcer and reduction in pain was achieved. In summary, applying cryopreserved AM probed to be a promising strategy to reduce pain and to enhance epithelialization and healing of chronic non-responsive ulcers in calciphylaxis.

### Use of sodium thiosulphate in a multi-interventional setting for the treatment of calciphylaxis in dialysis patients [^117DEosk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a life-threatening complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). No established therapy exists so far. The aim of the present study was to determine the therapeutic response to a multi-interventional treatment regimen with consistent use of sodium thiosulphate (STS) in an Austrian cohort of calciphylaxis patients.

Methods

We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data on 27 calciphylaxis patients treated with STS at seven Austrian dialysis centres between June 2004 and November 2010.

Results

Twenty-seven dialysis patients (68 ± 12 years) were treated with STS for a median (25th, 75th percentile) of 96 (54, 133) days. Seven patients (26%) suffered from proximal-type, and 20 patients (74%) from distal-type calciphylaxis. Fourteen patients (52%) showed a complete remission, five patients (19%) a partial remission and eight patients (30%) progression that resulted in amputation in four patients. During a median follow-up of 101 (79, 273) days, 14 patients died (52%). Non-survivors were older (P = 0.04), showed higher CRP values (P = 0.04), presented more frequently with proximal-type calciphylaxis (P = 0.03), had a higher disease severity score at diagnosis (P = 0.01), were treated more often with antibiotics (P = 0.01) and cinacalcet (P = 0.03) and had a lower remission rate during treatment (P = 0.004) than did survivors. The use of antibiotics and cinacalcet, disease severity at diagnosis and remission rates were found to be significant survival predictors in logistic regression analysis.

Conclusions

Calciphylaxis remains a serious complication with high mortality. Early and consistent therapy including STS may help to improve the disease outcome.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^113v1guf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The planned enrolment was 66 patients based on a sample size calculation informed by results for wound healing and pain from the phase 2 trial of hexasodium fytate in calciphylaxis. The study included a preplanned sample size reassessment when approximately half of the planned number of patients had been treated for 12 weeks.

We used SAS (Cary, NC) Version 9.4 or higher for all analyses. For both alternate primary efficacy outcomes, we compared the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 between treatment groups with a mixed model for repeated measures analysis in the modified intention-to-treat population. The hexasodium fytate intervention was to be considered successful if there were a statistically significant improvement relative to placebo in at least one of these outcomes. Sensitivity analyses for the alternate primary efficacy outcomes included jump-to-placebo and tipping-point approaches to assess the extent to which missing data might have influenced results. To control Type I error inflation, we planned a modified Hochberg procedure with two-sided alpha of 4% for the alternate primary outcomes with 1% alpha retained for testing of secondary outcomes. Further details for planned statistical methods are provided in the Supplementary materials.

Upon review of the prespecified safety analyses, the CALCIPHYX Steering Committee recommended additional post-hoc analyses of death and calciphylaxis-related events. These analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. We plotted cumulative incidence curves, calculating hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Because of small total numbers of events (all analyses have events totalling ≤ 15) and early separation of survival curves in each of the time-to-event analyses, the exact Wilcoxon test p-value based on the permutation test was provided. Since the permutation test does not provide an estimated hazard ratio and confidence intervals (CIs), bootstrapping the Cox proportional regression methods was applied to provide the estimated hazard ratio and CIs, adjusting for small numbers of events. Since a sizeable fraction of the population required multiple hospitalisations during the randomised treatment period and there were differences in exposure (higher study retention among patients randomised to hexasodium fytate), we also compared exposure-adjusted event rates between treatment groups, calculating rate ratios and 95% CI using negative binomial regression. Finally, given the extended duration of several hospitalisations, we calculated days alive and out of hospital weighted for exposure and compared treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

### Calciphylaxis: a case report [^113VhKtm]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis or calcific uremic arteriolopathy is characterized by the involvement of the tunica elastica of the reticular or deep subcutaneous dermis, with extravascular and vascular thrombosis calcifications that lead to tissular ischemia. The torso muscles, the lumbar region, and lower limbs are more frequently affected. The pathogenesis is unknown. Calciphylaxis is associated to hyperparathyroidism, chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus. The best therapy to date is prevention: early treatment of renal failure, performing a partial parathyroidectomy where necessary, surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, as well as avoiding the trigger factors such as systemic corticosteroids.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^112XQqdD]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the relatively low prevalence of calciphylaxis, we did not believe that an event-driven trial would be feasible due to anticipated challenges in recruitment. Thus, we needed to design a trial of modest size to test whether hexasodium fytate could improve clinically relevant features of calciphylaxis. We settled on a quantitative assessment of the primary calciphylaxis lesion and a patient-reported assessment of pain as alternate primary outcomes. The BWAT was developed initially as a tool for assessment of pressure ulcers; we developed the BWAT-CUA (a subset of questions from the BWAT) for this trial in an effort to adapt it for calciphylaxis wounds. While the BWAT-CUA has face validity, and appeared to be sensitive to change when applied to Phase 2 study results, it had not been prospectively tested before its use here. With respect to the Pain VAS, pain is perceived differently by different patients, and the provision of, and response to, narcotic analgesic and other analgesic agents and agents aimed to manage different types of pain may vary, losing specificity. Validated markers of disease progression and/or pragmatic trial designcould facilitate future clinical trials in calciphylaxis.

CALCIPHYX was the first phase 3, randomised, controlled trial to achieve recruitment targets and complete double-blinded treatment in patients with calciphylaxis. Patients were enrolled and treated at sites across the United States and Europe, with close collaboration among study investigators and large dialysis organisations. These achievements are notable not only because the trial was conducted successfully during the global COVID-19 pandemic, but also because three randomised clinical trials of sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis were previously attempted; all were terminated during patient recruitment (, ISRCTN73380053), the most recent of which recruited 29 patients over three years before the pandemic. Given the frequent, empirical use of sodium thiosulphate to manage calciphylaxis, randomisation was stratified by sodium thiosulphate use. Results for primary efficacy outcomes were similar among patients treated and not treated with sodium thiosulphate.

### Calciphylaxis due to hyperparathyroidism [^111mvYdQ]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss when and how to workup calciphylaxis for early diagnosis and to delineate medical vs surgical management of the disease.

Methods

Review of evidence-based medical literature on calciphylaxis due to primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

Calciphylaxis is usually associated with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. However, calciphylaxis can also be seen in the absence of chronic renal failure and has been reported in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. Calciphylaxis occurs when the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood exceed their solubility level, leading to calcium-phosphate deposits in arteries that compromise the vasculature. These ischemic changes result in plaque-like lesions that progress to painful nodules. Calciphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of physical examination, laboratory, and histopathologic findings. When medical therapy has failed in the setting of secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with calciphylaxis, parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment. In primary hyperparathyroidism, early recognition and aggressive wound care with debridement are important in managing this condition. However, resection of the offending parathyroid gland should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

When calciphylaxis is present, early detection is critical to the successful management of this condition. Although medical therapy can be effective, surgical resection of the diseased parathyroid glands can be curative and potentially life saving. A multidisciplinary approach involving early diagnosis, aggressive medical management, operative debridement, and parathyroidectomy has the best chance of improving survival in calciphylaxis.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^115CzLht]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a rare condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. Pain is a hallmark of this condition and can be extremely difficult to control. Anecdotal data suggests that pain management in calciphylaxis is challenging with variable approaches across the United Kingdom (UK) and internationally. A knowledge and practice survey was conducted to establish current practice in the management of pain in patients with calciphylaxis, in the UK. Based on the results and clinical experience the authors suggest a clinical practice guideline.

Methods

An online questionnaire was circulated among physicians (renal and palliative care) involved in the management of pain in calciphylaxis. The questionnaire included a mix of open-ended questions and questions with drop down options.

Results

One hundred and six clinicians responded to the survey of which 60 (57%) respondents were from palliative medicine; the remaining 46 (43%) were from renal medicine. 31 (30%) respondents across both specialties had not encountered any patients with a diagnosis of calciphylaxis (renal-2, palliative care-29). A referral to the palliative care team was undertaken by 18% of renal physicians, 32% referred to the pain team and 50% referred to both. Only 3% of the palliative medicine respondents indicated that they had received a referral from the renal team at the time of diagnosis. Opioids were the preferred initial drug of choice for the management of all types of pain. Paracetamol was universally selected as the preferred first-choice adjuvant agent for management of all types of pain. The importance of advance care planning was highlighted with 72% undertaking advanced care planning discussions often or most of the time.

Conclusion

There was wide variation in the current practice of pain management in patients with calciphylaxis, with variation between renal specialists and palliative care specialists. Referral to specialists in pain management is not universal despite the severe nature of the pain experienced by patients with calciphylaxis. The data generated has facilitated the development of a clinical practice guideline to support complex pain management in a group of patients with multiple comorbidities.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fbtkZ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Among the 5601 publications retrieved from the targeted databases, 19 retrospective cohort studies, (422 patients; mean age, 57 years; 37.3% male) met our eligibility criteria. Among the 422 patients with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis, 347 were dialysis-dependent. Detailed population distribution, demographic information, and other characteristics of these cohort studies involving patients with calciphylaxis are presented in Table 1.

Table 1.
Summary of 19 Retrospective Cohort Studies for Calciphylaxis

Abbreviations: CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; HBOT, hyperbaric oxygen therapy; HD, hemodialysis; NA, not available; PD, peritoneal dialysis; RRT, renal replacement therapy; STS, sodium thiosulphate.

No significant difference was observed for the outcome of skin lesion improvement (12 studies, 110 patients; RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85–1.78) between the STS and the comparator groups, although the RR favored the STS group (Figure 2 A). Similarly, despite a lower risk of death noted in the STS group in studies that provided dichotomous dead or alive outcome, no significant difference was achieved (15 studies, 158 patients; RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70–1.10) (Figure 2 B). None of the 3 studies that provided time-to-event death data showed an association between STS treatment and time to death. No significant benefit was observed after synthesis using meta-analysis (3 studies, 269 participants; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57–1.18) (Figure 2 C). In meta-regression, the log RR of lesion improvement associated with STS was found to be negatively correlated with publication year (coefficient = −0.14; p = 0.008) (Table 2).

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^114JUPfa]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there is wide variation in the current management of pain in calciphylaxis, amongst renal and palliative care physicians. The rarity of the condition and severity of pain are particularly challenging for non-pain specialists who have a tendency to revert to familiar drugs such as opioids. Moreover, there are no published guidelines or recommendations to support clinicians with decision-making.

### Intralesional sodium thiosulfate as adjuvant therapy in severe calciphylaxis [^113vQXQS]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare disease characterized by calcification of the middle layer of small arteries and arterioles, causing secondary cuta-neous ischemia. The diagnosis is clinical but may be confirmed by histological examination. The optimal treatment is not exactly known, although there is consensus that a multifactorial approach is required. This report is regarding the case of a female patient with a kidney transplant requiring peritoneal dialysis, in the late postoperative period of partial parathyroidectomy due to severe hyperparathyroidism, with refractory hypocalcemia and severe calciphylaxis, subsequently treated with intralesional sodium thiosulfate due to initial intoler-ance to intravenous thiosulfate treatment.

### Revisiting therapeutic options for calciphylaxis [^115d9Dee]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Calciphylaxis is a disorder of cutaneous microvascular calcification and thrombosis leading to chronic, excruciatingly painful, progressive wounds with a high risk of sepsis and death. The diagnosis and treatment of calciphylaxis presents significant challenges. A poorly understood disease, the management of calciphylaxis has mostly been restricted to wound management and a few novel therapies. Data from patient registries and new studies on causal pathways is stimulating the development of pathogenesis-based medical therapies.

Recent Findings

Much needed clinical trials are now underway to examine the safety and efficacy of sodium thiosulfate and other therapeutics for the indication of calciphylaxis. There is emerging data suggesting a potential role of therapeutic anticoagulation in these patients. There has also been a renewed emphasis on patient-oriented outcomes, such as improvement of pain scores and quality-of-life indices.

Summary

This review highlights ongoing clinical trials studying therapeutic options in calciphylaxis and emphasizes the causal pathways that led to the development of such therapies.

### Calciphylaxis with evidence of hypercoagulability successfully treated with unfractionated heparin: a multidisciplinary approach [^1157UZTX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is characterized by abnormal calcification of vessels and skin; however, its aetiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Entities frequently associated with calciphylaxis are end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, elevated calcium-phosphate product, hyperparathyroidism and possible hypercoagulable states. Skin lesions may remain quiescent or may develop suddenly and progress rapidly. They are more common on the legs. Treatment of calciphylaxis is very challenging and requires interdisciplinary management. We present a case that highlights the difficulty of treating calciphylaxis. A multidisciplinary approach was vital for the proper treatment of our patient. This case also demonstrates the importance of searching for underlying hypercoagulable states, especially in recalcitrant cases. In cases of calciphylaxis with vessel occlusion from microthrombi, heparin therapy would be a logical next step. The effect of anticoagulation may be rapid and impressive.

### Symptomatic management of calciphylaxis: a case series and review of the literature [^115daRDc]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriopathy, is a rare complication of end-stage renal impairment. It is characterized by the development of small vessel vasculopathy with subcutaneous necrosis and ulceration. Intense pain and cutaneous hyperesthesia are prominent features. Mortality rates are high, and the resulting morbidity is significant. While symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment, it can be challenging. We describe the symptomatic management of a series of three patients with calciphylaxis. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of multimodal analgesia with high-dose opioids, ketamine, and benzodiazepines and on the use of preemptive analgesia.

### Multi-intervention management of calciphylaxis: a report of 7 cases [^115qL1TW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) is a devastating but rare complication seen predominantly in dialysis patients that often is fatal. Because of the rarity of the disease and the multifactorial nature of its cause, no clinical trials have been conducted to date to determine the best therapy for the condition. We report a case series of 7 patients at a single institution in whom a systematic multi-interventional treatment strategy was implemented, consisting of trigger-agent cessation (calcium-based phosphate binders, alphacalcidol, and warfarin), wound management, and antibiotic therapy, supplemented by intensified hemodialysis (4 hours daily for 7 days followed by 5–6 times weekly), intravenous sodium thiosulfate (12.5–25 g intravenously 3 times a week), and attempted oxygen therapy (given through a face mask or hyperbaric chamber as tolerated by patient circumstance). Treatments selected were based on literature review, consensus discussion, and attempts to address the physiologic disturbances that underlie the condition. All 7 patients identified with biopsy-proven calcific uremic arteriolopathy were treated with this regimen in 2007–2010, with 6 of 7 showing complete recovery. We suggest that consistent implementation of a multi-interventional approach may alter the course of this devastating disease. Further studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.

### Sodium thiosulfate: new hope for the treatment of calciphylaxis [^116XdmJ4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis/calcific uremic arteriolopathy is rare but an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease with increasing prevalence. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) has rapidly emerged from a seldom used therapy for the treatment of calciphylaxis/calcific uremic arteriolopathy to a treatment that is being increasingly utilized globally due to multiple positive outcomes shared in the form of case reports and reviews during the past 6 years. Its role as a rather potent antioxidant has uniquely been associated with a prompt decrease in pain and its slower chelating properties are associated with regression of subcutaneous calcifications. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate nuclear transcription factor, NF(kappa)B and downstream cytokines resulting in inflammation, which may result in dysregulated hepatic protein synthesis. Indeed, inflammation activates acute-phase reactant synthesis, while concurrently inhibiting synthesis of fetuin-A (an inhibitor of extraosseous calcification) and the antioxidant albumin. Additionally, ROS may decrease locally synthesized matrix GLA proteins and this combination may contribute to increased vascular and subcutaneous calcification. STS used alone or in combination with other novel emerging therapies may result in the improved clinical outcomes in this challenging clinical condition.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112s2muc]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Calciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening condition associated with a significant impact on quality of life; pain is a major contributor to this. Due to the rarity and high mortality associated with this condition, randomised control trial evidence on management has been a challenge and there is no uniform strategy for the management of calciphylaxis associated pain.

Our survey demonstrated a wide variation in the management of pain in patients with Calciphylaxis. Notably the choice of medication varied depending on the speciality of the physician, indicating that familiarity with drugs and confidence in their use may be a factor in determining drug choice rather than an approach based on determining the nature of the pain and selecting the best choice of drug. Reported evidence in the literature on the management of pain in calciphylaxis is limited and variable. In a case series of three patients with Calciphylaxis, a cocktail approach of opioids, benzodiazepines and ketamine was used to manage refractory pain. Similarly, a multistep approach including antidepressants, opioids and benzodiazepines was used with the involvement of palliative care in the management of a case of penile calciphylaxis. Neurolytic lumbar sympathetic blockade has been used for the treatment of pain associated with calciphylaxis in ESRD patients. In addition to analgesics, treatments that may improve the underlying lesion itself are also likely to improve pain. To date, there is no approved treatment for calciphylaxis, and management is largely based on case reports and uncontrolled studies, although prospective clinical trials are under way. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, vitamin K and wound debridement are examples of management strategies that been reported to improve wound healing and therefore may also improve pain.

### Hexasodium fytate for the treatment of calciphylaxis: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^1125oNye]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This randomised, placebo-controlled trial of hexasodium fytate in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis with calciphylaxis was designed to compare BWAT-CUA and/or Pain VAS scores and did not yield improvements in its alternate primary efficacy outcomes, as patients in both groups experienced improvements in both parameters. No significant differences were observed in prespecified secondary efficacy outcomes, including the Wound-QoL questionnaire, total BWAT score, a qualitative assessment of wound healing, and use of narcotic analgesics.

Hexasodium fytate was well tolerated compared with placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were typical of the patient population. Patients randomised to hexasodium fytate were more likely to remain on study drug. The proportion of patients who died or who experienced calciphylaxis-related events, including infection and hospitalisation, was numerically lower in the hexasodium fytate group. In the post-hoc analysis of composite endpoints of time to death or first calciphylaxis-related hospitalisation, time to death or any hospitalisation, or days alive and out of hospital, patients randomised to hexasodium fytate showed clinically meaningful improvements that were of nominal statistical significance. Patients with calciphylaxis are at increased risk of bacteraemia, which is usually managed by hospitalisation. Post hoc analysis indicated patients treated with SNF472 had fewer calciphylaxis wound-related hospitalisations. The primary outcome measures of BWAT-CUA and Pain VAS had not been previously validated as endpoints in calciphylaxis. Due to the medical complexity of the patient population, these endpoints may not be sensitive enough to detect potential improvements specific to the calciphylaxis wounds and the impact on important clinical outcomes such as calciphylaxis-associated hospitalisation and death. This may also be influenced by the pre-specified methodology to handle missing data; the increased number of deaths and calciphylaxis hospitalisations seen in the placebo group led to a substantially larger amount of missing data in the placebo group. The study duration may also not have been long enough to see a difference in the primary endpoints. The improvement in BWAT-CUA and Pain VAS may reflect better than usual standard of care of the wound and pain management in the context of a clinical trial.

### Early diagnosis and intervention of calciphylaxis leading to rapid resolution [^114kVcVF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Calciphylaxis is a rare life-threatening disorder characterized by skin necrosis due to calcium deposition within small- and medium-sized vessels and subsequent thrombosis leading to tissue ischemia. Though the exact pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is poorly understood, risk factors such as chronic kidney disease can promote calcium deposition and vascular calcification contributing to the disease process. This condition presents with poor healing, painful skin lesions, which initially may be confused with mimickers, such as cellulitis; peripheral vascular disease, warfarin necrosis, or vasculitis. While calciphylaxis is considered a rare disease predominantly affecting patients with chronic kidney disease on renal replacement therapy, there has been an increase in clinical awareness, which may be reflected in the increase in incidence. Despite calciphylaxis having a high morbidity and 1-year mortality as high as 80% in some cases, no randomized controlled trials examining longitudinal outcomes and treatment efficacy have been published. This report discusses 3 cases of early calciphylaxis diagnosis and treatment leading to rapid resolution and survival, highlighting the impact of timely recognition and intervention.

### Calciphylaxis and kidney disease: a review [^116wgX8P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a life-threatening complication most often associated with chronic kidney disease that occurs as a result of the deposition of calcium in dermal and adipose microvasculature. However, this condition may also be seen in patients with acute kidney injury. The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with calciphylaxis highlight the importance to correctly diagnose and treat this condition. However, calciphylaxis remains a diagnosis that may be clinically challenging to make. Here, we review the literature on uremic calciphylaxis with a focus on its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, advances in diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies. We also discuss the unique histopathological features of calciphylaxis and contrast it with those of other forms of general vessel calcification. This review emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary collaboration including nephrology, dermatology, and palliative care to ultimately provide the best possible care to patients with calciphylaxis.

### Warfarin sodium [^111DZx4b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Calciphylaxis

Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.

### Success of small-dose fractionated sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of calciphylaxis in a peritoneal dialysis patient [^113ApHZV]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), is a rare, fatal disorder of microvascular calcification and thrombosis that typically affects patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving long-term dialysis. Fewer reports describe calciphylaxis in peritoneal dialysis patients than hemodialysis patients as per a literature review. To date, there are no clear guidelines for CUA diagnosis and treatment. While sodium thiosulfate (STS) has been increasingly used for treatment in recent years, there have also been reports of severe side effects. There is no uniform standard for its usage and dosage, especially for peritoneal dialysis patients.

Case Presentation

We present a case of a 40-year-old Chinese male patient with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis who developed calciphylaxis with severe painful cutaneous ulcers on the fingers and toes that were managed successfully for 6 months with comprehensive treatment composed mainly of small-dose fractionated sodium thiosulfate.

Conclusions

Our experience suggests that the treatment of calciphylaxis requires timely and multi-angle intervention. Treatment with small-dose fractionated sodium thiosulfate has proven effective and tolerated in this patient.

### Phenprocoumon based anticoagulation is an underestimated factor in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis [^111g4CfW]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another instance demonstrating the relationship between VKA and calciphylaxis was seen in one of our patients surviving calciphylaxis. Initial VKA treatment was begun due to atrial fibrillation. Upon diagnosis of calciphylaxis VKA treatment was stopped and calciphylaxis associated lesions healed completely. After 1 year VKA treatment was continued, however, this lead to a recurrence of calciphylaxis associated lesions. In summary, VKA use in calciphylaxis patients should be avoided, alternatively new oral anticoagulants should be considered as treatment options.

Impaired liver function seems to be, as up to now, an underestimated contributing factor. In our cohort, low serum albumin levels as well as reduced PCHE levels could be identified as contributing factors.

Furthermore obesity seems to be a major contributing factor. None of our patients presented with a normal BMI, the majority had a BMI of > 35 kg/m 2. However, larger patient numbers are needed to substantiate the connection between obesity and calciphylaxis. A pathogenic factor in obese patients might be due to an increaseed tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha expression in adipose tissue, which in turn decreases blood circulation thus accelerating the calcification process.

Limitations: The analysis of patient charts by a non-blinded observer may be a source of bias. Retrospective evaluation of unstandardised data also poses a limitation to this study. Future studies with larger study populations and a group of controls will be of great interest in order to draw definite conclusions on risk factors for calciphylaxis.

### Characterizing the burden of calciphylaxis: a qualitative analysis [^116x75pS]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a debilitating disease associated with high mortality and morbidity secondary to pain, nonhealing wounds and frequent hospital admissions. We qualitatively assessed the burden of calciphylaxis on patient quality of life through semi-structured interviews with nine adult participants. Participants identified an inability to complete activities of daily living because of mobility impairment and decreased strength, although most denied complete dependence on others. All participants described pain as the worst aspect of disease, citing a variable course, unpredictability in severity and poor control despite medical therapy. Calciphylaxis also caused feelings of sadness and anger, having a negative impact on self-confidence. Supportive care needs to address the pervasive and severe nature of pain, mobility impairment and psychiatric comorbidities; such interventions may decrease the overall burden for patients with calciphylaxis.

### Underreported use of palliative care and patient-reported outcome measures to address reduced quality of life in patients with calciphylaxis: a systematic review [^117Ezd5o]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Palliative care (PC) is a subspecialty that treats the pain and stress of serious illness. To assess whether the role of quality of life (QoL) indices, patient-reported outcome measures and PC have been studied in patients with calciphylaxis, we performed a systematic literature review. Several databases were searched from inception to October 2016 according to modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. We searched for papers on calciphylaxis that mentioned the symptoms and supportive needs of patients, QoL or outcome measures to report symptom severity, and the involvement of PC. Twelve papers met the inclusion criteria. Reported patient symptoms included pain, skin lesion resolution and pruritus, with the first being the most frequently reported. Four papers measured pain using a previously verified patient-reported outcome measure, including the Visual Analogue Scale. One paper used a verified QoL measure, the Dermatology Quality of Life Index. No tool was used consistently. Eight papers reported the use of hospice care or PC in the treatment of calciphylaxis. No outcome measure was used to prompt PC involvement. Overall, QoL indices, patient-reported outcome measures and PC are underreported in the treatment of calciphylaxis. PC may be a resource to assist in symptom management and adaptive coping strategies for patients from the onset of disease.

### Retrospective analysis of tissue plasminogen activator as an adjuvant treatment for calciphylaxis [^1117ZXy2]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report our experience with low-dose tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of calciphylaxis, a rare, usually fatal thrombotic condition that results in ischemia, necrosis, and infarction of adipose and cutaneous tissue.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care academic medical center.

Patients

Fifteen patients (4 men and 11 women) with calciphylaxis, treated from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010.

Intervention

Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, concomitant wound care, and management of calcium-phosphate status.

Main Outcome Measures

Short-term ulcer healing, long-term survival.

Results

Patients received daily low-dose infusions of tissue plasminogen activator (mean treatment duration, 11 days). Six patients had no adverse reactions, 3 had minor bleeding, 6 required blood transfusions, and 3 had life-threatening bleeding. No patients died of treatment-related complications. Ten patients died (median time to death, 3.6 months; range, 23 days to 4.2 years). Of the remaining 5 patients, the median duration of follow-up was 36.8 months (range, 70 days to 4.3 years). Patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator had approximately 30% greater survival than controls, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.14). Our results were limited by the use of concomitant therapies, referral bias for advanced disease, and retrospective case-series design.

Conclusions

Thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator may be a useful adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with calciphylaxis. However, a multidisciplinary approach that includes aggressive wound care, débridement, thrombolytic therapy, restoration of tissue oxygenation, avoidance of infection, and control of calcium-phosphate homeostasis also is essential.

### Warfarin-associated nonuremic calciphylaxis [^113Mqn9z]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Classic calciphylaxis associated with renal failure is a life-threatening disease. Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis without renal injury has been described, but whether it is a subset of classic calciphylaxis or a different entity remains unknown. We describe 1 case of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis, present data from 2 others from our institution, and review all cases of warfarin-associated calciphylaxis available in the literature. Our review indicates that warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is clinically and pathophysiologically distinct from classic calciphylaxis.

Objective

To review warfarin-associated calciphylaxis and determine its relationship to classic calciphylaxis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We searched MEDLINE and Ovid without language or date restrictions for case reports of calciphylaxis from the inpatient setting using the terms "calciphylaxis and warfarin", "non-uremic calciphylaxis", and "nonuremic calciphylaxis". We defined nonuremic calciphylaxis as a histopathologic diagnosis of calciphylaxis without severe kidney disease (serum creatinine level > 3 mg/dL; glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min; acute kidney injury requiring dialysis; and renal transplantation).

Exposures

Each patient had been exposed to warfarin before the onset of calciphylaxis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient data were abstracted from published reports. Original patient medical records were requested and reviewed when possible.

Results

We identified 18 patients with nonuremic calciphylaxis, 15 from the literature, and 3 from our institution. Patients were predominantly female (15 of 18 [83%]) with ages ranging from 19 to 86 years. Duration of warfarin therapy prior to calciphylaxis onset averaged 32 months. Lesions were usually located below the knees (in 12 of 18 [67%]). No cases reported elevated calcium-phosphate products (0 of 17 [0%]). Calcifications were most often noted in the tunica media (n = 8 [44%]) or in the vessel lumen and tunica intima (n = 7 [39%]). The most common treatments included substitution of heparin or low-molecular weight heparin for warfarin (n = 13 [72%]), intravenous sodium thiosulfate (n = 9 [50%]), and hyperbaric oxygen (n = 3 [17%]). The survival rate on hospital discharge was remarkably high, with 15 cases (83%) reporting full recovery and 3 cases ending in death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Warfarin-associated calciphylaxis is distinct from classic calciphylaxis in pathogenesis, course, and, particularly, outcome. This finding should influence clinical management of the disease and informs targeted treatment of the disease.

### Calciphylaxis: treatment and outlook-CME part II [^113KRxs4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare and devastating condition with important systemic ramifications. This second-part of our CME aims to educate the practicing dermatologist on the current standard of care once a diagnosis of calciphylaxis is confirmed or highly suspected. The key pathologic findings, as well as the role and limitations of biopsy, are reviewed. We aim to guide readers through the complex hospitalization and posthospitalization management of these medically vulnerable patients. Collaboration with other specialists will be discussed. Experimental and developing treatments are discussed, and the outlook of the condition is reported.

### Calciphylaxis epidemiology, risk factors, treatment and survival among French chronic kidney disease patients: a case-control study [^111mrzSB]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The main circumstance of death in our study was palliative care (49%), in the absence of efficient therapy to treat CUA. Due to its promising treatment properties, STS was frequently administered, but was only associated with a trend toward better prognosis after exclusion of patients treated less than 2 weeks. Trials are in progress to assess the real benefit of STS in CUA. As demonstrated by other studies, surgical debridement had a net impact on survival and should be proposed more widely. Contrary to other studies, parathyroidectomy was associated with a poorer prognosis, but given that only 5 parathyroidectomies were performed the conclusions are limited.

### Management of calciphylaxis in a burn center: a case series and review of the literature [^112Ft1TE]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare, necrotizing skin disorder usually associated with kidney disease, but also caused by many other systemic illnesses. This disease is associated with mortality rates as high as 80% at 1year. We present the demographic and clinical data of nine patients with calciphylaxis treated at our burn center over a 10year period. We review the literature on the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease. We propose that these patients be treated similar to patients with thermal burn injury; meaning intensive wound care, surgical management, critical care and physical therapy. Burn centers are uniquely capable of caring for these incredibly complex patients due to their experience in managing patients with extensive skin and soft tissue defects, wounds and diseases.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wtTNR]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Data Sources and Search Strategy

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using relevant terms and synonyms including sodium thiosulphate and calci* without language restriction. The controlled vocabulary terms, synonyms, and the complete search strategy are listed in eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1. We contacted the authors of eligible articles to retrieve missing data. Our search included studies published before August 31, 2021. This study was exempt from review by the Mass General Brigham institutional review board, and informed consent was not required because data were publicly available. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed. The protocol was registered and published on PROSPERO.

Eligibility Criteria

We searched for cohort studies that met the following criteria: (1) included adult patients (ages 18 years and older) diagnosed with CKD (defined as either kidney damage or a decreased glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for at least 3 months),(2) having calciphylaxis as the main complication studied and the primary indication for STS treatment, and (3) including both the patients treated with and without intravenous STS to provide a comparison between intervention and comparator groups (Figure 1). Studies were excluded if they reported outcomes only from nonintravenous administration of STS (eg, oral, intraperitoneal, intralesional, etc.), or the outcomes for CKD patients were not provided.

Two authors (W.W. and I.P.) independently screened the records using Endnote X9 (Clarivate) to identify eligible studies, extracted data regarding participants, intervention, and outcome measures (lesion improvement, all-cause death, and time-to-event survival), and graded the risk of bias in the studies using Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Discrepancies among the reviewers were reevaluated by a third author (S.N.) and discussed to obtain a consensus.

### Sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of calcific uremic arteriolopathy [^115Dpc6u]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA; also known as calciphylaxis) is a life-threatening condition observed mostly in patients on dialysis. The key histopathologic features of CUA include media calcification of small arteries, associated with endovascular fibrosis and thrombosis. Several risk factors for CUA are related to disturbances in bone and mineral metabolism; current treatments largely aim to normalize these disturbances by lowering serum calcium phosphate concentration and thereby preventing, or even reversing, calcium phosphate oversaturation, precipitation and, finally, calcification. Administration of sodium thiosulfate, which sequesters calcium ions to form highly soluble calcium thiosulfate complexes, can prevent calcium phosphate precipitation. As randomized controlled studies on sodium thiosulfate are lacking, this Perspectives article focuses on case reports and case series; in these reports the compound seemed to be effective and was not associated with serious short-term adverse events. Large clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of sodium thiosulfate are clearly warranted.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1133xnWv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol or codeine as background analgesia as they can rarely be titrated to effect in this population without opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Once pain is stable, transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine may be used in place of opioids by continuous subcutaneous infusion. If the lesions heal and pain resolves it is important to reduce the opioids step by step and aim to withdraw them fully.

To address the neuropathic element of pain secondary to calciphylaxis, gabapentin 100 mg after each haemodialysis session or pregabalin 25 mg after each haemodialysis session may be used in conjunction with opioids. If the patient is not on haemodialysis, start with a dose of 100 mg of gabapentin on alternate days or 25 mg of pregabalin on alternate days. Caution is needed as gabapentinoids accumulate in ESRD though they are removed by dialysis.

Discuss the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the nephrology team as they are very effective for the management of the inflammatory aspect of pain secondary to calciphylaxis. If residual renal function is not important, use an oral or parenteral NSAID (e.g. ketorolac) by continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain that is not controlled with the measures outlined above. Cover with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended. In general, NSAIDs are best used at the minimally effective dose and for a short duration but their harms are weighed against their opioid sparing effect.

If background pain remains problematic or dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, consider the addition of methadone as a co-analgesic or rotation to methadone from the current opioid. This step may require hospice inpatient care and should only be undertaken with specialist palliative care guidance.

Breakthrough pain control

Even when background pain control is achieved, the patient may continue to experience spontaneous breakthrough pain. Oxycodone 1–2 mg may be used by oral or by subcutaneous injection on a four hourly to 6 hourly basis. In countries where hydromorphone is available, 0.5 mg of hydromorphone sublingually four hourly is useful.

### Calciphylaxis [^1157HjnX]. Dermatologic Clinics (2008). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is defined by the presence of calcium deposits within the wall of small and medium-sized vessels. It is classically considered a life-threatening disease in patients with end-stage renal disease under dialysis. Clinically, it is characterized by the presence of painful plaques surrounded by a reticulate purpura that progresses to nonhealing ulcers, predominately in the lower limbs. It is associated with elevated parathyroid hormone levels and a dysregulation of the calcium/phosphate metabolism. In the absence of renal disease, normal parathyroid hormone levels, and calcium/phosphorus product, a good prognosis and the observation of similar calcium deposits associated with different conditions or even an epiphenomenon in diseases with well-known diagnosis leads one to consider the term calciphylaxis controversial.

### Success of small-dose fractionated sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of calciphylaxis in a peritoneal dialysis patient [^117X9Je7]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Calciphylaxis is a severe vascular disease mainly characterized by systemic small artery calcification combined with endothelial destruction and thrombosis that can affect the skin and other organs. The injured skin site is usually accompanied by stubborn pain, which can progress to ulcers and ischemic necrosis of the surrounding tissues. The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis is not yet clear, and there is no approved therapy for it. The mortality rate is high due to sepsis and internal organ failure, so active treatment should be initiated once diagnosed. A multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach is considered crucial in the treatment of calciphylaxis. Retrospective data reveal that sodium thiosulfate is promising as a potent calcium chelator, antioxidant, and vasodilator for the treatment of calciphylaxis, but there is no significant clinical benefit. In addition, the optimal duration, dose, and frequency of off-label administration of STS for patients receiving peritoneal dialysis are unclear. Prospective studies are urgently needed to define the optimal treatment approach. We report here a case of a 40-year-old Chinese male ESRD patient on peritoneal dialysis, who was successfully treated by low-dose and split-course intravenous STS for calciphylaxis with skin lesions.

### Removing the problem: parathyroidectomy for calciphylaxis [^111PF3zh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), widely known as calciphylaxis, is a rare and lethal disease that usually affects patients with end-stage renal disease. It is characterised by widespread vascular calcification leading to tissue ischaemia and necrosis and formation of characteristic skin lesions with black eschar. Treatment options include sodium thiosulfate, cinacalcet, phosphate binders and in resistant cases, parathyroidectomy. We report a case of recurrent, treatment-resistant CUA successfully treated with parathyroidectomy. Her postoperative course was complicated by hungry bone syndrome and worsening of her wounds before they completely healed. We then discuss the morbidity of CUA, including the controversy around the use of parathyroidectomy and risk of aggressive management of hungry bone syndrome.

### Early diagnosis and intervention of calciphylaxis leading to rapid resolution [^115vHMuj]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prompt recognition and diagnosis of calciphylaxis in these 3 patients led to rapid multi-disciplinary intervention with significant clinical improvement despite the patients' risk factors typically associated with a poor prognosis, including ESRD, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and warfarin use. Calciphylaxis has recently been reported to have a misdiagnosis rate as high as 73% with cellulitis being the most common misdiagnosis. The clinical presentation of calciphylaxis may vary, and early lesions can be erythematous or violaceous, and painful. As vascular occlusion progresses, ischemic changes can present as livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, ulceration, and tissue necrosis. Failure to improve with antibiotic treatment and severely painful and progressing skin lesions were important indicators of an alternative diagnosis in the first case, necessitating dermatological assessment. Furthermore, the second case presented an early diagnostic challenge with initial findings concerning for hematologic malignancy and excisional skin biopsy demonstrating amyloidosis. A skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of calciphylaxis in uncertain presentations. There are risks associated with skin biopsy, such as worsening pain, lesion progression, and false-positive and -negative histologic diagnosis. A repeat punch biopsy 1 month after the first biopsy resulted in a confirmatory diagnosis of calciphylaxis, which led to immediate intervention.

While the specific interventions of IV STS, pentoxifylline, apixaban, and wound and pain management are mostly supported by smaller case series or retrospective studies, they appear to be effective early interventions, although more research is conducted on the topic. Adjunctive treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and nutrition management may also be considered in these patients for further improvement. Clinical indications of a rapid response to therapy included the prompt reduction in pain, decrease in lesion size and number, resolution of purpura, cessation of ulcer propagation, and formation of new granulation tissue. While calciphylaxis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, early diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment initiation is an important intervention, as more research on treatment is underway.

### Calciphylaxis [^116yQA7E]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a disease in which metastatic calcification affects small- and medium-sized vessels resulting in significant dermatologic manifestations. Lesions typically occur over areas of high fat content and progress to black leathery eschars. Calciphylaxis is associated with intense pain and markedly increased risk of infection, often leading to sepsis requiring hospitalization. Diagnosis is made by clinical history and skin biopsy. Management of calciphylaxis is interdisciplinary, emphasizing factors such as primary prevention, proper wound care, pain control, and hormone and mineral balance. Although calciphylaxis carries a high mortality rate, symptomatic treatment has shown promise as a method for controlling disease progression.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JyoKW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Calciphylaxis is a rare but serious disorder of vascular calcification typically presenting with painful skin ulcerations that predominantly affects patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is no approved therapy for calciphylaxis. A 2022 meta-analysis of 6 clinical trialsconcluded that intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) could attenuate the progression of macrovascular calcification (in the coronary and iliac arteries) among hemodialysis patients. However, although STS has been used as an off-label therapeutic in calciphylaxis to improve pain and accelerate wound healing since 2004, there has been no data available from a clinical trial to inform its efficacy and safety. Many observational studies reporting the effectiveness of STS in patients with calciphylaxis lack a comparator arm, thus limiting the interpretation of their findings. To overcome this limitation, we performed a meta-analysis limited to cohort studies that provided data comparing outcomes among patients experiencing calciphylaxis treated with (intervention) and without (comparator) intravenous STS.

### Calciphylaxis: part I. diagnosis and pathology [^112u3wTZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is an uncommon but devastating disorder characterized by vascular calcification and subsequent cutaneous tissue necrosis. This results in exquisitely painful and slow healing wounds that portend exceptionally high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of this condition can be complicated because there are no conclusive serologic, radiographic or visual signs that this disease is manifesting. The differential of tissue necrosis is broad, and identifying calciphylaxis requires an adroit understanding of the risk factors and physical signs that should raise suspicion of this condition. Reviews on this subject are uncommon and lack directed commentary from disease experts on the best diagnostic approach for patients suffering from this disease. The goal of this article is to update practicing dermatologists on the current standard of care for calciphylaxis.

### Penile gangrene due to calciphylaxis: a multidisciplinary approach to a complex clinical challenge [^112yjLRN]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Penile calciphylaxis is a rare but clinically challenging condition to manage. While multiple treatment options have been proposed, the underlying evidence is anecdotal, and the overall prognosis remains extremely poor. We describe the case of a patient who underwent urgent debridement of a suspected gangrenous penile tip, who was intraoperatively found to have penile calciphylaxis. The necrosis progressed and the patient had a glans amputation. A non-healing wound developed, requiring reconstruction with two skin grafts using foreskin by the plastic and reconstructive surgical unit. The patient was commenced on sodium thiosulfate and his wound had completely healed 2months following his last operation. We review the literature to determine the biochemical features, management options and outcomes in patients with penile calciphylaxis.

### Intravenous sodium thiosulphate for calciphylaxis of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132WV18]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is intravenous sodium thiosulphate (STS) treatment associated with improvement in skin lesions and survival in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experiencing calciphylaxis?

Findings

This meta-analysis of 19 cohort studies examining STS treatment for patients with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis did not show an association between intravenous STS and skin lesion improvement or survival benefits compared with non-STS group.

Meaning

These results suggest that studies of intravenous STS on patients with CKD experiencing calciphylaxis have not found an improvement in skin lesion outcomes or survival. Future studies that rigorously evaluate therapies applied to patients with calciphylaxis are urgently needed.

### Intralesional sodium thiosulfate for the treatment of calciphylaxis [^113L5Eqk]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Calciphylaxis is a potentially fatal disorder of abnormal calcium deposition. Patients commonly present with painful retiform to stellate purpuric lesions that often undergo ulceration and necrosis, increasing the risk of infection and life-threatening sepsis. Treatment is multifaceted, and improved outcomes have been demonstrated with intravenous sodium thiosulfate; however, the use of this medication can be limited by its adverse effects. The use of topical sodium thiosulfate has been successfully reported for superficial calcium deposits in the skin from other processes. Therefore, we hypothesized that intralesional (IL) sodium thiosulfate may be an effective treatment for the deeper lesions of cutaneous calciphylaxis. We provide a retrospective case review of 4 patients with calciphylaxis who were treated with IL sodium thiosulfate.

Observations

Four patients with biopsy-proven cutaneous calciphylaxis were treated with IL sodium thiosulfate (250 mg/mL) in areas of clinically active disease. The patients tolerated the medication well, with only transient localized discomfort during injection. All 4 patients had complete healing of their ulcers and remission of disease.

Conclusions and Relevance

Intralesional sodium thiosulfate may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for localized calciphylaxis. This novel approach requires further research and investigation.
