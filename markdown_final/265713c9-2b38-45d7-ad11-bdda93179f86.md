## Question

How to replenish magnesium orally outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to replenish magnesium orally in the outpatient setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when oral therapy is appropriate versus intravenous therapy. Then, I should determine an initial elemental magnesium dose and choose the salt formulation. Next, I will consider patient-specific modifiers, dosing schedule, and titration strategy. After that, I need to plan monitoring intervals and labs. Finally, I should address drug interactions, contraindications, special populations, and patient counseling, while continuously verifying evidence quality and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm when oral magnesium is appropriate and when it is not. For asymptomatic or mildly hypomagnesemic patients with preserved gastrointestinal function and normal renal function, oral replacement is reasonable. For symptomatic patients with neuromuscular or cardiovascular manifestations, intravenous magnesium is indicated, and oral therapy should not be used initially, especially if arrhythmias or seizures are present [^111VUBdM] [^114BTohQ]. Wait, I should verify renal function as a key determinant; if eGFR is reduced, I need to lower the dose and monitor closely due to risk of hypermagnesemia, particularly when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1129nQW6] [^11792QQw].

> Now, I will establish a baseline elemental dose range. Let me think about the typical therapeutic window: most trials and guidelines operationalize 300–600 mg elemental magnesium per day for repletion or prophylaxis, with 400–600 mg being commonly used for migraine prevention and general supplementation in adults with normal renal function [^113VS8oT] [^112ZYsGw]. I should double-check the safety ceiling; the Work Group notes that toxicity risk rises at very high daily doses, so I should avoid exceeding 600 mg elemental magnesium daily unless there is a compelling indication and close monitoring, especially in those with reduced eGFR [^113VS8oT].

> Next, I should review formulation choice and bioavailability because this materially affects tolerability and efficacy. Organic salts like magnesium citrate, gluconate, and aspartate have better absorption and solubility than inorganic magnesium oxide, which is less bioavailable and more likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects at higher doses, although it is inexpensive and widely available [^117VdF5t] [^116xXJZq]. Hold on, I should verify special cases; in pregnancy trials, magnesium citrate 300 mg elemental once daily was used successfully with acceptable tolerability, and citrate's high solubility may mitigate GI upset, which supports choosing citrate when feasible in ambulatory care [^115CzZ1b] [^111N6zZ2].

> I need to ensure patient-specific factors are incorporated before finalizing the dose. For older adults, I should start at the lower end of the range and titrate cautiously because absorption may decline with age and renal function commonly falls, increasing hypermagnesemia risk [^1143tK5n]. For those with chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, I should anticipate reduced absorption and consider higher elemental doses or divided dosing, while monitoring closely for efficacy and tolerance [^117PqpLC]. But wait, what if the patient is on a PPI; I should confirm PPI use because long-term PPI therapy can impair intestinal magnesium absorption, and in some cases the most effective strategy is PPI withdrawal rather than escalating oral magnesium, which may not normalize serum magnesium despite high doses [^114BTohQ] [^111U1C6G].

> Let me consider the dosing schedule and titration. Dividing the total daily dose into two or three administrations with meals can reduce GI side effects and may improve net absorption, though I should acknowledge that formal dose-fractionation data are limited and practice varies by formulation and tolerance [^notfound]. I should confirm that we titrate based on symptoms and repeat serum magnesium after 1–2 weeks, adjusting the dose in 100–200 mg elemental increments to reach a target serum magnesium around 2.0–2.2 mg/dL, recognizing that serum magnesium reflects less than 1% of total body stores and may lag behind clinical improvement [^117VdF5t].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will now examine the cadence: recheck serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium at 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3 months once stable, and sooner if symptoms or interacting drugs change. Concurrently, I should assess renal function at baseline and periodically, especially if eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and reduce the dose by about 50% when eGFR is 10–30 and use extreme caution if eGFR is below 10, with frequent monitoring for hypermagnesemia [^1129nQW6] [^11792QQw]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overpromising normalization timelines; in chronic deficiency, especially with ongoing losses, normalization can take weeks to months, so I need to set expectations and monitor for coexisting electrolyte disturbances like hypokalemia and hypocalcemia that can complicate repletion [^111VUBdM].

> I will now examine drug–nutrient interactions that can impair absorption or efficacy. Bisphosphonates such as risedronate should be separated from magnesium-containing supplements by at least 30 minutes to avoid chelation and reduced absorption, and tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones should likewise be spaced apart from magnesium to prevent complexation and impaired antimicrobial exposure [^112WGx8s]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought PPIs directly chelate magnesium and reduce absorption that way; let me reconsider and correct that — PPIs impair active intestinal magnesium transport rather than forming nonabsorbable complexes, which explains why oral magnesium may fail despite high doses unless the PPI is stopped [^114BTohQ] [^111U1C6G].

> I should confirm contraindications and precautions. Severe renal impairment requires dose reduction and vigilant monitoring for hypermagnesemia, and in end-stage kidney disease, oral magnesium is often avoided unless there is a compelling indication and specialist oversight [^11792QQw]. For patients with chronic diarrhea or IBD, oral magnesium may worsen diarrhea and may be less effective due to losses; in such cases, I should consider lower divided doses, alternative salts, or even parenteral repletion if deficiency is severe or refractory, balancing risks and benefits [^117PqpLC]. I need to ensure that symptomatic patients with arrhythmias or seizures are not managed with oral magnesium alone, as IV therapy is indicated acutely in those scenarios [^111VUBdM].

> Let me think about special populations and conditions. In pregnancy, magnesium citrate 300 mg elemental once daily has been used safely in trials, and general magnesium requirements during pregnancy are commonly cited as 220–500 mg/day, though I should individualize dosing and monitor per obstetric protocols and renal status [^115CzZ1b] [^112vnDga]. For migraine prophylaxis, 400–600 mg elemental magnesium daily is supported by guideline and systematic review evidence, with modest benefit and generally favorable tolerability in patients with normal renal function, so I should screen for kidney disease before recommending chronic high-dose supplementation [^113VS8oT] [^112ZYsGw]. For chronic idiopathic constipation, magnesium oxide 500 mg to 1 g daily is a reasonable first-line option with RCT support and favorable cost and tolerability, though I should confirm renal function and watch for diarrhea at higher doses [^113gUKG8] [^113oK2Mn].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence during active repletion. Initially, I said to recheck magnesium at 1–2 weeks and then every 3 months. Hold on, I should verify that in higher-risk patients or during dose escalations, more frequent checks every 2–4 weeks are prudent until stable, especially if there are interacting drugs, renal impairment, or ongoing GI losses, and I should always interpret magnesium alongside potassium and calcium given their physiologic coupling and the risk of refractory hypokalemia in hypomagnesemia [^111VUBdM] [^117VdF5t].

> Next, I should review patient counseling points to improve adherence and safety. I need to ensure the patient understands expected benefits and timelines, common GI side effects such as diarrhea and cramping that are dose-related, and the importance of separating magnesium from interacting medications like bisphosphonates and certain antibiotics; I should also advise taking doses with meals to reduce GI upset and remind patients with CKD to use lower doses and keep appointments for lab monitoring [^116xXJZq] [^112WGx8s] [^1129nQW6]. But wait, I should also counsel on when to seek urgent care — symptoms such as severe muscle weakness, palpitations, or confusion warrant prompt evaluation because they may reflect severe electrolyte disturbances or hypermagnesemia, particularly in those with renal impairment [^111VUBdM].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses underlying causes and reassessment. Concurrent correction of hypokalemia and hypocalcemia improves neuromuscular and cardiac outcomes, and identifying and removing offending agents such as PPIs, loop or thiazide diuretics, or nephrotoxic drugs can be decisive for durable correction; in select diabetic patients with persistent hypomagnesemia, SGLT2 inhibitors have emerging evidence for increasing serum magnesium, though this remains investigational and should be coordinated with the treating specialist [^111VUBdM] [^114BTohQ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if oral therapy fails despite adherence and adequate dosing, I should reassess for ongoing losses, malabsorption, or unrecognized drug effects and consider specialist referral or alternative repletion strategies rather than simply escalating to unsafe oral doses [^114BTohQ].

Oral magnesium replacement is appropriate for **asymptomatic or mildly hypomagnesemic patients** with normal renal function [^111VUBdM], using **300–600 mg elemental magnesium daily** [^113VS8oT] in divided doses with food to enhance absorption and reduce GI upset [^notfound]. Magnesium citrate or glycinate are preferred for their **higher bioavailability and tolerability** [^117VdF5t] [^116xXJZq], while magnesium oxide is less bioavailable but useful for constipation [^113gUKG8]. Monitor serum magnesium and renal function at baseline and periodically; reduce dose or switch to IV therapy if symptoms develop or renal function declines [^111VUBdM]. Address underlying causes and drug interactions (e.g. PPIs, diuretics) to prevent recurrence [^114BTohQ].

## Indications for oral magnesium replacement

Oral magnesium replacement is indicated for **asymptomatic or mildly hypomagnesemic patients** with normal renal function [^notfound]. It is not appropriate for symptomatic patients or those with severe hypomagnesemia, who require intravenous magnesium therapy [^111VUBdM].

---

## Recommended oral magnesium formulations and dosing

Several oral magnesium formulations are available, each with different **bioavailability, tolerability, and clinical indications**:

| **Formulation** | **Elemental magnesium content** | **Bioavailability** | **Clinical indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Magnesium citrate | 60–120 mg per capsule/tablet | High | - General supplementation <br/> - Mild hypomagnesemia <br/> - Constipation |
| Magnesium glycinate | 50–100 mg per capsule/tablet | High | - General supplementation <br/> - Mild hypomagnesemia <br/> - Minimal GI side effects |
| Magnesium oxide | 120–240 mg per capsule/tablet | Low | - Constipation <br/> - Acid reflux |
| Magnesium gluconate | 27–54 mg per capsule/tablet | Moderate | - General supplementation <br/> - Mild hypomagnesemia |
| Magnesium chloride | 60–120 mg per capsule/tablet | Moderate | - General supplementation <br/> - Mild hypomagnesemia |

---

The **recommended dosing** is 300–600 mg elemental magnesium daily [^notfound], divided into two or three doses with meals to enhance absorption and minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral magnesium replacement

Oral magnesium supplementation effectively increases **serum magnesium levels** in patients with mild hypomagnesemia [^111V2ddQ]. A randomized controlled trial showed that **oral magnesium citrate (300 mg/day)** significantly increased serum magnesium levels in pregnant women without significant adverse effects [^notfound]. Another study found that oral magnesium supplementation improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in patients with **type 2 diabetes** and low serum magnesium levels [^111V2ddQ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing oral magnesium replacement

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the choice and dosing of oral magnesium supplements:

- **Renal function**: Patients with impaired renal function require careful monitoring and dose adjustments to prevent hypermagnesemia [^113VS8oT].
- **Gastrointestinal conditions**: Patients with chronic diarrhea or malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses or alternative formulations due to reduced absorption [^117PqpLC].
- **Age**: Elderly patients may have reduced renal function and increased risk of hypermagnesemia, necessitating lower doses and closer monitoring [^notfound].
- **Medication interactions**: Proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, and certain antibiotics can affect magnesium absorption and excretion, requiring dose adjustments and monitoring [^115rs3sE].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** is essential to ensure safe and effective magnesium replacement:

- **Serum magnesium levels**: Monitor at baseline, 1–2 weeks after initiation, and periodically thereafter.
- **Renal function**: Monitor serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) regularly, especially in patients with impaired renal function [^1118T7uX].
- **Clinical symptoms**: Monitor for symptoms of hypermagnesemia (e.g. muscle weakness, bradycardia, respiratory depression) and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

Oral magnesium supplementation is generally well tolerated, but **gastrointestinal side effects** (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping) are common, particularly with magnesium oxide [^116xXJZq]. Hypermagnesemia is rare but can occur in patients with impaired renal function or excessive intake [^1129nQW6]. Contraindications include severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity to magnesium-containing products, and certain cardiac conditions.

---

## Comparison with intravenous magnesium replacement

Oral magnesium replacement is preferred for asymptomatic or mildly hypomagnesemic patients due to its convenience, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Intravenous magnesium replacement is reserved for symptomatic patients, those with severe hypomagnesemia, or those unable to tolerate oral therapy [^111VUBdM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of identifying and addressing underlying causes of hypomagnesemia, such as medication-induced losses or chronic illnesses [^114BTohQ]. They also recommend regular monitoring of serum magnesium and renal function during replacement therapy [^notfound].

---

Oral magnesium replacement is effective for **asymptomatic or mildly hypomagnesemic patients** with normal renal function [^111VUBdM]. Magnesium citrate or glycinate are preferred due to their high bioavailability and tolerability [^111N6zZ2]. Regular monitoring and addressing underlying causes are essential for successful management [^114BTohQ].

Acute liver failure (ALF) — nutritional and metabolic support: Energy expenditure increases by 18%–30% compared with healthy controls, and it is recommended that ALF patients receive nutritional support if not expected to resume oral intake in a 5- to 7-day period. Oral nutrition can be considered with mild mental status changes; otherwise enteral support is preferred. Protein administration of 1.0–1.5 gm/kg/d is recommended, though in severe hyperammonemia (> 150 µmol/L) and HE, consideration can be given to delaying supplementation for the first 24–48 hours and restarting at a lower range (1.0 gm/kg/day) with close ammonia monitoring. For hypoglycemia, a constant infusion of dextrose 10% is recommended, and magnesium and phosphorus should be monitored every 8–12 hours. Key concepts emphasize monitoring and correction of glucose, fluid, and electrolytes, and to start enteral nutrition if oral intake cannot resume within 5–7 days.

### Oral magnesium improves outcomes in patients with CAD… [^115WUFLL]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term studies have shown that oral magnesium supplements improve endothelial function. It is less clear if this effect improves outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease. Shechter and associates compared the effect of oral magnesium with placebo on CAD outcomes by measuring exercise tolerance, exercise-induced ischemia, and quality of life. Using a randomized, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 187 participants older than 20 years with stable CAD, twice-daily oral magnesium supplementation was compared with placebo. Patients continued all other medications and routine diet habits during the six-month study. Baseline magnesium levels were similar between the two groups but increased significantly in the participants receiving magnesium supplementation. The treatment group had a significant improvement in exercise duration compared with no change in the placebo group.

There was a significant decrease in exercise-induced chest pain and ST-segment depression at peak exercise in the treatment group. Most quality-of-life parameters also improved in the treatment group. There were no significant differences noted in lipid levels in either group after six months. There was no increase in adverse events in the treatment group. The authors conclude that in a patient group already receiving near-optimal care for CAD, magnesium therapy improved cardiac exercise tolerance, exercise-induced chest pain, and quality of life. Potential mechanisms that may be responsible for this beneficial effect include improved intracellular adenosine triphosphate production, enhanced control of intracellular calcium changes, reduced systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, reduced arteriolar tone, and mild reduction of systolic blood pressure. It also is possible that CAD may be associated with excessive magnesium loss and relative magnesium deficiency.

Magnesium should be used as adjuvant therapy in patients with CAD.

### Magnesium and disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism [^113zyGpZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Magnesium is actively involved in a number of metabolic reactions as an important co-factor, with special emphasis on carbohydrate metabolism. After a brief overview of the regulation of intra- and extracellular magnesium, the present review first describes the regulatory role of magnesium in important metabolic pathways involved in energy metabolism and glycaemic control. Next the clinical significance of hypomagnesaemic conditions with regard to the management of glucose in prediabetic stages, such as insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance and in type 2 diabetes mellitus are characterized. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies suggest that a reduced dietary magnesium intake serves as a risk factor for the incidence of both impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes. Mechanisms that might be responsible for diabetes-associated hypomagnesaemia are discussed. Furthermore, the role of hypomagnesaemia in the development and progression of chronic diabetic complications are addressed. Finally, the available literature on the effects of magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control parameters during prediabetic conditions (preventive approach) as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus (therapeutic approach) are reviewed systematically. There is considerable evidence that chronic magnesium supplementation may delay the progression from impaired glucose regulation to type 2 diabetes; however, the effects of oral magnesium supplementation as an adjunct therapy for type 2 diabetes are quite heterogeneous with respect to the various measures of glycaemic control. The results of this review suggest a requirement for critical consideration of the pros and cons of magnesium replacement therapy, based on variables such as magnesium status, stage of disease and glycaemic control.

### Hydration methods for cisplatin containing chemotherapy: a systematic review [^1166ZbTe]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) can be prevented by fluid hydration, electrolyte supplementation, or forced diuresis; however, the best way to prevent CIN is still unknown. The aim of this study was to provide objective evidence on the optimal design of hydration schemes to prevent CIN based on an update of the literature.

Methods

A Pubmed and Embase search were conducted in December 2021 and repeated in April 2022 and March 2023. Two independent reviewers screened the articles. The included articles were categorized and reviewed per category.

Results

Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The included studies varied widely. Four out of seven studies investigating diuretics found a protective effect of adding mannitol to the hydration scheme. All six studies investigating duration and amount of volume of hydration found that a short-hydration scheme resulted in less CIN than a longer hydration scheme. Seven out of nine articles evaluating the role of electrolytes found that magnesium supplementation reduced the risk of nephrotoxicity. Three studies investigated the safety of oral hydration and concluded that nephrotoxicity did not occur more frequently after oral hydration.

Conclusion

The hydration scheme of cisplatin should be short and consist of a relatively small amount of volume. The scheme should include mannitol and magnesium supplementation. Head-to-head studies are needed to investigate the safety of furosemide compared with mannitol and the dose of mannitol and magnesium.

### Combined calcium, magnesium and potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults [^111FxDr4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (n = 277) with between 24 and 28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium & magnesium, calcium & magnesium, and calcium & potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium & magnesium and of calcium & potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the combination of potassium & magnesium. None of the trials provided data on mortality or morbidity. The combination of potassium & magnesium compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I(2) = 68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively). A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0). The quality of the trials was not well reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium & magnesium is effective.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^116xXJZq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Magnesium supplementation is recognized as a potentially effective alternative prophylactic treatment. The Canadian Headache Society (CHS) guideline for migraine prophylaxis strongly endorses its use for migraine prevention as both a standalone intervention for mild migraines and a non‐pharmacological co‐intervention for treatment‐refractory or more severe migraines. Magnesium, a crucial intracellular ion, is involved in numerous physiological processes, including energy production, protein synthesis, stabilization of mitochondrial membranes, and muscle function. Its role in neuronal excitability is particularly relevant to migraine, as it potentially causes a phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression.

Common types of magnesium supplements include magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium gluconate, magnesium aspartate, magnesium threonate, and magnesium bisglycinate, among others. Diarrhea and gastrointestinal discomfort are the most common adverse reactions observed with magnesium supplementation, and their occurrence and intensity are dose‐related, providing an indication of the maximum tolerable intake level. Studies exploring the effects of a 12‐week regimen of 600 mg of magnesium daily have found that migraines occurred less often than in participants who received only placebo. In children, a study that tested magnesium supplementation with magnesium oxide, at a daily dosage of 9 mg/kg three times a day for a minimum of four weeks, found equivocal evidence.

Why it is important to do this review

Migraine patients often explore complementary therapies to improve their quality of life, with many incorporating clinical supplementation. This is primarily due to issues with current pharmacological preventive treatment for migraine, which often has limited efficacy and has adverse effect profiles that many people poorly tolerate; for instance, response rates are relatively low, ranging from a 40% to 50% reduction in migraine attacks, frequency, and severity, and may be accompanied by substantial side effects, like paresthesia (tingling or numbness), fatigue, weight changes, and cognitive effects. In contrast, several nutraceuticals and supplements, such as magnesium, show promising efficacy in migraine prophylaxis and generally possess a more favorable safety profile. Perceptions of the side effects of preventive medications can influence people's willingness to use them. A study revealed that less than 60% of participants were willing to take preventive medications even if they offered a 50% reduction in headache frequency, primarily due to concerns about side effects. This suggests that the perceived safety and tolerability of supplements may be a significant factor in patients' decisions to opt for these alternatives. Therefore, this review of magnesium supplementation as a preventive treatment may have significant implications for patients, clinicians, policymakers, and healthcare systems.

### Magnesium biology [^114BTohQ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Therapeutics for magnesium disorders

Classic treatment of hypomagnesemia relies on Mg 2+ supplementation, either orally or intravenously depending on the severity of the disease. Moreover, clinicians may treat common underlying causes, such as alcoholism and diabetes mellitus, or halt the prescription of hypomagnesemia-causing drugs. The gold standard of treatment for PPI-induced hypomagnesemia is the withdrawal of PPIs. Within days after termination of PPI therapy, serum Mg 2+ levels reach a normal level in most patients. In contrast, oral Mg 2+ supplementation does not improve serum Mg 2+ levels even at high doses. A treatment approach that has been gaining attention over the last years is the use of prebiotics. Inulin fibers have been demonstrated to increase serum Mg 2+ levels in PPI users. To what extent this treatment is of benefit for patients with other causes of hypomagnesemia remains to be determined in future research.

In recent years, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have gained increasing attention as potential treatment opportunity for hypomagnesemia. SGLT2 is expressed in the PT, where it is responsible for the reabsorption of glucose. Large clinical trials examining the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors for treatment of diabetes or cardiovascular defects, concomitantly demonstrated increased serum Mg 2+ levels. One case even showed that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors were more efficient in replenishing Mg 2+ levels compared with oral Mg 2+ supplementation.

Recently, several case reports have been published in which non-diabetic individuals were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, resulting in significantly increased serum Mg 2+ levels. As a result, the patients were able to decrease the dosage of their Mg 2+ supplementation. This provides first evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors are not only of use in diabetic patients but also in hypomagnesemia patients with normal glucose metabolism. However, clinical trials need to be performed to confirm this effect.

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^11483htZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Aim

Hypomagnesaemia has been reported associated with long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. However, there have been no studies in Japanese patients. We therefore assessed the effects of long-term PPI use on serum magnesium concentrations in Japanese patients.

Methods

Data from 481 outpatients who visited our centre in October and November 2011 were reviewed to determine their underlying diseases, oral medications, including PPIs, and serum magnesium concentrations. The association between PPI use and serum Mg concentrations was assessed by multiple linear regression analysis.

Results

Serum magnesium concentrations were significantly lower in PPI users (n = 199) than in PPI non-users (n = 282; 1.86 ± 0.21 vs 1.91 ± 0.19 mg/dL, p < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the presence or absence of cirrhosis and PPI use was a significant predictor of magnesium concentration. In evaluating magnesium concentrations among PPI users and non-users with and without cirrhosis, we found that mean serum magnesium concentrations in patients with cirrhosis were significantly lower in PPI users than non-users (1.78 ± 0.22 vs 1.87 ± 0.22 mg/dL, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Outpatients receiving long-term PPI treatment had significantly lower serum magnesium concentrations than those not treated with PPI. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show hypomagnesaemia in Japanese patients with cirrhosis receiving long-term PPI treatment.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^1145Pbnc]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Micronutrient deficiency is common in patients with DC. Vitamin D levels should be checked and supplemented if low in line with local protocols. Specific evidence about the beneficial effect of other micronutrients and vitamin supplementation in cirrhotic patients is not available. However, confirmed or clinically suspected deficiency should be treated(including calcium, magnesium, phosphate, iron, B 12 and folate). Oral thiamine (100 mg two times per day) should be supplemented in all patients who continue to drink alcohol. As vitamin status is not easily assessed and multivitamin supplementation is cheap and substantially side effect free, a course of oral multivitamin supplementation could be justified in decompensated patients.

Physical activity can contribute to improving muscle mass and function. Nutritional stability must be achieved prior to initiating exercise. Movement can start at a low baseline with normal daily activities. Endurance exercise such as walking and cycling can support muscle functional capacity and resistance exercise can increase muscle mass. Therefore, a combination of endurance and resistance exercise is most beneficial. Simple exercises such as sit to stand can be a good first step.

### Torsades de pointes in the PACU after outpatient endoscopy: a case report [^113b6Rgx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic assessment

Stat EKG revealed inverted T waves, prominent U waves, and a prolonged QTc of > 600 milliseconds (Fig. 1). The rhythm strip from her earlier episode of presumed SVT was able to be retrieved (Fig. 2) and was consistent with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes). Two grams of IV magnesium was initiated. Laboratory evaluation revealed a potassium level of 2.4 mmol/L (critically low; Normal 3.5–4.5), phosphorus of 1.0 mg/dL (low; Normal 0.97–1.45), ionized calcium 1.04 mmol/L (low; Normal 1.2–1.32), magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL (normal 1.6–2.4), glucose 144 mg/dL (normal fasting level 60–100). Chest radiograph obtained and was normal. The diagnoses of severe hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and suspected acquired long QT syndrome were made. The prognosis of those conditions is favorable with electrolyte repletion and avoidance of QT prolonging medications.

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^113wUasy]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PPIs are frequently used in everyday medical practice. PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia may be life threatening in some patients. Some patients with PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic, and this may be overlooked because of lack of information. Thus, we recommend that serum magnesium concentrations be measured periodically in outpatients receiving long-term PPI treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show an association between long-term PPI treatment and hypomagnesaemia in patients with cirrhosis. It is necessary to recognise the possibility of hypomagnesaemia when treating cirrhosis patients with PPIs.

Supportive care for alcohol withdrawal in jails — supportive care is appropriate for all levels of alcohol withdrawal severity and may include nutritional supplementation, IV fluids, glucose, management of electrolyte abnormalities, and periodic clinical reassessments, as clinically indicated; if dehydration is an ongoing concern and the jail does not have the capacity to manage IV fluids, the patient should be transferred to a facility that does. Alcohol use can be associated with vitamin and mineral deficiencies; to reduce the risk of encephalopathy, all patients with suspected AUD should be treated with thiamine, 100 mg daily, either orally or intramuscularly for 3–5 days, and other vitamin and mineral supplementation (e.g., magnesium, folate) should be considered, as determined by the treating provider.

### Brazil magnesium (BRAMAG) trial: a double-masked randomized clinical trial of oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^112vnDga]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year 15 million children are born preterm before 37 weeks' gestation. Prematurity is a leading cause of death in the neonatal period, and the second most common cause in children under age five years. Preterm has immediate and long-term implications for the child, including cerebral palsy, learning difficulties and visual and hearing impairment. The ensuing social and economic costs are great.

Brazil is among the top-10 countries with the highest number of premature births. For example, of the nearly 3 million births registered in the country in 2015, about 10.8% were preterm. In that same year, prematurity was the main cause of death in children under the age of five years. Furthermore, in 2016, a national study identified that the North and Northeast regions of Brazil had the highest rates of preterm birth, at 13.0 and 12.9%, respectively. Factors associated with prematurity in Brazil are higher social vulnerability — low income, adolescent pregnancy and limited high school education – as well as inadequate prenatal care, a high rate of cesarean delivery and preeclampsia.

Magnesium deficiency has been implicated in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Moreover, magnesium deficiency has been associated with an increased risk for gestational and adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertensive syndromes, leg cramps and preterm birth. Currently, there is no consensus about the daily requirements of magnesium during pregnancy, with recommendations vary between 220 mg to 500 mg per day. A recent meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials (RCT), comprising 9090 pregnancies, evaluated oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy. Therein, oral magnesium did not significantly reduce the risk of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality or small for gestational age birthweight (SGA). Magnesium was associated with higher newborn Apgar scores and less hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, as only two of the 10 RCTs were considered to be of higher quality, the authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence as to whether oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy is beneficial to mother or fetus. Additionally, the effect of magnesium supplementation in the prevention of prematurity has had conflicting results, perhaps partly due to different the different forms of magnesium assessed in those trials.

Magnesium citrate has a high solubility in water, favoring greater intestinal tract absorption and bioavailability compared to other preparations. Accordingly, the current study compared magnesium citrate with placebo in the prevention of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes among women at higher risk.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^111dcL9H]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) access and monitoring — Tunneled central venous catheters are preferred for long-term PN over peripherally inserted central venous catheters and over totally implanted devices because ports must be accessed and exchanged on a weekly basis; PN should be initiated and adjusted to meet fluid, electrolyte, energy, protein, and micronutrient needs, with monitoring of weight, laboratory results, stool or ostomy output, urine output, and thirst. When ostomy output is high, increased fluid, potassium, magnesium, and zinc losses occur and need replacement; the amount of PN can be decreased when oral intake is adequate without excessive output and with weight maintenance or gain. In some patients, parenteral fluids without macronutrients may be needed if stool output exceeds intake, and during hot summer months additional daytime intravenous fluids may be required to prevent dehydration, as patients on home PN remain at increased risk of fluid electrolyte abnormalities.

### How much magnesium sulfate is needed to "keep total serum magnesium above 2.0 mg / dL"? [^116VXdAa]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients at increased risk of life-threating ventricular arrythmias, hospitalists often administer intravenous magnesium sulfate to maintain total serum magnesium concentration (TsMg) above 2mg/dL. How long each dose keeps TsMg above this threshold is not well known, however. We collected TsMg values from 12,618 veterans who were given 24,363 doses of intravenous magnesium sulfate during 14,901 hospitalizations for acute heart failure. Across dose amounts, the average TsMg dropped below 2.0mg/dL within 24h of administration. When we limited our analysis to 2g doses (the most common dose) and adjusted for baseline TsMg, estimated glomerular filtration rate, oral magnesium supplementation, and loop diuretic dosing, we found that less than half of the adjusted TsMg values remained above 2.0mg/dL just 12h after dose administration. Hospitalists should expect, on average, to administer 2g intravenous magnesium sulfate at least twice daily to maintain total serum magnesium above 2mg/dL.

### Magnesium supplementation: a consideration in dialysis patients [^115ECqZt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Even though disorders of magnesium (Mg) balance are common in dialyzed patients, this cation is often neglected. Many factors interfere with serum magnesium including diet, medications (eg, antacids or phosphate binders), and the dialysis prescription. Mg supplementation may help reduce serum phosphate concentration, PTH, and interfere with vascular calcification and bone mineralization. It could also decrease the all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, although the results of current studies are conflicting. As with many other variables that influence hard endpoints in nephrology, additional research directly targeting the role of Mg supplementation in dialyzed patients are required. Nevertheless, a current risk/benefit assessment suggests that supplementation of Mg targeting high normal serum levels may represent a plausible option to improve the outcome of dialysis patients.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^111Fi758]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — initiation of calories for avoidance and treatment of refeeding syndrome (RS) in at-risk adults — states to "Initiate with 100–150 g of dextrose or 10–20 kcal/kg for the first 24 hours; advance by 33% of goal every 1 to 2 days. This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose". In patients "with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered", and "Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected". It adds that "Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS", and if a patient has had "significant amounts of dextrose for several days" with stable electrolytes, "calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above".

### MBX 2109, A once-weekly parathyroid hormone replacement therapy prodrug: phase 1, first-in-human, randomized trial [^113ujkVK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by parathyroid hormone (PTH) deficiency that results in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The altered mineral metabolism in hypoPT produces clinical manifestations in bone, kidneys, muscle, nerve, and heart that constitute a substantial burden of illness. Patients with hypoPT experience hypocalcemia and its attendant neuromuscular symptoms including pain, muscle cramps, numbness, and tingling.

Compared with the general population, patients with hypoPT also experience worsened cognitive and emotional functioning including general fatigue, lack of focus (ie, brain fog), anxiety and/or depression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

The standard of care for hypoPT is oral supplementation with calcium, active vitamin D analogues, and magnesium. Adherence to supplements can be difficult owing to the large number of pills needed daily due to the short-lived increases in serum calcium and/or magnesium. Large oral doses can increase fractional calcium excretion due to PTH deficiency leading to hypercalciuria, which is worsened by the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D–mediated increase in gastrointestinal calcium absorption, which increases the risk of kidney disorders.

### Long-term magnesium supplementation improves glucocorticoid metabolism: a post-hoc analysis of an intervention trial [^111ThknQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Major strengths of the present study include the double‐blinded placebo‐controlled design, as well as the long duration of the intervention trial. Another strength includes the use of 24‐h urinary cortisol and cortisone excretion and measurements of their metabolites, which allowed us to study underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the enzyme activity of intracellular 11β‐HSDs and A‐ring reductases can be quantified from 24‐h urine concentrations of cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites. This approach provides important insight into the intracellular regulation of glucocorticoids.

A potential limitation of our study is that we were not able to define effects of oral magnesium supplementation on the 11β‐HSD type 1 activity. The 11β‐HSD type 1 activity can only be inferred from the THFs/THE ratio when the cortisol/cortisone ratios is unchanged. 14 In the current study, the cortisol/cortisone ratio was changed after the treatment period in the magnesium group, which may imply an effect on whole‐body 11β‐HSD activity, rather than an effect on the specific 11β‐HSD type 1 activity. Second, licorice‐derivatives, such as glycyrrhizic acid, inhibit the enzymatic activity of 11β‐HSD type 2. Whether the intake of licorice has influenced our results, is not entirely clear, because no data on licorice intake were available. However, participants were requested not to change their dietary intake pattern during the study. Results from the food frequency questionnaires showed indeed that dietary intake (macro and micro‐nutrient intake) did not change during the study, suggesting that it is unlikely that licorice intake affected our results. 2 Furthermore, we could not differentiate whether the effect on glucocorticoid metabolism was due to supplementation of magnesium or due to potential effects of citrate. However, in our future study, we will address effects of different magnesium supplements (magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide and magnesium sulphate) on cardiovascular risk markers, including arterial stiffness and blood pressure. 38 Finally, as the post‐hoc analyses we performed are exploratory and hypothesis generating, the current findings should be interpreted with caution.

To conclude, we observed a beneficial effect of oral magnesium supplementation towards a lower 24‐h urinary cortisol excretion together with an increased activity of 11β‐HSD type 2. Our findings may indicate improved glucocorticoid metabolism induced by oral magnesium supplementation, suggesting a potential mechanism by which increased dietary magnesium intake lowers CVD risk. Our results provide a basis to further investigate effects of oral magnesium supplementation on CVD risk and underlying mechanisms.

Table 1
Pooled data from randomized clinical trials of oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes

Based on reference.

More recent data suggest that maternal Mg ++ supplementation in pregnancy may have other perinatal benefits. In a double-blind RCT, 4,494 South African black pregnant women of low socioeconomic status were randomized to receive daily 128 mg Mg ++ stearate slow-release or matching placebo. Treatment was begun after 22 weeks gestation in most women, and was sustained for a mean of about 28 days in both groups. The rate of preterm delivery was 11.4% in the placebo group and 11.7% in the Mg ++ group. The risk of the primary outcome of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was non-significantly lower in the Mg ++ group (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.35), but the overall event rate was lower than expected in both groups. Interestingly, the risk of 3rd-trimester stillbirth was lower in Mg ++ arm (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.87). The late initiation and limited duration of Mg ++ supplementation may have limited the evaluation of the efficacy of Mg ++ in this RCT.

As stated by others, there is not enough high quality evidence to show that Mg ++ supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial. Certainly, what is needed is an RCT that enrolls enough women at risk, at an early enough gestational age, for the remaining duration of the pregnancy, and that can assess both perinatal and maternal outcomes that matter, including not only preterm birth, but also SGA and preterm preeclampsia. Our proposed RCT will address these goals.

The proposed intervention: oral Mg ++ citrate supplementation in pregnancy

Mg ++ citrate is a widely used Mg ++ supplement: it is inexpensive, easily absorbed and rarely has a detectable laxative effect. It can be taken as a powder, or placed into standard-dose capsules. Mg ++ citrate has high solubility (55%) in water, in all states of gastric acid secretion. As demonstrated in one RCT, Mg ++ citrate appears to be the most bioavailable of all oral Mg ++ preparations. Thus, oral Mg ++ citrate is cheap, accessible, easy to manufacture. Thus, a programme of its use in pregnancy in low-middle income countries would be easy to initiate.

3.2 Twenty‐four‐hour urinary cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites

Effects on 24‐h urinary excretions of cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites are presented in Table 3. After 24‐week of magnesium supplementation, 24‐h urinary cortisol excretion showed a mean decrease of 32 nmol/24‐h in the magnesium group (95% CI: −59; −5 nmol/24‐h, p = .021). Mean 24‐h urinary THF and allo‐THF excretions were not significantly different between the groups after 24‐week (−0.5 μmol/24‐h, 95% CI: −1.2; 0.3 μmol/24‐h, p = .231 and −0.5 μmol/24‐h, 95% CI: −1.1; −0.0 μmol/24‐h, p = .065, respectively). Oral magnesium supplementation did not change 24‐h urinary cortisone and THE excretions after 24‐week (−1 nmol/24‐h, 95% CI: −38; 35 nmol/24‐h, p = .949 and −0.2 μmol/24‐h, 95% CI: −1.9; 1.6 μmol/24‐h, p = .861, respectively). No significant effect on the total secretion was found (−1.2 μmol/24‐h, 95% CI: −4.0; 1.7 μmol/24‐h, p = .420). Additionally, analyses using log‐transformed data were performed, but similar effects on cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites were observed (Table 4).

### Effects of magnesium concentration on the regulation of nutrition and inflammation in nutritional support for cancer patients [^116NDrwd]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Magnesium plays a crucial role in metabolic homeostasis and energy balance. This study aims to evaluate the effect of magnesium in regulating nutritional status and inflammatory responses in nutritional support.

Methods

A survey of 86 lung cancer patients was conducted. The oral nutrition supplement group was given an oral nutritional solution that was magnesium rich on the basis of the routine diet in the hospital, while a routine hospital diet was given to the control group. Changes in magnesium concentration, nutritional status and inflammatory indicators were compared between groups.

Results

There was no significant difference in the indicators on 1st day and 10th day compared to the control group (P > 0.05). However, the levels of Mg, ALB, PA, Hb and TLC in the oral nutrition supplement group were significantly increased and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and CRP were significantly reduced on the 21st day (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Changes in magnesium concentration can improve nutritional status and inflammatory response. The synergistic effect of magnesium concentration and nutritional support may open a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of cancer patients.

Migraine prevention — oral magnesium: We suggest oral magnesium for the prevention of migraine (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence includes a systematic review (SR) of four placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium (n = 266) showing a mean reduction of 2.6 migraine headaches per month after 12-weeks with doses ranging from 500–600 mg of oral magnesium daily. Another SR of eight RCTs (n = 568) reported an OR of 0.2 for change in migraine days, with formulations including 1–2 g magnesium sulfate, 200–800 mg magnesium 2-propyl valerate, and 400–600 mg magnesium oxide. A randomized crossover study comparing 500 mg magnesium oxide to 400 mg valproate sodium twice daily (n = 70; only 63 completed) found both groups reduced from five to approximately three headaches per month with no statistically significant difference. The Work Group determined that the benefits slightly outweighed the harms of oral therapy in patients with normal renal function, where side effects are largely limited to GI intolerance; magnesium toxicity has been associated with doses greater than 5,000 mg per day and the risk of these adverse events is increased with reduced renal function. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115sxd7D]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. A major limitation in most studies was the lack of data on dietary intake and, therefore, the overall magnesium intake of participants. Moreover, magnesium preparations have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, which influence bioavailability. Absorption of organic magnesium compounds is better than absorption of inorganic compounds. Significant heterogeneity was also present across studies, and although this was reduced when we undertook subgroup analyses, sources of heterogeneity were not identified through additional meta-regression of participant and study characteristics. Differences in study designs, BP measurement techniques, magnesium supplement composition, baseline clinical status of participants, along with small sample sizes, may have contributed, making it difficult to draw conclusions.

Most studies used a magnesium dose between 300 and 500 mg and yielded a wide range of BP responses. This limited the ability to perform a dose-response analysis across a wide range of doses to undertake a more comprehensive dose-response analysis. Dose-response analysis was also undertaken for magnesium dose, but was not completed for the dose of intervention duration, which may have increased the robustness of the analysis.

Hypomagnesemia and normomagnesemia categories were determined by studies based on reported categories of serum magnesium. However, < 1% of magnesium in the body is found in the blood, and therefore, serum magnesium concentrations may underestimate depleted intracellular stores and magnesium deficiency. For a more accurate evaluation of magnesium status, total dietary magnesium and urinary losses should be considered.

Perspectives

This meta-analysis strengthens the evidence to support the benefits of oral magnesium intake for the reduction in SBP and DBP, with potentially greater benefit for patients with hypertension using BP-lowering medication, and for patients with hypomagnesemia. We found no dose-response relationship. Importantly, the absence of a significant effect in normotensive populations and the lack of a clear dose-response relationship underscore the complexity of magnesium's physiological influence and the need for further research. The high heterogeneity across studies emphasizes the necessity for future large-scale, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to elucidate optimal dosing thresholds and identify responsive subpopulations. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting personalized nutritional approaches in hypertension management and call for integration of micronutrient assessment in clinical practice, particularly where the hypertension burden is high.

Methods

Search strategy

A medical librarian (MVN) performed a comprehensive literature search on April 2016. Searched databases were as follows: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, and on-going clinical trials. The main search concepts were asthma and oral magnesium; Boolean operators: OR (for combining synonyms), AND (to combine concepts), and truncations were used when appropriate. A review of references and a manual search of relevant articles was completed. Additionally, we contacted the authors of the trials to minimize chances of missed articles. The search was updated on May 2017. No restrictions to study type, time, or language were applied.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included RCTs that investigated the use of oral magnesium as an adjunct to asthma inhalers. Asthma was defined in accordance with the authors of the included trials, which were either clinically, objectively (spirometry), or both. All trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) Population: mild and moderate asthmatic older than 6 years [6 years was the cut-off based on the global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines];(2) Intervention: all preparations of oral magnesium, regardless of name or dosage; (3) Comparisons: placebo or no treatment; (4) Outcomes: frequency of rescue asthma exacerbation, ER visits or hospital admissions, objective measures: FEV1, FVC, and PEF, daytime symptoms, daytime activity, night-time symptoms, frequency of bronchodilator use, use of oral or inhaled steroids, side effects, and mortality; (5) Timing: treatment for any duration was included; (6) Study type: RCTs, blinded or open-labeled. Crossover trials were excluded.

Study selection

Two reviewers (AA and FA) separately scanned the titles and abstracts of all articles, and when needed, the full text was retrieved and reviewed to identify all relevant articles. A third author (MF) resolved any disagreements.

Data extraction

Important data were extracted using a piloted form, which incorporated all attributes of the studies, including author, publication year, country, setting, design, sample size, intervention (dose and type), placebo, patient's age and sex, severity, study duration, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcomes, and limitations. Data was extracted by AA and FA and reviewed by MF. We contacted the author of the study in question for any missing information.

### Magnesium for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^116vzeur]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Because electrolyte abnormalities are a frequent and potentially hazardous complication in patients with heart failure, magnesium likely improves outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure by preventing ventricular arrhythmias. Bashir et al investigated the effect of oral magnesium supplementation in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial involving 21 patients with stable congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease and who were receiving long-term loop diuretics. Oral magnesium supplementation was found to lower mean arterial pressure, systolic vascular resistance and the frequency of isolated ventricular premature complexes, couplets and non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. However, more studies are needed to establish whether routine supplementation of magnesium in patients with heart failure is warranted. In fact, Ralston et al showed that the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in ambulatory patients with dilated cardiomyopathy is relatively low (9%); however, magnesium is 99% intracellular and hence there is a poor correlation between serum, mononuclear cells, skeletal muscles cells and cardiac muscle cell magnesium levels.

### An evidence-based review of oral magnesium supplementation in the preventive treatment of migraine [^1149Abae]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is an incompletely understood, debilitating disorder that lacks a universally effective treatment. Magnesium participates in a variety of biochemical processes related to migraine pathophysiology, and a deficiency could contribute to migraine development.

Methods

A review of the literature from 1990 to the present on magnesium and migraine was conducted.

Review

The authors identified 16 studies aimed at magnesium status assessment in migraine, and four intervention trials assessing the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation, independent of other therapies, in the prevention of migraine.

Conclusion

The strength of evidence supporting oral magnesium supplementation is limited at this time. With such limited evidence, a more advantageous alternative to magnesium supplementation, in patients willing to make lifestyle changes, may be to focus on increasing dietary magnesium intake.

### Severe hypomagnesaemia in long-term users of proton-pump inhibitors [^111U1C6G]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the mechanism underlying severe hypomagnesaemia in long-term users of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Patients

Two cases of severe hypomagnesaemia in adult long-term users of the PPI omeprazole, presenting with hypocalcaemic seizures.

Measurements

We studied renal magnesium handling during an incremental intravenous magnesium infusion, and assessed total body magnesium status by the 24-h retention of the parenteral load. We also observed the effects of oral magnesium supplements whilst continuing the PPI, and the effect of withdrawal of the PPI.

Results

Both patients were severely magnesium-depleted and had avid renal magnesium retention, implicating a failure of intestinal magnesium absorption. There was no evidence of generalized malabsorption. The hypomagnesaemia could be partially corrected by high dose oral magnesium supplementation, and resolved on withdrawal of PPIs.

Conclusions

PPI use can inhibit active magnesium transport in the intestine, though it is not clear if this is an idiosyncratic effect. Long-term PPI users who are highly adherent to treatment can eventually deplete total body magnesium stores and present with severe complications of hypomagnesaemia.

### Oral magnesium supplementation in asthmatic children: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^113RkjSS]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the long-term effect of oral magnesium supplementation on clinical symptoms, bronchial reactivity, lung function and allergen-induced skin responses in children and adolescents with moderate persistent asthma.

Design

A double-blind randomized parallel placebo-controlled study.

Setting and Subjects

The patients were recruited from the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic, Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Immunology, and followed at the Center for Investigation in Pediatrics at State University of Campinas Hospital, Brazil. Thirty-seven out of 72 patients met the study criteria. There were no dropouts.

Intervention

The 37 patients (aged 7–19 years, 19 males) were randomized in two groups: magnesium (n = 18, 300 mg/day) and placebo (n = 19), during 2 months. Both patient groups received inhaled fluticasone (250 microg twice a day) and salbutamol as needed. The primary outcome was bronchial reactivity evaluated with methacholine challenge test (PC20).

Results

After a follow-up of 2 months, the methacholine PC20 for testing bronchial reactivity has augmented significantly in the magnesium group only. The skin responses to recognized antigens have also decreased in patients treated with magnesium. The forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume at first second (FEV1), the forced expiratory flow at 25–75 and the FEV1/FVC ratio were similar in both groups. The magnesium group presented fewer asthma exacerbations and used less salbutamol compared to the placebo group.

Conclusions

Oral magnesium supplementation helped to reduce bronchial reactivity to methacholine, to diminish their allergen-induced skin responses and to provide better symptom control in pediatric patients with moderate persistent asthma treated with inhaled fluticasone.

### Lansoprazole-induced hypomagnesaemia [^113edeSv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the late 1980s optimised the medical treatment of acid-related disorders. They are potent medications and have a good safety profile. However, long-term therapy with PPIs may carry undesired side effects, one of which is hypomagnesaemia. This entity is likely to be under-reported. We present a clinical case which illustrates this important clinical problem. We present the case of a 73-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with supraventricular tachycardia due to hypomagnesaemia while using lansoprazole, followed by the literature review on this subject. In our patient after the intravenous magnesium replenishment, her arrhythmia resolved. After stopping her PPI her serum magnesium remained within reference values without oral supplementation. We believe that more attention towards this underdiagnosed side effect is required. Serum magnesium concentration should be checked in patients on PPIs if they are unwell or present with arrythmia.

### Magnesium lactate in the treatment of gitelman syndrome: patient-reported outcomes [^117VdF5t]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The importance of achieving adequate Mg levels in maintaining serum K is well recognized. Interestingly, the mean serum K levels post-SRMgL in our patients improved more readily than Mg levels themselves. This may be explained by serum Mg not necessarily reflecting Mg storage, since < 1% of total body Mg is present in the serum. Patients who are chronically losing Mg are likely to be total-body Mg-deplete, and replenishment will be accompanied by some redistribution into exchangeable stores. In addition, it is possible that a smoothing of overall Mg levels by using a slow-release compound supports stabilization of, or improvement in, K levels.

A wide variety of Mg preparations is available in different countries, most of which are classed as food supplements. For these, there is no requirement to provide the same scientific evidence to support bioavailability, efficacy and tolerability as applies to medicines, and many health-food store-stocked Mg compounds contain doses too low to be useful in GS. Labelling of these 'over the counter' preparations is often not very informative and conforms to limited standards, although more stringent labelling regulations were introduced in the USA in 2014. In addition, few Mg supplements are licensed; in the UK, this is limited to Mg aspartate. In UK clinical practice outside nephrology, Mg oxide has been the compound most frequently prescribed, but it has much lower bioavailability than organic formulae, and in ours and others' experience, poor tolerability when used in larger doses. Consequently, the choice of Mg supplementation is often decided on physician preference based on clinical experience and factors such as cost and compound availability, rather than scientific evidence.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^114jUrFA]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Nutrient supplementation and repletion after bariatric surgery — vitamin B1 (thiamine) — include preventive and therapeutic dosing. For prevention, ≥ 12 mg thiamine daily; preferably a 50–100 mg daily dose of thiamine from a B-complex supplement or high-potency multivitamin. Bariatric patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should be treated before or in the absence of laboratory confirmation and monitored/ evaluated for resolution of signs and symptoms. Repletion dosing varies by route: Oral therapy: 100 mg 2–3 times daily until symptoms resolve; IV therapy: 200 mg 3 times daily to 500 mg once or twice daily for 3–5 d, followed by 250 mg/d for 3–5 d or until symptoms resolve, then consider treatment with 100 mg/d orally, indefinitely, or until risk factors have been resolved; IM therapy: 250 mg once daily for 3–5 d or 100–250 mg monthly. Magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus should be given simultaneously to patients at risk for refeeding syndrome.

### Magnesium supplementation for the management of essential hypertension in adults [^111Tpwsd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence on the effects of magnesium on blood pressure is inconsistent. Metabolic and experimental studies suggest that magnesium may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of magnesium supplementation as treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral magnesium supplementation with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or magnesium supplementation was combined with other interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

Twelve RCTs (n = 545) with eight to 26 weeks follow-up met our inclusion criteria. The results of the individual trials were heterogeneous. Combining all trials, participants receiving magnesium supplements as compared to control did not significantly reduce SBP (mean difference: -1.3 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.0 to 1.5, I(2) = 67%), but did statistically significantly reduce DBP (mean difference: -2.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.4 to -0.9, I(2) = 47%). Sensitivity analyses excluding poor quality trials yielded similar results. Sub-group analyses and meta-regression indicated that heterogeneity between trials could not be explained by dose of magnesium, baseline blood pressure or the proportion of males among the participants.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the poor quality of included trials and the heterogeneity between trials, the evidence in favour of a causal association between magnesium supplementation and blood pressure reduction is weak and is probably due to bias. This is because poor quality studies generally tend to over-estimate the effects of treatment. Larger, longer duration and better quality double-blind placebo controlled trials are needed to assess the effect of magnesium supplementation on blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Esomeprazole magnesium (esomeprazole magnesium) [^111RPfco]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Esomeprazole magnesium is supplied as delayed-release capsules for oral administration. The recommended dosages are outlined in Table 1. Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules should be taken at least one hour before meals.

The duration of proton pump inhibitor administration should be based on available safety and efficacy data specific to the defined indication and dosing frequency, as described in the prescribing information, and individual patient medical needs. Proton pump inhibitor treatment should only be initiated and continued if the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment.

Table 1: Recommended Dosage Schedule for Esomeprazole Magnesium Delayed-Release Capsules

[See Clinical Studies (14.1)] The majority of patients are healed within 4 to 8 weeks. For patients who do not heal after 4 to 8 weeks, an additional 4 to 8 weeks of treatment may be considered.
Controlled studies did not extend beyond six months.
If symptoms do not resolve completely after 4 weeks, an additional 4 weeks of treatment may be considered.
Doses over 1 mg/kg/day have not been studied.
Doses over 1.33 mg/kg/day have not been studied.
The dosage of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules in patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions varies with the individual patient. Dosage regimens should be adjusted to individual patient needs.
Doses up to 240 mg daily have been administered [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114hDMjZ]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

There are inconsistent reports regarding the effect of magnesium intake on blood pressure (BP) across hypertensive and normotensive populations.

METHODS:

We performed a meta-analysis and dose-response analysis to explore the relationship between magnesium supplementation and BP in randomized-controlled trials with a duration of ≥ 4 weeks, using a cubic spline regression model.

RESULTS:

Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 2709 participants were eligible for inclusion. Studies included an elemental magnesium dose from 82.3 mg to 637 mg with a median dose of 365 mg and a median intervention period of 12 weeks. Mean differences of changes in BP were calculated by random effects meta-analysis. Magnesium intake resulted in a reduction in systolic BP of −2.81 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.32 to −1.29) and diastolic BP by −2.05 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.23 to −0.88) compared with placebo. Hypertensive individuals on BP-lowering medication and individuals with hypomagnesemia yielded greater systolic BP reductions of −7.68 and −5.97 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.05), and diastolic BP reductions of −2.96 and −4.75 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.05). In normotensive groups, statistical significance was not reached. We identified high heterogeneity across studies. We found no dose-response relationship between magnesium and BP changes (all P ≥ 0.20).

CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings support the beneficial effect of magnesium on reducing BP among populations with hypertension and hypomagnesemia, although effects should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity of studies. Larger, well-designed studies assessing higher magnesium doses are needed to refine the dose-response relationship between magnesium intake and BP and identify potential optimal supplementation strategies for subpopulations.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cn2Tu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, GINA guidelines defined adults as those 6 years old and above. This dichotomy is not used in many of the available studies. Clearer details regarding trial methodology, particularly about sequence generation and allocation concealment would help future systematic reviewers appraise the literature more properly. Additionally, clear stratification by oral magnesium dose and duration of therapy can help produce more precise and useful estimates. Finally, none of the RCTs provided their research protocol.

The use of magnesium supplements as an adjuvant to standard asthma treatment in mild to moderate asthmatic patients is not supported by high quality evidence. Apart from one point at week 8 where the FEV1 had significantly improved, no other benefits from oral magnesium supplements were seen. Until future higher quality evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended for mild to moderate asthma.

### Comparison of oral and intravenous magnesium repletion in patients with hypomagnesemia: a randomized… [^114r2whu]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear Sir / Madam, You are being asked to participate in a medical study. If you should have any questions, you are free to ask either me or anyone else participating in this study that you feel comfortable with. The purpose of this study is to determine how magnesium, a trace mineral necessary for a number of bodily processes. can best be replaced. Every organ in the body needs a small amount of magnesium to function well, particularly the heart, muscles, and kidneys. It also helps make teeth and bones. Magnesium helps activate many enzymes, contributes to energy production, and helps regulate levels of calcium, copper, zinc, potassium, vitamin. Comparison of oral and intravenous magnesium repletion in patients with hypomagnesemia: A randomized controlled trial study. Informed Consent Form, English. We will replace the magnesium your body has lost. However, we will do this either orally or through a catheter placed into your arm or leg.

The catheter may be used for administration of other medications. your body is low in magnesium, it has enough magnesium that your low magnesium state is not life- threatening, making it safe for you to receive it orally. Voluntary Participation Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. It is your choice whether to participate or not. Whether you choose to participate or not, all the services you receive at this hospital will continue and. nothing will change. If you choose not to participate in this research project, you will offered the treatment that is routinely offered in hospital for low magnesium. You may change your mind later and stop participating even if you agreed earlier. Procedures and Protocol After receiving the magnesium, your magnesium blood level will be checked 12 hours later through a. be given medications to slow the gut, if it is considered safe to do so.

It is possible to experience some burning when the magnesium is being administered through a vein. If, after administration of the magnesium, you are found to have a dangerously high level of magnesium, you will be treated in the same way as if you were. not in the study; this may include administration of medications called diuretics to make you urinate more, or hemodialysis if the magnesium level is life-threatening. Risks The risks associated with this study are very low. They consist primarily of not receiving enough magnesium, and requiring additional doses of magnesium later.

### Long-term magnesium supplementation improves glucocorticoid metabolism: a post-hoc analysis of an intervention trial [^1159qy3z]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study population

A total of 51 participants completed the initial intervention trial. For the current post‐hoc analysis, data on 24‐h urinary excretions of cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites were available from 49 participants. Baseline characteristics of the 49 participants that were included in the analysis are presented in Table 2. Their mean age was 62 ± 6 years and 22 (44.9%) were female. They had an average BMI of 29 ± 3 kg/m². Baseline measurements were comparable between the magnesium and placebo group (Table 2). Oral magnesium supplementation led to an increase in 24‐h urinary magnesium excretion, (2.22 mmol/24‐h; 95% CI: 1.38; 3.07 mmol/24‐h, p < .001) and a small, but non‐significant, increase in plasma magnesium (0.01 mmol/L; 95% CI: −0.01; 0.04 mmol/L, p = .170) (Table 3). Overall compliance was excellent, as evident by the increased 24‐h urinary magnesium excretion observed in the magnesium group as well as the capsule counts. Compliance, based on the returned capsules, ranged from 86% to 102% and was on average 99% and 98% for the magnesium group and for the placebo group, respectively. The magnesium supplements were well tolerated. No serious adverse events were observed. Only mild headache and mild gastrointestinal complaints were reported for 7 days by 1 women from the magnesium group (during week 11 of the study).

### The Brazil MAGnesium (BRAMAG) trial: a randomized clinical trial of oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy for the prevention of preterm birth and perinatal and maternal morbidity [^1129KnE3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

One of the main determinants of maternal Mg ++ handling is renal function, including after oral Mg ++ administration. Thus, as a safety measure in our proposed RCT, we will measure maternal serum creatinine concentration at 12–20 weeks gestation. We will deem ineligible any woman whose estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is under 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

In terms of infant safety, we will assess for the presence of hypocalcemia at birth, defined as a total serum calcium concentration in the umbilical cord below 10 mg/dL. These measures will be obtained in all neonates of BRAMAG enrolled mothers who deliver within IMIP and the Dom Malan Hospital. We will also assess for the presence of neonatal osteopenia by plain X-ray examination of all newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (and who receive a routine chest X-ray as part of their care). It is expected that around 5% of all newborns studied (150/3,000) will have a chest X-ray. Radiological markers of osteopenia will be assessed on these plain radiographs by a radiologist.

### Brazil magnesium (BRAMAG) trial: a double-masked randomized clinical trial of oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^115CzZ1b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Consenting participants allocated to the active arm received a daily magnesium citrate capsule (300 mg elemental magnesium citrate per capsule), and those in the control arm received a daily placebo capsule identical to that in the active arm. While the original protocol plan was to administer magnesium citrate 150 mg twice daily, it was changed to 300 mg daily, before initiation of the study, to maximize patient compliance. Women were advised to take the capsule after breakfast, daily, until the end of the current pregnancy. Adherence to treatment was defined as the ingestion of at least 80% of the prescribed dose. The magnesium citrate and placebo capsules were manufactured by IMIP's Department of Pharmacology, and were identical in colour and shape. The 300 mg daily dose of magnesium was chosen to achieve the daily nutritional needs, while minimizing the side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal or sleepiness) or toxicity of excess magnesium. The study medication packages were supplied to each local pharmacy with sequential numbers. Code break envelopes were supplied to the lead pharmacist, but were not available for the investigation team. Each medication pack was individually prescribed for each participant.

Adherence, adverse events, and clinical intercurrences were monitored by the research team at each routine prenatal visit, and every 60 days. Adequate adherence was defined as completion of at least 70% of the prescribed pill count. Anthropometric data and routine laboratory tests were also performed at these encounters. Pregnant women who did not attend their scheduled clinic visits were contacted by telephone and visited within their residence. Post-randomization losses were duly recorded, with the related reason. Criteria for unplanned study exist were clinical signs or symptoms reported by the patient due to the intake of the capsules, or cancellation of prenatal care at their local hospital.

### A randomized, controlled trial of oral sulfate solution versus polyethylene glycol for bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^116XKCky]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The quality of colonoscopy is significantly influenced by the effectiveness of bowel preparation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of bowel cleansing between a new oral sulfate solution (OSS) and standard polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder (PEG).

Methods

This single center, randomized, superiority study recruited 679 outpatients who were assigned to either the new OSS group (Group A) or standard PEG group (Group B). The quality of bowel cleansing was evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and compared between the two groups. Furthermore, data pertaining to the duration of bowel preparation, patient tolerability, and the occurrence of adverse events were also analyzed.

Results

According to BBPS scores, group A demonstrated significantly higher bowel preparation cleanliness than group B. Additionally, group A achieved superior bowel cleansing, as evidenced by a greater proportion of patients with BBPS scores ≥ 8 compared to group B (75.3% vs. 55.2%, P < 0.05). No severe adverse events were reported during examinations in either group.

Conclusions

The magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and potassium sulfate concentrated oral solution is a novel, safe, and effective bowel preparation for colonoscopy.

Trial registration

This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on 20/02/2024 (clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2400081004).

### Magnesium supplementation does not affect blood calcium level in treated hypoparathyroid patients [^112CfDBD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Magnesium is involved in the homeostasis of calcium metabolism, and magnesium deficiency may lead to clinically significant hypocalcemia. We have had two cases in our department in which treated hypoparathyroid patients with stable calcium levels developed hypercalcemia in conjunction with supplementary magnesium use. To our knowledge, there has been no prospective study looking at the effect of supplementary magnesium on calcium homeostasis in hypoparathyroid patients.

Objective

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate whether magnesium treatment affects plasma calcium levels in hypoparathyroid patients.

Design and Setting

We conducted a prospective, two-phase, uncontrolled treatment trial at a referral center of endocrine disorders.

Participants

We enrolled treated (calcium + vitamin D analog) hypoparathyroid patients with normal plasma magnesium levels.

Intervention

Three weeks of treatment with oral magnesium (350 mg/d) were followed by 2 wk off treatment.

Measures

We compared the plasma ionized calcium level after 3 wk of treatment to the pretreatment value. Plasma calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and creatinine levels were measured before treatment, after 3 wk on magnesium, and 2 wk after stopping magnesium treatment.

Results

Ten patients completed the trial. Supplementary treatment with magnesium for 3 wk did not change calcium levels in these patients. Magnesium supplementation induced a small but statistically significant increase in the plasma magnesium level, but levels of phosphate and creatinine remained stable.

Conclusions

Magnesium supplementation did not influence plasma calcium levels in treated hypoparathyroid patients.

### A randomized cohort study of the efficacy of PO magnesium in the treatment of acute concussions in adolescents [^115oLZXs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Study Objective

Concussions are becoming a growing concern in society today with one out of every five adolescents being affected. This accounts for 1.6 to 3.8 million emergency department visits annually. The current standard of care involves an initial period of mental rest with symptomatic care and symptom-based return to daily activities/sports. High dose IV magnesium has been proven to be neuroprotective in severe TBI. We hypothesized that oral magnesium replacement following a concussion will decrease the overall symptomatic period allowing a quicker return to functional baseline.

Methods

We used a randomized cohort study involving patients aged 12–18 who presented within 48 h after a concussion. Our study design had a treatment arm including acetaminophen, ondansetron, and magnesium PO and a placebo arm of acetaminophen and ondansetron. We then utilized the Post- Concussion Severity Score (PCSS) to evaluate the extent of the patient's symptoms. This score was collected immediately prior to obtaining medications, 1 h, 48 h, and 120 h after starting the study. The study relied on outpatient follow up through phone conversations, and a Sports Medicine clinic locally.

Results

Our data shows that there was a statistically significant decrease in the PCSS at 48 h (p = 0.016) in the magnesium group relative to the placebo treatment arm. This study does imply that magnesium supplementation has potential benefit in treatment of concussions acutely.

Conclusion

Oral magnesium replacement decreases symptoms acutely following a concussion and should be provided with symptomatic management following a concussion in the emergency setting.

### Magnesium supplementation for migraine prophylaxis [^114ftyNT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We will include studies implementing a minimum four‐week magnesium supplementation of any kind (magnesium oxide, citrate, dicitrate, sulphate, chloride, lactate, malate, taurate, glycinate, bisglycinate, orotate, and threonate), administered orally in a dose range of 200 to 600 mg daily according to the general recommendations of the CHS, the Swiss Headache Society, or other guidelines or any other dose used by the trial authors. We will consider co‐interventions, provided they are not part of the randomization process and are provided in all groups in a study.

We anticipate that most trials will have permitted the use of medication for acute migraine attacks experienced during the trial period. We therefore will record descriptions of trial rules concerning the use of acute medication in a 'Characteristics of included studies' table whenever such information is provided. If a trial includes multiple arms, we will include any arm that meets the inclusion criteria for this review.

We plan to investigate the following comparisons of interventions and comparators.

Interventions

Pharmacological treatment grouped by drug class or mechanism of action: antihypertensive agents; antiepileptic (antiseizure) drugs; antidepressants; calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway‐targeted therapies; or onabotulinumtoxinA.

Outcome measures

We will not consider measurement of the outcomes assessed in this review as a criterion for eligibility.

### How should hypomagnesaemia be investigated and treated? [^111VUBdM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia is relatively common, with an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 2·5% to 15%. It may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. Drug-induced hypomagnesaemia, particularly related to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, is being increasingly recognized. Most patients with hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic; symptomatic magnesium depletion is often associated with multiple other biochemical abnormalities, including hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis. Manifestations of symptomatic hypomagnesaemia most often involve neuromuscular, cardiovascular and metabolic features. Patients with symptomatic hypomagnesaemia should be treated with intravenous magnesium, reserving oral replacement for asymptomatic patients.

### Effects of intravenous and oral magnesium on reducing migraine: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xnUGo]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine attack has been associated with magnesium deficiency. Previous studies investigating the effect of intravenous and oral magnesium on acute migraine attacks and the prevention of migraine have produced equivocal findings.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine attacks and oral magnesium supplements on migraine prophylaxis.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Electronic databases, namely EMBASE, PubMed, the Wanfang Data Chinese Database, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database were searched from inception to February 24, 2015.

Methods

This review was conducted according to the guidelines of the PRISMA. Only RCTs evaluating the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium on migraine compared with a control group were included.

Results

A total of 21 studies were included. Of which, 11 studies investigated the effects of intravenous magnesium on acute migraine (948 participants) and 10 examined the effects of oral magnesium on migraine prophylaxis (789 participants). Intravenous magnesium significantly relieved acute migraine within 15–45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion (Odd ratios [ORs] = 0.23, 0.20, and 0.25, respectively). Oral magnesium significantly alleviated the frequency and intensity of migraine (ORs = 0.20 and 0.27).

Limitations

Some of the included studies did not adopt adequate randomization methods.

Conclusions

Intravenous magnesium reduces acute migraine attacks within 15–45 minutes, 120 minutes, and 24 hours after the initial infusion and oral magnesium alleviates the frequency and intensity of migraine. Intravenous and oral magnesium should be adapted as parts of multimodal approach to reduce migraine.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^111Adw3o]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease postoperative calcium management — strategies and risk assessment (Recommendation 29) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for management of calcium levels, with a weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can be measured and supplementation given based on results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for supplementation. Patients can be discharged if asymptomatic and their serum calcium levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/ dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling over a 24-hour period. Persistent hypocalcemia may warrant measurement of serum magnesium and possible repletion; following discharge, serum iPTH should be measured in persistent hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is present or whether "bone hunger" is ongoing. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, teriparatide has yielded encouraging preliminary results, but more data are needed before it can be considered for clinical practice; intravenous calcium gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if symptoms worsen despite oral therapy.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^1155z1gP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus criteria — adult refeeding syndrome (RS) risk identification specifies two tiers: Moderate Risk requires "2 Risk Criteria" while Significant Risk requires "1 Risk Criteria". Body mass index (BMI) thresholds are "16–18.5 kg/m²" for Moderate Risk and " < 16 kg/m²" for Significant Risk. Weight loss thresholds are "5% in 1 month" for Moderate Risk and "7.5% in 3 months or > 10% in 6 months" for Significant Risk. Caloric intake thresholds for Moderate Risk include "None or negligible oral intake for 5–6 days OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 7 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month", whereas Significant Risk includes "None or negligible oral intake for > 7 days OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 5 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month". Abnormal prefeeding electrolytes (potassium, phosphorus, or magnesium) are "Minimally low levels or normal current levels and recent low levels necessitating minimal or single-dose supplementation" for Moderate Risk versus "Moderately/significantly low levels or minimally low or normal levels and recent low levels necessitating significant or multiple-dose supplementation" for Significant Risk. Loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass require "Evidence of moderate loss" or "Evidence of mild or moderate loss" for Moderate Risk compared with "Evidence of severe loss" for Significant Risk, and higher-risk comorbidities are "Moderate disease" versus "Severe disease". A footnote cautions that "electrolytes may be normal despite total-body deficiency, which is believed to increase risk of refeeding syndrome".

### Oral magnesium supplementation improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic subjects: a randomized double-blind controlled trial [^111V2ddQ]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether oral magnesium supplementation (as magnesium chloride [MgCl(2)] solution) improves both insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic subjects with decreased serum magnesium levels.

Research Design and Methods

This study was a clinical randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. A total of 63 subjects with type 2 diabetes and decreased serum magnesium (serum magnesium levels ≤ 0.74 mmol/l) treated by glibenclamide received either 50 mL MgCl(2) solution (containing 50 g MgCl(2) per 1,000 mL solution) or placebo daily for 16 weeks. Chronic diarrhea, alcoholism, use of diuretic and/or calcium antagonist drugs, and reduced renal function were exclusion criteria. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used as the parameter of insulin sensitivity and glucose and HbA(1c) as parameters of metabolic control.

Results

At the end of the study, subjects who received magnesium supplementation showed significant higher serum magnesium concentration (0.74 ± 0.10 vs. 0.65 ± 0.07 mmol/l, P = 0.02) and lower HOMA-IR index (3.8 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 1.3, P = 0.005), fasting glucose levels (8.0 ± 2.4 vs. 10.3 ± 2.1 mmol/l, P = 0.01), and HbA(1c) (8.0 ± 2.4 vs. 10.1 ± 3.3%, P = 0.04) than control subjects.

Conclusions

Oral supplementation with MgCl(2) solution restores serum magnesium levels, improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic patients with decreased serum magnesium levels.

### Effects of magnesium concentration on the regulation of nutrition and inflammation in nutritional support for cancer patients [^115kuziw]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Magnesium plays a crucial role in metabolic homeostasis and energy balance. This study aims to evaluate the effect of magnesium in regulating nutritional status and inflammatory responses in nutritional support.

Methods

A survey of 86 lung cancer patients was conducted. The oral nutrition supplement group was given an oral nutritional solution that was magnesium-rich on the basis of the routine diet in the hospital, while a routine hospital diet was given to the control group. Changes in magnesium concentration, nutritional status, and inflammatory indicators were compared between groups.

Results

There was no significant difference in the indicators on 1st day and 10th day compared to the control group (P > .05). However, the levels of Mg, ALB, PA, Hb, and TLC in the oral nutrition supplement group were significantly increased, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP were significantly reduced on the 21st day (P < .05).

Conclusions

Changes in magnesium concentration can improve nutritional status and inflammatory response. The synergistic effect of magnesium concentration and nutritional support may open a new avenue for the prevention and treatment of cancer patients.

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^116C6dBZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have shown here that serum magnesium concentrations were lower in Japanese outpatients who did receive long-term PPI treatment than in those who did not. Although several cases of PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia have been reported in the USA and Europe, only one has been reported in Japan.

Hypomagnesaemia has been observed in > 20% of hospitalised patients and in 65% of patients in intensive care units. Among US inpatients, those who received long-term PPI treatment had significantly lower serum magnesium levels than PPI non-users. Our results in Japanese outpatients were similar to those reported for US inpatients and indicate that PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia is also highly probable among outpatients.

Magnesium is the fourth most common cation in the body, with a standard concentration range of 1.9–3.1 mg/dL. Maintaining serum magnesium levels depends primarily on food intake and effective function by the kidneys and small intestine. Hypomagnesaemia may be caused by diarrhoea; malabsorption syndrome; malabsorption caused by excessive alcohol consumption; and nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, amphotericin B and cyclosporine. Because magnesium is essential for the enzymatic reactions involved in generating ATP as well as for enzymes that are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, magnesium insufficiency can affect ATP generation and neural transmission.

### Long-term magnesium supplementation improves glucocorticoid metabolism: a post-hoc analysis of an intervention trial [^1136HwSy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this post‐hoc analysis of a randomized, controlled trial with overweight and slightly obese adults, we observed a reduction in 24‐h urinary cortisol excretion after 24‐week of daily supplementation with 350 mg magnesium. Also, changes in THFs/THE and cortisol/cortisone ratios were observed, which reflects an increased kidney 11β‐HSD type 2 activity. These novel findings indicate an increased inactivation of cortisol by the 11β‐HSD type 2 enzyme that may be another potential mechanism by which increased dietary magnesium intake lowers CVD risk.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first human intervention trial that addressed the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on glucocorticoid metabolism, as assessed by 24‐h urinary measurements of cortisol, cortisone and their metabolites. Effects of magnesium on glucocorticoid metabolism have been previously reported by preclinical studies. A magnesium deficient diet has been shown to affect glucocorticoid metabolism in rats. 15, 16 The latter study showed that in rats receiving a magnesium deficient diet, corticosterone concentrations were elevated. Also, the expression of the gene encoding the enzyme 11β‐HSD type 1 was increased, whereas the expression of the gene encoding the enzyme 11β‐HSD type 2 was decreased. The mechanism underlying the effect of dietary magnesium restriction on altered 11β‐HSD activity is unknown. Previous studies showed that 11β‐HSDs are regulated by several cytokines and growth factors, including insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1), as well as by gonadal steroids. 19, 20, 21 Interestingly, a magnesium deficient diet in rats has been associated with reductions in serum IGF‐1. 22 Thus, it might be possible that the potential effects of magnesium restriction on IGF‐1 underlie the effects on altered 11β‐HSD activity. A limited number of clinical studies observed beneficial effects of oral magnesium supplementation on circulating cortisol concentrations. 23, 24, 25, 26 Although evidence regarding the mechanism by which magnesium lowers circulating cortisol levels is somewhat controversial, it might be that the effect is mediated by changes in the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is an endocrine feedback system in which corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), while ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol. Indeed, a previous study in mice showed deregulation of the HPA axis induced by a magnesium deficient diet, as evident by an increased transcription of the CRH and increased plasma CRH concentrations. 27 Another study conducted in healthy men found that after magnesium administration, secretion of ACTH was significantly reduced. 28

### Magnesium biology [^115rs3sE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

To conclude, Mg 2+ is essential for the physiological function of the human body and is tightly regulated by an interplay between intestinal Mg 2+ absorption and renal Mg 2+ excretion. Hypomagnesemia can either be genetic, acquired, or drug-induced by drugs such as PPIs, immunosuppressive drugs and diuretics. It often goes along with other comorbidities such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome or age. The first line of treatment for these patients is Mg 2+ supplementation to increase serum Mg 2+ levels; as of the time of writing there are no cures for the underlying causes of hypomagnesemia. SGLT2 inhibitors, however, shows promising effects in clinical case studies to increase serum Mg 2+ levels in diabetic patients with hypomagnesemia.

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^112KjD9j]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Serum magnesium concentrations decreased with increasing age in PPI users (table 2). Age was not a significant factor in our multivariate analysis (table 5). Therefore, hypomagnesaemia should be carefully monitored even in patients receiving long-term PPI treatment.

Serum magnesium levels did not differ among the groups of patients taking the three types of PPIs. Long-term administration of all these preparations, omeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole, has been reported to result in hypomagnesaemia. Therefore, regardless of the preparation used, hypomagnesaemia should be carefully monitored in patients receiving long-term PPI treatment.

Our study also showed that cirrhosis was associated with hypomagnesaemia. Because biosynthesis reactions and reactions involving trace elements occur in the liver, patients with cirrhosis have reduced trace element concentrations as well as low serum magnesium. We found that serum magnesium levels were lower in patients with cirrhosis than in those without. Further, PPI users with cirrhosis had significantly lower serum magnesium levels than non-users with cirrhosis and than patients without cirrhosis, regardless of PPI use (figure 2). Although the effect of long-term PPI administration on serum magnesium levels in patients with cirrhosis has not yet been examined in detail and PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia is rare, it may be life threatening in Japanese outpatients with cirrhosis.

This study had several limitations. First, it was performed at a single institution. Since PPI-associated hypomagnesaemia is extremely rare, randomised comparative trials of serum magnesium concentrations and PPI use were virtually impossible. Second, the study included only outpatients who underwent blood sampling. Blood is sampled from only some outpatients, introducing a selection bias and preventing these results to be extrapolated to normal healthy adults. Third, a history of whether these patients took supplements containing magnesium was not evaluated completely. Although the study protocol excluded patients with a history of administration of medications that are believed to affect serum magnesium levels, supplements containing magnesium were not assessed and may have affected our results. Fourth, nutritional status (diet, alcohol intake and diarrhoea) that could affect serum magnesium levels was unknown in this study.

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^114YTzQL]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Methods

We studied 1742 individuals treated as outpatients at the Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital between October and November 2011. Our general hospital has a focus on digestive diseases. The study participants were 481 outpatients who met the inclusion criteria as follows: age > 20 years and no history of hospitalisation within 1 week of blood sampling. Exclusion criteria were as follows: dialysis patients and patients who were administered magnesium oxide, diuretics or cisplatin preparations that may have affected serum magnesium. Cirrhosis was defined by clinical findings, blood examination data and image diagnosis (CT or ultrasound). Outpatients underwent blood sampling in the morning after at least a 12 h overnight fast. We measured serum magnesium levels in units of 0.1 mg/dL. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed to determine their underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cirrhosis and dyslipidaemia), possibility of ingestion, oral medications used, long-term use of PPIs and serum magnesium concentrations. Patients administered a PPI for > 1 year were regarded as PPI users, whereas those administered a PPI for < 1 year or not at all were considered PPI non-users. At the time this study was conducted, only three PPIs were approved for clinical use in Japan: omeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole. The dose of each drug was omeprazole 20 mg, lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg and rabeprazole 10 mg. Further, during this study, none of the patients were hospitalised for hypomagnesaemia. The protocol and consent form for this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Statistical analysis

Mean, SD and percentage with frequency were used to report continuous and discrete variables. χ 2 test or two-sample t test was used to assess significant differences between two groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine whether serum Mg concentrations were significantly associated with PPI use; the mode was adjusted for potential confounders, including age, sex, diagnosis of cirrhosis, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and PPI. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS II statistical software (SPSS Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan).

### A comparison of oral sulfate solution with sodium picosulfate: magnesium citrate in split doses as bowel preparation for colonoscopy [^117NDrZQ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are few data comparing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved low-volume bowel preparations for colonoscopy.

Objective

To compare oral sulfate solution (OSS) with sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate (SP+MC) for bowel cleansing efficacy.

Design

Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Ten U.S. centers.

Patients

Outpatients undergoing colonoscopy for routine indications.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to undergo bowel preparation with OSS or SP+MC. Both preparations were given in split doses.

Main Outcome Measurements

Cleansing efficacy on a 4-point scale from excellent (4) to poor (1).

Results

Among 338 randomized patients who took preparation, OSS resulted in a higher rate of successful (excellent or good) preparation (94.7% vs 85.7%; p = 0.006) and more excellent preparations (54% vs 26%; P < .001) compared with SP+MC. There was no difference between OSS and SP+MC in treatment-emergent adverse events. SP+MC had better scores for nausea, but the differences were small.

Limitations

The preparation grading scale has been used in previous studies and has regulatory acceptance but has not been formally validated.

Conclusion

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved split-dose regimen of OSS provides superior bowel cleansing compared with the approved split-dose regimen of SP+MC. (

### Treatment of hypomagnesemia [^114hjPFu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Serum magnesium concentration is determined by the interplay of intestinal absorption and renal excretion. Hypomagnesemia can occur as a result of insufficient magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss, or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular compartments. A number of drugs are known to cause hypomagnesemia, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We report the case of a patient with symptomatic hypomagnesemia due to short bowel syndrome and PPI therapy. Investigations revealed low 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion and secondary hypocalcemia. PPI treatment was withdrawn and the patient was managed with intravenous and oral magnesium and calcium replacement. This teaching case provides an evidence-based discussion of the treatment of hypomagnesemia.

A 32-year-old woman presented with an incidental finding of hypokalaemia on routine bloods at 9 weeks of a second pregnancy, on a background of lifelong salt craving. Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated. She had no previous significant medical or family history. Venous blood gases showed a hypokalaemic, normochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. Urinary potassium was elevated. Escalating doses of oral supplementation of potassium, magnesium, sodium and potassium-sparing diuretics were required through the course of pregnancy, in response to regular electrolyte monitoring. These were later weaned and completely stopped post partum. Delivery was uneventful with no maternal or neonatal complications. Genetic testing performed post partum showed heterogenous mutation of SCL12A3 gene.

### Oral magnesium supplementation reduces insulin resistance in non-diabetic subjects-a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial [^1132UGLE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome correlates with the availability of magnesium (Mg). We studied the effect of oral Mg supplementation on insulin sensitivity and other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in normomagnesemic, overweight, insulin resistant, non-diabetic subjects. Subjects were tested for eligibility using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and subsequently randomized to receive either Mg-aspartate-hydrochloride (n = 27) or placebo (n = 25) for 6 months. As trial endpoints, several indices of insulin sensitivity, plasma glucose, serum insulin, blood pressure and lipid profile were determined. Mg supplementation resulted in a significant improvement of fasting plasma glucose and some insulin sensitivity indices (ISIs) compared to placebo. Blood pressure and lipid profile did not show significant changes. The results provide significant evidence that oral Mg supplementation improves insulin sensitivity even in normomagnesemic, overweight, non-diabetic subjects emphasizing the need for an early optimization of Mg status to prevent insulin resistance and subsequently type 2 diabetes.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^112fayVP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture". It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Magnesium carbonate is an effective phosphate binder for chronic hemodialysis patients: a pilot study [^112Buq68]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium carbonate as a phosphate binder in hemodialysis patients.

Design

This study was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing magnesium carbonate/calcium carbonate versus calcium acetate as a sole phosphate binder.

Setting

This study involved outpatient hemodialysis.

Participants

We recruited 30 stable hemodialysis patients without a history of frequent diarrhea.

Intervention

After receiving informed consent, we randomized patients 2:1 to magnesium carbonate versus calcium acetate. The dose of each binder was titrated to achieve the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) phosphate target of < 5.5 mg/dL.

Main Outcome Measure

The efficacy-phase serum phosphorus concentration and the percentage of patients meeting K-DOQI targets for phosphorus, along with the daily elemental calcium intake, were the primary outcome measures.

Results

Magnesium carbonate provided equal control of serum phosphorus (70.6% of the magnebind group and 62.5% of the calcium acetate group had their average serum phosphorus within the K-DOQI target during the efficacy phase), while significantly reducing daily elemental calcium ingestion from phosphate binders (908 ± 24 vs. 1743 ± 37 mg/day, P < .0001).

Conclusion

Magnesium carbonate was generally well-tolerated in this selected patient population, and was effective in controlling serum phosphorus while reducing elemental calcium ingestion.

### Risedronate sodium [^112WGx8s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take risedronate sodium tablets at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day other than water, and before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins to maximize absorption and clinical benefit, [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Avoid the use of water with supplements, including mineral water, because they may have a higher concentration of calcium.
Swallow risedronate sodium tablets whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 ounces). Avoid lying down for 30 minutes after taking the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Do not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
Do not eat or drink anything except plain water, or take other medications for at least 30 minutes after taking risedronate sodium tablets.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate; and to take calcium supplements, antacids, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations at a different time of the day as they interfere with the absorption of risedronate sodium tablets.

### Magnesium bioavailability from mineral water. A study in adult men [^1143tK5n]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess magnesium enteral absorption from a magnesium-rich mineral water.

Design

Experimental study.

Setting

Department of Nuclear Medicine, Brugmann Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.

Subjects

Ten healthy male volunteers in the age range 25–42 y.

Intervention

Each subject completed two sessions in a random order. At one session, they received an oral load of 300 mL of water (containing 1.2 mmol Mg), traced with (28)Mg, and at the other session they received an intravenous injection of (28)Mg, in order to take into account the metabolism of endogenous magnesium. The dietary consumption was further noted on a weekly diary.

Results

The mean bioavailability was 59.1% (s.d. ± 13.6). Magnesium absorption and age were significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.68, P = 0.035).

Conclusion

Magnesium-rich mineral water is a reliable source of magnesium. Our observation of decreased magnesium absorption with age deserves further investigations.

Sponsorship

The study was sponsored by SEV, Bourg la Reine, France.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111B3ENr]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness of airway smooth muscles. There is growing evidence that magnesium may have a role in managing asthma through its dual effect as an anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating agent. To assess the efficacy of oral magnesium supplements in chronic asthmatic patients. In addition to searching through Clinicaltrials.gov/ and references for oral magnesium supplement studies, we performed a database search in Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Embase. We contacted the authors of the included trials to ask for additional information. We included randomized controlled trials that compared oral magnesium supplements versus placebo, in addition to standard asthma treatment in mild-moderate asthmatic adults and children (older than 6 years). Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data abstraction, and the assessment of the risk of bias. Eight trials at moderate risk of bias enrolling a total of 917 patients were included. Oral magnesium improved FEV1 at week 8 (5.69 (L/min); 95% CI: 1.92, 9.46; I 2: 45%). There was no significant improvement in FEV1 at other follow up periods. There was no significant change in FVC, Methacholine challenge test, the frequency of bronchodilator use, or symptoms score. There were no data on mortality or quality of life. Oral magnesium supplements may lead to improvement in FEV1 that was only demonstrated at eight weeks; but no effect on any other outcome. Until future evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended as adjuvants to standard treatment for mild to moderate asthmatic individuals.

### Impact of intravenous magnesium infusion rate during ambulatory replacements on serum magnesium concentrations after allogeneic stem cell transplant [^114RFfho]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

For an outpatient cancer center to operate efficiently, optimizing the use of chair time is essential. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients are seen frequently in this setting after hospital discharge and regularly for several months thereafter. Aggressive electrolyte replacement is commonly required in these patients, primarily due to renal wasting with calcineurin inhibitor use. Frequent intravenous (IV) magnesium repletion, requiring several hours of infusion time, is often needed in these patients to adequately manage their magnesium deficiencies. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of extending the infusion rate of intravenous magnesium sulfate on the frequency and degree of IV magnesium replacements required in allo-HCT recipients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study to compare two cohorts of patients administered IV magnesium sulfate at a rate of 4 g/1 h versus 4 g/2 h.

Results

A total of 103 continuous patients were assessed in two groups as cohort 1 at the 4 g/1 h rate and cohort 2 at the 4 g/2 h rate. Cohort 1 required less IV magnesium per outpatient visit (median 2.2 vs. 2.9 g/visit, P = 0.0211) and less total IV magnesium replacement through day +100 (median 68 vs. 85 g, P = 0.0479) than cohort 2.

Conclusion

These data suggest that there is no apparent benefit of prolonging magnesium infusion from 1 to 2 h in our outpatient allo-HCT population.

5.3.2 Blood tests for specific nutritional deficiencies

Statement 102. We recommend that IBD patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should have relevant screening blood tests to assess for macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. This may include measurement of iron stores, vitamin B12, folate, vitamins A, C, D and E, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, zinc and selenium (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.6%).

Measurement of macronutrient and micronutrient status in IBD is important for ongoing monitoring in patients who have or are at risk of malnutrition; however, interpretation of results can be challenging. Some micronutrients are influenced by disease activity so serum levels should consider C-reactive protein (CRP) when interpreting these micronutrients. A reliable clinical interpretation can be made only if the CRP is < 20 mg/L (plasma zinc), < 10 mg/L (plasma selenium, vitamin A and vitamin D) or < 5 mg/L (vitamin B6 and vitamin C). Magnesium deficiency has been reported to occur in 13–88% of patients with IBD, but serum magnesium is not an accurate measurement of magnesium status because less than 1% of magnesium stores are in the blood. The remainder is in bone, soft tissue and muscle. Magnesium deficiency in IBD is likely to be caused by increased gastrointestinal losses. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency include abdominal cramps, impaired healing, fatigue and bone pain. Magnesium supplementation can be given orally or intravenously, although oral supplementation can worsen diarrhoea. Up to a third of patients with IBD fail to meet the recommended dietary intake for calcium and calcium supplementation should be considered alongside vitamin D supplementation (see Section 5.2.8.3: Common Disease Considerations, Calcium and vitamin D supplementation). Plasma potassium levels should be monitored and supplemented as required. There are existing ECCO guidelines for monitoring and management of iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. General advice about iron replacement is shown in box 9.

### Effects of oral magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized double-blind controlled trials [^116CURQ8]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to assess the evidence on the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We searched the electronic databases of medline, embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to January 2005. We identified nine randomized double-blind controlled trials with a total of 370 patients with Type 2 diabetes and of duration 4–16 weeks. The median dose of oral magnesium supplementation was 15 mmol/day (360 mg/day) in the treatment groups. The primary outcome was glycaemic control, as measured by glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) or fasting blood glucose levels; the secondary outcomes included body mass index, blood pressure (BP) and lipids. Using a random-effects model, we calculated the weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

After a median duration of 12 weeks, the weighted mean post-intervention fasting glucose was significantly lower in the treatment groups compared with the placebo groups [-0.56 mmol/l (95% CI, -1.10 to -0.01); P for heterogeneity = 0.02]. The difference in post-intervention HbA(1c) between magnesium supplementation groups and control groups was not significant [-0.31% (95% CI, -0.81 to 0.19); P for heterogeneity = 0.10]. Neither systolic nor diastolic BP was significantly changed. Magnesium supplementation increased on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [0.08 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.14); P for heterogeneity = 0.36] but had no effect on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride.

Conclusions

Oral magnesium supplementation for 4–16 weeks may be effective in reducing plasma fasting glucose levels and raising HDL cholesterol in patients with Type 2 diabetes, although the long-term benefits and safety of magnesium treatment on glycaemic control remain to be determined.
