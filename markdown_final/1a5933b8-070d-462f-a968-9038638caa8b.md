## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions should be asked for a patient suspected of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) while also ruling out other causes of relapsing fever, such as tick-borne illnesses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fever attack pattern and periodicity. Then, I should verify the associated serosal, articular, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms during attacks. Next, I will assess inter-episode wellness. After that, I should check for triggers and epidemiologic exposures. I will then review family and ethnic history, evaluate response to specific therapies, examine tick-exposure risks, and scrutinize prior diagnostics and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize features that favor FMF versus tick-borne disease and outline next diagnostic and management steps, including what to do if features overlap or remain ambiguous [^116gWuNe] [^111yWGQ8] [^115Q88zC] [^113HfHxg].

> Let me first confirm the fever pattern because this often anchors the diagnosis. FMF typically presents with stereotyped, self-limited febrile attacks lasting about 12–72 hours and tends to develop a recognizable personal pattern over time, whereas TBRF has true relapses with febrile episodes more often lasting several days and separated by afebrile intervals, and may not self-resolve without treatment, so I should directly ask how long each episode lasts, how often they recur, whether the fevers remit completely without medication, and the peak temperatures recorded during attacks [^116gWuNe] [^114K8wRJ] [^115Q88zC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I detail co-symptoms during febrile episodes. FMF is classically associated with serositis such as diffuse peritonitis causing severe abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, and acute monoarthritis of large lower-extremity joints, sometimes with an erysipelas-like erythema on the legs, while TBRF tends to have nonspecific constitutional symptoms, gastrointestinal complaints, and may feature altered sensorium or other neurologic manifestations during febrile relapses; I also need to be precise that erythema migrans implicates Lyme disease and a petechial rash on palms and soles raises Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which are tick-borne but distinct from TBRF, so I should carefully characterize any rash morphology and distribution [^111yWGQ8] [^115Q88zC] [^113HfHxg].

> I need to check the patient's baseline between attacks because FMF patients are usually completely well between episodes, whereas tick-borne illnesses may leave residual fatigue or ongoing constitutional symptoms; rapid return to baseline strongly supports FMF, while persistent malaise suggests an alternative process such as chronic or incompletely treated infection, malignancy, or another inflammatory condition [^111yWGQ8] [^113HfHxg].

> Next, I should review potential triggers and temporal patterns. FMF attacks can be precipitated by cold exposure, physical exertion, emotional stress, or menses, and patients may report prodromal warning sensations, whereas tick-borne diseases track with seasonality and exposure, often peaking in warmer months; so I must ask about cyclic fevers with menses, seasonal clustering, and any prodrome preceding attacks to refine pretest probabilities for FMF versus a vector-borne illness [^115SU6mP] [^113HfHxg].

> Let me consider the family and ethnic context because it materially shifts suspicion. FMF is autosomal recessive, disproportionately affects individuals of Armenian, Arab, Turkish, and Jewish or broader Mediterranean ancestry, and a positive family history is a minor diagnostic criterion; asking about relatives with recurrent fevers or known FMF and any prior MEFV testing can meaningfully weight the likelihood toward FMF, while such history is not expected in tick-borne illnesses [^111yWGQ8] [^1169cRZm].

> I should confirm therapeutic responses because they can be highly discriminating. A dramatic suppression of attack frequency and severity with colchicine is a major FMF criterion and is uncommon in infectious etiologies; NSAIDs may palliate FMF attack symptoms but do not prevent them, while early doxycycline or tetracycline typically improves tick-borne infections including relapsing fever, and a striking single-dose steroid response points more toward PFAPA than FMF, so I need to document prior trials of colchicine, NSAIDs, antibiotics, or steroids and the temporal relationship of responses to attacks [^111yWGQ8] [^114t8g39] [^113HfHxg] [^114RUdwM].

> Wait, let me verify the exposure risk profile carefully, because the epidemiology can clinch or refute a tick-borne diagnosis. Many patients do not recall a bite, so I must ask about outdoor activities, hiking or camping in endemic regions, seasonal yard work, hunting, presence of pets that may carry ticks, travel to endemic areas, and any recollection of ticks on skin or clothing; absence of a known bite does not exclude a tick-borne illness, so I should not over-rely on recall here [^116DLQ66] [^113HfHxg].

> I will now examine prior diagnostics and seek red flags. During FMF attacks, inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR rise and typically normalize between episodes, whereas in TBRF, a peripheral smear obtained during fever may directly reveal Borrelia spirochetes; I should also ask about any MEFV genetic testing, while remembering genetic testing supports but does not exclude FMF, screen urine for protein as an amyloidosis sentinel in FMF, and confirm that broader infectious, malignant, and autoimmune causes have been reasonably excluded before applying FMF criteria [^1136Hz4U] [^115Q88zC] [^1134fGQN] [^111yWGQ8] [^116gWuNe].

> But wait, what if features point away from FMF toward other autoinflammatory or infectious syndromes; I should double-check for mouth ulcers, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis that suggest PFAPA, for urticarial or cold-induced rashes that raise cryopyrinopathy, or for migratory myalgias and prolonged febrile episodes that suggest TRAPS or mevalonate kinase deficiency, as these patterns change the downstream testing and therapeutic approach substantially [^114RUdwM] [^116HBTqr] [^114K8wRJ].

> Let me synthesize the picture that favors FMF: multiple months of stereotyped febrile flares lasting 12–72 hours with serositis or acute monoarthritis, complete wellness between attacks, Mediterranean ancestry or positive family history, and a robust colchicine response; in that scenario, I should apply Tel-Hashomer or Livneh criteria, obtain MEFV genetic testing recognizing that it supports but does not exclude diagnosis, trend ESR/CRP during and between episodes, screen urine for proteinuria, and if a clinical diagnosis is made, initiate colchicine while arranging follow-up with an FMF-experienced clinician [^111yWGQ8] [^116gWuNe] [^1134fGQN] [^115iffYt] [^113QzaVC].

> Hold on, I should verify next steps when the gestalt favors a tick-borne process: clear epidemiologic exposure, a compatible rash such as erythema migrans or petechiae, neurologic findings or persistent constitutional symptoms, and absence of FMF history or ethnic risk; there I would obtain a peripheral blood smear during a febrile spike to look for spirochetes in suspected TBRF, send appropriate serologies, and begin empiric doxycycline without delaying for laboratory confirmation, counseling about possible Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions during initial treatment [^115Q88zC] [^113HfHxg].

> I need to ensure a plan for ambiguity because overlap is common. Up to roughly 30% of clinically diagnosed FMF patients lack conclusive genetic evidence, and heterozygous carriers can still manifest disease, so if the picture is mixed or atypical, I should consult an autoinflammatory disease specialist for guidance on genetic interpretation and phenotype integration, continue systematic data collection during and between attacks, and avoid premature closure until the trajectory and responses clarify the diagnosis [^111qQUX9] [^111gf4Ja] [^113PJUGm].

For a patient with relapsing fever, ask about **ethnicity, family history, and colchicine response** to support FMF [^111yWGQ8], and about **tick exposure, travel, and animal contact** to assess tick-borne risk [^113HfHxg]. Characterize the **fever pattern** and associated symptoms (serositis, arthritis, rash); review medication use and immunosuppression [^113kvRAS]; and order CBC, ESR/CRP, LFTs, urinalysis, blood cultures, and MEFV testing [^1134fGQN]. Consider **serology/PCR** for tick-borne pathogens if exposure is possible [^115Q88zC], and use clinical criteria (Tel-Hashomer, Livneh) to guide diagnosis and management [^116gWuNe].

---

## Clinical history

### Demographic and family history

- **Ethnicity**: Mediterranean descent (Armenian, Turkish, Arab, Sephardic Jewish) increases FMF likelihood [^1169cRZm] [^113kvRAS].
- **Family history**: Recurrent fever, serositis, or amyloidosis supports FMF [^113kvRAS].
- **Genetic testing**: MEFV mutations (especially M694V) support FMF but are not definitive alone [^1134fGQN] [^112PVi1s].

---

### Fever characteristics

- **FMF**: Short (12–72 h), self-limited, with symptom-free intervals [^113kvRAS] [^116HBTqr].
- **Tick-borne**: Longer (3–7 d), relapsing, often with chills/rigors [^115Q88zC] [^112gyz97].
- **Pattern**: Regular attacks favor FMF; irregular relapses favor tick-borne disease [^115cW19G].

---

### Associated symptoms

FMF typically presents with serositis (abdominal/chest pain), arthritis (large joints), an erysipelas-like rash, and scrotal pain/swelling [^113kvRAS], whereas **tick-borne** illnesses more often cause headache, myalgia, arthralgia, rash (erythema migrans, petechial, eschar), and neurologic symptoms [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97].

---

### Exposure history

- **Tick exposure**: Bites, outdoor activities, travel to endemic areas [^113HfHxg].
- **Animal contact**: Rodents, livestock, pets [^116DLQ66] [^113HfHxg].
- **Travel**: Recent travel to endemic regions [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97].

---

### Medication and immunosuppression

Medications such as **immunosuppressants or biologics** may predispose to infection [^113kvRAS], and a rapid **colchicine response** that prevents attacks supports FMF [^111yWGQ8].

---

## Physical examination

FMF may show serositis (abdominal/pleuritic), arthritis (large joints), an erysipelas-like rash, and scrotal swelling [^113kvRAS], whereas **tick-borne** illnesses may present with rash (erythema migrans, petechial, eschar) [^113HfHxg], lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic deficits [^112gyz97].

---

## Laboratory and diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **FMF** | **Tick-borne illnesses** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | - Leukocytosis <br/> - Neutrophilia <br/> - Thrombocytosis | - Leukopenia <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Anemia |
| ESR/CRP | Elevated during attacks | Elevated |
| LFTs | Mild elevation | Marked elevation |
| Urinalysis | - Proteinuria <br/> - Hematuria | Usually normal |
| Blood cultures | Negative | Positive in some |
| Serology/PCR | MEFV mutations [^1134fGQN] | - Borrelia <br/> - Rickettsia <br/> - Ehrlichia <br/> - Anaplasma [^113HfHxg] |
| Imaging | - Serositis <br/> - Arthritis | Organ involvement |
| Response to colchicine | Positive [^115iffYt] | Negative |

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The **Tel-Hashomer criteria** include major features (serositis, colchicine response, amyloidosis) and minor features (recurrent fever, erysipelas-like erythema, family history) [^111yWGQ8], and the **Livneh criteria** include typical attacks, colchicine response, and family history [^116gWuNe].

---

## Management considerations

FMF is managed with colchicine as first-line therapy [^115iffYt] [^113kvRAS], with IL-1 inhibitors for colchicine-resistant disease [^114FMcoC], whereas **tick-borne** illnesses are treated with doxycycline or other appropriate antibiotics; early treatment prevents complications [^113HfHxg].

---

## Key questions summary

Ask about **ethnicity and family history** to assess FMF risk [^1169cRZm]; characterize the fever pattern (short, self-limited attacks versus longer, relapsing fevers) [^113kvRAS] [^115Q88zC]; and screen associated symptoms (serositis, arthritis, rash versus headache, myalgia, and neurologic symptoms) [^112gyz97]. Elicit exposure history (tick bites, animal contact, travel) [^113HfHxg] and review medication use (immunosuppressants), and note any colchicine response [^111yWGQ8]. On examination, look for serositis, arthritis, rash, and neurologic deficits; obtain CBC, ESR/CRP, LFTs, urinalysis, blood cultures, and serology/PCR as indicated [^1136Hz4U]; apply Tel-Hashomer or Livneh criteria [^116gWuNe]; and manage with colchicine or IL-1 inhibitors for FMF [^115iffYt] [^114FMcoC] versus appropriate antibiotics for tick-borne disease [^112gyz97]. A structured approach that integrates **history, exam, labs, and criteria** helps distinguish FMF from tick-borne illnesses and guides management.

### Criteria for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever [^116gWuNe]. Arthritis and Rheumatism (1997). High credibility.

The Simplified Livneh Diagnostic Criteria for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a clinical calculator used to diagnose Familial Mediterranean Fever, a hereditary inflammatory disorder. This calculator is applicable to individuals of all ages who present with recurrent febrile episodes and are suspected of having FMF, particularly those of Mediterranean descent, including Armenians, Arabs, Turks, and Jews.

The criteria are clinically useful in identifying patients with FMF, which can help guide appropriate treatment and management strategies. They take into account factors such as the frequency and duration of fever episodes, the presence of specific symptoms like abdominal pain or arthritis, the response to colchicine treatment, and the family history of FMF.

Exclusion criteria for using this calculator include the presence of other conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or other rheumatic diseases. Additionally, the criteria may not be as accurate in populations where FMF is less common.

The diagnostic criteria involve evaluating specific symptoms and responses to treatment, assigning numerical scores to each, to determine if diagnostic criteria for FMF are met. This diagnostic tool takes into account information on eight possible factors:

- **Typical attacks of generalized peritonitis**: Include specific symptoms and response assessments.
- **Typical attacks of unilateral**: Further evaluation is needed for diagnosing FMF based on this symptom.

### Tick-borne disease [^113HfHxg]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne diseases in the United States include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, and relapsing fever. It is important for family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. A petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Various other rashes or skin lesions accompanied by fever and influenza-like illness also may signal the presence of a tick-borne disease.

Early, accurate diagnosis allows treatment that may help prevent significant morbidity and possible mortality. Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases.

### Familial Mediterranean fever: From the clinical syndrome to the cloning of the pyrin gene [^111yWGQ8]. Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology (1998). High credibility.

The Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for the diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is a genetic disorder causing recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, primarily affecting populations of Mediterranean descent such as Armenians, Arabs, Turks, and Jews.

- **Categories of Tel-Hashomer criteria**: The criteria are divided into two categories: major and minor.
	- **Major criteria**: Typical attacks of fever and serositis, response to colchicine treatment, and amyloidosis of AA type without a known cause.
	- **Minor criteria**: Recurrent febrile episodes, erysipelas-like erythema, and a positive family history of FMF.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of FMF, particularly when genetic testing is inconclusive or unavailable. It is also used to guide treatment decisions, as a positive diagnosis may warrant the use of colchicine, a drug that can prevent FMF attacks and complications.

- **Exclusion criteria**: There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria. However, it should be noted that this calculator is less effective in populations where FMF is less common and may not be as accurate in diagnosing atypical or milder forms of the disease.

### Tick-borne relapsing fever [^115Q88zC]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne relapsing fever is characterized by recurring fevers separated by afebrile periods and is accompanied by nonspecific constitutional symptoms. It occurs following a patient has been bitten by a tick infected with a Borrelia spirochete. The diagnosis of tick-borne relapsing fever requires an accurate characterization of the fever and a thorough medical, social, and travel history of the patient. Findings on physical examination are variable; abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered sensorium are the most common symptoms. Laboratory confirmation of tick-borne relapsing fever is made by detection of spirochetes in thin or thick blood smears obtained during a febrile episode. Treatment with a tetracycline or macrolide antibiotic is effective, and antibiotic resistance is rare. Patients treated for tick-borne relapsing fever should be monitored closely for Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Fatalities from tick-borne relapsing fever are rare in treated patients, as are subsequent Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Persons in endemic regions should avoid rodent- and tick-infested areas and use insect repellents and protective clothing to prevent tick bites.

### A taste of periodic fever syndromes [^114K8wRJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Periodic fevers are acquired or inherited disorders of innate immunity, first described in the 1940s. Patients typically present young at onset with regularly recurring fevers lasting a few days to a few weeks, accompanied by systemic inflammatory symptoms and interrupted by symptom-free periods.

A variety of clinical manifestations occur, including gastrointestinal complaints, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Differential diagnosis may include re-infections, other inflammatory disorders, and neoplastic diseases. This clinical review focuses on a sample of autoinflammatory disorders, including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome.

We review the basics, pertinent clinical and laboratory features, and management of each entity.

### The spectrum of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) mutations [^116MU5Gp]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the prototype of a group of inherited inflammatory disorders. The gene (MEFV) responsible for this disease comprises 10 exons and 781 codons. Twenty-nine mutations, most located in the last exon, have been identified so far. It is unclear whether all are true disease-causing mutations. Five founder mutations, V726A, M694V, M694I, M680I, and E148Q, account for 74% of FMF chromosomes from typical cases (Armenians, Arabs, Jews, and Turks). Rare mutations are preferentially found in populations not usually affected by FMF (e.g. Europeans not from the above ancestries).

The various combinations of MEFV mutations define severe to mild genotypes. The trend is that genotypes including two mutations located within mutational 'hot-spots' (codons 680 or 694) of the gene are associated with severe phenotypes, whereas mild phenotypes are associated with some other mutations, E148Q being the mildest and least penetrant. Understanding the correlation between the FMF phenotype and genotype is further obscured by the existence of complex alleles, modifier loci, genetic heterogeneity, and possible epigenetic factors. Additionally, mutations in the MEFV gene are thought to be involved in non-FMF disorders.

Carrier rates for FMF mutations may be as high as 1:3 in some populations, suggesting that the disease is underdiagnosed. This review update emphasizes that both clinical and genetic features are to be taken into account for patient diagnosis, colchicine treatment, and prognosis.

### Mutations in the gene for familial Mediterranean fever: Do they predispose to inflammation [^115UHsnc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003).

The objective of the study was to analyze 70 individuals identified with the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene to determine the presence of definite familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and assess their susceptibility to clinical and laboratory inflammation. Additionally, 72 patients with childhood rheumatic diseases were prospectively evaluated for the presence of MEFV mutations.

- **Methods**: Seventy patients with one MEFV gene mutation were reevaluated using a new set of criteria for the presence of a clinical FMF phenotype. They were questioned about musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatic diseases. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels were measured. A second group, consisting of childhood rheumatic disease patients, was diagnosed following international criteria.

- **Results**: The median age of the 70 heterozygous individuals was 12 years. Approximately one-third (34.3%) were classified with a clinical FMF phenotype based on the suggested criteria. Fifteen individuals (21.4%) were classified as normal, while three (4.3%) experienced abdominal pains without fulfilling all FMF criteria. Overall, 28 (40.0%) exhibited some form of rheumatic complaint, and 15 (21.4%) developed a rheumatic disease, including Behçet's disease, vasculitis, or acute rheumatic fever. The mean ESR and CRP levels were 45.47 ± 33.05 mm/h and 4.00 ± 6.73 mg/dl, respectively. Within the group of 72 childhood rheumatic disease patients, 22 (30.5%) carried one or two mutations of the MEFV gene. The frequency of mutated alleles among patients with rheumatic diseases was significantly higher than in controls (p < 0.05).

### Familial Mediterranean fever in Arabs [^1169cRZm]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases are a group of disorders characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation in the absence of high-titre autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells and include the hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an archetypal autoinflammatory disorder, which is autosomal recessive and has a high prevalence in non-Ashkenazi Jews, Armenians, Turks, and Arabs. The classic clinical picture is characterized by acute short-lived febrile and painful attacks with variable periods of remission. In a subset of patients, the disorder is complicated by amyloidosis that leads to renal failure.

The gene responsible for FMF, MEFV, has been identified, and its role in inflammation is being assessed. There seems to be a distinctive clinical picture in Arab patients with FMF, and the range and distribution of MEFV mutations is different from that noted in other affected ethnic groups. Here, we discuss the clinical and molecular aspects of FMF in Arabs.

### Tick-borne infections [^116DLQ66]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

There are many tick-borne infections that affect children and adolescents in the United States. These illnesses often begin with non-specific flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and myalgia, so obtaining a good travel history is important. Most people do not even realize that they were bitten by a tick, so identification of the specific tick is not necessary. Often, treatment should commence before formal illness identification, as delays may cause more severe disease, and rapid laboratory confirmation is difficult. One of the most important issues is prevention of tick bites with insect repellents, accompanied by thorough tick checks after being outdoors in a tick-infested region.

### Unexplained recurrent fever: When is autoinflammation the explanation [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Fever can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases, including malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines exist for approaching patients with recurrent fever. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases is often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated with a variety of divergent presentations, differentiating other causes of febrile illnesses can be challenging.

In this article, we first review disease entities that frequently present with the symptom of recurrent fever. Next, we summarize their characteristic patterns of disease presentation. Finally, we analyze key features of autoinflammatory diseases, which are helpful in distinguishing this group of diseases from other causes of recurrent fever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

### The differential contribution of MEFV mutant alleles to the clinical profile of familial Mediterranean fever [^114QGtzm]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurring attacks of fever and serositis. Five sequence alterations (M694V, V726A, M680I, M694I, and E148Q) in the MEFV gene account for the majority of FMF chromosomes. The wide clinical variability of the disease has been related to MEFV allelic heterogeneity. M694V homozygotes have a severe form of the disease, while mutations E148Q and V726A have reduced penetrance. The clinical features associated with the M680I and the complex V726A-E148Q allele are not well defined. This study aims to further characterize the phenotypic profile associated with the major MEFV mutations. We investigated 220 FMF patients, in whom both FMF alleles have been identified, and found that different genotypes are characterized by a specific allelic-related clinical profile and penetrance. Homozygotes for the M694V mutation and the complex V726A-E148Q allele are the most severely affected and often endure renal amyloidosis. Homozygotes for the M680I and V726A alleles and compound heterozygotes for either the M694V or the V726A-E148Q alleles in combination with either the E148Q, the V726A, or the M680I alleles are significantly less severely affected. The morbidity associated with the complex V726A-E148Q allele by far outweighs that associated with the V726A allele, providing evidence that the E148Q mutation is not a benign polymorphism. These findings increase our understanding of the role of allelic variability in disease expression.

### Autoinflammatory diseases: A review [^116HBTqr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Autoinflammatory disease (AID) represents a vast spectrum of disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of sterile inflammation. Since the first cloning of the familial Mediterranean fever gene in 1997, there has been a rapid rate of discovery of new AIDs. As of 2022, there have been 485 inborn errors of immunity documented by the International Union of Immunological Societies, many of which display aspects of autoinflammation. The pathophysiology of AIDs is complex. Although many are caused by rare mutations in genes that govern innate immunity, others are polygenic, with disease expression thought to be triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed hosts.

AIDs range in prevalence from common entities like gout to ultra-rare monogenic diseases. Initially studied in pediatric populations, it is now apparent that AIDs can also present in adulthood and even in the elderly. The rarity and heterogeneity in presentation and underlying etiology make AIDs clinically challenging. Although the care of AIDs spans medical disciplines, rheumatologists often play a central role due to the inflammatory nature of these illnesses.

In this review, we explore the pathophysiology of these complex conditions and propose a classification system for AIDs. We emphasize AIDs that present to the adult rheumatologist and discuss important AIDs that can mimic classic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory arthritis. Finally, we offer an approach to the clinical assessment of these conditions.

### EULAR recommendations for the management of familial Mediterranean fever [^112aUvHr]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of familial Mediterranean fever, specifically in relation to chronic arthritis, the 2016 EULAR guidelines recommend considering the initiation of additional medications. These may include DMARDs, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, or biologics for chronic arthritis in patients with FMF.

### Severe liver involvement in two patients with long-term history of fever: Remember familial Mediterranean fever [^116HpEPG]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by recurrent, self-limited fever attacks and serositis. Severe liver involvement has rarely been reported. We present two FMF cases of a 55-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman in whom the prevailing manifestations were unexplained episodes of anicteric hepatitis (man) and severe jaundice (woman). A long-term history of self-limited episodes of fever was also claimed in both.

After the exclusion of infectious, malignant, autoimmune, liver, and biliary diseases, a diagnosis of FMF was confirmed by molecular analysis. The patients started colchicine 1 mg/day with immediate resolution of symptoms. During follow-up, no new episodes of fever and exacerbation of liver biochemical parameters have been recorded for 5 and 1 years, respectively.

Physicians must keep FMF in mind in patients with episodes of unexplained severe liver impairment and fever, especially in regions like the Mediterranean basin where hereditary periodic fever syndromes are common.

### Periodic fever syndromes: Beyond the single gene paradigm [^111gf4Ja]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in Canada and is characterized by a clinical syndrome of episodic inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants; however, FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants, though they are often of unknown clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways, together with gene-environment interactions, including epigenetic modulation, likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease.

We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.

### Pfapa syndrome: A review on treatment and outcome [^114RUdwM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, the steroid response may be useful in distinguishing attacks of PFAPA from familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or other hereditary periodic fever syndromes (HPF) and can be used as an additional criterion for diagnosis. In fact, HPF attacks, except for periodic fever associated with Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD), usually don't show a dramatic response to a single dose of steroids like PFAPA.

- **Reduction of flare frequency**: Colchicine

	- The precise mechanism of action of colchicine in reducing inflammation is unknown. Colchicine binds to tubulin, forming a tubulin-colchicine complex. This complex can change the structure and the function of the cytoskeleton, thereby influencing neutrophil and lymphocyte migration and adhesion. The rationale for the use of colchicine as a prophylactic treatment for PFAPA is based primarily on clinical and laboratory similarities between FMF and PFAPA and the long-term experience with this drug in the treatment of FMF. For these reasons, when colchicine is effective in PFAPA patients, an alternative diagnosis of FMF has to be considered.

In a 6-month open-label, randomized, controlled study, Aviel et al. showed a significant increase in intervals between attacks in 8 PFAPA patients on colchicine therapy compared with 10 patients treated only with corticosteroids. Among the 18 treated patients, 8 carried FMF mutations; 6 out of 8 in the colchicine group and 2 out of 10 in the steroid group.

Padeh et al. described 10 PFAPA patients previously diagnosed as FMF patients; 6 out of 10 were heterozygous for an MEFV gene mutation (M694V).

### Characterization of new mutations in the 5'-flanking region of the familial Mediterranean fever gene [^116fwbKb]. Genes and Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive autoinflammatory disease commonly found in Mediterranean populations. Genetic diagnosis has developed since the discovery of the causative gene MEFV in 1997. As many patients could not be confirmed genetically by routine exon screening, we searched for mutations in the 5'-flanking region of this gene. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, we screened DNA from 108 patients with clinical FMF and 91 asymptomatic individuals. We found six novel sequence variants in a region extending -825 bp upstream of the first translated codon.

To investigate the potential role of these variants in altering MEFV gene expression, we first characterized the MEFV promoter. Promoter mapping assays revealed that the region located between nucleotides -949 and -152 of the initiation codon was important for regulating expression of the gene. We identified a putative enhancer element between -571 and -414. Investigation of the sequence variants found in two patients demonstrated that c.-614C > G resulted in a 70% decrease in promoter activity, whereas c.-382C > T induced a 100% increase in activity compared to the wild type. We observed specific DNA-protein binding to both wild-type sites, suggesting that transcription factors may bind to these sequences to modulate MEFV expression.

### Familial Mediterranean fever — a review [^111hPiXr]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There are two phenotypes: types 1 and 2. Familial Mediterranean fever type 1 is characterized by recurrent short episodes of inflammation and serositis, including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to renal failure, is the most severe complication.

Familial Mediterranean fever type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Routine treatment of end-stage renal disease, including renal transplantation, is advised. Lifelong treatment with colchicine is required for homozygotes of the p. Met694Val mutation or compound heterozygotes for p. Met694Val and another disease-causing allele; this prevents inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid.

Individuals who do not have the p. Met694Val mutation and who are only mildly affected should either be treated with colchicine or monitored every six months for the presence of proteinuria. Molecular genetic testing of the MEFV gene, the only gene currently known to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever, can be offered to family members, especially when the p. Met694Val allele is present, because renal amyloidosis can be prevented by colchicine.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^115cnGVE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Our knowledge regarding Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) has undergone notable changes within the past 10 years. Molecular tools have allowed us to better discriminate rickettsial species and subspecies of the spotted fever group (SFG). We now know that more than one rickettsiosis can be present in the same country. Patients who have been included in series of MSF cases may have had other rickettsioses. Moreover, MSF has a wider distribution than previously described. The disease has emerged and re-emerged in several countries in the Mediterranean basin.

New clinical features, such as multiple eschars, previously suggested in the early description, have now been confirmed in MSF. MSF is becoming an increasingly severe disease with death rates ranging from 3.2% to 32%. However, questions persist regarding the vector and reservoir for this disease, which need to be addressed.

### Mediterranean spotted fever with multiorgan involvement [^113Zu3er]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Human rickettsial diseases are caused by bacteria of different genera, including but not limited to Rickettsia, Orientia, Neorickettsia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma. Almost all rickettsial diseases are transmitted by an arthropod vector. Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) is part of the spotted fever group, which includes Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Rickettsial diseases can present a spectrum of symptoms ranging from self-limiting, mild symptoms to severe illness, making clinical differentiation challenging. Important differential diagnoses, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), West Nile virus, and leptospirosis, can have clinical symptoms similar to MSF. Therefore, expert laboratory diagnosis is invaluable. However, positive serology may be misleading due to cross-reactivity with other rickettsial species like Rickettsia typhi, the causative agent of murine typhus. This can complicate diagnosis, especially since both diseases are endemic to the Mediterranean basin.

### A delayed diagnosis: Recurrent fever and beta thalassaemia [^112tDcgc]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever and beta-thalassaemia are two genetic disorders with a largely common geographical distribution. However, they have little else in common, as the first is an autoinflammatory disorder, while the other is a haemoglobinopathy. We describe a patient with known beta-thalassaemia intermedia who presented with recurrent fevers and was diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever two years later. We discuss whether there is an association between the two disorders and the cognitive biases that led to the delay in the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever.

### Recurrent peripheral facial palsy in a child with familial Mediterranean fever [^115oy8sq]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Peripheral facial palsy is uncommon in children. It primarily occurs as an idiopathic disorder and, to a lesser extent, in the setting of some infectious, genetic, or systemic disorders. However, its association with familial Mediterranean fever has not been reported before.

- **Case presentation**: We present a 14-year-old girl who experienced three episodes of right-sided peripheral facial palsy during a 9-month interval. She had a diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (homozygous with M694V mutation) and had been receiving colchicine for 8 years. Peripheral facial palsy could be a neurological manifestation of vasculitis in familial Mediterranean fever.

- **Conclusion**: Peripheral facial palsy may be a manifestation of familial Mediterranean fever in children.

### Patient management and the association of less common familial Mediterranean fever symptoms with other disorders [^11467oZS]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we present clinical data from 16,000 familial Mediterranean fever patients, discussing the clinical manifestations of a subset and their potential symptom associations with other disorders.

- **Methods**: Familial Mediterranean fever patients were confirmed using Tel-Hashomer criteria and were tested for the 12 most common mutations using the familial Mediterranean fever StripAssay. A total of 100 samples were selected, and their MEFV gene exons and intron junctions were completely sequenced.

- **Results**: We observed that in children, severe phenotypes with polyserositis, erysipelas-like erythema, splenomegaly, and vasculitis are associated with high penetrance of exon 10 mutations, particularly M694V. Several forms of arthritis were associated with familial Mediterranean fever, including acute mono/oligoarthritis in the lower extremities, destructive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, arthritis of the hip joint, and juvenile chronic arthritis. Severe life-threatening complications, such as adhesive intestinal obstruction and renal amyloidosis, and uncommon/rare symptoms were sometimes the only form of familial Mediterranean fever manifestation.

- **Conclusion**: We suggest performing familial Mediterranean fever genetic testing for patients presenting with rare or uncommon symptoms also common in other disorders, to prevent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. In our experience, the most effective patient management for familial Mediterranean fever was its rapid diagnosis through genetic testing and initiation of colchicine therapy.

### Improvement of MEFV gene variants classification to aid treatment decision making in familial Mediterranean fever [^113Uatjy]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Next, we used REVEL, which has been demonstrated to outperform most of the available predictors, to score both classified and unclassified variants of the MEFV gene. When using the originally reported best threshold, REVEL scores were almost perfect in identifying the benign and likely benign variants (97.2%), while only 13 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (31.7%) demonstrated a score above the threshold for pathogenicity. We hypothesized that mechanisms conferring pathogenic effects to MEFV variants are subtler than mechanisms of disease-causing variants used to train many prediction algorithms, including REVEL.

Indeed, the reasons why MEFV variants cause symptom onset are poorly understood. In a mouse model, human MEFV knock-in variants act as gain-of-function mutations, although severity varied inversely with respect to human phenotypes. More recently, in FMF patients, a small set of MEFV pathogenic variants have been shown to act as hypermorphic mutations with a gene dosage effect. Surprisingly, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that FMF mutations (including M694V) render pyrin inflammasome insensitive to colchicine, while this drug is the mainstay treatment in FMF patients. Although many variants with a putatively pathogenic role lie in the C-terminus of the pyrin protein, no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have emerged so far.

A further proof of the complex mechanisms leading to pathogenicity in FMF is demonstrated by the markedly different REVEL scores for variants affecting the same amino acid. For instance, the well-known polymorphism E148Q has a REVEL.

### Improvement of MEFV gene variants classification to aid treatment decision making in familial Mediterranean fever [^117VFbm4]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The development of reliable functional assays able to assess precisely the effects of MEFV gene variants on the pyrin inflammasome should also help in expanding the set of variants with a robust classification. The ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines recommend that the usage of in silico predictors should have only a supporting role in establishing the pathogenic role of variants identified during genetic testing. In addition, these widely followed guidelines suggest that concordance among multiple algorithm-based predictions should be sought. However, while several metapredictors incorporating many of these older algorithms have been demonstrated to perform robustly in large heterogeneous datasets, first-generation algorithms such as SIFT, Polyphen, Mutation Taster, CADD, and Provean are still used even in recent work.

A further consideration should be mentioned about the thresholds used from the in silico tools to predict functional consequences. Most of these predictors return both a score and a prediction for the submitted variant. However, many others simply return a numeric value without any suggestion on the forecasted impact. Therefore, it is up to the submitters to frame the returned score in a putative pathogenic classification and translate it into clinical recommendations for specialists and patients. REVEL belongs to the second class of predictors, and two different threshold values for pathogenicity have been proposed by authors using this metapredictor in their studies, while a threshold was not given in the original paper.

In this work, we identified a MEFV gene-specific…

### Reliability of a generative artificial intelligence tool for pediatric familial Mediterranean fever: Insights from a multicentre expert survey [^112QqZW5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the growing interest in understanding the possibilities of AI for medical scope, particularly for rare diseases such as FMF, there is currently no consensus from medical organizations on related benefits and risks. Our multicentric survey aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a popular generative AI tool for inquiries about pediatric FMF. Several considerations can be made about the responses provided; for example, despite the fact that responses are generally fluent, well-written, and rich in detail, information is often inaccurate or incomplete.

- **AI's definition of FMF**: When prompted about what FMF is, the AI tool responded that "genetic testing is not the only way to diagnose FMF" (response 1 A). According to the EuroFever/PRINTO classification criteria, this definition could be acceptable. However, it should be specified that genetic investigations should always be performed when available to achieve a diagnosis with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than clinical classification criteria.

- **Inheritance pattern**: The AI repeated in various responses (responses 1B, 2B, 2C, etc) that "people with FMF inherit a faulty copy of this gene from each parent" or "this mutation is passed from parents to their children in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must be carriers for a child to have the disease". Nevertheless, patients with a heterozygous phenotype with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants may be diagnosed with FMF.

Other inaccuracies could be found, such as "the gene mutation causes pyrin to be".

### Familial Mediterranean fever without fever as a cause of monoarthritis [^113DsbkZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease. FMF-related arthritis affects large joints, especially in the lower extremities. It starts with acute pain and swelling, affecting one joint at a time. Fever is the most common symptom in FMF. Monoarthritis as the sole symptom is relatively rare and led to a delayed diagnosis of the disease in a patient who had been suffering from monoarthritis for several years. Genetic analysis showing typical mutations in the patient eventually resulted in a correct diagnosis, although classical clinical diagnostic criteria were not met. The patient received appropriate therapy with colchicine, which led to remission of the symptoms.

### Familial Mediterranean fever: breaking all the (genetic) rules [^116urpAM]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by attacks of painful periodic fever caused by diffuse serositis and a risk of secondary amyloidosis due to IL-1β-mediated inflammation. The disease appears to be transmitted through autosomal recessive mutations in the MEFV gene encoding the pyrin protein. Although more than 300 variants have been reported worldwide so far, their association with symptom severity, the relative frequencies in different populations, and the disease penetrance are far from being completely understood. We investigated genotype-phenotype correlations in two large nuclear families and verified whether commonly used web-based tools can usefully predict variant pathogenicity in FMF.

- **Methods**: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 15 patients of two families who had been diagnosed with FMF according to international criteria. The entire MEFV coding region was sequenced in all subjects, and 179 MEFV variants were surveyed with five different pathogenicity predictors.

- **Results**: The inheritance of FMF could not be explained by traditional autosomal recessivity in both families. In silico tools demonstrated a significant association of variants' pathogenicity with their position along the coding sequence but not with variants' frequency.

- **Conclusion**: By describing two large families with paradigmatic complexity of FMF genetics, we conclude that established concepts in assessing the causative role of variants identified in mutation screening cannot be easily translated into appropriate genetic counselling in FMF.

### Canakinumab for the treatment of autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes [^114FMcoC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known as the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic autoinflammatory diseases characterized by recurrent fever flares.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with genetically confirmed colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, or TRAPS at the time of a flare to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a resolution of their flare received an add-on injection of 150 mg of canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete response (resolution of flare and no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase up to week 40, patients who had a complete response underwent a second randomization to receive canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second randomization and had a subsequent flare, and all other patients, received open-label canakinumab.

- **Results**: At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab had a complete response than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (P < 0.001), 35% vs. 6% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P = 0.003), and 45% vs. 8% of those with TRAPS (P = 0.006). The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks yielded a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with TRAPS.

### Evaluation of common mutations in the Mediterranean fever gene in multiple sclerosis patients: Is it a susceptibility gene [^1134nPyY]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by multiple areas of inflammation and demyelination in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. The MEFV gene, which is the main factor in familial Mediterranean fever, is an intracellular regulator of inflammation. This study was designed to determine if known mutations in the pyrin domain of the MEFV gene are involved in MS and associated with MS morbidity.

- **Methods**: Fifty-three patients with MS and 66 healthy subjects, all of whom were Turkish, were included in this study. Five pyrin gene mutations (E148Q, M680I, M694V, M694I, and V726A) were detected in the patients and controls using the PRONTO FMF Basic Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

- **Results**: Pyrin gene mutations were found in 20 of the 53 MS patients (38%) and in seven of the 66 healthy subjects (11%). The frequency of total pyrin domain mutations was significantly higher in the MS patients than in the healthy subjects (p < 0.0001). The frequencies of M694V, E148Q, and V726A mutations were significantly higher in the patients than in the healthy subjects (p = 0.02, p = 0.013, and p = 0.004, respectively). The mean time to reach an EDSS score of 3.0 was earlier in the patients with MEFV gene mutation (p = 0.02), and the relapse rate was slightly higher among the MS patients carrying the MEFV gene mutation (p = 0.04).

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study supported the hypothesis that MS patients with MEFV mutation seem to have the susceptibility to develop a more progressive disease. Moreover, these data suggest that MEFV mutations may increase.

### Performance of different diagnostic criteria for familial Mediterranean fever in children with periodic fevers: Results from a multicenter international registry [^116qnE6o]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to validate the pediatric diagnostic criteria in a large international registry and compare them with previous criteria for diagnosing familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

- **Methods**: Pediatric patients with FMF from the Eurofever registry were used to validate the existing criteria. Other periodic fevers served as controls: mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome (PFAPA), and undefined periodic fever from the same registry. The performances of Tel Hashomer, Livneh, and the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria were assessed.

- **Results**: The FMF group included 339 patients. The control group consisted of 377 patients: 53 with TRAPS, 45 with MKD, 32 with CAPS, 160 with PFAPA, and 87 with undefined periodic fevers. Patients with FMF were correctly diagnosed using the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria with a sensitivity rate of 87.4% and a specificity rate of 40.7%. In contrast, the Tel Hashomer and Livneh criteria displayed sensitivities of 45.0% and 77.3%, respectively. Both criteria exhibited better specificity than the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria, with 97.2% for the Tel Hashomer and 41.1% for the Livneh criteria. The overall accuracy for the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria was 65% and 69.6% when using 2 and 3 criteria, respectively. Ethnicity and residence had no effect on the performance of the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria.

The Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria offered better sensitivity but the conclusion is missing because the sentence is cut off.

### Familial Mediterranean fever: An unusual case presentation [^115SU6mP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever is a heritable illness typically characterized by recurring fevers and serositis. Triggers of this illness include various factors such as cold or stress.

- **Case**: This case describes a teenager who initially presented to the gynecologist's office because of recurring fevers with menses. Because she only had symptoms during menses, was healthy between attacks, and met the Livneh criteria, treatment with colchicine and combined oral contraceptive pills was initiated, resulting in an improvement of her symptoms.

- **Summary and conclusion**: There are multiple etiologies for febrile illness during menses, and one should consider familial Mediterranean fever as a possible cause of cyclic fevers.

### Familial Mediterranean fever is no longer a rare disease in Italy [^115PJfZi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of fever with abdominal, chest, or joint pain and erysipelas-like erythema. It is an ethnically restricted genetic disease, found commonly among Mediterranean populations, as well as Armenians, Turks, Arabs, and Jews. Traditionally, Italians have been considered little affected by FMF, despite the geographical position of Italy (northern Mediterranean basin) and migratory changes in its population. The objective was to characterize the demographic, clinical, and genetic features of FMF in Italy.

Patients of Italian origin were recruited from those referred to Italian-French medical centers for fever of unknown origin (FUO) or 'surgical' emergencies. Clinical history, genealogy, and physical examination were recorded, and all other possible infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases were excluded. Mutational analysis of the gene responsible for FMF (MEFV on 16p13.3) was performed, after which geno-phenotypical correlations were established.

Italian FMF patients, 40 women and 31 men, aged from 3 to 75 years, have shown all the clinical manifestations indicative of FMF described in the literature, but with a lower incidence of amyloidosis. The genetic tests have been contributive in 42% of cases. The frequency of each different mutation has been similar to that found in a series of 'endemic' countries. The geno-phenotypical correlations have suggested the existence of genetic and/or environmental modifier factors. Among Italians, FMF seems to be more frequent.

### Unresolved issues in familial Mediterranean fever: Is p.R202Q MEFV variant potentially pathogenetic in unleashing inflammation [^114iP7wv]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes for pyrin. Although genetic testing is commonly employed for FMF diagnosis, the interpretation of genetic results is often challenging. Therefore, we aimed to functionally characterize the p.R202Q MEFV alteration. Furthermore, we hypothesized that inflammation may affect genomic stability and neutrophilic subsets.

A cohort comprising patients with FMF (n = 4), p.R202Q variant (n = 18), and FMF-like (n = 8) were selected from the Outpatient Clinic for Autoinflammatory Diseases of Padova University Hospital. Primary monocytes were incubated for 3 hours in the presence of LPS or LPS+PKN1/2 inhibitor (UCN-01). Colchicine pretreatment was applied to assess its anti-inflammatory effect.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA, and leukocytes were examined using May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining on blood smears. We did not find significant differences in IL-1 and IL-18 levels in monocytes treated with LPS+UCN-01 between p.R202Q patients and healthy donors (HDs). The levels of IL-1β released from LPS-stimulated patients were higher in p.R202Q patients than in HDs. We found that immature and hypersegmented neutrophils were higher in p.R202Q patients than in HDs. Nuclear abnormalities were higher in FMF and p.R202Q patients than in HDs. Finally, we found a higher cell rate in leukocytes from p.R202Q patients than in HDs.

The p.R202Q variant did not appear to affect pyrin function, albeit these patients presented cytological alterations similar to those observed in FMF patients. These changes may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis in FMF and related conditions.

### Familial Mediterranean fever [^115Pfdmj]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the oldest and most common of the hereditary autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). A large body of information has been accumulated over recent years on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an up-to-date summary of the clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of FMF.

- **Recent findings**: An overview of the pathophysiologic basis of FMF, as part of the AID landscape, is provided. Over the past year, notable efforts were made to establish new criteria for childhood FMF, along with new guidelines for the treatment and follow-up of the disease. Additionally, novel treatment strategies have been proposed. A comparison of different disease severity scores, for research purposes, suggests the need for a new scoring system. New evidence supports anti-interleukin-1 blockade as an emerging treatment modality.

- **Summary**: New diagnostic criteria, a disease severity score, and treatment and follow-up guidelines have been proposed, which will require validation in the coming years.

### Unresolved issues in familial Mediterranean fever: Is p.R202Q MEFV variant potentially pathogenetic in unleashing inflammation [^111C1p6R]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Subjects**: Four patients with genetically confirmed FMF, along with eighteen with the p.R202Q MEFV variation and eight patients with FMF-like conditions with K695R, E148Q, or E195D variations were chosen from the outpatient clinic for autoinflammatory diseases. Sanger sequencing was employed to assess the carriage of the variations in the MEFV, MVK, and TNFRSF1A genes. The carriers of the p.R202Q variant (NM_000243.3) were selected based on the presence of reFever and clinical manifestations as requested by TelHashomer Criteria. The potential carriage of MEFV variations was not assessed in healthy donors (HDs). Demographical data, clinical features, and genetics of patients are depicted in Table 1. All FMF patients fulfilled the Tel HaShomer criteria for FMF and had at least one mutation in the MEFV gene. Blood samples were collected during the follow-up visit. Eighteen HDs were included in the study and were not affected by relevant comorbidities. Blood samples from HDs were drawn on the same day as patients. All subjects gave their fully informed written consent to participate in the study, which was carried out in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol follows the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Padova University Hospital (protocol code 5349/AO/22).

- **Table 1**
Demographical data, clinical features, and genetics of FMF, FMF-like, and p.R202Q patients are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). The p-value was calculated according to the Kruskal–Wallis test, with Dunn's post hoc test.

### Periodic fever syndromes: Beyond the single gene paradigm [^117KmEib]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Many heritable monogenic autoinflammatory diseases present with recurrent fever episodes, often beginning in childhood. These disorders, characterized by clinical and biological evidence of inflammation in the absence of antigen-specific immunity, include familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes, and mevalonate kinase deficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome.

FMF is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease worldwide and in Canada, characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of fever and inflammation involving serous and synovial membranes. Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, its prevalence is highest among populations of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin, and it is variable in other populations; the exact prevalence of this condition is uncertain. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and further supported by genetic testing for disease-associated variants in the MEFV gene. MEFV encodes pyrin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein that senses perturbations in intracellular homeostasis, such as microbial inactivation of Rho GTPases. Its association with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) leads to activation of a multiprotein inflammasome complex and downstream production of the potent pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and synovial fibroblasts. Recent data suggest a key role for the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^112w4GVu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

- **Fluctuation of incidence**: Incidence of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) in Italy and Portugal, and of Rocky Mounted spotted fever (RMSF) in the United States varies by year. In the United States, the disease is now in its third emergence since 1920, after peaking from 1939 to 1949, and again from 1974 to 1984.

- **Causes of variations**: The causes of variations in the incidence of MSF and other SFG rickettsioses remain unknown. In most countries, no national epidemiologic surveillance of MSF cases is conducted. Only Italy and Portugal have a formal, albeit passive and non-mandatory, surveillance program. Consequently, reported cases often depend on observers and external factors, such as the need for international publications. For example, the marked increase in MSF cases in Oran, Algeria, is primarily due to the renewed interest in the disease by one physician.

- **Surveillance and diagnosis**: Although countries with surveillance programs observe temporal variations, the study of MSF incidence is limited by the use of nonspecific serologic tests, which may include other SFG rickettsioses. In Oran, specific tests such as Western blot and molecular tools identify R. conorii conorii as the primary etiologic agent of SFG rickettsioses.

### 8th international congress of familial Mediterranean fever and systemic autoinflammatory diseases [^116oZ6MS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Within the 5 Mb region identified from the homozygosity mapping, a missense variant of interest in a mitochondrial chaperone-like protein was discovered. This variant segregated with the disease in the family and was rare or absent in ethnically matched and other healthy controls. Knockdown of this gene in macrophage-like THP1 cells led to increased mitochondrial ROS production, while overexpression of the wild-type protein resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial ROS, an effect not observed with mutant protein overexpression.

### Unresolved issues in familial Mediterranean fever: Is p.R202Q MEFV variant potentially pathogenetic in unleashing inflammation [^111qQUX9]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

The association between mutations in the MEFV gene and FMF was reported for the first time in 1997. It has been shown that variants in exon 10 account for almost 80% of typical FMF cases. Genetic analysis may be performed to confirm FMF diagnosis since it increases the sensitivity of the criteria recently proposed by Eurofever/PRINTO; however, the previous diagnostic criteria did not include genetic testing as part of the normal work-up. Indeed, there is a lack of conclusive genetic evidence for around 30% of patients diagnosed with clinical FMF.

This study focused on the p.R202Q gene variation, which is commonly considered a polymorphism according to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD); currently, there are limited data about the significance of this alteration. However, recent studies have shown that it may be a disease-causing mutation.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of MEFV p.R202Q alteration in a cohort of patients who received a diagnosis of probable FMF based on Tel Hashomer criteria. In these patients, we evaluated several aspects linked to inflammasome activation and inflammation: the patients' clinical profile, the alteration of plasma cytokines, the response of monocytes/whole blood to PKN inhibition, and finally, the cytological evaluation of leukocytes.

Our p.R202Q carriers indeed shared clinical similarities with canonical FMF, including a positive response to colchicine, with no differences between p.R202Q homozygous or heterozygous patients.

We observed a marked increase in IL-1β levels both in FMF and FMF-like patients.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^117Wfqki]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Recent work based on the Eurofever registry — a large international registry of autoinflammatory diseases — has proposed new provisional clinical classification criteria with high sensitivity and specificity based on a gold standard defined by the presence of two MEFV mutations. The criteria include fever episodes lasting less than two days, accompanied by symptoms of chest pain and/or abdominal pain together with Eastern or North Mediterranean ethnicity. Patients should not have aphthous stomatitis, urticarial rash, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and episodes may not last more than six days. While these criteria remain provisional, other published classification criteria have been developed based on expert opinion and description of clinical manifestations in populations of limited ethnic diversity. The overlap among clinical features has led to low performance when applied to patients with different autoinflammatory diseases.

Given that there are overlapping symptoms among familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and a number of polygenic autoinflammatory diseases — including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and Behçet disease — it is often challenging to make a purely clinical diagnosis of FMF. This is particularly the case in regions such as North America, where FMF is rare and may be milder or present atypically. Some patients may also be mistakenly diagnosed with autoinflammatory or autoimmune syndromes that have overlapping clinical features.

### Tick-borne illnesses: A CME update [^114vYBex]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

North American tick-borne illnesses are a group of important emerging diseases whose incidence has been increasing for the past decade. Emergency physicians may be the first contact for patients with symptoms of tick-borne illness; thus, it is important that these diseases remain on a physician's differential diagnosis when presented with an appropriate clinical presentation. This CME activity provides an overview of the most common tick-borne illnesses in North America and will help physicians evaluate their clinical presentation, order appropriate diagnostic tests, develop pediatric treatment recommendations, and prepare to include tick-borne illnesses in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients presenting with multisystem disease.

### Update in familial Mediterranean fever [^112fyfFf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the prototypic autoinflammatory disease. Although the gene associated with the disease was identified 24 years ago, we still have much to learn about the pathogenesis of its inflammation and the variation in the phenotype. In this review, we discuss some recent findings in FMF, such as changes in our understanding of the genetics, aims to define new criteria, and factors contributing to the disease presentation.

- **Recent findings**: We have finally learned why a mutation causing this disease was selected in ancient times; MEFV gene mutations confer resistance to the microbe of plague. A group of experts has outlined recommendations for the analysis of the genetics of FMF. These recommendations complement the new classification criteria, which include genetic results. In the past year, a number of studies have addressed the contributing factors to the inflammation caused by the mutations in pyrin; this has included epigenetic studies as well. Finally, we now have long-term data for the use of anti-IL1 treatment in colchicine-resistant patients.

- **Summary**: We have recommendations for assessing genetic analysis of the MEFV gene and how to reliably classify a patient as FMF. We await further data to understand the contributing genetic and environmental factors that affect the inflammation and final phenotype in FMF and the extent of the disease presentation.

### Old paradigms and new concepts in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): An update 2023 [^113dfEnA]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and polyserositis. Its first description as a new entity was published by Siegal in 1945. Colchicine has been the treatment of choice for this disease since 1972. Significant progress has been made over the years in understanding FMF's clinical features, diagnosis, mode of inheritance, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approach. However, many old paradigms related to FMF have proven inaccurate, leading to the emergence of new concepts that provide more precise insights.

- **Disease terminology and diagnosis**: The term 'FMF' is no longer appropriate, as the disease is found beyond the Mediterranean basin. The concept of diagnosis based only on clinical grounds has proven to be incorrect.

- **Genetic insights**: The paradigm that MEFV mutations in FMF lead to a loss of function of the encoded peptide pyrin turned out to be a gain of function mutation.

- **Therapeutic approach**: The belief that, as a genetic disease, FMF should be treated for life was found to be inaccurate for the subpopulation of heterozygote patients.

Thus, the breakthroughs of identifying the gene associated with the disease (MEFV) and deciphering its pathogenesis have revolutionized our old paradigms, replacing them with new and more precise insights.

### Symptomatic patients with P369S-R408Q mutations: Familial Mediterranean fever or mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome [^112wMskf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old South African female of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was admitted with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and fever. She had experienced vague abdominal and calf pains for 30 years. Her monozygotic twin was investigated independently for recurrent abdominal pain. Despite initially responding to antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, she developed recurrent fevers and pleuritic chest pain. After thorough investigation without significant findings, she re-attended days after discharge with similar symptoms.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was suggested as she met diagnostic criteria and responded to colchicine, though FMF normally presents before 20 years old. Genetic testing showed no pathogenic mutations but revealed heterozygous P369S and R408Q mutations. The significance of these mutations remains unclear, as they are found in asymptomatic patients, suggesting incomplete penetrance. She remains well, with full symptom resolution, but mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome may be a more appropriate diagnosis in symptomatic patients with both P369S and R408Q mutations.

### Evidence-based recommendations for genetic diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever [^113D8nax]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for familial Mediterranean fever, specifically in the context of genetic testing, the SHARE initiative 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining close monitoring and considering initiating treatment in individuals with two pathogenic mutations for FMF. This is advised even without symptoms but with risk factors for AA amyloidosis, such as the country of origin, family history, and persistently elevated inflammatory markers, particularly serum amyloid A protein.

### Familial Mediterranean fever is commonly diagnosed in children in Israel with periodic fever aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome [^115dj5CD]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To describe a cohort of pediatric patients diagnosed with periodic fever aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), we compared them with children diagnosed solely with PFAPA (sPFAPA).

- **Study design**: Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data of all pediatric patients diagnosed with sPFAPA or PFAPA/FMFA were retrospectively collected from two primary Israeli medical referral centers and compared.

- **Results**: Of 270 patients with PFAPA, more than half were of Mediterranean ancestry. Among patients with PFAPA, 51 (18.9%) were also diagnosed with FMF (PFAPA/FMFA). Genetic data on the nine most common MEFV variants were available for 45 children (88%) in the PFAPA/FMFA group. In this group, two variants were found in 15 children (33.3%), one variant in 27 patients (60%), and three patients (6.6%) had no variants. Abdominal pain, myalgia, and arthralgia were more commonly reported in the PFAPA/FMFA group compared with the sPFAPA group (90% vs. 49% [p < 0.0001]; 46% vs. 23% [P = 0.02], and 30% vs. 17% [P = 0.049], respectively). Colchicine was more commonly prescribed for the PFAPA/FMFA group compared with the sPFAPA group (82% vs. 29%; p < 0.0001), though the alleviation of PFAPA symptoms with colchicine was similar between groups (75% vs. 63%; p = 0.23).

- **Conclusion**: We show a strong association between two common autoinflammatory syndromes, PFAPA and FMF, in patients of Mediterranean ancestry. Clinicians should be aware that the presentation of one disease may clinically evolve into another. The association between PFAPA and FMF poses questions about similar pathogenesis.

### Recurrent fevers of unknown origin [^112DjDK3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever of unknown origin is often caused by rare diseases, and many cases remain unexplained. The very limited literature available does not allow for the construction of a diagnostic algorithm. A number of general principles should be kept in mind before starting the investigation for this rare subtype of fever of unknown origin.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^115DJ26p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in Canada and is characterized by a clinical syndrome of episodic inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants; yet, FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing have led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown clinical significance.

Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways — together with gene-environment interactions, including epigenetic modulation — likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease. We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.

### Autoinflammatory manifestations in adult patients [^117HnyuB]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common hereditary systemic autoinflammatory disease. It is caused by autosomal recessive gain-of-function mutations of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, which encodes for pyrin, a cytosolic sensor capable of inducing inflammasome assembly (thus called the pyrin inflammasome). Approximately 90% of patients with FMF develop symptoms before the third decade of life; however, the presence of low-penetrance or de novo mutations may result in later disease onset.

The disease typically presents with sporadic and recurrent episodes of fever, lasting from a few hours to a few days, associated with serositis as manifested by acute abdominal or chest pain. Other manifestations include arthritis or arthralgia of large joints, which in general is unilateral, and the development of erysipelas-like erythema of the lower limbs. Adult-onset FMF seems to bear a milder clinical presentation, with a lower occurrence of arthritis and erysipelas-like erythema.

Diagnosis of FMF can be formulated using the clinical criteria published by Livneh et al. Nevertheless, genetic analyses demonstrating mutations in the MEFV gene are mandatory for a definitive diagnosis. Amyloidosis is the most severe complication and the major cause of mortality in patients with FMF, occurring in a high proportion of untreated patients. Colchicine represents the cornerstone of treatment for FMF, although some patients are refractory to standard treatment. Anakinra has proved to be very effective in the treatment of refractory cases.

### A new set of criteria for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever in childhood [^112XVVq8]. Rheumatology (2009). High credibility.

The Yalcinkaya-Ozen's diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) in children. Familial Mediterranean Fever is a genetic autoinflammatory disorder that causes recurrent fevers and painful inflammation of the abdomen, chest, and joints. This calculator is particularly useful in pediatric populations where FMF is suspected, especially in regions where the disease is prevalent, such as the Mediterranean region.

The Yalcinkaya-Ozen's diagnostic criteria includes parameters such as typical clinical symptoms, response to colchicine treatment, and presence of MEFV mutations. It helps clinicians to establish a diagnosis of FMF, particularly in cases where genetic testing is not available or inconclusive.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include the presence of other diseases that can mimic FMF symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or other rheumatic diseases. Additionally, it may not be as applicable in populations where FMF is rare.

The evaluator for childhood familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) explores two key aspects: symptoms and family history. These inputs help determine the likelihood of meeting the diagnostic criteria for FMF.

- **How the evaluation works**
- **Symptoms frequency and duration**: Users are asked if they've had at least three episodes of specific symptoms, each lasting between 6 and 72 hours: Fever (Text continues but is cut off here).

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^1163vdXz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Typical eschar and spots can be found on the leg of a patient with Mediterranean spotted fever. Eschars are rarely multiple; however, this observation was reported in the early description of the disease by Olmer. More recently, two studies in Sicily found multiple eschars in 7 (1.08%) of 645 children and in 6 (1.4%) of 415 children, respectively. Studies in Spain identified multiple eschars in 3%–11.5% of patients, involving a higher percentage of children. These findings should be interpreted with caution, as the role of R. aeschlimannii circulating in Hyalomma spp. in Spain must be considered in connection with cases of multiple eschars.

Indeed, Rh. sanguineus has a low probability of biting humans, and the infection rate by rickettsiae is low (< 10%). Accordingly, the likelihood of being bitten simultaneously by several infected Rh. sanguineus is low. Conversely, H. marginatum ticks readily bite humans, leading to multiple simultaneous tick bites. In Spain, Fernandez-Soto et al. reported R. aeschlimannii in six tick species that frequently feed on humans; a total of 4,049 ticks were removed from 3,685 asymptomatic patients. In this study, R. conorii conorii was isolated from only one Rh. sanguineus. In this context, we can hypothesize that spotted fever cases acquired in southern Europe, associated with several eschars, may be caused by R. aeschlimannii. Nevertheless, multiple eschars also occur in MSF. In 2004, our laboratory confirmed a diagnosis of MSF in 9 patients using PCR. Among these patients, 3 had multiple eschars, and 2 of the 3 exhibited a severe form of the disease.
