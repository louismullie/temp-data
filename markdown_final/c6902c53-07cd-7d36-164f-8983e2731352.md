## Question

Oral antibiotics to treat stye

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral antibiotics are appropriate to treat a stye and, if so, which agents and regimens to use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a stye is and whether it is an abscess or a cellulitis. Then, I should verify the standard of care and whether topical therapy suffices. Next, I will check for any evidence supporting oral antibiotics and weigh benefits versus harms. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where oral therapy might be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with clear red flags and follow-up advice.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its usual management. A stye, or hordeolum, is an acute focal infection of the eyelid margin, typically Staphylococcus aureus, and it behaves like a small abscess or focal cellulitis of the eyelid. Wait, let me verify the standard approach: warm compresses and eyelid hygiene are first-line, and most cases resolve without systemic antibiotics, which aligns with general ophthalmic practice patterns and the principle that localized superficial infections are managed conservatively unless there is spreading cellulitis or systemic involvement [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm whether any high-quality evidence supports oral antibiotics for styes. I need to check the provided references for randomized trials, guidelines, or systematic reviews specific to hordeolum. Hmm, wait a minute, I do not see any RCTs, guidelines, or reviews in the supplied materials that recommend routine oral antibiotics for styes, which is consistent with the absence of supportive evidence in standard ophthalmic care summaries and stewardship frameworks for localized infections [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the rationale against routine oral antibiotics. Localized superficial infections have limited systemic penetration of oral agents to the site of infection, whereas warm compresses promote drainage and topical therapy achieves high local concentrations. I should double-check the principle: topical therapy delivers concentrations 100–1000 times higher than systemic therapy at the site, which is why topical antibiotics are preferred for superficial ocular surface and lid margin infections when indicated, and adding systemic therapy rarely improves outcomes in uncomplicated cases [^45aa076f].

> I will now examine potential harms of unnecessary oral antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics carry risks such as gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, C. difficile infection, and selection for resistance. Let me verify exemplars: acute otitis externa guidelines show no added benefit from oral antibiotics and document increased persistence and recurrence with systemic therapy, underscoring the ecological harm of overtreatment in superficial infections; similarly, acne stewardship guidance warns against monotherapy and prolonged systemic antibiotics due to resistance and adverse effects, reinforcing caution even in inflammatory dermatologic conditions where antibiotics are sometimes used [^1920969b] [^e933cbf9].

> But wait, what if there are special scenarios where oral therapy is justified? I need to ensure I consider spreading eyelid cellulitis, immunocompromise, or failure of conservative therapy. In those cases, oral antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA risk if present, may be reasonable. Agents with activity against S. aureus include doxycycline, TMP-SMX, clindamycin, and linezolid for MRSA coverage, with selection tailored to local resistance and patient factors; however, I should emphasize that this extrapolates from SSTI guidance rather than stye-specific trials, so clinical judgment and close follow-up are essential [^168387e9].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For uncomplicated styes, prioritize warm compresses and lid hygiene; reserve topical antibiotics for cases with significant purulence or secondary infection, recognizing that many styes are self-limited. I should confirm red flags that warrant escalation: rapid progression, surrounding eyelid cellulitis, fever, immunocompromise, or lack of improvement after 48–72 hours of conservative care; in those scenarios, consider oral therapy directed at S. aureus with MRSA coverage if risk factors exist, and reassess within 48 hours to ensure clinical response and source control [^notfound].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is clear and stewardship-aligned. Routine oral antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated styes; conservative local therapy remains first-line, and oral antibiotics should be reserved for complicated or refractory cases after reassessment. I should double-check that this aligns with the absence of supportive evidence in the provided materials and with general principles for localized superficial infections, which it does [^notfound].

Oral antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** for uncomplicated styes (hordeolum) because most are self-limited and respond to conservative measures [^notfound]. They are only considered when there is **significant cellulitis**, **systemic symptoms**, or **failure of local therapy after 48–72 hours**. If needed, use oral agents active against Staphylococcus aureus (e.g. cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 7–10 days; doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 7–10 days if MRSA risk) [^168387e9]. Routine oral antibiotics are discouraged due to low benefit, potential adverse effects, and resistance risk [^1920969b].

---

## Indications for oral antibiotics in stye management

Oral antibiotics are **not first-line** for uncomplicated styes; reserve them for:

- **Significant cellulitis**: Eyelid or periorbital cellulitis with spreading erythema, edema, or warmth.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy.
- **Failure of local therapy**: No improvement after 48–72 hours of warm compresses and topical antibiotics.

---

## Recommended oral antibiotic regimens

When indicated, select agents active against Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA if risk factors are present:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally four times daily for 7–10 days | First-line for MSSA; mild to moderate cellulitis |
| Dicloxacillin | 500 mg orally four times daily for 7–10 days | First-line for MSSA; mild to moderate cellulitis |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily for 7–10 days | MRSA risk or beta-lactam allergy |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily for 7–10 days | MRSA risk or beta-lactam allergy |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | MRSA risk or beta-lactam allergy |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral antibiotic use

Direct evidence for oral antibiotics in styes is **limited**; most data derive from SSTI literature and expert opinion. A Cochrane review of impetigo found topical antibiotics are as effective as or superior to oral agents, with fewer adverse effects, supporting a conservative approach to superficial infections [^8cabc637]. Similarly, acute otitis externa guidelines show no added benefit from routine systemic antibiotics when topical therapy is used, reinforcing restraint with systemic therapy in localized infections [^45aa076f].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Oral antibiotics carry risks that must be weighed against limited benefit in uncomplicated styes:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis.
- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis.
- **Resistance**: Selection for resistant organisms, including MRSA.
- **Drug interactions**: Particularly with macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

Conservative measures remain **first-line**:

- **Warm compresses**: Apply for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to promote drainage.
- **Topical antibiotics**: Erythromycin or bacitracin ointment for secondary infection or persistent inflammation.
- **Lid hygiene**: Gentle cleansing of the lid margin to reduce bacterial load.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current ophthalmic and infectious disease guidance emphasizes conservative management and reserves oral antibiotics for complicated cases. The AAO Preferred Practice Pattern for blepharitis supports topical therapy and notes that oral antibiotics may be considered for severe meibomian gland disease, but **not for routine hordeolum management** [^f32526d9]. IDSA SSTI guidance similarly restricts systemic antibiotics to cases with systemic involvement or failure of local therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated styes; use them only for significant cellulitis, systemic symptoms, or failure of local therapy. When needed, select agents active against S. aureus, including MRSA coverage if risk factors are present, and limit the course to 7–10 days. Conservative measures such as warm compresses and topical antibiotics should be first-line to minimize adverse effects and resistance.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^168387e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Systematic review of antibiotic resistance in acne: an increasing topical and oral threat [^98d0a15b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Topical and oral antibiotics are routinely used to treat acne. However, antibiotic resistance is increasing, with many countries reporting that more than 50% of Propionibacterium acnes strains are resistant to topical macrolides, making them less effective. We reviewed the current scientific literature to enable proposal of recommendations for antibiotic use in acne treatment. References were identified through PubMed searches for articles published from January, 1954, to March 7, 2015, using four multiword searches. Ideally, benzoyl peroxide in combination with a topical retinoid should be used instead of a topical antibiotic to minimise the impact of resistance. Oral antibiotics still have a role in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, but only with a topical retinoid, benzoyl peroxide, or their combination, and ideally for no longer than 3 months. To limit resistance, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide should always be added when long-term oral antibiotic use is deemed necessary. The benefit-to-risk ratio of long-term antibiotic use should be carefully considered and, in particular, use alone avoided where possible. There is a need to treat acne with effective alternatives to antibiotics to reduce the likelihood of resistance.

### An unusual presentation of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma mistaken for a stye [^5368466e]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

The patient is a 62-year-old woman who initially sought medical attention for irritation of the left lower eyelid, accompanied by worsening swelling, redness, itch, pain, and a foreign body sensation. The initial presumption of chalazion and meibomianitis guided supportive treatments including hot compresses, lid wipes, and topical and oral antibiotics. After 5 months of topical and oral antibiotics without resolution of symptoms despite the multitude of treatments initiated, she was referred to an ophthalmologist for further management. A biopsy from the left upper eyelid was performed which revealed invasive SCC. Given the ill-defined cutaneous changes on both her upper and lower eyelid, 3 additional biopsies from the left lower eyelid were performed which showed severe dysplasia/SCC in situ. Recognizing the high-risk nature of the malignancy, she was referred for Mohs surgery.

Upon presentation to Mohs surgery, initial clinical appearance was notable for diffuse erythema and swelling of the upper and lower eyelid and a diffusely verrucous appearance of the conjunctiva (Fig 1). Histological examination of the first stage revealed islands of large, atypical epithelioid cells with increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio within the subconjunctival dermis (moderate and poorly differentiated SCC) and within the full-thickness epidermis and full-thickness conjunctiva (Fig 2). In all stages, involvement of epidermis was minimal, and the majority of carcinoma was present on the conjunctival surface, which was diffusely positive in nearly all stages (Fig 2, B). After the second stage, it was noted that invasive carcinoma was tracking onto the bulbar conjunctiva beneath the eye shield and could not be excised safely in this setting. Two more additional stages were taken to remove any safely accessible tumor. Next, we discussed with the patient our recommendation to discontinue Mohs surgery despite the remaining invasive carcinoma and carcinoma in situ within the conjunctiva (Fig 3).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^0b65ff30]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^6c4997ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently, a wide range of terminology is used, including "long-term suppressive therapy", "indefinite chronic suppression", and "indefinite oral antimicrobial suppression". We recommend "suppressive antibiotic therapy" as a standardized term that accurately and succinctly describes the practice of using long courses of antibiotics to indefinitely suppress bacterial infection, so that relevant data are not unintentionally excluded from systematic reviews. As antimicrobial resistance and the levels of comorbidity in the population increase worldwide, the number of patients prescribed SAT will likely increase. Therefore, it is important that both patients and clinicians have accurate information about the treatment strategy to promote safe patient-centered care.

### The use of oral antibiotics in treating acne vulgaris: a new approach [^2688d659]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Although acne is not an infectious disease, oral antibiotics have remained a mainstay of treatment over the last 40 years. The anti-inflammatory properties of oral antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines, are efficacious in treating inflammatory acne lesions. Common prescribing practices in Dermatology exert significant selection pressure on bacteria, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic use for acne not only promotes resistance in Propionibacterium acnes, but also affects other host bacteria with pathogenic potential. This review will summarize the commonly used treatments for acne vulgaris, and how they should be combined as rational treatment. The indications for using oral antibiotics in acne will be highlighted. Strategies described in the literature to conserve the utility of oral antibiotics will be summarized. These include limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy, concomitant use of a topical non-antibiotic agent, use of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, and the introduction of topical dapsone.

### Oral antibacterial therapy for acne vulgaris: an evidence-based review [^afd3313e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

To some degree, acne vulgaris affects nearly every individual worldwide. Oral antibiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne; however, long-term use of oral antibiotics for acne may have unintended consequences.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the efficacy and appropriate use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of acne.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted to identify randomized controlled clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Overall, 41 articles that examined oral antibiotics compared with placebo, another oral therapy, topical therapy, alternate dose, or duration were included in this study.

Results

Tetracyclines, macrolides, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective and safe in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Superior efficacy of one type or class of antibiotic could not be determined, therefore the choice of antibiotic is generally based on the side-effect profile. Although different dosing regimens have been studied, there is a lack of standardized comparator trials to determine optimal dosing and duration of each oral antibiotic used in acne. The combination of oral antibiotics with a topical therapy is superior to oral antibiotics alone.

Conclusion

This article provides a systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence of the efficacy of oral antibiotics for acne. Due to heterogeneity in the design of the trials, there is insufficient evidence to support one type, dose, or duration of oral antibiotic over another in terms of efficacy; however, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, dermatologists should heed consensus guidelines for their appropriate use.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1920969b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — overuse and harms of oral antibiotics: Despite the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy of topical preparations, about 20% to 40% of subjects with AOE nonetheless receive oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical antimicrobials, and despite a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics clinicians actually prescribed more systemic antibiotics postpublication (31% vs 22%). Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

### Early oral antibiotic switch in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) trial early oral switch protocol [^59654a22]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The SNAP trial is an innovative approach to studying the management of SAB, allowing multiple treatments to be studied in parallel. The EOS domain aims to determine whether EOS is non-inferior to traditional prolonged IV treatment. Conventional teaching means using oral antibiotics to complete a SAB treatment course remains an unfamiliar and intimidating idea for many clinicians who treat adults. Barriers to enrollment in this domain include inadequate source control and persistent bacteremia, clinician hesitancy, and concerns about adherence. We hope to contribute high-quality evidence to the debate on the safety and efficacy of oral antibiotics in the treatment of SAB and eventually to be part of a paradigm shift in the management of this serious and common condition.

### Treatment of impetigo: oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed [^72d4cf57]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin disease that is frequently seen in children. While data support the use of topical antibiotics for treatment, the medications actually prescribed in practice are not well documented.

Objectives

To determine the prescribing pattern of dermatologists and nondermatologists when treating impetigo and the demographics of the patients treated.

Methods

National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data on office visits for impetigo were analyzed from 1997 to 2007. Patient demographics and the treatments for impetigo were recorded.

Results

During this 10-year period, dermatologists managed an estimated 274,815 impetigo visits and nondermatologists an estimated 3,722,462 visits. Both dermatologists and nondermatologists most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics to treat impetigo. Topical antibiotics were second most common, and a variety of combination treatments were used.

Conclusions

Oral antibiotics are the most common class of medications used to treat impetigo. There is an opportunity for physicians to take advantage of the equally efficacious topical antibiotics for treating impetigo. A shift towards topical antibiotics would likely decrease morbidity (resulting from adverse effects) associated with use of oral agents.

### Blepharitis (lid margin disease) [^3c6c1058]. COP (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for blepharitis, more specifically with respect to oral antibiotics, CO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering systemic antibiotics (such as doxycycline or minocycline for several weeks or months; or oral erythromycin or azithromycin if tetracyclines are contraindicated) as second-line therapy in patients with posterior blepharitis.

### Optimizing use of oral antibiotics in acne vulgaris [^0d8679ca]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Oral antibiotics are commonly used to treat acne vulgaris, primarily in patients presenting with moderate to severe facial or truncal disease severity. These agents are most appropriately used in combination with a topical regimen containing benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid. The most common oral antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris are the tetracycline derivatives, although macrolide agents such as erythromycin have also been used extensively. Over the past 4 decades, as the sensitivity of Propionibacterium acnes to several oral and topical antibiotics has decreased, the efficacy of oral tetracycline and erythromycin has markedly diminished, leading to increased use of doxycycline, minocycline, and other agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^5a957047]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers to 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia)/discomfort/local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity measured in several ways. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found three new studies (390 participants). Overall, we included 21 studies (2525 participants). We report four core comparisons below, and describe an additional four in the Results section of the review. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain from a single study if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks, or health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. The study did not report ear pain and suspected ototoxicity. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Seven studies assessed this comparison, with five presenting usable data. There may be little or no difference between oral ciprofloxacin and placebo/no treatment (with all participants receiving ciprofloxacin ear drops) in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 300 participants; low-certainty evidence), with similar results at two to four weeks. One study reported outcomes beyond four weeks, but the results were not usable. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications, and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antibiotics and topical steroids in both study arms) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus topical steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at two to four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 1 study, 30 participants). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if co-trimoxazole improved resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence). From the narrative reporting of one study, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing, or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). 4. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antiseptics in both study arms) One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms, and found no difference in the resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no-treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes. Limitations include heterogeneity in the duration and definition of CSOM used by studies included in the review. Although we planned subgroup analyses for different participant characteristics, treatment duration, and spectrum of antibiotic activity, we did not perform these analyses due to lack of available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence available to determine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM is limited. We are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics, when used alone (with or without aural toileting (ear cleaning)), are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an intervention such as topical antibiotics, there may be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics; it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic is more effective than another. Harmful effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the included studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^c5f71de2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

### Topical antibiotics: therapeutic value or ecologic mischief? [^3e02ca5b]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Based on antibiotic prescribing data from 2003, dermatologists account annually for 8–9 million prescriptions for oral antibiotics, and 3–4 million prescriptions for topical antibiotics. Overall, much of the emphasis on concerns related to emergence of clinically significant antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains focuses on use of systemic antibiotics, however, topical antibiotic use may also have potential implications. The following article discusses the perspectives of the authors related to the potential therapeutic benefits and ecologic implications ("ecologic mischief") of topical antibiotic therapy for specific indications encountered in ambulatory dermatology practice.

### Oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis [^aa517ffc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti-inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel-group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the USA. Follow-up duration was three months. One three-arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high-dose (200 mg twice a day) and low-dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta-analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three-arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.17; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.10; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break-up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high-dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low-dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

The decision to use intravenous or oral agents has been debated. Currently, oral therapy is recommended for mild infections and intravenous therapy for severe infections. Moderate infections may be treated via the oral route, or with one to two intravenous doses and then transitioning to oral therapy. For patients with severe infections who are able to tolerate oral therapy and in whom clinical improvement has been documented, the goal should be to transition to the oral route as soon as possible. There is evidence to suggest that this approach positively impacts length of stay as well.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^4e917cd3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are a commonly used treatment option for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) against placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving patients with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms also received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (2135 participants) with unclear or high risk of bias. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge at between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 33 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. Ear pain and suspected ototoxicity were not reported. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Six studies were included of which five presented useable data. There may be little or no difference in the resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks for oral ciprofloxacin compared to placebo or no treatment when ciprofloxacin ear drops were used in both intervention arms (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence). No results after two weeks were reported. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received other background treatments) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 40 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if resolution of ear discharge at six weeks was improved with co-trimoxazole compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 98 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ear discharge was not reported at other time points. From the narrative report there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms and found similar resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (both very low-certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported. 4. Different types of systemic antibiotics This is a summary of four comparisons, where different antibiotics were compared to each other. Eight studies compared different types of systemic antibiotics against each other: quinolones against beta-lactams (four studies), lincosamides against nitroimidazoles (one study) and comparisons of different types of beta-lactams (three studies). It was not possible to conclude if there was one class or type of systemic antibiotic that was better in terms of resolution of ear discharge. The studies did not report adverse events well.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of evidence available to examine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. When used alone (with or without aural toileting), we are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an effective intervention such as topical antibiotics, there seems to be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics and it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic may be more effective than another. Adverse effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the studies included. As we found very sparse evidence for their efficacy, the possibility of adverse events may detract from their use for CSOM.

### Short versus standard duration antibiotic therapy for acute streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^fd96b77c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The standard duration of treatment for acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register; the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2007); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to December 1965); and EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Twenty studies were included with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20), or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).

Authors' Conclusions

Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10 day oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. In countries with low rates of rheumatic fever, it appears safe and efficacious to treat children with acute GABHS pharyngitis with short duration antibiotics. In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^61cf71de]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic regimen for patients without penicillin allergy: Under the question Does the patient have a penicillin allergy?, use Oral amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times per d, 3–7 d)§; if not feasible, use Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)§; and if first-line treatment fails, broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)§; the guideline notes, Although the expert panel recommends both amoxicillin and penicillin as first-line treatments, amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.

### Common and alternate oral antibiotic therapies for acne vulgaris: a review [^9a3d5405]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common disorder affecting many adolescents and adults throughout their lifetimes. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and is thought to involve excess sebum, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Many therapeutic options exist for treating acne, including topical benzoyl peroxide, topical and oral antibiotics, topical and oral retinoids, and oral contraceptives. Oral antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of acne for decades and function by exerting an antibacterial effect by reducing the follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Systemic antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This article reviews the English language literature on the efficacy of various systemic antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris, including second-line and less historically used medications. We discuss the tetracyclines, including subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, macrolides (notably azithromycin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as treatment options for acne vulgaris.

### Early oral antibiotic switch in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) trial early oral switch protocol [^0f00ea32]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia) is traditionally treated with at least 2 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics in adults, 3–7 days in children, and often longer for those with complicated disease. The current practice of treating S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) with prolonged IV antibiotics (rather than oral antibiotics) is based on historical observational research and expert opinion. Prolonged IV antibiotic therapy has significant disadvantages for patients and healthcare systems, and there is growing interest in whether a switch to oral antibiotics following an initial period of IV therapy is a safe alternative for clinically stable patients.

Protocol

The early oral switch (EOS) domain of the S. aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) trial will assess early switch to oral antibiotics compared with continued IV treatment in clinically stable patients with SAB. The primary endpoint is 90-day all-cause mortality. Hospitalised SAB patients are assessed at platform day 7 ± 2 (uncomplicated SAB) and day 14 ± 2 (complicated SAB) to determine their eligibility for randomization to EOS (intervention) or continued IV treatment (current standard of care).

Discussion

Recruitment is occurring in the EOS domain of the SNAP trial. As of August 2023, 21% of all SNAP participants had been randomized to the EOS domain, a total of 264 participants across 77 centers, with an aim to recruit at least 1000 participants. We describe challenges and facilitators to enrolment in this domain to aid those planning similar trials.

### Oral antibiotics for meibomian gland-related ocular surface disease: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^dca6df8a]. Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the existing medical literature on the role of oral antibiotics in the management of ocular surface disease (OSD) that arises from disorders of the meibomian glands and to assess the efficacy of oral antibiotics in the management of this common ocular disease.

Methods

A literature search was last conducted on August 12, 2015, in the PubMed and Cochrane databases for English-language original research investigations that evaluated the role of doxycycline, minocycline, and azithromycin in OSD among adult patients. The searches identified 87 articles, and 8 studies ultimately met the criteria outlined for this assessment.

Results

The 8 studies identified in the search documented an improvement in meibomian gland-related OSD after treatment with these agents, although side effects were common. This search identified only 1 randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of these medications.

Conclusions

Although oral antibiotics are used commonly in the management of OSD, there is no level I evidence to support their use. There are only a few studies that have assessed the efficacy of oral antibiotics in clinically meaningful ways in the management of OSD that arises from disorders of the meibomian glands. The current level of evidence is insufficient to conclude that antibiotics are useful in managing OSD arising from disorders of the meibomian glands. The few existing studies on the topic indicate that oral antibiotics may be an effective treatment for OSD that results from meibomian gland disease.

### Evaluation of a paradigm shift from intravenous antibiotics to oral step-down therapy for the treatment of infective endocarditis: a narrative review [^6731dbe5]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The requirement of prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses to treat infective endocarditis (IE) is a time-honored dogma of medicine. However, numerous antibiotics are now available that achieve adequate levels in the blood after oral administration to kill bacteria. Moreover, prolonged intravenous antibiotic regimens are associated with high rates of adverse events. Accordingly, recent studies of oral step-down antibiotic treatment have stimulated a reevaluation of the need for intravenous-only therapy for IE.

Observations

PubMed was reviewed in October 2019, with an update in February 2020, to determine whether evidence supports the notion that oral step-down antibiotic therapy for IE is associated with inferior outcomes compared with intravenous-only therapy. The search identified 21 observational studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treating IE, typically after an initial course of intravenous therapy; none found such oral step-down therapy to be inferior to intravenous-only therapy. Multiple studies described an improved clinical cure rate and an improved mortality rate among patients treated with oral step-down vs intravenous-only antibiotic therapy. Three randomized clinical trials also demonstrated that oral step-down antibiotic therapy is at least as effective as intravenous-only therapy in right-sided, left-sided, or prosthetic valve IE. In the largest trial, at 3.5 years of follow-up, patients randomized to receive oral step-down antibiotic therapy had a significantly improved cure rate and mortality rate compared with those who received intravenous-only therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review found ample data demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of oral step-down vs intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for IE, and no contrary data were identified. The use of highly orally bioavailable antibiotics as step-down therapy for IE, after clearing bacteremia and achieving clinical stability with intravenous regimens, should be incorporated into clinical practice.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^2eeacd7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

End-of-life antibiotic stewardship in advanced dementia and hospice care emphasizes symptom-focused use, trade-offs, and shared decision-making. For symptom relief in specific infections, treating urinary tract infection may improve dysuria and treating thrush may improve dysphagia, but the impact of antibiotics on respiratory tract infection symptoms is less clear. In advanced dementia with suspected pneumonia, antibiotic treatment via any route was associated with improved survival but less comfort. If prolonging survival is not a primary goal, withholding antibiotic agents should be considered; if treatment is desired, antibiotic agents should be administered orally whenever possible. Patients and their surrogates should be engaged in the decision to use antibiotic agents at end of life, and given treatment burdens, potential for adverse effects such as CDI, and public health risks, antibiotic therapy should be viewed as aggressive care in the end-of-life setting.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^8cba0d66]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Complicated appendicitis postoperative antibiotics — The panel suggested that adult and pediatric patients who have undergone appendectomy for complicated appendicitis should be treated with short-term antibiotics postoperatively. This is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty of evidence. There is still uncertainty surrounding the ideal number of days of antibiotics post-operatively; however, the STOP-IT trial demonstrated that antibiotics for four days after adequate source control is sufficient and this can logically be applied to patients with complicated appendicitis as well. Once adopted, it will be important to monitor readmission and post-operative infection (both superficial and deep) at individual institutions. Future studies should investigate how short a course of antibiotics is still effective, when the transition to oral antibiotics can be made, and the optimal antibiotic from the perspective of stewardship and efficacy.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^bb0a4edb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis — initial antibiotic regimens are to use oral antibiotic therapy for 28 days (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Oral antibiotic regimens indicated for the treatment of Lyme arthritis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for 28 days. Supporting evidence includes a randomized controlled trial reporting resolution of arthritis within 1–3 months in approximately 90% of participants treated with a 30-day course of either oral doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily) or amoxicillin plus probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours). Oral antibiotics are described as easier to administer than intravenous (IV) antibiotics, associated with fewer serious complications, and less expensive, and studies evaluating a shorter course of antibiotic therapy appear warranted for treatment of Lyme arthritis in the United States.

### Azithromycin and COVID-19: prompt early use at first signs of this infection in adults and children, an approach worthy of consideration [^41d50064]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The devastating effects of the coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have led to urgent attempts to find effective therapeutic agents for inpatient and outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Initial enthusiasm for the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has abated. However, as a result of positive clinical experience with azithromycin used alone during the first few days of the flu-like illness caused by this coronavirus, we recommend formal clinical trials using azithromycin early in the course of a COVID-19 infection. There is one clinical trial initiated, the individually randomized, telemedicine-based, "Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment in Outpatients Nationwide" based at the University of California San Francisco. This placebo-controlled trial is designed to determine the efficacy of a single 1.2-g dose of oral azithromycin to prevent COVID-19 patient progression to hospitalization. We recommend formal clinical trials of azithromycin in its prepackaged form at the first sign of COVID-19 infection in adults and children, using an initial adult dose of 500mg followed by 250mg per day for 4days, a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g, and for children 5 to 18years of age, 10 mg/kg on the first day followed by 5 mg/kg for 4days.

### New antibiotic therapies for acne and rosacea [^c721495a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Acne and rosacea compromise a substantial portion of the dermatology clinical practice. Over the past century, many treatment modalities have been introduced with antibiotics playing a major role. Today, both oral and topical antibiotics are used in the management of acne and rosacea, with several novel formulations and/or combination regimens recently introduced. The latest studies suggest anti-inflammatory actions to be the most likely mechanism of antibiotics in acne and rosacea, shifting the focus to subantimicrobial-dose oral antibiotics and/or topical antibiotic regimens as the preferred first-line agents. Here we will discuss the most recent oral and topical antibiotic therapies available for treatment of acne and rosacea, with special focus on efficacy data, indication, dosing, and mechanism of action.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme carditis — antibiotic route and duration: In outpatients, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), while in hospitalized patients we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For total duration, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^941bc17d]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

### A red plaque on the face of a healthy man [^41ec89a4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is true regarding the prognosis of this condition?
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80%
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50%

Answers:
A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years, with recurrence after treatment in more than 40% of cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease have been associated with higher recurrence rates.
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed – Incorrect. Cutaneous dental sinus tract is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity of occurrence and lack of associated symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, definitive treatment through oral therapy to eliminate the source of infection, whether it is through endodontic treatment or extraction, is effective and provides a cure.
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50% – Correct. Angiosarcomas make up less than 1% of all sarcomas, with approximately 2 to 3 new cases per 1 million diagnoses yearly. Importantly, many angiosarcomas are highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival between 10% and 50% and a median overall survival ranging from 30 to 50 months. The clinical variability of these tumors contributes to delayed diagnosis, and that, coupled with their genetic heterogeneity, makes them difficult to treat. Surgical excision with wide margins is considered the mainstay of therapy in localized disease; however, the infiltrative and satellite foci often lead to difficulty in obtaining negative margins and frequent local recurrences. Thus, a multimodal approach, which often includes radiation, is often necessary. Our patient was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiation given positive margins. He remains without evidence of disease at 2 years.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^e933cbf9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne systemic antibiotic stewardship — Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is strongly discouraged, and the use of topical maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### Oral azithromycin versus oral doxycycline in the treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^297fd514]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, the inclusion of a limited number of studies is a notable constraint. This arises from the fact that antibiotic use is not considered a first-line treatment in the management of MGD and is not widely adopted in clinical practice. Consequently, the availability of eligible studies meeting our inclusion criteria was limited, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, a significant limitation is the high level of heterogeneity observed among the included studies. This heterogeneity may be attributed to methodological disparities and variations in the study design, intervention protocols, and outcome measures employed across the studies. The resulting inconsistency in the pooled results necessitates caution when interpreting and extrapolating the findings. However, it is important to note that we conducted a thorough investigation to identify potential sources of heterogeneity and explore their underlying causes. Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of antibiotics in the management of MGD. Nevertheless, future research endeavors should aim to address these limitations by conducting larger-scale studies with a more diverse range of participants, standardized protocols, and consistent outcome measures. Such efforts would contribute to the robustness and generalizability of the findings, thereby enhancing our understanding of the role of antibiotics in the treatment of MGD.

Regarding medical management for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider de-escalating antibiotic treatment according to the susceptibility pattern of the isolated pathogen, maintaining IV administration for 1–2 weeks, and switching to oral treatment as soon as the clinical signs and symptoms of infection (fever, redness, warmth, swelling, pain) and blood biomarkers (WBC and CRP) indicate satisfactory progress. Decide on oral antibiotics based on the in vitro activity, oral bioavailability, and diffusion to the synovial fluid.

### Scientific rationale for study design of community-based simplified antibiotic therapy trials in newborns and young infants with clinically diagnosed severe infections or fast breathing in south Asia and sub-saharan Africa [^a962c1d2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

CHOICE OF ANTIBIOTICS, REGIMENS, DOSAGE, DURATION AND DELIVERY STRATEGIES

Ideally, the selection of an appropriate antimicrobial agent is based on its ability to kill bacteria that are responsible for the infection in the majority of cases, based on efficacy and safety data, and pharmacokinetic information from relevant pediatric age groups. For the simplified antibiotic therapy trials, additional considerations include ease of delivery in community settings and cost — both factors with significant implications for future scale-up. The experimental arms, therefore, comprise combinations of injectable and oral antibiotics or switch therapy from injectable to oral antibiotics (Tables 2 and 3).

Antibiotics Regimens Evaluated in Trials of Simplified Antibiotic Therapy for Management of Newborns and Young Infants With Clinically Diagnosed Severe Infections (CSIs) or Fast Breathing

TABLE 3.
Number of of Intramuscular (IM) Injections in Each Therapeutic Arm

Penicillin and gentamicin are used globally for treating sepsis and presumed sepsis in the neonatal age group and the second month of life. Extended-interval (24-hourly) gentamicin regimens using doses ranging from 4 to 5 mg/kg/day have been shown to be as effective as traditional dosing regimens for treating neonatal sepsis. The combination of penicillin/amoxicillin and gentamicin targets common neonatal pathogens such as Escherichia coli, other enteric gram-negative rods, streptococci and pneumococci.

Benzyl penicillin and ampicillin need to be given 4 times a day, which is impractical in the outpatient setting. Based on recommendations from the 2007 London consultation on community-based strategies for management of severe infections in young infants born in high mortality settings, the pharmacologic profile of antibiotics, and experience of their use, we decided to use a combination of procaine penicillin and gentamicin delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection as the reference arm to treat clinically diagnosed severe infection because both can be given in once daily dosing and together can successfully treat vast majority of bacterial infections in young infants.

For the simplified experimental regimens, amoxicillin was selected as the oral agent. Oral antibiotics have successfully been used in community-based management of neonatal pneumonia, resulting in significant reduction in pneumonia and overall neonatal mortality. There is extensive experience with use of oral amoxicillin in newborns and young infants, and safety of this drug is well-established in this age group. In full-term neonates, the bioavailability of oral amoxicillin is high at approximately 80%. Similar serum amoxicillin concentrations were achieved in neonates in the first 4 days of life with intravenous and oral routes, with the exception of the first 30 minutes after dosing when levels were lower with oral administration.

### Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella infections in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review on antimicrobial resistance and treatment [^4100fe52]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of oral fluoroquinolones to treat invasive NTS infections was recommended in various publications, including the Red Book, the Sanford Guide, and the NIH guidelines on opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. The Red Book suggested that to treat bloodstream infections, intravenous ceftriaxone can be switched to oral fluoroquinolones or azithromycin when the blood culture is cleared and focal infections are excluded. Sequential intravenous and oral treatment in children over 12 months with bloodstream infection was also recommended in a review. In the treatment of a first bloodstream infection in patients with AIDS, 1–2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics could be continued for 4 weeks with an oral fluoroquinolone. To treat osteomyelitis, intravenous antibiotics could be switched to oral antibiotics if systemic symptoms resolved.

### Intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics to treat chronic lower back pain [^537c4439]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps, the debate should focus on the selection of the antibiotic and dosage regimen. The publications using oral amoxicillin to treat CLBP by Braten et al. and the AIM study group and their subsequent analyses should be considered with caution. The differences between Albert et al. and Braten et al. oral amoxicillin RCTs may be at least partially explained by both studies being in a steep part of the amoxicillin dose-response at the intervertebral disc. Some patients respond to oral antibiotics; however, their use must be optimized. Oral cefuroxime axetil may be an alternative to amoxicillin, as it is more potent against C. acnes and the modelling presented here suggests that it may provide a better chance of adequate intradiscal exposure at a lower dose.

A planned Cochrane review on the use of oral amoxicillin to treat CLBP with Modic changes, based on the RCT studies summarized here, may be premature and may have a greater impact when diverse antibiotics and regimens have been evaluated and optimized and further RCTs conducted.

This review identified gaps of knowledge to set priorities for further research. Additional high-quality studies with well-validated analytical methodology such as Liang et al.investigating the intradiscal pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics in subjects with Modic type 1 and Modic type 2 changes are required to inform the optimisation of dosing, and future studies should at least incorporate an assessment of serum/plasma antibiotic concentrations at timepoints during the 100 days of administration. It is recommended that expertise in antibacterial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be integrated into the design and execution of future studies.

### Systemic antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^c4b30af5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The standard recommendation for treating chronic osteomyelitis is 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. However, oral antibiotics are available that achieve adequate levels in bone, and there are now more published studies of oral than parenteral antibiotic therapy for patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Oral and parenteral therapies achieve similar cure rates; however, oral therapy avoids risks associated with intravenous catheters and is generally less expensive, making it a reasonable choice for osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms. Addition of adjunctive rifampin to other antibiotics may improve cure rates. The optimal duration of therapy for chronic osteomyelitis remains uncertain. There is no evidence that antibiotic therapy for > 4–6 weeks improves outcomes compared with shorter regimens. In view of concerns about encouraging antibiotic resistance to unnecessarily prolonged treatment, defining the optimal route and duration of antibiotic therapy and the role of surgical debridement in treating chronic osteomyelitis are important, unmet needs.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^531a0a82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, and aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is the first update of a review published in 2021. The update found no new studies. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics versus systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. The two main comparisons were the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups and different types of antibiotics in each group. Within each comparison, we separated studies into 1. those in which both groups of participants had received aural toileting in addition to the antibiotics, and those where neither group had received aural toileting, and 2. those in which both groups received some other concomitant treatment (such as topical antiseptics) and those with no such concomitant treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related quality of life using a validated instrument, and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias. Three studies included participants with confirmed CSOM, where perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related quality of life. 1. Topical quinolone versus systemic quinolone Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Topical administration may slightly increase resolution of ear discharge at one to less than two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.84; 2 studies, 210 participants; low-certainty evidence). These studies either did not mention aural toileting or limited it to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of resolution after four weeks, health-related quality of life, ear pain, or serious complications. No studies reported results for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical quinolone versus systemic aminoglycosides One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did not report any "side effects" from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected ototoxicity, or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical quinolone versus systemic penicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor One study (60 participants) compared topical ofloxacin versus oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may increase the resolution of ear discharge at one to less than two weeks compared to topical ofloxacin, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of topical ofloxacin compared with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on ear pain, hearing, or suspected ototoxicity (all very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of resolution after four weeks, health-related quality of life, and serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of low- or very low-quality evidence available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to determine whether topical or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. This was mostly due to high risk of bias in the studies and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the topical administration of quinolone antibiotics may be slightly more effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different types of topical antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^5b5354e4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### Early oral antibiotic switch in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) trial early oral switch protocol [^afdba607]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is the leading cause of mortality due to bloodstream infections. Adult patients with SAB typically receive a minimum of 2 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Patients with more complex infections may receive weeks of IV therapy. These durations are based on observational research and expert opinion. The duration of IV treatment is shorter in children (median 11 days), with oral switch occurring as early as day 3 of treatment in 1 small randomized clinical trial (RCT).

IV administration is the most effective way to rapidly achieve therapeutic antibiotic concentrations in unwell patients with severe infections. Once the patient has stabilized, early transition to oral antibiotics is increasingly recognized as part of good antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practice. IV therapy requires substantial resources, is inconvenient and less acceptable to patients, and has risks such as venous catheter complications. Several antibiotics have excellent oral bioavailability, allowing achievement of plasma and tissue concentrations comparable to those achieved with IV administration. For antibiotics not traditionally considered highly orally bioavailable, dosing to optimize pharmacodynamic characteristics may enable acceptable antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection.

Two large RCTs of partial oral therapy — the POET endocarditis treatment study, which included S. aureus endocarditis, though was not powered to analyze this patient sub-group — and the SABATO study of uncomplicated SAB — showed that partial oral therapy was non-inferior to extended IV treatment for these indications. Smaller RCTs including patients with S. aureus endocarditis and SAB related to various sources, and several observational studies of complicated and uncomplicated SAB treatment have also demonstrated non-inferiority of early oral switch (EOS) (Tables 1 and 2 contain a summary of literature on EOS in SAB). Of the oral antibiotics potentially available to treat SAB, the best evidence for clinical non-inferiority compared with IV treatment is for oral linezolid. Successful outcomes with an oral fluoroquinolone-rifampicin combination were reported in 2 studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus bacteremia (MSSA-B), and the RODEO-1 RCT will test this combination for treatment of endocarditis, including S. aureus endocarditis. Other retrospective observational studies of partial oral treatment in SAB have included patients treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and beta-lactams and have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach for complicated and uncomplicated SAB.

### Partial oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment of endocarditis [^9d801a81]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart are typically treated with intravenous antibiotic agents for up to 6 weeks. Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown.

Methods

In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed.

Results

After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P = 0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P = 0.40), which met noninferiority criteria.

Conclusions

In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment. (Funded by the Danish Heart Foundation and others; POET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257 .).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^2e391f2e]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^6258c004]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM such as ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics against systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics. We separated studies according to whether they compared the same type of antibiotic in both treatment groups, or different types of antibiotics. For each comparison we considered whether there was background treatment for both treatment groups, for example aural toileting (ear cleaning).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks up to four weeks, and after four weeks), health-related quality of life using a validated instrument, ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Six studies (445 participants), all with high risk of bias, were included. All but two studies included patients with confirmed CSOM, where perforation of the ear drum was clearly documented. None of the studies reported results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks or health-related quality of life. 1. Topical versus systemic administration of the same type of antibiotics (quinolones) Four studies (325 participants) compared topical versus systemic (oral) administration of ciprofloxacin. Three studies reported resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks and found that the topical administration may slightly increase resolution (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.76; 285 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). In these studies, aural toileting was either not mentioned, or limited to the first visit. Three studies (265 participants) reported that they did not suspect ototoxicity in any participants, but it is unclear how this was measured (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcomes of ear pain or serious complications. No studies reported results for hearing, despite it being measured in three studies. 2. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus aminoglycosides) One study (60 participants) compared topical ciprofloxacin versus gentamicin injected intramuscularly. No aural toileting was reported. Resolution of ear discharge was not measured at one to two weeks. The study did not report any 'side effects' from which we assumed that no ear pain, suspected ototoxicity or serious complications occurred (very low-certainty evidence). The study stated that "no worsening of the audiometric function related to local or parenteral therapy was observed". 3. Topical versus systemic administration of different types of antibiotics (quinolones versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) One study compared topical ofloxacin with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with all participants receiving suction ear cleaning at the first visit. It is uncertain if there is a difference between the two groups in resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks due to study limitations and the very small sample size (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.50 to 5.72; 56 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if there is a difference between topical quinolone compared with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with regards to ear pain, hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported the outcome of serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of low-quality evidence available, from studies completed over 15 years ago, to examine whether topical or systemic antibiotics are more effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the topical administration of antibiotics may be more effective than systemic administration of antibiotics in achieving resolution of ear discharge (dry ear). There is limited evidence available regarding different types of antibiotics. It is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not topical quinolones are better or worse than systemic aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Antibiotics for trachoma [^c42592a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Trachoma is the world's leading infectious cause of blindness. In 1996, WHO launched the Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by the year 2020, based on the 'SAFE' strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement).

Objectives

To assess the evidence supporting the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective), Chlamydia trachomatis infection of the conjunctiva, antibiotic resistance, and adverse effects (secondary objectives).

Search Methods

We searched relevant electronic databases and trials registers. The date of the last search was 4 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that satisfied either of two criteria: (a) trials in which topical or oral administration of an antibiotic was compared to placebo or no treatment in people or communities with trachoma, (b) trials in which a topical antibiotic was compared with an oral antibiotic in people or communities with trachoma. We also included studies addressing different dosing strategies in the population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies where individuals with trachoma were randomised and 12 cluster-randomised studies. Any antibiotic versus control (individuals)Nine studies (1961 participants) randomised individuals with trachoma to antibiotic or control (no treatment or placebo). All of these studies enrolled children and young people with active trachoma. The antibiotics used in these studies included topical (oxy)tetracycline (5 studies), doxycycline (2 studies), and sulfonamides (4 studies). Four studies had more than two study arms. In general these studies were poorly reported, and it was difficult to judge risk of bias. These studies provided low-certainty evidence that people with active trachoma treated with antibiotics experienced a reduction in active trachoma at three months (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.89; 1961 people; 9 RCTs; I² = 73%) and 12 months (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; 1035 people; 4 RCTs; I² = 90%). Low-certainty evidence was available for ocular infection at three months (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; 297 people; 4 RCTs; I² = 0%) and 12 months (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78; 129 people; 1 RCT). None of these studies assessed antimicrobial resistance. In those studies that reported harms, no serious adverse effects were reported (low-certainty evidence). Oral versus topical antibiotics (individuals)Eight studies (1583 participants) compared oral and topical antibiotics. Only one study included people older than 21 years of age. Oral antibiotics included azithromycin (5 studies), sulfonamides (2 studies), and doxycycline (1 study). Topical antibiotics included (oxy)tetracycline (6 studies), azithromycin (1 study), and sulfonamide (1 study). These studies were poorly reported, and it was difficult to judge risk of bias. There was low-certainty evidence of little or no difference in effect between oral and topical antibiotics on active trachoma at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 953 people; 6 RCTs; I² = 63%) and 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.15; 886 people; 5 RCTs; I² = 56%). There was very low-certainty evidence for ocular infection at three or 12 months. Antimicrobial resistance was not assessed. In those studies that reported adverse effects, no serious adverse effects were reported; one study reported abdominal pain with azithromycin; one study reported a couple of cases of nausea with azithromycin; and one study reported three cases of reaction to sulfonamides (low-certainty evidence). Oral azithromycin versus control (communities)Four cluster-randomised studies compared antibiotic with no or delayed treatment. Data were available on active trachoma at 12 months from two studies but could not be pooled because of reporting differences. One study at low risk of bias found a reduced prevalence of active trachoma 12 months after a single dose of azithromycin in communities with a high prevalence of infection (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.65; 1247 people). The other, lower quality, study in low-prevalence communities reported similar median prevalences of infection at 12 months: 9.3% in communities treated with azithromycin and 8.2% in untreated communities. We judged this moderate-certainty evidence for a reduction in active trachoma with treatment, downgrading one level for inconsistency between the two studies. Two studies reported ocular infection at 12 months and data could be pooled. There was a reduction in ocular infection (RR 0.36, 0.31 to 0.43; 2139 people) 12 months after mass treatment with a single dose compared with no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). There was high-certainty evidence of an increased risk of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli to azithromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin in communities treated with azithromycin, with approximately 5-fold risk ratios at 12 months. The evidence did not support increased resistance to penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. None of the studies measured resistance to C trachomatis. No serious adverse events were reported. The main adverse effect noted for azithromycin (˜10%) was abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Oral azithromycin versus topical tetracycline (communities)Three cluster-randomised studies compared oral azithromycin with topical tetracycline. The evidence was inconsistent for active trachoma and ocular infection at three and 12 months (low-certainty evidence) and was not pooled due to considerable heterogeneity. Antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects were not reported. Different dosing strategiesSix studies compared different strategies for dosing. There were: mass treatment at different dosing intervals; applying cessation or stopping rules to mass treatment; strategies to increase mass treatment coverage. There was no strong evidence to support any variation in the recommended annual mass treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of active trachoma and ocular infection in people infected with C trachomatis, compared to no treatment/placebo, but the size of the treatment effect in individuals is uncertain. Mass antibiotic treatment with single dose oral azithromycin reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection in communities. There is no strong evidence to support any variation in the recommended periodicity of annual mass treatment. There is evidence of an increased risk of antibiotic resistance at 12 months in communities treated with antibiotics.

### Palmoplantar hyperkeratotic projections [^982a894e]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the next best step for management of this condition?
A. Mechanical friction and keratolytics
B. High-potency topical corticosteroids
C. Cryotherapy
D. Oral antibiotics
E. Photoprotection and topical 5-fluorouracil

Answers:
A. Mechanical friction and keratolytics – Correct. Spiny keratoderma is difficult to treat; mechanical friction (eg, paring and dermabrasion), emollients, keratolytics, and topical retinoids, may be useful in management but lesions tend to recur without regular maintenance therapy.
B. High-potency topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. Management of spiny keratoderma, as well as other forms of palmoplantar keratoderma, is aimed at softening and reducing the thickness of hyperkeratotic skin and controlling associated discomfort. Corticosteroids are not a part of management.
C. Cryotherapy – Incorrect. Cryotherapy, along with other destructive interventions such as laser or photodynamic therapy, may be used in the management of porokeratosisbut is not typically used for spiny keratoderma or other types of palmoplantar keratoderma.
D. Oral antibiotics – Incorrect. Although secondary bacterial and fungal infections can occur in spiny keratoderma and should be treated appropriately to avoid disease exacerbation, oral antibiotics are not a component of primary management.
E. Photoprotection and topical 5-fluorouracil – Incorrect. These treatments are commonly used for porokeratosis, but are not used for spiny keratoderma. Education about sun protection is especially important in porokeratosis because of the possibility of malignant transformation.

### Evaluation of opportunities for oral antibiotic therapy in bone and joint infections [^fcce36e2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The OVIVA trial suggests oral antibiotics are an alternative to intravenous antibiotics to treat bone and joint infections (BJI). A shift in practice to treatment with oral antibiotics would eliminate the need for central vascular access, improve patient satisfaction, and reduce overall healthcare costs.

Objective

The primary objective was to identify the proportion of patients treated for BJIs with outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) who would have qualified for oral antibiotics based on microbiological data. The secondary objective was to conduct a cost-analysis to estimate potential cost-savings had eligible patients been treated with oral antibiotics.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients in the United States treated with intravenous antibiotics for BJIs from January 2018 to April 2020. Inclusion and exclusion criteria matched the OVIVA trial. Patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, endocarditis, or other high-risk features were excluded.

Results

281 patients met the inclusion criteria. Most had prosthetic joint infections (56%). Infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (25%) were most common, followed by S. aureus (23%) and polymicrobial infections (22%). 69 (25%) patients required a switch during their OPAT course to an alternate antibiotic agent. Thirteen patients (5%) experienced vascular access complications, and 6 patients (2%) developed Clostridiodes difficile infections. Oral therapy could have resulted in an estimated average savings per patient of $3,270.69 USD.

Conclusion and Relevance

Most patients treated with OPAT for BJIs were candidates for oral antibiotics. A change in practice would result in cost-savings to the U.S. healthcare system.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^644168d6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — systemic antibiotic recommendations — Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other. Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children < 8 years of age), and erythromycin use should be restricted because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance. Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients. Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3–4 months to minimize the development of bacterial resistance, and monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy.

### Ongoing trials of simplified antibiotic regimens for the treatment of serious infections in young infants in south Asia and sub-saharan Africa: implications for policy [^3802e25c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

POLICY-RELEVANT FINDINGS EXPECTED FROM THE TRIALS

It is anticipated that the trials' findings will help answer a number of key policy-related questions about treating severe neonatal infections.

What are the Simplest Low Cost-effective Antibiotic Regimens That Can be Provided for the Treatment of Clinical Severe Infections as Alternatives to the 7–10 Days Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy With 2 Intramuscular Injections?

The primary objective of 3 trials (SAT-Bangladesh, SAT-Pakistan and AFRINEST-severe infections) was to examine whether young infants with clinical signs suggestive of severe infection can be treated with a combination of oral amoxicillin plus gentamicin or whether injections could be stopped after the first 2 days and the infant switched to oral amoxicillin alone, reducing the number of injections to be given and making treatment much simpler to administer. The studies will also evaluate whether compliance will be improved with simpler antibiotic regimens compared with the reference regimen of procaine penicillin and gentamicin injections daily for 7 days.

Should the Recommended Treatment for Newborns and Young Infants Who Present With Fast Breathing as the Only Clinical Sign be Changed From Intramuscular Antibiotics to Oral Amoxicillin?

The primary objective of 1 multicenter trial (AFRINEST-fast breathing) was to examine whether young infants with fast breathing as the only clinical sign can be successfully treated with oral amoxicillin compared with intramuscular procaine penicillin and gentamicin treatment. If oral amoxicillin is found to be as effective as intramuscular antibiotic injections, it would avoid using any antibiotic injections for this relatively large subgroup among those with PSBI. This would make it possible to treat many more of these babies at home.

What Is the Population-based Burden of Clinical Severe Infections in Asian and African Settings?

Pregnancy and birth identification and surveillance for signs of infection by CHWs are being conducted in DRC, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, and one of the study sites in Bangladesh. Data from this surveillance will provide population-based incidence of PSBI, and its classification into critical illness, severe infection and fast breathing. This will provide insights into specific subgroups that may be successfully treated as outpatients, thus reducing the need for hospitalization of all young infants with PSBI.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a576c443]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^df47fb4a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — oral antibiotics for MGD and pediatric dosing — Oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful for patients with MGD whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled by eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, and doxycycline, minocycline, or tetracycline can be given daily and tapered after clinical improvement is noted. To avoid using tetracyclines in women of childbearing age and in children, oral erythromycin or azithromycin may be used, with one suggested dosing regimen for erythromycin in children being 30 to 40 mg/kg divided over 3 doses for 3 weeks, then twice daily for 4 to 6 weeks, and a pediatric dosing regimen for azithromycin of 5 mg/kg daily for 2 months shown to be helpful for clinical improvement in a small case series. However, a Cochrane systematic review reported uncertainty with respect to indications and effectiveness of both topical and systemic treatments for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children due to the lack of high-quality evidence.

### Skin and soft tissue infections… [^79412068]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

MILD TO MODERATE INFECTIONS Topical antibiotics are options in patients with impetigo and folliculitis. 5, 27 Beta-lactams are effective in children with nonpurulent SSTIs, such as uncomplicated cellulitis or impetigo. 28 In adults, mild to moderate SSTIs respond well to beta-lactams in the absence of suppuration. 16 Patients who do not improve or who worsen after 48 hours of treatment should receive antibiotics to cover possible MRSA infection and imaging to detect purulence.
16. Antibiotic therapy is required for abscesses that are associated with extensive cellulitis, rapid progression, or poor response to initial drainage; that involve specific sites; and that occur in children and older adults or in those who have significant comorbid illness or immunosuppression. 32 In uncomplicated cellulitis, five days of treatment is as effective as 10 days.

33 In a randomized controlled trial of 200 children with uncomplicated SSTIs primarily caused by MRSA, clindamycin and cephalexin were equally effective.
34. SEVERE INFECTIONS Inpatient treatment is necessary for patients who have uncontrolled infection despite adequate outpatient antimicrobial therapy or who cannot tolerate oral antibiotics. Intravenous antibiotics should be continued until the clinical picture improves, the patient can tolerate oral intake, and drainage or debridement is completed. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients is seven to 14 days. A Cochrane review did not establish the superiority of any one pathogen-sensitive antibiotic over another in the treatment of MRSA SSTI. 35 Intravenous antibiotics may be continued at home under close supervision after initiation in the hospital or emergency department. 36 Antibiotic choices for severe infections are outlined in Table 6. 5,
27.

Monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis caused by streptococcal and clostridial infections is treated with penicillin G and clindamycin; S. aureus infections are treated according to susceptibilities. Antibiotic therapy should be continued until features of sepsis have resolved and surgery is completed. Patients may require repeated surgery until debridement and drainage are complete and healing has commenced.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^c80d4815]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern with facial lacerations is potential communication with the oral cavity, which carries a significant bacterial load. Lacerations that are confined to the intraoral cavity (including mucous membranes, the lips, and the tongue) and do not communicate with the extraoral environment do not need antibiotics. Through-and-through lacerations have been considered at higher risk for infection, and therefore antibiotics are often suggested, although this remains controversial given the limited data. There are almost no specific data to inform antibiotic prophylaxis for scalp wounds specifically, so it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the management of other traumatic soft tissue wounds. Traumatic cartilage exposure (ear, nose) has historically been treated with prophylactic antibiotics (often fluoroquinolones) in addition to local wound care due to concern for perichondritis. Fluoroquinolones have been used because pseudomonas is a common cause of all-cause perichondritis, but most of these cases are related to piercings, and it is unclear whether the trauma population follows the same microbial pattern. Evidence to support systemic antibiotics in these injuries is lacking. Thus, as above, we think a practical approach would be to risk stratify the wound and the patient and use antibiotics only sparingly in truly high-risk situations.

Nasal packing

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of nasal packing?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in the setting of nasal packing for traumatic epistaxis given a lack of data showing benefit.

Discussion: Nasal packing material is often placed when other efforts at controlling epistaxis have failed. Packing can stay in place for an amount of time varying from a few hours to many days. Infectious concerns with nasal packing include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and toxic shock syndrome. However, multiple recent studies have found routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to be neither effective at reducing infection rates nor cost-effective given the risks and complications of antibiotics. Rates of infection associated with nasal packing are very low at baseline, and cases of toxic shock syndrome secondary to nasal packing are almost non-existent from the last decade. Due to this low infection rate, the many small studies that have attempted to study the role of empiric antibiotic prophylaxis are grossly underpowered to show any significant difference.

### Meta-analysis comparing efficacy of antibiotics versus oral contraceptives in acne vulgaris [^3e1eb5d7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both antibiotics and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been found to be effective in managing acne vulgaris. Despite widespread use, few direct comparisons of efficacy between the 2 modalities have been published.

Objective

We compared the efficacy of antibiotics and OCPs in managing acne.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane collaboration guidelines.

Results

A review of 226 publications yielded 32 randomized controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. At 3 and 6 months, compared with placebo, both antibiotics and OCPs effected greater percent reduction in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesions; the 2 modalities at each time point demonstrated statistical parity, except that antibiotics were superior to OCPs in percent reduction of total lesions at 3 months (weighted mean inflammatory lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 53.2%, 3-month course of OCPs = 35.6%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 26.4%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 57.9%, 6-month course of OCPs = 61.9%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 34.2%; weighted mean noninflammatory lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 41.9%, 3-month course of OCPs = 32.6%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 17.1%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 56.4%, 6-month course of OCPs = 49.1%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 23.4%; weighted mean total lesion reduction: 3-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 48.0%, 3-month course of OCPs = 37.3%, 3-month course of placebo treatment = 24.5%, 6-month course of oral antibiotic treatment = 52.8%, 6-month course of OCPs = 55.0%, 6-month course of placebo treatment = 28.6%).

Limitations

Investigative treatment heterogeneity and publication bias are limitations.

Conclusions

Although antibiotics may be superior at 3 months, OCPs are equivalent to antibiotics at 6 months in reducing acne lesions and, thus, may be a better first-line alternative to systemic antibiotics for long-term acne management in women.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^634c7001]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis — management when arthritis has not completely resolved includes: for partial response (mild residual joint swelling) after a first course of oral antibiotic, we make no recommendation for a second course of antibiotics versus observation (no recommendation, knowledge gap), with the comment that a second course of oral antibiotics for up to 1 month may be a reasonable alternative for patients with mild residual joint swelling and for those who prefer repeating a course of oral antibiotics before considering IV therapy; for no or minimal response (moderate to severe joint swelling with minimal reduction of the joint effusion) to an initial course of oral antibiotic, we suggest a 2- to 4-week course of IV ceftriaxone over a second course of oral antibiotics (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The rate of resolution of Lyme arthritis after an initial course of oral antibiotics can vary, with 90% of patients responding within 1–3 months, and patients treated with IV ceftriaxone have resolution of all signs and symptoms in 59–83% of cases, although complete resolution may take many months to over a year.

Post-antibiotic (previously termed antibiotic-refractory) Lyme arthritis — subsequent management recommends that in patients who have failed one course of oral antibiotics and one course of IV antibiotics, we suggest a referral to a rheumatologist or other trained specialist for consideration of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, intraarticular steroids, or arthroscopic synovectomy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and antibiotic therapy for longer than 8 weeks is not expected to provide additional benefit to patients with persistent arthritis if that treatment has included 1 course of IV therapy.

### Are the view of Helicobacter pylori colonized in the oral cavity an illusion? [^68457a80]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The eradication of stomach H. pylori infection faces more challenging than ever due to progressive loss efficacy of traditional therapy

There were several proposals how to providing treatment after failure of second-line therapies. One of them is the endoscopic-guided antibiotic susceptibility testing. However, according to the principal of Maastricht Guidelines, its role has expanded over, over again in past years. Several authors have reported the results of such proposal. The developed both efficacy clinical trials and cost-effectiveness trials against drug-resistant of treatment on stomach H. pylori infections. However, their results are not very successful, because antibiotic resistance is not the only main reason for the failure so far. The failure becomes a good attention in medical societies worldwide, special in Asia. It is time now we should establish a new view besides antibiotic resistance, which are the most important issues for the progressive loss of efficacy of eradication due to oral facts. Yeeproposed the key conception that H. pylori have a second colonized site in an oral cavity in addition to the stomach. However, some authors said 'oral H. pylori cannot be cultured', ' H. pylori exists in the oral cavity are dead bacterial that has no effect on stomach treatment' and 'the oral cavity is not a colonized site', which has become the main reasons to deny our version of oral H. pylori colonization. Because the majority of physicians working in gastroenterology field ignore the oral H. pylori, ~20% of the population of Asia suffers from oral H. pylori infection. Not only in Asia, Jonaitis et al. reported that after H. pylori eradication they frequency observe on H. pylori recurrence of peptic ulcer patients during 9 years in Lithuania The recurrence rate of H. pylori is high at 27.2%. This number is very close that we found in Asia.

### Acne and craniofacial defects [^ec6f136b]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for the acne in a patient with this condition?
A. Topical retinoid
B. Oral antibiotic
C. Isotretinoin
D. Topical antibiotic
E. Benzoyl peroxide

Answers:
A. Topical retinoid – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin, not topical, is found to be most effective at resolving acneiform lesions associated with Apert syndrome.
B. Oral antibiotic – Incorrect. Although tetracyclines inhibit the FGFR2b downstream expression and activity of metalloproteinases, this inhibition has not been sufficient in treating this gain-of-function FGF2 mutation.
C. Isotretinoin – Correct. The onset of acne in Apert syndrome, and often oily skin, occurs in early puberty. When androgen levels increase, they promote FGF synthesis, activate the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation, and cause the severe acneiform lesions in these patients. FGF2b signaling is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne. Although most drugs target single regions of the FGF2b signaling cascade, oral retinoids disrupt multiple regulatory steps and signals in the FGFR2 pathway and therefore provide the most effective treatment for patients with the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation. However, depending on the acne severity, isotretinoin may not be required in all patients. A risk-benefit assessment should be made on an individual case basis because of the numerous known potential side effects of isotretinoin. Of concern, the disruption of FGFR2 signaling during embryonic development yields a teratogenicity risk in postpubertal females.
D. Topical antibiotic – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin therapy is the best therapy for these patients.
E. Benzoyl peroxide – Incorrect. Although benzoyl peroxide is effective in interrupting acne pathogenesis through the degradation of lysosomal receptors and downregulation of FGFR2b, it is not sufficient in Apert syndrome. The gain-of-function FGF2 mutation in Apert syndrome requires multiple levels of pathway inhibition for successful treatment.

### Moderate and severe inflammatory acne vulgaris effectively treated with single-agent therapy by a new fixed-dose combination adapalene 0.3% / benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled study [^b03bcf14]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Indeed, 0.3% A/BPO may fill a gap as a single-agent treatment for moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Pediatric guidelines recommend that an oral antibiotic be started concomitantly with topical combination therapy (i.e. topical retinoid and BPO) promptly to prevent scarring in severe acne, when there is evidence of scarring even in moderate acne, or as a step-up regimen if initial therapeutic response with topical therapy is not adequate. European guidance suggests that for moderate acne, an oral antibiotic should be initiated upon the presentation of more widespread disease. Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be able to substitute antibiotics in the interest of minimizing antibiotic resistance in cases where the addition of systemic antibiotic therapy is considered, particularly as its mechanism of action includes prevention of microcomedone formation. International guidelines for acne management stipulate that oral isotretinoin remains the gold standard for severe acne treatment. Recent guidance for the pediatric population suggests that oral isotretinoin is no longer indicated as first-line treatment, but instead only after inadequate response with initial treatment using combination therapy (topical treatment associated with oral antibiotic). Therefore, 0.3% A/BPO may be an appropriate treatment, alone or in combination with other therapies, prior to the potential need for step-up treatment to oral isotretinoin, or while enrolling the patient in the required programs to obtain access to oral isotretinoin. Furthermore, 0.3% A/BPO may be seen as a replacement for existing topical combination therapies used with oral antibiotics in not only moderate acne but also in severe inflammatory non-nodulocystic acne (although, perhaps not exclusively).

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to switching to oral therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider transitioning to oral antibiotics in patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, who are initially treated with parenteral therapy, are clinically improving, can take oral medication, and have an effective oral option available, rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration.
Regard an antimicrobial agent as effective if it achieves therapeutic levels in both the urine and the relevant tissue, and demonstrates activity against the causative pathogen.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1ed0eec0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. Two comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) topical antibiotics or b) systemic antibiotics. Within each comparison we separated where both groups of patients had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toilet and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We identified seven studies (935 participants) across four comparisons with antibiotics compared against acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of quality of life or serious complications. A. Topical antiseptic (acetic acid) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge with acetic acid compared with aminoglycosides at one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.08; 1 study; 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. It was very uncertain if there was more ear pain, discomfort or local irritation with acetic acid or topical antibiotics due to the low numbers of participants reporting events (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.34; 2 RCTs; 189 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were reported narratively for hearing (quinolones) or suspected ototoxicity (aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). B. Topical antiseptic (aluminium acetate) versus topical antibiotics No results for the one study comparing topical antibiotics with aluminium acetate could be used in the review. C. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones) One study reported more participants with resolution of ear discharge when using topical antibiotics (quinolones) compared with boric acid ear drops at between one to two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.92; 1 study; 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear discharge for every five people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. There was a bigger improvement in hearing in the topical antibiotic group compared to the topical antiseptic group (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels (dB), 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence) but this difference may not be clinically significant. There may be more ear pain, discomfort or irritation with boric acid compared with quinolones (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies; 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). Suspected ototoxicity was not reported. D. Topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) versus topical antibiotics (quinolones) It is uncertain if there is a difference between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no patients developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks, or ear pain, discomfort or irritation, were reported. E. Topical antiseptic (acetic acid) + aural toileting versus topical + systemic antibiotics (quinolones) One study reported that participants receiving topical and oral antibiotics had less resolution of ear discharge compared with acetic acid ear drops and aural toileting (suction clearance every two days) at one month (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; 100 participants). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks, ear pain, discomfort or irritation, hearing or suspected ototoxicity.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) probably results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw conclusions. Adverse events were not well reported.

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^bcc0bc1e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during the study period (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone. Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the study period (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any relevant outcome for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days. Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no beneficial effect for COVID-19 individuals. There is no evidence from RCTs available for other antibiotics as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of COVID-19. With accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. However, in relation to the evidence for azithromycin and in the context of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside well-designed RCTs.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^662faa87]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme carditis antibiotic regimens — In outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Evidence includes a randomized controlled trial comparing oral doxycycline to IV ceftriaxone in acute disseminated infection without meningitis in which 6.5% presented with carditis, showing similar efficacy but significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events with IV ceftriaxone and more dermatologic adverse events with doxycycline; patients initially treated with IV antibiotics should be converted to oral therapy to complete their treatment course once they begin to improve, and there are no comparative data evaluating whether other oral antibiotics have similar efficacy in the treatment of Lyme carditis.

### Antibiotics for trachoma [^557fda4a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Trachoma is the world's leading infectious cause of blindness. In 1997 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by the year 2020, based on the 'SAFE' strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement).

Objectives

To assess the evidence supporting the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective) and on Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection of the conjunctiva (secondary objective).

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1950 to December 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (December 2010) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (December 2010). We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the included studies. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and we contacted authors and experts for details of further relevant studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 12 December 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that satisfied either of two criteria: (a) trials in which topical or oral administration of an antibiotic was compared to placebo or no treatment in people or communities with trachoma, (b) trials in which a topical antibiotic was compared with an oral antibiotic in people or communities with trachoma. A subdivision of particular interest was trials in which topical tetracycline or chlortetracycline and oral azithromycin were compared with each other, or in which one of these treatments was compared with placebo or no treatment, as these are the two WHO recommended antibiotics. We considered individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for missing data. Where appropriate, the effect estimates from the individual studies (risk ratios) were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Results

A total of 14 trials randomised individuals with trachoma to oral antibiotic, topical antibiotic, both, or control (no treatment or placebo) and were eligible for inclusion in this review (n = 3587). Overall, the quality of the evidence provided from these trials was low. Nine of the trials compared antibiotic treatment to control. Most of the studies found a beneficial effect of treatment on active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection at three and 12 months follow up. There was considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials, which meant that it was difficult to reliably estimate the size of the treatment effect. It is likely to be in the region of a 20% relative risk reduction. Seven of the 14 trials compared the effectiveness of oral and topical antibiotics. There was no consistent evidence as to whether oral or topical antibiotics were more effective, although one trial suggested that a single dose of oral azithromycin was significantly more effective than unsupervised use of topical tetracyclineA further eight trials assessed the effectiveness of community-based treatment. In five trials antibiotic treatment was compared to no (or delayed) treatment (57 communities), and in three trials oral antibiotic was compared to topical treatment (12 communities). The quality of the evidence provided by these trials was variable but at least one trial was considered to provide high quality evidence. There was evidence that community-based antibiotic treatment reduced the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection 12 months after single-dose treatment. There was some evidence that oral azithromycin was more effective than topical tetracycline as a community treatment. Data on adverse effects were not consistently reported however there were no reported serious adverse events associated with treatment with oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline; in one sample survey of 671 people treated with azithromycin between 10% and 15% experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea or vomiting, or both).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection in people infected with C. trachomatis, but we do not know for certain the size of the treatment effect in individuals. Mass antibiotic treatment with single-dose oral azithromycin reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection in communities.

### Efficacy of tetracyclines in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a review [^34fb5119]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Oral tetracyclines are routinely used for the management of inflammatory acne. However, there is a lack of evidence-based data on their relative effectiveness and appropriate dosages.

Objectives

To assess the relative effectiveness and the optimal dosage of tetracyclines for the treatment of inflammatory acne.

Methods

We designed a systematic review of the clinical trials (1962–2006) investigating oral tetracyclines for the treatment of inflammatory acne. We obtained data from MEDLINE, PubMed, Current Contents, reference lists and specialist textbooks.

Results

There was substantial heterogeneity in the design of the trials. We identified only seven randomized trials which were set up to compare the efficacy of tetracyclines in reducing acne lesion counts. These showed no evidence of superiority of one tetracycline over another. Overall, there was also no significant difference between the available tetracyclines in terms of improvement in inflammatory (32 trials, P = 0.898) and noninflammatory (23 trials, P = 0.429) lesions. In the range of investigated dosages, the antibiotic dosage had no impact on efficacy in inflammatory (P = 0.609) and noninflammatory (P = 0.654) lesions. There was no decrease in efficacy during the study period.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support one tetracycline rather than another in terms of efficacy. In the range of investigated dosages, the antibiotic dosage seems to have no impact on efficacy. Despite increased resistance to antibiotics, oral tetracycline formulations displayed no change in efficacy during the study period. Further studies are, however, required to determine if the anti-inflammatory properties of tetracyclines are sufficient in managing acne.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^45aa076f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^388f7fa0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Overview Multiple antibiotic regimens have been recommended for GAS carriage eradication in either
- 2002 U. S. guidelines for postpartum and post-surgical outbreaks
- Canada's guidelines for prevention and control of invasive GAS disease Several regimens have been used in previous outbreaks for GAS carriage eradication. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis.

Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens. First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages. Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days.

Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported. Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella infections in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review on antimicrobial resistance and treatment [^b728a25e]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

As expected, this review did not find high-quality evidence on the efficacy or safety of antimicrobial treatment of invasive NTS infections. No data were available from interventional or dedicated observational clinical studies. In analogy with the lack of evidence, we did not find supranational guidelines on the antimicrobial treatment of invasive NTS infections. However, we found three guidelines from the USA that are used internationally, i.e. the Red Book, the Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy, and the NIH guidelines on the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. In general, the "Access group" antibiotics ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol and the "Watch group" antibiotics ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin were recommended as the first-choice antibiotics. Some also recommended the use of the "Watch group" antibiotic azithromycin. Most authors proposed 7–14 days of antibiotics for uncomplicated bloodstream infections and 4–6 weeks for meningitis, osteomyelitis, endovascular, or other focal infections. The possibility of oral antimicrobial treatment or switch to oral antimicrobial treatment was suggested in some guidelines and reviews.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^2ccee4fc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

CRS-directed antibiotics and steroids — Clinicians should use systemic antibiotics for acute exacerbations of CRS; however, in some patients, this may not be necessary (Rec, C). Consider a 3- to 6-week course of topical antibiotics for CRS (Rec, C). Consider the use of systemic antibiotics plus a short course of oral steroids in the treatment of CRS; greater benefit with antibiotics has been reported in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP (Rec, A). Consider a short course of oral steroids for the treatment of CRSwNP (Rec, C). Use short-term treatment with oral steroids in CRSwNP because it decreases nasal polyp size and symptoms (StrRec, A). Use intranasal corticosteroid (INS; sprays and aerosols) for the treatment of CRSwNP and CRSsNP (StrRec, A).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^8bc65296]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Human bite wound infections — key antibiotic choices and organism considerations — include oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6 h, with doxycycline 100 mg bid as an oral option, for which the table states "Good activity against Eikenella species, staphylococci, and anaerobes; some streptococci are resistant". The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

### Interventions for impetigo [^8cabc637]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938–1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949–1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.

Side Effects

The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.

### Chronic suppurative otitis… [^cc110cee]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation in children should be treated with an oral antibiotic. Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is better than oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for treating acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes. Topical quinolone antibiotics, with or without topical corticosteroids, are the best treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media. The authors concluded that antibiotics were more effective than placebo or delayed treatment in children with acute otitis media and otorrhea versus children with acute otitis media without otorrhea.

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH TYMPANOSTOMY TUBES An industry-sponsored, single-blind RCT of 80 children six months to 12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute otitis media compared ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid oral suspension. The children treated with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone had a median time to cessation of otorrhea of four days compared with seven days for those treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. CHRONIC SUPPURATIVE OTITIS MEDIA A 2007 clinical evidence review of adults with chronic suppurative otitis media concluded that topical antibiotics, with or without topical corticosteroids, are likely to reduce persistent otorrhea. 7 An expert consensus panel convened by the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery recommends topical quinolone antibiotics for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media and tympanostomy tube otorrhea in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease.

8 In 2004, the World Health Organization recommended topical quinolone antibiotics without additional oral antibiotics for treating chronic suppurative otitis media. 1.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^2214a212]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^d41ae381]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The comparisons were 1. topical antiseptics compared to topical antibiotics, and 2. topical antiseptics compared to systemic antibiotics. We further separated these comparisons into those in which a. both groups of participants received aural toileting in addition to the intervention, or b. both groups received some other add-on therapy treatment (such as systemic antibiotics) to both arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This updated review included eight new studies. Overall, we identified 15 studies (2371 participants) across seven comparisons with antibiotics compared to acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life or serious complications. 1. Topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) versus topical antiseptic (acetic acid) We included seven studies (835 participants). Acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge when compared to aminoglycoside at one to two weeks (low-certainty evidence). It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks when compared to topical quinolone. Results after four weeks were only presented narratively. It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may cause more ear pain, discomfort, local irritation, or combinations of these compared to topical antibiotics (aminoglycosides and quinolones) (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 277 participants; very low-certainty evidence). An additional two studies (350 participants) provided narrative results. There may be little to no difference in hearing between groups reported narratively (quinolones; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for serious complications (aminoglycosides) or suspected ototoxicity (aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (boric acid) We included two studies (532 participants). Topical quinolones are likely to increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks compared with boric acid ear drops (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.35; 1 study, 411 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear discharge for every four people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. There may be less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation with quinolones compared with boric acid (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies, 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). Suspected ototoxicity and serious complications were not reported. Topical quinolones may result in a greater improvement in mean hearing from baseline compared to topical boric acid (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels, 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study, 390 participants; low-certainty evidence), but this difference may not be clinically significant. 3. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) We included one study (40 participants). It is very uncertain if there is a difference between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no participants developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks; ear pain, discomfort, or irritation; or serious complications. 4. Topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptic (aluminium acetate) We included one study (51 participants; 60 ears) that presented results for resolution of ear discharge at two to four weeks results narratively. No other results were reported. 5. Other comparisons Five studies (966 participants) were assessed over an additional three comparisons; however, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) likely results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw conclusions. Harmful effects were not well reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recent data, limitations in the quality of included studies, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Oral antibiotics are effective for the treatment of hand osteomyelitis in children [^2f3b269d]. Hand (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Acute osteomyelitis of the hand is common in the pediatric population. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics is expensive and is associated with catheter-site infection and thrombosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of managing osteomyelitis of the hand in children with oral antibiotics. Methods: A retrospective review of cases of acute osteomyelitis of the hand at a single pediatric institution over a 4.5-year period was performed. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed, and treatment courses and outcomes were analyzed. Results: In total, 21 patients with acute osteomyelitis of the hand were included in the study. Of the 21 patients, 17 were initiated on a 6-week course of oral antibiotics upon diagnosis. Thirteen were successfully treated with oral antibiotics alone, 3 required subsequent surgical debridement, and 3 required conversion to intravenous antibiotics. Of the 21 patients, 4 were treated with surgical debridement upon diagnosis due to gross purulent drainage and then initiated on a 6-week course of oral antibiotics. All patients who underwent debridement were treated successfully with postoperative oral antibiotics. Conclusions: Most cases of osteomyelitis of the hand in children can be treated with oral antibiotics, either as the primary treatment or as postoperative therapy. Surgical debridement is indicated when purulence is present at the time of initial diagnosis or if the infection progresses during treatment with oral antibiotics. The use of oral antibiotics for treating acute osteomyelitis of the hand in children may result in decreased cost and fewer catheter-associated complications.
