## Question

fenofibrate and kidney function

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how fenofibrate affects kidney function, including mechanisms, clinical evidence, dosing in renal impairment, monitoring, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled dosing constraints in renal impairment. Then, I should verify the mechanism behind creatinine rises and whether this reflects true GFR loss. Next, I will review randomized and observational evidence on renal outcomes, including reversibility and albuminuria effects. After that, I need to check dosing recommendations across regulatory sources and reconcile discrepancies. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled renal guidance. Fenofibrate is a prodrug converted to fenofibric acid, which is substantially renally cleared; exposure increases as kidney function declines, explaining dose restrictions in moderate to severe CKD and contraindication in severe impairment, typically eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², where accumulation and adverse effects rise meaningfully [^1115UscN] [^111mwnEh] [^111TZt9Q]. Wait, I should verify the exact labeled thresholds and starting doses because different formulations vary; the FDA labeling for fenofibric acid advises 45 mg once daily in eGFR 30–59 and contraindicates use below 30, while some fenofibrate labels specify a 48 mg daily start when CrCl is at least 30 mL/min, with dose escalation only after assessing renal function and lipids, which I need to keep in mind when advising patients with borderline eGFR values [^111mwnEh] [^115H6QR4] [^112Wg4h2].

> Now, I will examine the mechanism of fenofibrate-associated creatinine elevation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that a creatinine bump equals structural kidney injury; multiple studies show a reversible increase in serum creatinine with relatively preserved true GFR, pointing toward hemodynamic or tubular transport effects rather than parenchymal damage. Mechanistically, decreased effective renal plasma flow, altered tubular secretion of creatinine, and possibly increased creatinine generation have been proposed, with supportive data from clearance studies and cystatin C observations that parallel creatinine changes, reinforcing a functional rather than structural explanation in most cases [^111ijNdZ] [^115gaga8] [^112G3cao] [^112k39G3]. I should double-check that this pattern holds across populations; yes, similar reversible dynamics are seen in diabetes cohorts and in combination therapy studies with washout designs, strengthening the case for a pharmacologic, reversible effect rather than true nephrotoxicity in the majority of patients [^115L99EN] [^114YSsXF].

> Next, I should review the randomized trial evidence on renal outcomes. In ACCORD Lipid, about 47% of fenofibrate-treated participants had a 20% or greater creatinine rise at 3 months, yet after 5 years and a 51-day drug holiday, creatinine returned to placebo levels, and those with minimal early rise had net GFR preservation versus placebo, arguing against long-term structural harm and suggesting possible renoprotection in a subset [^1164cnhD] [^114Zcf5c] [^113Jcd48]. In FIELD, fenofibrate reduced albuminuria progression and slowed eGFR decline despite early creatinine increases, with no excess ESRD events, and the greatest absolute cardiovascular benefit observed in those with eGFR 30–59, supporting safety and potential renal benefit in moderate CKD when appropriately dosed [^116Vw9ti] [^114Ptzzo] [^112JjiB4]. Let me verify consistency with meta-analyses; a systematic review confirms reversible creatinine rises, reduced albuminuria progression in diabetes, and cardiovascular benefit in mild to moderate CKD, aligning with these trial data [^114AxAL4].

> I need to check observational and real-world signals for context and risk stratification. Population-based data in older adults show a 2.4-fold increase in hospitalization for creatinine rise after new fibrate starts, with higher risk in CKD, yet no excess dialysis or mortality, again supporting reversibility and the need for early monitoring rather than avoidance in appropriately selected patients [^111iG13K]. In gout cohorts, fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity, defined as a creatinine rise of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 6 months, occurred in about 10% overall and was more frequent with baseline CKD or tophi, with approximately two-thirds reversing after drug withdrawal, highlighting a vulnerable subgroup that warrants closer surveillance and dose caution [^112N3WJY] [^116jm9fo]. But wait, what if the patient has severe CKD or is on dialysis; in those settings, case reports and pharmacokinetic reasoning support avoiding fenofibrate due to accumulation and potential tubular injury, reinforcing the labeled contraindication in eGFR less than 30 [^111TZt9Q] [^111mwnEh].

> Let me consider dosing recommendations and reconcile apparent discrepancies. The FDA fenofibric acid label recommends 45 mg once daily for eGFR 30–59 and contraindicates use below 30, which is a conservative, safety-first approach given accumulation risk and myopathy potential in severe CKD [^111mwnEh]. Some fenofibrate labels suggest starting at 48 mg daily when CrCl is at least 30 mL/min and only increasing after reassessing renal function and lipids, which is consistent with a cautious titration strategy in mild to moderate impairment [^115H6QR4] [^112Wg4h2]. Hold on, I should verify whether standard 200 mg dosing was used safely in trials; FIELD used a fixed 200 mg dose without renal adjustment and still showed cardiovascular benefit without excess ESRD, but that protocol predated current labeling conservatism and excluded severe CKD, so contemporary practice should align with labeled dose reductions to mitigate exposure-related risks [^116Vw9ti] [^111mwnEh].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions. In older adults, renal function should guide dosing because exposure increases as eGFR falls; routine renal monitoring is prudent, and dose reductions are appropriate for eGFR 30–59, with avoidance below 30, consistent with labeling and geriatric pharmacokinetics [^111TZt9Q] [^111mwnEh]. For transplant recipients, case series document reversible allograft dysfunction with fenofibrate, likely reflecting tubular toxicity in the context of calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity; if used, very close monitoring and low starting doses are advisable, with prompt discontinuation if creatinine rises disproportionately [^116uTvgw]. Regarding statin coadministration, fenofibrate does not meaningfully inhibit statin metabolism like gemfibrozil, so the myopathy risk is lower, though vigilance remains necessary, especially in CKD where myopathy risk is inherently higher [^115i2PXJ] [^111TZt9Q].

> I will now examine monitoring and interpretation of renal labs during therapy. Baseline creatinine, eGFR, and liver enzymes should be obtained before initiation, with a repeat creatinine and eGFR check within 4–8 weeks to detect early rises, recognizing that a 20–30% increase is common and often functional; if the rise exceeds 50% or is accompanied by concerning clinical features, reassess volume status, concomitant nephrotoxins, and consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation, with re-challenge after resolution if clinically indicated [^notfound]. Let me verify the time course of reversibility; ACCORD showed complete reversal of creatinine within about 6–8 weeks off drug, supporting a watchful waiting approach when the clinical context is stable and no alternative explanation exists for the rise [^114Zcf5c] [^113Jcd48]. I should confirm that cystatin C may help distinguish functional from structural changes; parallel increases in cystatin C with creatinine during therapy that normalize off drug further support a reversible, non-injurious mechanism in most patients [^112k39G3].

> But wait, what about the possibility of true nephrotoxicity in some cases. Recent case reports describe osmotic nephropathy with isometric vacuolization on biopsy in the setting of unadjusted dosing in severe renal impairment, reminding me that accumulation-related tubular injury can occur and that guideline-concordant dosing and avoidance in eGFR less than 30 are essential safeguards rather than mere formalities [^111jVAHr]. I should also note that while meta-analyses suggest no increase in ESRD and possible cardiovascular benefit in CKD, the renal outcome data are less robust than the albuminuria and eGFR slope signals, so shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit discussions are warranted, especially in patients with borderline kidney function or high pill burden [^114AxAL4].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical approach. For patients with eGFR 60 or higher, standard fenofibrate dosing is reasonable with baseline and early follow-up labs to document the expected creatinine pattern and ensure stability. For eGFR 30–59, use the lowest effective dose, typically fenofibric acid 45 mg or fenofibrate 48 mg daily depending on product, reassess renal function and lipids before any dose escalation, and avoid use if eGFR is below 30 or if there is a history of disproportionate creatinine rises with fibrates. In gout or transplant populations, anticipate higher nephrotoxicity risk, start low, monitor closely, and be prepared to discontinue if creatinine rises by 30% or more without an alternative explanation, recognizing that most elevations are reversible on withdrawal [^111mwnEh] [^115H6QR4] [^112N3WJY] [^116uTvgw]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both safety and efficacy; yes, this strategy balances the cardiovascular and albuminuria benefits seen in moderate CKD with the need to mitigate accumulation-related risks and interpret creatinine changes correctly rather than reflexively stopping an otherwise beneficial therapy [^116Vw9ti] [^114AxAL4].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The long-term impact of fenofibrate on hard renal endpoints remains incompletely defined, and ongoing observational follow-up may clarify whether the favorable albuminuria and eGFR slope effects translate into fewer dialysis events over decades. Until then, clinicians should individualize decisions, prioritize statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction, and reserve fenofibrate for persistent hypertriglyceridemia or compelling microvascular indications, applying conservative dosing and vigilant monitoring in CKD to optimize benefit while minimizing harm [^114AxAL4] [^116ToooH] [^111J3BRF].

Fenofibrate causes a **reversible increase in serum creatinine** of about 10–20% [^112acerj] within weeks of initiation, reflecting reduced tubular secretion rather than true GFR decline [^notfound]. This effect is **fully reversible within 4–8 weeks** after stopping therapy [^114Zcf5c] and is not associated with increased risk of ESRD or dialysis [^114Ptzzo] [^1123TUak]. In patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², fenofibrate is contraindicated [^111mwnEh]; for eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², use 48 mg daily and monitor renal function [^115H6QR4] [^112Wg4h2]. Routine monitoring of creatinine at baseline and 4–8 weeks after initiation is recommended [^notfound]; if creatinine rises > 50% from baseline, reassess and consider dose reduction or discontinuation [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of fenofibrate-induced changes in kidney function

Fenofibrate-associated creatinine rises reflect **reduced tubular secretion** and hemodynamic effects, not structural injury [^112Sd6i1] [^111ijNdZ]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Reduced tubular secretion**: Fenofibrate inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine, increasing serum creatinine without reducing true GFR [^notfound].

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Fenofibrate may alter renal hemodynamics, contributing to transient creatinine increases [^111ijNdZ].

- **Reversibility**: These effects are reversible on discontinuation, with creatinine returning to baseline within 4–8 weeks [^114Zcf5c] [^113Jcd48].

---

## Clinical evidence of fenofibrate-induced changes in kidney function

Multiple studies show fenofibrate causes a **transient, reversible creatinine rise** without structural kidney injury:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| ACCORD Lipid Trial | Type 2 diabetes | - 48% had ≥ 20% creatinine rise at 3 months [^114Zcf5c] <br/> - Fully reversible after discontinuation [^114Zcf5c] <br/> - No excess ESRD or dialysis [^notfound] |
| FIELD Study | Type 2 diabetes | - 12% mean creatinine rise [^112acerj] <br/> - Reversible on discontinuation [^1129yuDG] [^114JHu1Z] <br/> - No excess ESRD or dialysis [^114Ptzzo] |
| Healthy volunteer study | Normal renal function | - Creatinine rose 0.11 mg/dL <br/> - No change in inulin clearance <br/> - Indicates hemodynamic/tubular effects [^111ijNdZ] [^115gaga8] |

---

## Clinical significance and reversibility of fenofibrate-induced renal changes

Fenofibrate-induced creatinine rises are **clinically benign and reversible**; they do not indicate structural kidney injury or progressive renal decline [^112Sd6i1]. Reversibility is consistent, with creatinine returning to baseline within 4–8 weeks after stopping therapy [^114Zcf5c] [^113Jcd48]. Long-term safety shows no increase in ESRD or dialysis in large trials [^114Ptzzo] [^114AxAL4].

---

## Risk factors for fenofibrate-induced renal impairment

Certain patients are at **higher risk** of a creatinine rise with fenofibrate:

- **Pre-existing renal impairment**: eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² increases risk [^112myNWL].

- **High-dose fenofibrate**: Higher doses increase nephrotoxicity risk [^113bj7Ci].

- **Concomitant medications**: Calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors may increase risk [^113bj7Ci].

- **Elderly patients**: Age-related renal decline increases susceptibility [^1115UscN].

---

## Recommended monitoring and management strategies

To minimize renal risk, **follow these practices**:

- **Baseline assessment**: Check serum creatinine and eGFR before starting therapy [^111mwnEh].

- **Early monitoring**: Recheck creatinine and eGFR 4–8 weeks after initiation [^notfound].

- **Dose adjustment**: If creatinine rises > 50% from baseline, reassess and consider dose reduction or discontinuation [^notfound].

- **Renal impairment**: Avoid use if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; use 48 mg daily if eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111mwnEh] [^115H6QR4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **cautious use and monitoring** in patients with renal impairment:

- **KDOQI**: Recommends dose reduction and monitoring in CKD; avoid in severe impairment [^112Kp3Kd].

- **FDA**: Contraindicates use in severe renal impairment; requires dose reduction in mild-to-moderate impairment [^111mwnEh].

- **ACC/AHA**: Recommends monitoring renal function and adjusting therapy as needed [^notfound].

---

## Long-term renal outcomes and safety

Long-term data show fenofibrate does not increase ESRD or dialysis and may slow eGFR decline and reduce albuminuria, suggesting **renoprotective effects** in diabetes [^114Ptzzo] [^116Vw9ti] [^116WgUuu].

---

Fenofibrate causes a **reversible creatinine rise** from reduced tubular secretion and hemodynamic effects, not structural injury [^114JHu1Z]. This is benign and resolves after discontinuation, with no excess ESRD or dialysis. Use is contraindicated in severe renal impairment and requires dose reduction and monitoring in mild-to-moderate CKD [^111mwnEh].

### Effect of fenofibrate on kidney function: a 6-week randomized crossover trial in healthy people [^111ijNdZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Fenofibrate was associated with increases in serum creatinine concentrations. The effect of short-term fenofibrate treatment on kidney function was investigated in subjects with normal kidney function.

Study Design

Double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled.

Setting and Participants

24 middle-aged subjects with normal kidney function (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 80 mL/min).

Intervention

Subjects were treated with fenofibrate (160-mg/d tablet) and placebo in two 6-week periods separated by a washout.

Outcomes and Measurements

The primary outcome measure was glomerular filtration rate measured by means of inulin clearance, with a test of noninferiority to rule out a change in the 95% confidence interval (CI) greater than 20%. Secondary outcomes included effective renal plasma flow measured by means of para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, creatinine clearance, creatinine secretion (ratio of creatinine to inulin clearance), serum cystatin C and uric acid, and urinary excretion of creatinine. Glomerular and tubular damage was evaluated by using albumin and retinol-binding protein levels and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity.

Results

Inulin clearance was unchanged after fenofibrate (change [Delta] between treatments on 6-week values, 0.8 mL/min; 95% CI, -10.5 to 12.2; P = 0.9), but PAH clearance decreased (Delta, -33; 95% CI, -66 to -1; P = 0.05). Changes in inulin and PAH clearances were not greater than 20%. Plasma creatinine level increased (Delta, 0.11 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.18; P < 0.05), and creatinine clearance decreased (Delta, -9.5 mL/min; 95% CI, -14.4 to -4.7; P < 0.001). Creatinine secretion and urinary creatinine excretion were unchanged (Delta, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.02; P = 0.2; Delta, 0.37 g/24 h; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.88; P = 0.1, respectively). Plasma cystatin C level increased (Delta, 0.18 mg/L; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.34; P = 0.02) and serum uric acid level decreased (Delta, -0.7 mg/dL; 95% CI, -1.2 to -0.3; P = 0.1). Urinary albumin and retinol-binding protein levels were unchanged, but urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity increased (Delta, 20.0 mumol/h/mmol creatinine; 95% CI, 9.3 to 30.7; P = 0.001).

Limitations

Short treatment duration and inclusion of healthy subjects precludes conclusions about effects of longer term use in patients with kidney disease. Small changes in glomerular filtration rate may be difficult to detect by using clearance methods. Interference with the creatinine assay cannot be excluded.

Conclusion

Short-term fenofibrate treatment did not alter glomerular filtration rate by more than 20% in subjects with normal kidney function, but a smaller decrease cannot be ruled out. Increased serum creatinine levels may be caused by decreased creatinine clearance. The explanation for decreased creatinine clearance and increased serum creatinine levels in this study is not clear.

### Long-term effects of intensive glycemic and blood pressure control and fenofibrate use on kidney outcomes [^116FRvoG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In people with type 2 diabetes, aggressive control of glycemia, BP, and lipids have resulted in conflicting short-term (< 5 years) kidney outcomes. We aimed to determine the long-term kidney effects of these interventions.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) was a multifactorial intervention study in people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (n = 10,251), to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c < 6.0% versus 7%-7.9%), BP control (systolic BP < 120 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg) or fenofibrate versus placebo added to simvastatin on cardiovascular events and death. The glycemia trial lasted 3.7 years and participants were followed for another 6.5 years in ACCORDION, the ACCORD Follow-On Study. The post hoc primary composite kidney outcome was defined as incident macroalbuminuria, creatinine doubling, need for dialysis, or death by any cause. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated the effect of each intervention on the composite outcome and individual components. In secondary outcome analyses, competing risk regression was used to account for the risk of death in incident kidney outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographics, randomization groups, and clinical factors.

Results

There were 988 cases of incident macroalbuminuria, 954 with doubling of creatinine, 351 requiring dialysis, and 1905 deaths. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the composite outcome with intensive glycemic, BP control, and fenofibrate use compared with standard therapy were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.86 to 0.98), 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28), and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27). Multivariable, secondary outcome analyses showed that in the glycemia trial, only macroalbuminuria was significantly decreased (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77). In the BP and lipid trials, only creatinine doubling was affected (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.06 and HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.49, respectively).

Conclusions

In people with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease, intensive glycemic control may result in a long-term reduction in macroalbuminuria; however, intensive BP control and fenofibrates may increase the risk for adverse kidney events.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^1164cnhD]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

This study found that about 50% of ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants experienced an increase of 20% or more in serum creatinine levels immediately upon starting fenofibrate therapy, while approximately 25% had no increase. For those participants with a creatinine increase of 20% or more, the increase was reversible and not associated with an adverse effect — compared with placebo — on renal function over 5 years. Those with no increase in creatinine upon starting fenofibrate appeared to have less renal function loss compared with placebo over 5 years of therapy. More work needs to be done to test these findings over longer durations of therapy, to determine if this apparent renal protection is also seen among the low HDL/high triglyceride subgroup that had apparent cardiovascular benefit in the main ACCORD Lipid Study, and to determine the duration of the apparent renal protective effects.

---

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^115sNPUp]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Our results suggest the presence of two distinct clinical effects of fenofibrate therapy. The first is the previously studied rise in serum creatinine levels shortly after starting therapy. Based on the ACCORD results, this can be expected to occur in 47% of type 2 diabetic patients with a similar cardiovascular and renal function profile to the participants in the ACCORD Lipid Trial. This rise appears to be wholly reversible after 5 years of therapy. The second effect is a preservation of GFR in patients who experience little or no rise in serum creatinine immediately after initiating therapy, which is expected in about 25% of patients with a similar profile to ACCORD Lipid. A similar protective effect on GFR was also seen in fenofibrate participants more generally at the conclusion of the FIELD Trial. Whether this preservation is maintained or whether it reduces the long-term macro- or microvascular disease risk after the initial 5 years of therapy is unknown. The ACCORDION (ACCORD Follow-Up) Study, which is currently underway, will help to answer the second question. ACCORDION is a posttrial, prospective, observational study of 8,000 ACCORD participants over 3.5 years to elucidate the long-term effects of the ACCORD treatment strategy and will include additional measurements of serum creatinine, urinary creatinine, and albumin.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^116Vw9ti]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Diabetic patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2) are at particular cardiovascular risk. Fenofibrate's safety in these patients is an issue because it may elevate plasma creatinine. Furthermore, guidelines regarding fenofibrate dosing in renal impairment vary internationally. We investigated fenofibrate's effects on cardiovascular and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) events, according to eGFR, in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Type 2 diabetic patients (aged 50–75 years) with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were randomly allocated to a fixed dose of fenofibrate (200 mg daily) (n = 4,895) or placebo (n = 4,900) for 5 years. Baseline renal function (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) was grouped by eGFR (30–59, 60–89, and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The prespecified outcome was total cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary/carotid revascularization). Serious adverse events and instances of ESRD (plasma creatinine > 400 μmol/L, dialysis, renal transplant, or renal death) were recorded. Analysis was by intention to treat.

RESULTS

Overall, fenofibrate reduced total cardiovascular events, compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–0.99]; P = 0.035). This benefit was not statistically different across eGFR groupings (P = 0.2 for interaction) (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.68 [0.47–0.97], P = 0.035; eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2: 0.85 [0.70–1.02], P = 0.08). ESRD rates were similar between treatment arms, without adverse safety signals of fenofibrate use in renal impairment.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment benefit from long-term fenofibrate, without excess drug-related safety concerns compared with those with no or mild renal impairment. Fenofibrate treatment should not be contraindicated in moderate renal impairment, suggesting that current guidelines may be too restrictive.

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^113WgTH6]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a chronic disease caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and is characterised by joint inflammation and pain. The prevalence of gout is 2.7–6.7% in western developed countries and has steadily increased recently to 1.1% in mainland China. One correlation is kidney damage, with nephropathy associated with gout.

Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia, which is prevalent with ∼50–70% of gout patients suffering from dyslipidaemia. The 2012 ACR guidelines recommend that agents other than probenecid with clinically significant uricosuric effects, such as fenofibrate and losartan, can be therapeutically useful as components of a comprehensive urate-lowering therapy (ULT) strategy. In addition, the 2016 European League Against Rheumatism guidelines suggest the use of fenofibrate in gout patients. However, the British Society for Rheumatology Guideline did not recommend fenofibrate as a primary ULT because of its weak uricosuric effect. Moreover, the 2020 ACR guidelines recommend against adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate despite its urate-lowering effects, as the risks, including side effects of the medication, were felt to outweigh potential benefits. However, the level of evidence supporting the ACR recommendation against the switch to fenofibrate is low. A combination of fenofibrate plus ULT is regarded as beneficial in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia and/or hypertension, as well as hyperuricaemia in gout patients with these complications, and has been widely used in clinical practice.

The elevation of serum creatinine (SCr) levels in some gout patients with hypertriglyceridaemia receiving fenofibrate treatment has been observed. However, this adverse effect has not been thoroughly evaluated with respect to the incidence, potential risk factors and reversibility of nephrotoxicity in gout patients on fenofibrate treatment. Therefore we performed a single-centre, retrospective, observational study to investigate these questions.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^111AxnB2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the FIELD Study, fenofibrate did not increase CVD or renal risk in the setting of mild or moderate renal impairment in type 2 diabetes, despite causing an elevation in plasma creatinine. In those with pre-existing moderate renal impairment, the CVD benefits of fenofibrate were at least as great as in those with normal renal function, without any additional safety concerns. Therefore, fenofibrate at standard doses should be considered as an additional therapeutic option, along with conventional risk factor management, to further reduce CVD events and mortality and afford renoprotection in patients with type 2 diabetes, even in patients with moderate renal impairment.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Fenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking fenofibrate.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The use of fenofibrate should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The use of fenofibrate has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^115PA3ch]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetic patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) are at particular cardiovascular risk. Fenofibrate's safety in these patients is an issue because it may elevate plasma creatinine. Furthermore, guidelines regarding fenofibrate dosing in renal impairment vary internationally. We investigated fenofibrate's effects on cardiovascular and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) events, according to eGFR, in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study.

Research Design and Methods

Type 2 diabetic patients (aged 50–75 years) with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were randomly allocated to a fixed dose of fenofibrate (200 mg daily) (n = 4,895) or placebo (n = 4,900) for 5 years. Baseline renal function (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) was grouped by eGFR (30–59, 60–89, and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The prespecified outcome was total cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary/carotid revascularization). Serious adverse events and instances of ESRD (plasma creatinine > 400 μmol/L, dialysis, renal transplant, or renal death) were recorded. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Overall, fenofibrate reduced total cardiovascular events, compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–0.99]; P = 0.035). This benefit was not statistically different across eGFR groupings (P = 0.2 for interaction) (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m(2): 0.68 [0.47–0.97], P = 0.035; eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2): 0.85 [0.70–1.02], P = 0.08). ESRD rates were similar between treatment arms, without adverse safety signals of fenofibrate use in renal impairment.

Conclusions

Patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment benefit from long-term fenofibrate, without excess drug-related safety concerns compared with those with no or mild renal impairment. Fenofibrate treatment should not be contraindicated in moderate renal impairment, suggesting that current guidelines may be too restrictive.

### Fenofibrate and risk of end-stage renal disease: a nationwide cohort study [^1123TUak]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Previous studies have shown that fenofibrate improves outcomes such as albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline. We hypothesize that fenofibrate has renoprotective effects and prevents or delays the development of end-stage renal disease. The objective of this study is to investigate the risk of incident end-stage renal disease in relation to fenofibrate treatment in patients who are already taking statins.

Materials and Methods

We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using data from the Korea National Health Information Database from 2010 to 2017. Among adults using statins, 413715 fenofibrate users were compared with 413715 fenofibrate non-users after 1:1 age, sex and triglyceride matching. The endpoint of this study was incident end-stage renal disease.

Results

During a median 3.96-year follow-up, the incidence per 1000 person years of end-stage renal disease was lower in fenofibrate users than in fenofibrate non-users (0.885 vs. 0.960, p < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for end-stage renal disease was lower (0.763, 95% confidence interval 0.710–0.821) in fenofibrate users. This association was significant in patients with hypertension, proteinuria and an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73 2.

Conclusions

Fenofibrate use in patients taking statins with either hypertension, proteinuria, or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate is associated with a low risk of incident end-stage renal disease. To confirm the renoprotective effect of fenofibrate in chronic kidney disease, a randomized controlled trial is warranted.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^1129yuDG]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Fenofibrate was also found to have a protective effect on the albuminuria levels in ACCORD Lipid Trial participants. Fewer participants randomized to fenofibrate progressed to frank microalbuminuria or proteinuria postrandomization than placebos. This result is consistent with the reduced progression found in the DAIS and FIELD Trials, and the greater reduction in mean urinary albumin/creatinine ratio in the fenofibrate arm compared with placebo over 5 years of follow-up in FIELD. The ACCORD Lipid Trial albuminuria results will be reported in detail elsewhere.

Previous studies support our key finding about the reversibility of serum creatinine levels postfenofibrate therapy. Early comparative studies in patients who had undergone renal transplant and were on fenofibrate therapy demonstrated a reversible increase in creatinine if no chronic renal failure was present at baseline. A limitation of these early reports is that they were all retrospective case studies in a limited number of patients with pre-existing renal disease or transplant. The FIELD Trial reported results from a large study of reversibility of renal function in patients with diabetes on fenofibrate therapy. After a 6-week prerandomization run-in period of all FIELD study participants on fenofibrate therapy, mean levels of serum creatinine increased, but returned to baseline in those subjects randomized to placebo within 4 months of cessation of therapy. Furthermore, a posttrial fenofibrate wash-out substudy at the conclusion of the 5-year trial demonstrated an acute decline in creatinine values during the wash-out period of 52 days resulting in a net protective effect of fenofibrate. Similar to ACCORD, the FIELD Trial examined a broad population of type 2 diabetic participants who had normal renal function at study entry.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^115gaga8]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Fenofibrate therapy is commonly prescribed for the clinical management of elevated triglyceride levels in diabetic patients, but has been noted to cause an elevation in serum creatinine concentrations. In several small studies, creatinine levels increased during fenofibrate treatment but returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy. In the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) of the effects of fenofibrate on angiographically demonstrated progression of coronary artery disease in 418 individuals with diabetes, serum creatinine rose 16% in the fenofibrate-treated group and 0.2% in the placebo group. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study of the effects of fenofibrate on cardiovascular outcomes in 9,795 individuals with diabetes, after the prerandomization 6-week fenofibrate run-in period, serum creatinine returned to baseline levels after 4 months in those participants randomized to receive the nonfenofibrate placebo. In a post-FIELD trial wash-out study in 7% of the participants (n = 661), serum creatinine fell by 16% (change in median 1.04–0.87 mg/dL) in the fenofibrate group, but by 4% in the placebo group (0.93–0.89 mg/dL).

Although these data suggest that the increase in creatinine is reversible, the effect has not been fully confirmed in large studies or trials, and the mechanism underlying the rapid elevation and subsequent decline on cessation of therapy is not well understood. Given the apparently rapid and complete reversibility in most cases, it has been postulated that the mechanism is an alteration of renal hemodynamics. Increased creatinine production has also been proposed as has decreased creatinine secretion in renal tubules. Serum cystatin C, considered to be a specific marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), has been reported to be unchanged or increased during fenofibrate treatment. Similarly, inulin clearance has been reported to be unchanged in two smaller studies despite increases in serum creatinine.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Trial offered a rare opportunity in a large cohort to determine if the rise in creatinine seen among some individuals upon starting fenofibrate is reversible after prolonged exposure to the drug.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^112Sd6i1]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is projected to remain the single leading cause of death and is a major cause of morbidity and premature mortality in people with diabetic kidney disease, independent of other risk factors. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study was a 5-year trial of fenofibrate versus placebo involving type 2 diabetic patients. Although there was no significant benefit from fenofibrate for the primary end point of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, the secondary end points of CVD events and nonfatal myocardial infarction were significantly reduced, as were hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and coronary and carotid revascularization procedures. Fenofibrate also significantly reduced the microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes, including nephropathy.

Set against its potential benefits, there have been safety concerns associated with fenofibrate administration in the setting of renal impairment, with current guidelines recommending dose reduction in patients with even mildly abnormal renal function. The rise in plasma creatinine in response to fenofibrate is well documented, but this does not reflect true renal injury or an actual fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although renal impairment is an independent risk predictor of CVD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it has been unclear whether the fenofibrate-associated rise in plasma creatinine might also confer excess risk, especially in patients with pretreatment renal impairment. We therefore investigated the impact of fenofibrate on prespecified cardiovascular and renal end points of the FIELD Study in patients with impaired renal function at baseline.

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^113MdFux]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) than the general population.
Information regarding the association between fibrate use and the risk of MACE in patients with CKD is limited.
Furthermore, the class effect of fibrates on MACE is not fully understood.

This study adds:

Recent and current use of fibrates, but not past use, was significantly associated with reduced risks of MACE in patients with CKD.
Among the classes of fibrates, a significant association was observed between current pemafibrate use, but not bezafibrate and fenofibrate use, and a reduced risk of MACE.

Potential impact:

The optimal use of fibrates in patients with CKD may lead to better clinical outcomes.
Among fibrates, pemafibrate may be a better choice than other fibrates.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^114Zcf5c]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We investigated the potential reversibility of the rapid serum creatinine increase observed on starting fenofibrate therapy. The fenofibrate cases (participants who experienced a 20% or more increase in serum creatinine after 3 months of fenofibrate; 47.4% of all participants randomized to fenofibrate in the ACCORD Lipid Trial) had a mean serum creatinine decrease on cessation of fenofibrate to a value that was no different than the mean creatinine of the placebo reference group, suggesting no residual loss of GFR after 5 years of therapy. This reversal of serum creatinine elevation was complete after 51 days off therapy. By contrast, for the control subgroup of fenofibrate participants (participants who experienced < 2% change in creatinine; 24.6% of all participants randomized to fenofibrate), the mean serum creatinine was lower than the placebo reference group after 51 days off therapy, suggesting a net preservation of GFR and renal function. The serum cystatin C results showed similar trends.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^111y54yq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Diabetes is a significant risk factor for CVD events and mortality, requiring intensive treatment of conventional CVD risk factors. Unfortunately, the implementation of established preventive treatment recommendations remains incomplete, and even with intensive multifactorial risk reduction, the CVD complication rate in type 2 diabetic patients remains unacceptably high. The FIELD Study confirms that type 2 diabetic patients with reduced eGFR (< 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2) are at exceptionally high risk of CVD (> 5% per year). This underscores the need for better implementation of proven treatments, especially in those with coexistent renal impairment.

These FIELD Study findings should help allay previous concerns regarding the safety of fenofibrate use in patients with renal impairment, indicating that neither moderately poor renal function nor an initial rise in plasma creatinine with fenofibrate is a contraindication to such treatment. Furthermore, treatment benefits at least as great as those seen in patients with normal renal function could be expected. The benefits reported here support the long-term use of standard doses of fenofibrate in such patients to reduce both CVD events and death from CVD. These benefits occur despite a reversible and modest increase in plasma creatinine, with evidence of renoprotection (eGFR preservation and albuminuria reduction) that was similar across the eGFR groups. The benefits of fenofibrate on CVD and albuminuria are both in addition to and independent of established proven measures, such as glycemic control, antihypertensive treatment in general, and use of the renin-angiotensin system blockade in particular (,–). In this context, the results would support the use of fenofibrate being in addition to, rather than an alternative to, the above current established strategies.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^114Dti9Y]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In both the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, as well as in the FIELD Study, fenofibrate was associated with a reduction in albuminuria despite similar elevations in serum creatinine to those seen in the FIELD Study. In a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration hearing, the ACCORD trial reported that after fenofibrate withdrawal eGFR returned to placebo-matched levels, with some patients having an overall improvement in renal function. The ACCORD trial and other studies also show that fenofibrate is not associated with excess kidney-related adverse events and is, overall, safe to use even in combination with statins. However, none of these previous study reports have investigated if there is any relationship between outcomes and the drug-induced creatinine rise or examined the safety and efficacy of fenofibrate use in renal impairment. To our knowledge, this article is the first to do so, looking at both cardiovascular and renal outcomes. It provides added reassurance, demonstrating that the drug is not only safe but also just as efficacious in patients with moderate renal impairment compared with those with normal function.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^111ktLAp]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The ACCORD Trial was a double 2 × 2 factorial trial designed to test the effect of 1) intensive glucose control versus standard control, 2) intensive blood pressure control versus standard control, and 3) lipid treatment strategy that used fenofibrate plus a statin compared with statin monotherapy on the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Details of the design of the ACCORD Lipid Trial have already been published. Briefly, 5,518 participants were randomized to either fenofibrate or placebo medication. All participants received simvastatin to assure good LDL control, and participants were started on masked medication (160 mg/day fenofibrate or placebo) at the month 1 visit. All 77 participating clinics obtained approval from their local institutional review board prior to participating. This ACCORD Renal Ancillary Study was conducted among participants of a subset of 40 clinics with a total enrollment of 1,081 participants (mean per clinic enrollment was 27, range 2–91). Participants read and signed an additional informed consent before enrollment in this study.

During the ACCORD Lipid Trial, participants whose GFR fell below 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for two consecutive visits had their fenofibrate dose reduced to 54 mg/day. Participants whose GFR fell below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 on two consecutive visits had their fenofibrate discontinued. To maintain masking, placebo arm participants who experienced similar decreases in GFR were provided with equivalent appearing, reduced dose placebo tablets or had their placebo pills discontinued. All GFR estimates for safety reporting used the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease method.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^114JHu1Z]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Fenofibrate may be an especially appropriate therapy to reduce CVD risk in the setting of renal impairment because it raises apolipoprotein A1 and HDL cholesterol levels and influences HDL particle size. However, its use has been limited by concerns that the typical drug-induced rise in plasma creatinine might adversely affect CVD risk and renal outcomes. In the FIELD Study, we found no evidence that the use of a standard dose of fenofibrate in patients with moderate renal impairment had adverse effects on either CVD or renal outcomes. In fact, the greatest absolute risk reductions for CVD events with fenofibrate were seen in those with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and no excess ESRD events were seen in fenofibrate-treated patients in any eGFR group. Of interest, although the number of subjects in the low-eGFR group was relatively small, there was an independently significant CVD reduction with fenofibrate in patients with low HDL cholesterol or marked dyslipidemia. The relative CVD benefits of fenofibrate were statistically equivalent across eGFR groups, except for CVD mortality, for which fenofibrate was associated with a significantly greater risk reduction in those with lower baseline renal function.

In general, higher baseline serum creatinine is associated with an increased risk of ESRD, with findings confirmed in the FIELD Study. However, the fenofibrate-induced increase in circulating creatinine levels does not carry the same risk of ESRD events because these events were nonsignificantly fewer in those allocated to fenofibrate than to placebo.

The reasons behind the initial fenofibrate-associated plasma creatinine rise have yet to be fully elucidated, and there are various hypotheses apart from reduced glomerular filtration. These include increased muscle production of creatinine, changes in active tubular creatinine secretion, and altered renal plasma flow. Several of these mechanisms may be involved, but regardless of the underlying physiology, the early creatinine rise is fully reversible even after 5 years of fenofibrate treatment and is concurrently associated with significant reductions in total CVD events and preservation of renal function.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^111u62mo]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Fenofibrate therapy in those in the group with low eGFR produced the greatest estimated absolute reduction in CVD risk despite the greatest early plasma creatinine rise. Therefore, not only does this early drug-induced plasma creatinine rise fail to portend any adverse cardiac or renal outcomes, but it may in fact be a surrogate marker of drug benefit. This latter finding is hypothesis generating and will require further clinical investigation.

Current guidelines for fenofibrate use in Western countries recommend a substantial dose reduction (between 30 and 69%) when renal function is impaired but with significant variation in the threshold at which this should be implemented. Dose reduction is recommended when creatinine clearance is < 100 mL/min in Canada to < 80 mL/min in the U.S. and < 60 mL/min in the U.K. and Australia. Recommendations for dose reduction also vary by manufacturer, which may cause confusion and undue concern about fenofibrate use in patients with any level of renal impairment. Our current findings suggest that these thresholds may be too restrictive and that fenofibrate dose reductions may not be required until eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules and periodically thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Treatment with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules should be initiated at a dosage of 45 mg orally once daily in patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and TG levels at this dosage.
Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients

Dosage selection for geriatric patients should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^114YSsXF]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the reversibility of the elevation of serum creatinine levels in patients with diabetes after 5 years of continuous on-trial fenofibrate therapy.

Research Design and Methods

An on-drug/off-drug ancillary study to the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Trial to investigate posttrial changes in serum creatinine and cystatin C. Eligible participants were recruited into a prospective, nested, three-group study based on retrospective on-trial serum creatinine levels: fenofibrate case subjects (n = 321, ≥ 20% increase after 3 months of therapy); fenofibrate control subjects (n = 175, ≤ 2% increase); and placebo control subjects (n = 565). Serum creatinine and cystatin C were measured at trial end and 6–8 weeks after discontinuation of trial therapy. RESULTS At trial end, case subjects had the highest adjusted serum creatinine (± SE) mg/dL (1.11 ± 0.02) and the lowest adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (± SE) mL/min/1.73 m(2) (68.4 ± 1.0) versus control subjects (1.01 ± 0.02; 74.8 ± 1.3) and placebo subjects (0.98 ± 0.01; 77.8 ± 0.7). After 51 days off-drug, serum creatinine in case subjects was still higher (0.97 ± 0.02) and eGFR still lower (77.8 ± 1.0) than control subjects (0.90 ± 0.02; 81.8 ± 1.3) but not different from placebo subjects (0.99 ± 0.01; 76.6 ± 0.7). Changes in serum cystatin C recapitulated the serum creatinine changes.

Conclusions

Participants with significant initial on-trial increases in serum creatinine (≥ 20%) returned to the same level of renal function as participants receiving placebo while participants who had ≤ 2% increase in serum creatinine had net preservation of renal function compared with the same unselected placebo reference group. The fenofibrate-associated on-trial increases in serum creatinine were reversible, and the reversal was complete after 51 days off-drug. The similarity of the cystatin C results suggests that the mechanism of this change is not specific for serum creatinine.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^112JjiB4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Consistent with the highest absolute risks for CVD events being in those with the greatest renal impairment, fenofibrate offered the greatest absolute risk reductions in these individuals. Patients with a baseline eGFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 who received fenofibrate had independently significant absolute risk reductions compared with those allocated to the placebo group in coronary revascularization, total CVD events, and CVD mortality (Table 2). However, the relative risk reductions with fenofibrate were similar to those for other patients such that there were no statistically significant trends for varying treatment effects across eGFR groups (P > 0.05 for interaction), even after adjustment for on-study statin use. For example, fenofibrate reduced CVD risk overall by 11% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.80–0.99]; P = 0.035) irrespective of eGFR grouping (Fig. 2; P = 0.22 for interaction), with an overall number needed to treat of 70 (95% CI 36–1,112) to avoid one event. Among those with an eGFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, there was neither significantly greater benefit nor greater harm, with an estimated total CVD risk reduction of 32% (0.68 [0.47–0.97]; P = 0.035) and number needed to treat of 14 (7–834). These observed benefits on total CVD (as also was true for reduced albuminuria) were independent of the background use or nonuse of ACE inhibitors, the extent of glycemic control (by HbA 1c), and systolic blood pressure levels (all P interactions were not significant).

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^116megq2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESULTS

We recruited 321 active fenofibrate arm cases (30.2%), 175 active fenofibrate arm controls (16.5%), and 565 active placebo controls (53.3%) plus 20 others (18 ineligible and 2 eligible but missing required study data) for a total ACCORD Renal Ancillary Study enrollment of 1,081 participants. Forty-nine individuals (4.6%) were lost to follow-up between the trial close-out visit (the first Renal Study on-drug visit) and postclose-out (off-drug) visit. Two of the forty-nine were deaths with causes not attributed to this study. The clinical characteristics for the three recruited study groups are listed in Table 1. As expected, the change in serum creatinine between the trial baseline and month 4 visits was significantly different between cases and controls with a mean (± SD) increase of +0.31 ± 0.16 mg/dL in cases, decrease of −0.05 ± 0.08 mg/dL in controls, and was also significantly different between controls and placebos, with placebos showing no change (0.00 ± 0.13 mg/dL). Other differences between the three groups included fewer control participants in the intensive arm of the ACCORD Glycemia Trial (37%) than cases (55%) or placebos (49%); differences among all three groups in the mean follow-up time during the main trial from randomization to close-out visit (5.0 ± 1.0 vs. 5.6 ± 1.6 vs. 5.2 ± 1.2 years); more Asian participants among controls (17%) than in cases (10%) or placebo (10%); a lower triglyceride level at trial close-out among cases (136 ± 14 mg/dL) than either controls (160 ± 227 mg/dL) or placebos (163 ± 93 mg/dL); greater use of insulin by cases at trial close-out (62%) than among controls (49%); and more cases (58%) with a creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL at close-out than among either controls (38%) or placebos (36%). There were no significant differences in mean time interval between close-out and postclose-out visits for the three groups (Table 2). Creatinine levels in cases remained higher than controls at study close-out after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, although the creatinine levels in cases declined from the month 4 visit to close-out visit, while that of the controls and placebos increased, narrowing the difference in the means between the groups.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^114Q5Uyj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and CKD — fibrate and statin therapy outcomes and dosing considerations are as follows. In type 2 diabetes, fenofibrate lowered new onset microalbuminuria versus placebo (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.97), promoted regression from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04–1.28; n = 2260; 2 trials), and did not change progression to macroalbuminuria (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.43–2.63; 1 trial; n = 97). The Treating to New Targets trial reported benefit for secondary prevention with atorvastatin, 80 mg/day versus 10 mg/day, in 546 patients with diabetes and CKD over 5 years; stroke risk was 4.8% (13/273) versus 3.7% (10/271) and there was no reduction in all-cause mortality. Higher doses of lipid-lowering medicines are associated with increased risk of myopathy, particularly among patients with reduced kidney function; therefore, doses of some lipid-lowering medicines should be modified in moderate-to-advanced CKD (stages 3–5). The SHARP trial used simvastatin (20 mg/day) plus ezetimibe (10 mg/day) to achieve an average LDL-C reduction of about 1 mmol/L.

### Safety considerations with fibrate therapy [^115i2PXJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Fibrates are an important class of drugs for the management of dyslipidemia. This class of drugs is generally well tolerated but is infrequently associated with several safety issues. Fibrates, most likely by an effect mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, may reversibly increase creatinine and homocysteine but are not associated with an increased risk for renal failure in clinical trials. Fibrates are associated with a slightly increased risk (< 1.0%) for myopathy, cholelithiasis, and venous thrombosis. In clinical trials, patients without elevated triglycerides and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, fibrates are associated with an increase in noncardiovascular mortality. In combination with statins, gemfibrozil generally should be avoided. The preferred option is fenofibrate, which is not associated with an inhibition of statin metabolism. Clinicians are advised to measure serum creatinine before fibrate use and adjust the dose accordingly for renal impairment. Routine monitoring of creatinine is not required, but if a patient has a clinically important increase in creatinine, and other potential causes of creatinine increase have been excluded, consideration should be given to discontinuing fibrate therapy or reducing the dose.

### Effects of long-term fenofibrate treatment on markers of renal function in type 2 diabetes: the FIELD helsinki substudy [^116ybT49]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that fibrates increase the production of creatinine with no adverse effect on renal function. This seems unlikely since an increase of creatinine excretion has not been observed, which was confirmed in our study. Thus, we cannot exclude the option that the increase of creatinine is caused by the decrease in creatinine clearance. Another hypothetical option is that fenofibrate might have an inhibitory effect on the excretion of creatinine via the kidneys, requesting higher blood concentration of creatinine to maintain normal excretion. Finally, fenofibrate may increase the flow of creatinine from the muscle. If fenofibrate increases creatinine outflow from the muscle, muscle damage cannot be ruled out. However, creatine phosphokinase levels were lower in the fenofibrate group in this study. Likewise, increased flux of creatinine from muscle should be reflected in increased excretion of creatinine, which was not seen in this study.

This study was a prespecified FIELD Helsinki substudy addressing renal function using several markers but not an intention to treat analysis as several patients were excluded. In this substudy, direct measures of GFR could not be used due to multiple visits and a cumbersome study protocol. However, the size of our study cohort gives enough statistical power despite potential day-to-day variations in the measured variables. The strength of our study is that all used parameters of albumin excretion and renal function showed parallel results in the fenofibrate group.

In conclusion, our results do not support the benefits of fenofibrate on the progression of albuminuria. Available data do not allow us to conclude whether the fenofibrate-induced increase in creatinine and cystatin C are relevant for the prognoses of these patients, but obviously the changes in the estimates of eGFR impair the follow-up of renal function in clinical practice. The results of the lipid-lowering arm of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial may clarify the issue. Currently, the use of fenofibrate for cardiovascular protection should be considered in the context of the increases of both creatinine and cystatin C.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^113Jcd48]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

At the postclose-out visit after discontinuation of the fenofibrate study drug for 51 days, the mean creatinine had decreased markedly in both cases (average decrease −0.13 ± 0.01 mg/dL) and controls (average decrease −0.09 ± 0.01 mg/dL), but showed a slight increase in placebos (average increase +0.02 ± 0.01 mg/dL). The absolute magnitude of reduction in serum creatinine was significantly greater in cases than in controls (P = 0.002), and also different in both cases and controls compared with a slight rise in placebos (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). After discontinuation of the study drug for 6–8 weeks, cases had a mean serum creatinine of 0.12 mg/dL above trial baseline mean, while controls were 0.04 mg/dL below their baseline mean, although identical to their mean value at trial month 4. Similar between-group trends were observed in eGFR. At postclose-out, the mean eGFR of cases was 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 greater than placebos but not significant (P = 0.4), while controls were 5.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 greater than placebos (P < 0.0001). These results did not change substantially after removing participants who stopped taking nonfenofibrate, renal function–altering medications between close-out and postclose-out visits (further details in the Supplementary Data online). The Supplementary Data also includes analyses that suggest that the reduction in serum creatinine was essentially complete after 51 days.

### A randomized, double-blind study of fenofibric acid plus rosuvastatin compared with rosuvastatin alone in stage 3 chronic kidney disease [^115L99EN]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have mixed dyslipidemia and high cardiovascular disease risk. Although statins reduce LDL-C, adding a fibrate may further improve lipid parameters.

Objective

This multicenter, randomized study evaluated the short-term efficacy and safety profile of fenofibric acid (FA) + rosuvastatin (R) combination therapy for improving lipid parameters in patients with stage 3 CKD and mixed dyslipidemia. The study also assessed estimated glomerular filtration rate after study drug washout.

Methods

Patients received FA 45 mg + R (5 mg for 8 weeks, then 10 mg for 8 additional weeks) or R monotherapy (5 mg for 8 weeks, then 10 mg for 8 additional weeks), followed by an 8-week washout period. Primary and secondary end points were percent changes in triglycerides and HDL-C, respectively, from baseline to week 8.

Results

FA 45 mg + R 5 mg, compared with R 5 mg, resulted in significant improvements in triglycerides (median % changes: week 8, -38.0% vs -22.4%, P < 0.001; week 16, -42.6% vs -29.7%, P < 0.001) and HDL-C (mean % changes: week 8, 16.9% vs 7.8%, P < 0.001; week 16, 17.3% vs 8.9%, P < 0.001). Adverse event rates were similar between groups (70.7% with FA + R vs 68.6% with R). Mean serum creatinine level at baseline was 1.36 mg/dL in the FA + R group and 1.38 mg/dL in the R group. The final treatment serum creatinine value, defined as the last nonmissing postbaseline value collected within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, was 1.52 mg/dL with FA + R (vs 1.41 mg/dL with R; P < 0.001), which then decreased to 1.39 mg/dL after the 8-week washout (vs 1.42 mg/dL with R).

Conclusions

The data suggest that, after 16 weeks of therapy, FA + R has an acceptable safety profile and improved TG and HDL-C efficacy versus R. FA + R combination therapy may thus further improve lipid parameters in patients with stage 3 CKD and mixed dyslipidemia. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00680017.

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^116jm9fo]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity is often overlooked in the treatment of gout patients with hypertriglyceridaemia. Our retrospective study suggests that 10.2% of gout patients initiated on fenofibrate will develop an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl. The incidence was higher when gout patients had the complications of tophus and/or CKD. The elevated SCr was reversible in 65.6% patients after fenofibrate withdrawal.

Fenofibrate, which can activate the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, is a good option to lower SU concentrations in gout patients with hypertriglyceridaemia. Fenofibrate induces an elevation in SCr in some individuals with mild renal insufficiency shortly after taking the drug. A population-based study that included 80 453 patients reported that in the first 90 days of treatment, fenofibrate was associated with a 2.4-fold risk of hospitalization due to increased SCr compared with ezetimibe. In this cohort, 9.1% of fenofibrate users had an increase of SCr > 50%. However, in some experimental cases, fenofibrate presents a renoprotective effect against nephropathy in the case of attenuating tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation. The application of fenofibrate in gout patients is also ubiquitous owing to its ability to reduce SU levels and the risk of gout attacks. However, the renal safety of fenofibrate in gout patients is still unclear.

This study confirmed that fenofibrate-related nephrotoxicity occurs in > 10% in a general cohort of gout patients and > 30% in patients with tophus and CKD. Previously eGFR declined ∼1 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year, from 120–130 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in younger patients; those that declined > 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year were considered 'fast progressors'. In our study, the fenofibrate-related nephrotoxicity group had an eGFR reduction of ∼25 ml/min/1.73 m 2 after fenofibrate initiation, whereas the predicted progression of CKD or chronic gouty nephropathy is generally < 12 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year. This indicates that the majority of nephrotoxicity during gout management is caused by fenofibrate.

### The ACCORD (action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes) lipid trial: what we learn from subgroup analyses [^111XGqeV]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A total of 5,518 men and women with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the ACCORD Lipid trial. All participants received simvastatin (20–40 mg/day) and were also randomly assigned to masked fenofibrate (160 or 54 mg/day, depending on renal function) or placebo. The primary outcome was the first postrandomization occurrence of a nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years.

The primary outcome occurred at a rate of 2.4%/year in the placebo group and 2.2%/year in the fenofibrate group. This result gave a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95% CI 0.79–1.08), which was not significant (P = 0.32). Thus, the ACCORD Lipid trial did not confirm its primary hypothesis. There were a number of secondary outcomes, including each component of the primary composite outcome tested individually, an expanded cardiovascular outcome, major coronary events, and total mortality. None of these outcomes showed differences that were statistically significant. In some prior fibrate trials, cardiovascular and/or total mortality tended to be increased in fibrate-treated groups. In the ACCORD Lipid trial, annual cardiovascular mortality was 0.77% in the fenofibrate group and 0.83% in the placebo group; total mortality was 1.47% in the fenofibrate group and 1.61% in the placebo group. There was no evidence of increased mortality with fenofibrate.

### Effects of fibrates in kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114AxAL4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy and safety of fibrate therapy in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population.

Background

Fibrate therapy produces modest cardiovascular benefits in people at elevated cardiovascular risk. There is limited evidence about the clinical benefits and safety of fibrate therapy in the CKD population.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched (1950 to January 2012) for prospective randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of fibrate therapy compared with placebo in people with CKD or on kidney-related outcomes were included.

Results

Ten studies including 16,869 participants were identified. In patients with mild-to-moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), fibrates improved lipid profiles (lowered total cholesterol [-0.32 mmol/l, p = 0.05] and triglyceride levels [-0.56 mmol/l, p = 0.03] but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [-0.01 mmol/l, p = 0.83]; increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [0.06 mmol/l, p = 0.001]). In people with diabetes, fibrates reduced the risk of albuminuria progression (relative risk [RR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76 to 0.98; p = 0.02). Serum creatinine was elevated by fibrate therapy (33 μmol/l, p < 0.001), calculated GFR was reduced (-2.67 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.01) but there was no detectable effect on the risk of end-stage kidney disease (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.49; p = 0.575). In patients with eGFR of 30 to 59.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2), fibrates reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.89; p = 0.004) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.96; p = 0.03) but not all-cause mortality. There were no clear safety concerns specific to people with CKD but available data were limited.

Conclusions

Fibrates improve lipid profiles and prevent cardiovascular events in people with CKD. They reduce albuminuria and reversibly increase serum creatinine but the effects on major kidney outcomes remain unknown. These results suggest that fibrates have a place in reducing cardiovascular risk in people with mild-to-moderate CKD.

### The PPARalpha ligand fenofibrate: meeting multiple targets in diabetic nephropathy [^115xjnop]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Fibrate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha ligands are mainly used as hypolipidemic drugs. But this commentary highlights their potential in treating insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and in preventing diabetic nephropathy, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. Because diabetes is a major contributor to chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, PPAR-alpha agonists may provide greater opportunities for hitting multiple targets in this complex metabolic disease.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^114dAJRb]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5.2 Serum Creatinine

Reversible elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving Trilipix as monotherapy or co-administered with statins as well as patients receiving fenofibrate. In the pooled analysis of three double-blind controlled studies of Trilipix administered as monotherapy or in combination with statins, increases in creatinine to > 2 mg/dL occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with Trilipix monotherapy and 1.1% to 1.3% of patients treated with Trilipix co-administered with statins compared to 0% to 0.4% of patients treated with statin monotherapy. Elevations in serum creatinine were generally stable over time with no evidence for continued increases in serum creatinine with long-term therapy and tended to return to baseline following discontinuation of treatment. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment taking Trilipix is suggested. Renal monitoring should be considered for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, such as the elderly and those with diabetes.

### Fenofibrate and diabetic retinopathy [^116WgUuu]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence aligns with these preclinical findings. A small clinical trial (n = 56) evaluated the efficacy of fenofibrate (200 mg/day) in reducing microalbuminuria in patients with T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia, compared to no intervention. After 180 days, the fenofibrate group showed a significant reduction of 44 mg/g in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), whereas the control group experienced a non-significant reduction of 8 mg/g (p < 0.05).

Similar to retinopathy, post hoc analyses of cardiovascular trials with fenofibrate have assessed kidney outcomes. In the FIELD study, fenofibrate reduced the UACR by 24%, compared to an 11% reduction with placebo (mean difference 14%, p < 0.001). Fenofibrate also decreased progression to microalbuminuria by 14% and increased regression to normoalbuminuria by 18% (p < 0.001 for both). Furthermore, participants on fenofibrate experienced a smaller total loss of eGFR (5.8 ml/min), compared to those on placebo (9.9 ml/min) (p < 0.001). The annual slope of eGFR decline was also significantly lower with fenofibrate (1.19 ml/min/year) compared to placebo (2.03 ml/min/year, p < 0.001).

Finally, these findings were reproduced in the ACCORD trial. Fenofibrate was associated with a slower annual eGFR decline (− 0.28 ml/min/year) compared to placebo (− 1.25 ml/min/year, p < 0.01). Compared to placebo, the risk of new-onset microalbuminuria was 44% lower in the fenofibrate group (HR 0.56 [0.43–0.72]) while the risk of macroalbuminuria was 28% lower (HR 0.72 [0.57–0.91]).

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^115bfEGn]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

The FIELD Study was a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial conducted in Australia, New Zealand, and Finland. The registered study (clinical trial no. ISRCTN64783481) had ethics committee approval in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Study design and patient characteristics have been published elsewhere. In brief, 9,795 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 50–75 years, were randomly allocated to receive 200 mg comicronized fenofibrate or placebo daily for an average of 5 years. There was no dose adjustment for any degree of renal impairment. Subjects had mild dyslipidemia, with no immediate indication at study entry for lipid-modifying therapy. Exclusion criteria included plasma creatinine > 130 μmol/L, liver or symptomatic gallbladder disease, or a CVD event within 3 months before recruitment. All patients with National Kidney Foundation chronic kidney disease stage 5 (estimated GFR [eGFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), stage 4 (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m 2), and some with stage 3 (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2) of the disease were therefore excluded. All patients provided informed consent and then completed a 16-week run-in period comprising 4 weeks of diet, 6 weeks of single-blinded placebo, and 6 weeks of single-blinded fenofibrate before being randomly assigned. Eligibility was confirmed during the run-in period independently of adherence or biochemical changes.

A telephone computer randomization service using dynamic balancing to stratify patients by prognostic variables was used; all investigators, except one statistician, were masked to treatment allocation. Patients were seen every 4–6 months against a background of usual care, and information concerning treatment tolerability and complications was obtained.

eGFR was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study four-variable equation and was grouped as eGFR ≥ 90, 60–89, and 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Baseline eGFR was taken as the mean of two measurements before the active run-in phase (visits 1 and 3, median 72 days apart).

All major CVD events and all other deaths were adjudicated by an outcomes assessment committee using prespecified definitions and while unaware of treatment allocation. The safety- and data-monitoring committee reviewed the safety data at regular intervals every 6 months and undertook two formal interim analyses of the numbers of deaths from CHD.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^114Ptzzo]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Safety of fenofibrate use in renal impairment: ESRD events overall and by eGFR

Overall, there were 26 compared with 21 ESRD events over 5 years in the placebo compared with fenofibrate group, respectively. The greatest rate of ESRD events occurred among those with baseline eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (stratified by treatment). There was no increase in ESRD events with fenofibrate use compared with placebo either overall (data previously published) or within any eGFR group (Table 2; P = 0.75 for interaction). Within the group with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the rates were 1.7 vs. 1.3% (dialysis), 0.7 vs. 0.9% (plasma creatinine > 400 μmol/L), and 0.0 vs. 0.4% (death from renal disease) in the fenofibrate- versus placebo-allocated patients. The extent of the plasma creatinine rise with fenofibrate did not predict the occurrence of ESRD events (P = 0.60 for interaction).

Other serious adverse events

For approximately one-half of the categories of adverse events, the greater the renal impairment the higher the rates of occurrence. However, adverse event rates generally were no higher among those receiving fenofibrate than those on placebo, including within the eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 group. The only category with a statistically significant interaction was nonfatal gastrointestinal events, with more events in the fenofibrate- than placebo-allocated patients with normal renal function (20.5 vs. 17.3% in the placebo group, P = 0.01, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) but no significant difference for patients with eGFR 30–59 or 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Those allocated to fenofibrate had a statistically significant, but only marginally greater, overall risk of pancreatitis and pulmonary embolism than those allocated to placebo, but there was no difference in risk across groups by eGFR (P for interaction for both events not significant). Overall, there was no increased risk of myopathy (2 vs. 1 subjects) or rhabdomyolysis (3 vs. 1 subjects) attributed to fenofibrate, compared with placebo, with too few events to assess whether treatment effect differed by baseline renal function.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^114Sv8PD]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Study power

The study power was estimated for the change in creatinine levels after the trial postclose-out visit based on two-group t tests of differences in the log-transformed serum creatinine. The estimates used Satterthwaite approximation for unequal variances at a Bonferroni-adjusted global significance of 0.05. Based on projected variability estimates prior to study close-out, the power to detect a difference of 1.1 versus 1.0 mg/dL in serum creatinine (i.e. a difference of 0.095 between log means) was 91% for fenofibrate cases versus fenofibrate controls; 99% for fenofibrate cases versus placebo controls; and 94% for fenofibrate controls versus placebo controls. Observed variability was less than projected, yielding post hoc power estimates of 99% for all three comparisons.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^115rjPaZ]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

FIBRICOR is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking FIBRICOR.

8.6	Renal Impairment

The use of FIBRICOR should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

The use of FIBRICOR has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

### Effects of long-term fenofibrate treatment on markers of renal function in type 2 diabetes: the FIELD helsinki substudy [^1122t3qP]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although fenofibrate was associated with less progression of albuminuria in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, it is unknown if it has any effect on renal function. We explored if there were changes in commonly available markers of renal function during fenofibrate treatment in the FIELD Helsinki cohort excluding statin users.

Research Design and Methods

One hundred and seventy subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day) or placebo for 5 years. In this substudy, we measured several markers of albumin excretion and renal function.

Results

After intensified treatment, blood pressure and fasting glucose decreased in both groups while A1C remained at 7.2%. Plasma creatinine increased with fenofibrate while urine creatinine remained comparable between the groups, resulting in significant decreases in both creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)-4 and Cockroft-Gault equations in the fenofibrate group. Cystatin C increased during fenofibrate treatment. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and diurnal urine protein remained unchanged, whereas overnight urinary albumin excretion rate showed minor decreases in both groups.

Conclusions

We report concomitant decreases in creatinine clearance and eGFR by fenofibrate. These changes complicate the clinical surveillance during fenofibrate treatment. We could not demonstrate the beneficial effects of fenofibrate on albumin excretion. A novel finding is the increase of cystatin C in type 2 diabetic patients during fenofibrate treatment. The clinical relevance of the changes needs to be assessed in a long-term outcome study of renal function.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^111c4f6E]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Study population and design

This study used a retrospectively defined, nested, three group, on-drug/off-drug study design. Eligible participants within participating clinics were identified by the Coordinating Center approximately 3 months prior to their ACCORD Lipid Trial close-out visit and reported to clinics while maintaining masking to participant randomization status. Fenofibrate arm case subjects ("cases") were defined as active participants in the fenofibrate arm who had experienced ≥ 20% increase in serum creatinine from trial baseline to month 4 and remained on study medication at close out (either full or reduced dose). Since the study drug was started 1-month postrandomization, study month 4 was equivalent to 3 months of therapy. Fenofibrate arm control subjects ("controls") were defined as active in the fenofibrate arm who experienced ≤ 2% increase in creatinine over the same period. Placebo arm control subjects ("placebos") were defined as randomized to placebo but without restriction on their change in serum creatinine. Individuals with baseline renal disease (creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) were excluded from ACCORD. All eligible cases and controls that consented to participate were enrolled in the study, while eligible placebos were enrolled until maximum enrollment was achieved.

The ACCORD Lipid Trial close-out visit served as the baseline visit for the ACCORD Renal Ancillary Study. A follow-up visit for ancillary study participants was held 6–8 weeks after the trial close-out visit, referred to here as the "postclose-out" visit. At both visits, a medication inventory was obtained. At the trial close-out visit, all trial participants were provided with a 3-month supply of simvastatin, as well as their current diabetes medications. No fenofibrate was provided to any trial participant at close out, and participants in the ancillary study were given a letter asking their physician to refrain from starting open label fenofibrate or other medications that could affect serum creatinine or creatinine excretion until after the postclose-out visit. This protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each clinic, at the Coordinating Center, and at the ACCORD Renal Study Center.

Table 2 shows the adjusted mean creatinine and eGFR for the three groups at four time points during the trial and the postclose-out visit. The same data are plotted in Figs. 1 A and 2 A. The mean values in Table 2 were adjusted for glycemia treatment arm assignment, age, diabetes duration, sex, nonwhite race, insulin use, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure; the change in values were additionally adjusted for the time interval between visits (trial baseline to month 4, or trial close-out to postclose-out visit). All subsequent results in the main text refer to these adjusted values (unadjusted values are included for comparison in). The mean serum creatinine levels in the three study groups were not significantly different at baseline or month 4 from the other participants in the main lipid trial who would have satisfied the retrospective percent change in serum creatinine inclusion criterion and were thus representative of the entire eligible ACCORD Lipid Trial cohort at month 4.

### Simvastatin reduces chronic kidney disease and renal failure risk in type 2 diabetes patients: post hoc ACCORD trial analysis [^115axsy7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The limitation of our analysis is that most ACCORD participants had normal kidney function at baseline, leading to a limited number of renal failure events. Nevertheless, the significant effect of simvastatin on this outcome, even after comprehensive adjustments, warrants further investigation to confirm its robustness. Additionally, unlike the original ACCORD trial design, this study focused on assessing the renal effects of simvastatin, excluding patients on fenofibrate to avoid potential synergistic or confounding effects. While this approach allows for a more accurate evaluation of simvastatin's impact, it also reduces the sample size and may introduce selection bias. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings.

In conclusion, using statins, particularly simvastatin, in individuals with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular disease, is likely to offer additional renal benefits, especially in reducing clinically relevant renal events such as CKD and renal failure. These findings have important implications given the burden of diabetes and the urgent need for effective therapies to slow the progression of significant renal endpoints.

### Fenofibrate delays the need for dialysis and reduces cardiovascular risk among patients with advanced CKD [^117PQE4c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Fenofibrate provides limited cardiovascular (CV) benefits in the general population; however, little is known about its benefit among advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.

Objective

This study compared outcomes among advanced CKD patients treated with fenofibrate, statins, a combination of both, and none of these.

Methods

This national cohort study was based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients younger than 20 years with advanced CKD were identified and further divided into 4 groups according to treatment. The inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance baseline characteristics. Patients received fenofibrate, statins, a combination of fenofibrate and statins, or none of these in the 3 months preceding the advanced CKD date. Main outcome measures included all-cause mortality, CV death, and incidence of permanent dialysis.

Results

The fenofibrate and statin groups exhibited a lower risk of CV death (fenofibrate vs nonuser: hazard ratio [HR]: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94; statins vs nonuser: HR: 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.97) compared with the nonuser group. The fenofibrate group further exhibited the lowest incidence of permanent dialysis (fenofibrate vs nonuser: subdistribution HR [SHR]: 0.78; 95% CI, 0.77–0.80; statins vs fenofibrate: SHR: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26–1.29; combination vs fenofibrate: SHR: 1.15; 95% CI, 1.13–1.17). Furthermore, the combined administration of fenofibrate and high-intensity statins exhibited a lower risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.

Conclusion

For patients with advanced CKD, continuing fenofibrate may provide a protective effect on CV outcomes equal to that of statins, and it may further delay the need for permanent dialysis. The combination of fenofibrate and high-intensity statins may have additional benefits.

Therapeutic lifestyle changes in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertriglyceridemia — In adults with CKD (including those treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation), we suggest that therapeutic lifestyle changes be advised. (2D). The commentary notes that while the benefits on outcomes are uncertain, the risk for harm with therapeutic lifestyle changes is minimal. For fibrates, a meta-analysis of 2 studies with 9,018 individuals with eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 observed reduced cardiovascular events and cardiovascular disease death but not all-cause mortality with fibrate treatment versus placebo; however, the concurrent use of statins and fibrates raises the risk for rhabdomyolysis, and the combination should not be used in CKD, and Fenofibrate is contraindicated in individuals with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Observational data also associated fibrate use with increased hospitalization and nephrologist consultation within 90 days of initiation, with excess risk magnified for patients with CKD. Research priorities include defining pancreatitis burden due to triglycerides > 1,000 mg/dL in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^112Cfd1z]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

This is a clinical delivery population-based cohort study. A total of 1335 gout patients with fenofibrate treatment identified from the Biobank Information Management System (BIMS; Haier, China) who visited the Gout Clinic at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between September 2016 and June 2020 were screened. Every patient voluntarily provided written informed consent to import their electronic health records into the BIMS, which could be used in further scientific research. The data set contains demographic characteristics, including age, ethnicity, birthplace, height and weight, history of gout, complications and treatment regimes.

All patients were diagnosed according to the 2015 ACR/EULAR gout classification criteria. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: < 18 years of age, receiving fenofibrate therapy < 14 days without further follow-up and long-term use of SCr elevation drugs such as NSAIDs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A total of 983 patients were finally included (Fig. 1). The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (QYFYWZLL 25847).

Flowchart for participant selection

Study design and measurements

Baseline was the time of fenofibrate initiation; follow-up laboratory data were obtained from outpatient visits. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in SCr of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within the first 6 months of fenofibrate administration, according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network guidelines. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measure as suggested by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative clinical practice guidelines. Any hepatic disease was defined as the presence of fatty liver, hepatitis or liver tumours. A positive family history of gout was defined as one or more of the patient's first- or second-degree relatives affected by gout. The eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the trends and predictors for fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity (defined above). Secondary outcomes included medications and comorbidities that predispose to nephrotoxicity and the time course for nephrotoxicity analysed by changes in SCr during the treatment period and the temporal relationship between therapy initiation and an increase in SCr.

### Lessons from PROMINENT and prospects for pemafibrate [^112tafPp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite a well-argued rationale, supported by strong observational, genetic, and mechanistic evidence, PROMINENT was terminated early after full recruitment (n = 10,497) on the advice of an independent data and safety monitoring board for reasons of futility. Despite lowering TGs by 26% (placebo-corrected), treatment with pemafibrate did not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, coronary revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.15), with no apparent effect modification in any prespecified subgroup.

PROMINENT did provide further insights into the safety of pemafibrate. Overall, pemafibrate did not differ significantly from placebo with respect to the incidence of adverse events, including infections and musculoskeletal complications. There was a slight excess in the incidence of investigator-reported adverse renal events with pemafibrate versus placebo (1463 vs. 1347 patients, p = 0.004), with increases in both chronic kidney disease (CKD, 180 vs. 117 patients, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (160 vs. 106 patients, p = 0.001). Pemafibrate treatment was also associated with a small increase in median serum creatinine and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, although both returned to baseline levels similar to that of the placebo group after discontinuation of treatment. Similar findings have been reported with fenofibrate in the ACCORD and FIELD trials, although another study suggested that long-term fenofibrate may delay impairment in renal function in T2DM patients. The underlying mechanisms to explain the differences in impact on kidney function between pemafibrate and fenofibrate, as well as the drug-induced elevation of serum creatinine, are not fully understood.

### Management of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria in patients with diabetes and CKD: a systematic review for a KDOQI clinical practice guideline [^112rzLP5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In 2007, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for treating patients with diabetes and kidney diseases. Given recent studies that may enhance our understanding of the benefits and harms of glycemic, lipid, and albuminuria management in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the NKF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate data on the management of these patients.

Study Design

Systematic review and evidence synthesis.

Setting & Population

Patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes with or without CKD.

Selection Criteria For Studies

English-language publications indexed in the MEDLINE database from January 2003 to October 2010, as well as cited references in these publications and publications identified after consultation with the NKF Diabetes Work Group were screened. Randomized controlled trials providing evidence for the management of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria in individuals with diabetes were included.

Interventions

(1) Intensive glycemic control; (2) lipid management; (3) interventions aimed at prevention of incident albuminuria and/or progression of albuminuria in normotensive patients.

Outcomes

For all interventions, all-cause mortality was the primary outcome and secondary clinical outcomes included death from cardiovascular causes, incident kidney failure, and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Intermediate outcomes included changes in albuminuria and measures of kidney function. For intensive glycemic control only, severe and mild hypoglycemia were secondary and intermediate outcomes, respectively.

Results

5 studies (n = 27,159) assessed the impact of intensive versus conventional glycemic control strategies on clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Intensive glycemic control reduced the development of micro- and macroalbuminuria, but did not reduce the incidence of primary or secondary clinical outcomes and was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in severe hypoglycemia. 11 studies (n = 7,539) assessed lipid management. Statins did not reduce all-cause mortality or stroke compared to placebo in adults with diabetes and CKD. Fenofibrate increased regression of microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria compared to placebo. 3 studies reported inconsistent effects of different angiotensin II receptor blockers on the incidence of microalbuminuria, and one study reported that telmisartan reduced macroalbuminuria in normotensive participants. No study demonstrated a benefit on primary or secondary clinical outcomes.

Limitations

Patients with CKD constituted a subgroup in most studies. Substantial heterogeneity with respect to population, interventions, outcome measures, and duration of follow-up.

Conclusions

Intensive glycemic control and lipid interventions did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although interventions typically improved albuminuria, evidence was insufficient to determine whether treatment of albuminuria in normotensive patients provides beneficial effects on clinical outcomes. More intensive clinical management of patients with diabetes and CKD has inherent risks, including severe hypoglycemia, which should be considered when formulating treatment strategies.

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^117T1sfq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Fenofibric acid is substantially excreted by the kidney as fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking fenofibric acid.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The use of fenofibric acid should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The use of fenofibric acid has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^112N3WJY]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the incidence and potential risk factors for development of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity in gout patients.

Methods

A total of 983 gout patients on fenofibrate treatment who visited the dedicated Gout Clinic at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between September 2016 and June 2020 were retrospectively enrolled from the electronic records system. Fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 0.3mg/dl within 6months of fenofibrate initiation. The change trend of SCr and uric acid levels during the treatment period were assessed by a generalised additive mixed model (GAMM). Multivariate analysis was performed for risk factors affecting elevated SCr.

Results

A total of 100 (10.2%) patients experienced an increase in SCr ≥ 0.3mg/dl within 6months after fenofibrate initiation. The median change of SCr in the whole cohort was 0.11mg/dl [interquartile range (IQR) 0.03–0.20], whereas it was 0.36 (0.33–0.45) in the fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity group. In a multivariable regression model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) [odds ratio (OR) 2.39 (95% CI 1.48, 3.86)] and tophus [OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.39, 3.78)] were identified to be risk predictors, independent of measured covariates, of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity. During the treatment period, although SCr temporarily increased, serum urate and triglyceride concentrations decreased using the interaction analysis of GAMM. Of those with fenofibrate withdrawal records, the SCr increase in 65% of patients was reversed after an average of 49days off the drug.

Conclusions

This observational study implied that fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity occurs frequently in gout patients, especially in patients with tophi or CKD. The potential renal risks of fenofibrate usage in gout needs additional research.

### Effects of high density lipoprotein raising therapies on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with or without renal impairment: the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes study [^116aSfZ2]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The role of high density lipoprotein-raising interventions in addition to statin therapy in patients with diabetes remains controversial. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a strong modifier of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. We therefore investigated the impact of CKD status at baseline on outcomes in patients with diabetes randomized to standard statin or statin plus fenofibrate treatment in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial.

Methods

Among 5,464 participants in the ACCORD lipid trial, 3,554 (65%) were free of CKD at baseline, while 1,910 (35%) had mild to moderate CKD. Differences in CV outcomes during follow-up between CKD and non-CKD subgroups were examined. In addition, the effect of fenofibrate as compared to placebo on CV outcomes was examined for both subgroups.

Results

All CV outcomes were 1.4–3 times higher among patients with CKD as compared to non-CKD patients. In patients with CKD, the addition of fenofibrate had no effect on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. In patients without CKD, however, the addition of fenofibrate was associated with a significant 36% reduction of CV mortality (hazards ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% CI 0.42–0.97; p value for treatment interaction < 0.05) and 44% lower rate of fatal or non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF; HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.37–0.84; p value treatment interaction < 0.03).

Conclusions

For patients with type 2 diabetes at high CV risk but no CKD, fenofibrate therapy added to statin reduced the CV mortality and the rate of fatal and non-fatal CHF.

### Effects of long-term fenofibrate treatment on markers of renal function in type 2 diabetes: the FIELD helsinki substudy [^116545YX]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study showed that fenofibrate reduces several measures of renal function to a greater extent than placebo.

In addition, our study showed that long-term fenofibrate treatment had no effect on albumin excretion rate. This finding is in agreement with the lack of changes in the mean values of AER attributable to fenofibrate in the DAIS. In the FIELD study, the allegedly beneficial renal outcome was based on 2.6% more patients allocated to fenofibrate than placebo regressing or not progressing in a categorized albuminuria variable (P = 0.002). This benefit is rather modest, and the clinical relevance should be evaluated in a long-term outcome study of renal function.

In the placebo group, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 2 and 8 mmHg, respectively, and in the fenofibrate group by 6 and 8 mmHg, respectively. These changes in blood pressure may explain the decrease in AER in both groups. Furthermore, the increased use of renin-angiotensin system blockers in both groups may have had nephroprotective effects beyond arterial blood pressure lowering. It should also be recognized that glycemic control did not worsen during our 5-year study. These variables, together with TGs and LDL cholesterol, were included in the repeated-measures ANOVA and were found not to account for the changes in renal function. Overall, these factors may explain the modest annual reduction of eGFR seen in the placebo group.

The increase in plasma creatinine by fenofibrate is a well-established phenomenon. In contrast, the reduction in renal function has been previously observed as a decrease of para-aminohippurate clearance and an increase of cystatin C in nondiabetic subjects. Since urinary creatinine levels remained unchanged in both studies, there was an obvious reduction in creatinine clearance. The MDRD-4 and Cockroft-Gault estimates express variability and tend to underestimate renal function in subjects with relatively normal renal function. In these patients, creatinine clearance is a more reliable measure of renal function. As cystatin C is considered the best marker of renal function, we used it as a creatinine-independent marker of renal dysfunction during fenofibrate treatment. We observed a 14% increase of cystatin C levels in the fenofibrate group, suggesting impairment of renal function.

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^111ysPAV]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results showed 18.9% of the patients had tophi and 16.7% had nephrolithiasis. Other studies have documented elevated SCr and decreased eGFR in gout patients complicated with tophi or CKD. The increased risk of tophi for nephrotoxicity may result from increased urine urate excretion, which would cause renal overload during ULT in tophaceous gout. Additionally, urate stones deposited in the kidney result in renal interstitial fibrosis and renal tubular atrophy, further leading to renal arteriolar thickening, lumen stenosis and glomerulosclerosis. As the presence of tophi, indicative of chronic refractory gout and renal dysfunction, inhibits both creatinine and urate clearance, it may predispose to the onset of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity by this mechanism.

In this study, 65.6% of gout patients had a decrease in SCr to baseline levels after fenofibrate withdrawal, consistent with other studies. Lee et al. found that SCr was temporarily increased after fenofibrate therapy but resolved after drug withdrawal. In the ACCORD Lipid Trial, after 5 years of continuous on-trial fenofibrate therapy, case subjects had the highest adjusted SCr vs control subjects. After 51 days off the drug, SCr in the fenofibrate therapy group was comparable to that of control subjects. Our and these studies support that fenofibrate‐associated SCr elevation may be a short‐term kidney event, and mainly reversible.

Our data also suggest a stronger effect on lowering urate of fenofibrate combined with febuxostat than with allopurinol or benzbromarone. Yamamoto et al. reported that co-administration of allopurinol with fenofibrate was able to increase oxypurinol (an active allopurinol metabolite) clearance in addition to urate clearance. Fenofibrate and benzbromarone were both supposed to promote renal urate excretion by inhibiting URAT1. However, a more effective urate-lowering function of febuxostat in a Han Chinese cohort has been demonstrated.

A limitation of this study is its retrospective, observational design. Further, although it is useful to explore the incidence of adverse events, we were limited in our ability to evaluate any long-term effects. Moreover, the gout patients in the current study are Han Chinese, which potentially limits the generalizability.

### Fenofibrate and diabetic retinopathy [^115Rs2gv]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Fenofibrate and Other Diabetes Microvascular Complications- Diabetic Nephropathy

Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by early changes in the renal glomeruli, which are critical for the development of glomerulosclerosis. Significant alterations in podocyte function are hypertrophy, loss of intercellular adhesions, and podocyte depletion through apoptosis and autophagy, ultimately leading to microalbuminuria. Other key pathological changes include mesangial cell proliferation/hypertrophy, and increased production of extracellular matrix proteins.

In addition to glomerular damage, the renal tubule is also affected. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a key contributor to the progressive loss of kidney function and is regarded as the final common pathway in diabetic nephropathy. Experimental studies have suggested a potential therapeutic role for fenofibrate in this context. For instance, an animal study using db/db mice demonstrated that fenofibrate treatment (100 mg/kg/day) significantly improved renal function and reduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Similarly, an in vitro assay using human epithelial cells demonstrated that exposure to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of fenofibrate (50 μmol/l) reduced lipid accumulation and apoptosis induced by free fatty acids (Fig. 4).

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^116btuhZ]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics

The placebo and fenofibrate groups were well matched for baseline characteristics (Table 1). The 519 participants with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were older, had a longer duration of diabetes, and had higher systolic blood pressure than the others. A smaller proportion had a history of smoking. They were more likely to have elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios (ACRs), elevated total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and a history of previous CVD events.

Table 1
Clinical and metabolic characteristics of the FIELD Study population at baseline, by eGFR group

Lipid and blood pressure effects of fenofibrate by eGFR

The early (over ~6 weeks) lipid-modifying effects of fenofibrate (increased HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) were independently significant within each category of eGFR, with significantly greater improvement in lipid profile in the lowest eGFR group. However, the differences between eGFR groups in lipid effects were lost over 5 years. In addition, over the 6-week fenofibrate run-in period, there was a small but significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure in patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (5.1 mmHg) compared with those with eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (3.4 mmHg).

Cardiovascular risk by eGFR and fenofibrate treatment

Among placebo-allocated patients, all CVD outcomes (CHD events, coronary revascularization, CVD death, total CVD events, stroke, and total mortality) were more frequent in those with renal impairment compared with those without (Table 2). The number of CVD events in placebo-treated patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was more than double that of those with eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Fig. 1), and CVD and all-cause death were more than six- and fourfold higher, respectively (Table 2, Fig. 1).

Figure 2
HRs (95% CIs) for total CVD events, cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality risk by treatment allocation within different categories of eGFR. ■, relative weights of the outcome event in each group; ⋄, summary HR with 95% CI.

The CVD mortality risk in those with an eGFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 allocated to fenofibrate was significantly reduced by 49% (95% CI 7–72; P = 0.03) compared with placebo, with greater benefit among those with lower eGFR than others (P = 0.03 for interaction) (Table 2). However, this pattern was no longer significant after adjustment for other baseline variables (sex, age, diabetes duration, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA 1c, hemoglobin, urine ACR, previous retinopathy, previous CVD, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blocker use, β-blocker use, and aspirin use).

Plasma creatinine concentrations rose by ~12% soon after commencement of fenofibrate, but there was no loss of CVD benefit among those with the greatest creatinine rise. In fact, the greatest absolute benefit was seen in this group.

Analysis by eGFR group showed a significant inverse association between baseline eGFR and the extent of fenofibrate-associated plasma creatinine rise, with the greatest rises seen in the lowest eGFR group, although the strength of this relationship was weak (r² = 0.03, P < 0.001). The average rise in plasma creatinine in the lowest eGFR group was approximately twice that in the highest eGFR group (17.9 vs. 8.4 μmol/L, P < 0.001 for trend across all three eGFR groups).

Analysis by the presence of different lipid abnormalities (low HDL cholesterol [male subjects < 1.03 mmol/L, female subjects < 1.29 mmol/L], high triglycerides [≥ 1.7 mmol/L], and dyslipidemia [low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides]), older age (≥ 65 years), previous CVD, or sex within each eGFR group did not reveal any statistically significant interactions. Among those with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, those with low HDL cholesterol or marked dyslipidemia (low HDL cholesterol plus triglycerides ≥ 2.3 mmol/L) had independently significant total CVD risk reductions (data not shown).

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^112tS3KU]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the incidence and potential risk factors for development of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity in gout patients.

Methods

A total of 983 gout patients on fenofibrate treatment who visited the dedicated Gout Clinic at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between September 2016 and June 2020 were retrospectively enrolled from the electronic records system. Fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within 6 months of fenofibrate initiation. The change trend of SCr and uric acid levels during the treatment period were assessed by a generalised additive mixed model (GAMM). Multivariate analysis was performed for risk factors affecting elevated SCr.

Results

A total of 100 (10.2%) patients experienced an increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dl within 6 months after fenofibrate initiation. The median change of SCr in the whole cohort was 0.11 mg/dl [interquartile range (IQR) 0.03–0.20], whereas it was 0.36 (0.33–0.45) in the fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity group. In a multivariable regression model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) [odds ratio (OR) 2.39 (95% CI 1.48, 3.86)] and tophus [OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.39, 3.78)] were identified to be risk predictors, independent of measured covariates, of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity. During the treatment period, although SCr temporarily increased, serum urate and triglyceride concentrations decreased using the interaction analysis of GAMM. Of those with fenofibrate withdrawal records, the SCr increase in 65% of patients was reversed after an average of 49 days off the drug.

Conclusions

This observational study implied that fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity occurs frequently in gout patients, especially in patients with tophi or CKD. The potential renal risks of fenofibrate usage in gout needs additional research.

### Fibrate-induced increase in blood urea and creatinine: is gemfibrozil the only innocuous agent? [^115ChhsP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Some reports indicate that fibrates can induce renal dysfunction. However, the clinical characteristics of these episodes, and the respective nephrotoxicity of the four main fibrates used-namely, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and gemfibrozil-remain ill defined.

Methods

To better characterize this side-effect, we first reviewed the charts of 27 patients from our institution who developed an impairment of renal function during fibrate therapy. We next analysed the articles (n = 24) that contained data on renal function in patients taking fibrates (n = 2676).

Results

Among our 27 patients, 25 were on fenofibrate therapy, one was taking bezafibrate, and one ciprofibrate. Nineteen were recipients of solid-organ transplants (kidney recipients, n = 15; heart or heart-lung recipients, n = 4), and eight were non-transplanted patients with some impairment of renal function. Baseline plasma creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 2.9 mg/dl. It increased by a mean of 40% after the start of fibrate therapy. There was a concomitant increase of blood urea values (mean 36%) in most of the patients. Renal function returned to baseline in 18/24 patients after fibrate discontinuation. However, six patients, all transplant recipients, experienced a permanent increase in plasma creatinine. The incidence of fibrate-induced renal dysfunction among our series of kidney transplant recipients was 60%, as it occurred in 15 of the 25 patients who had ever taken fibrates. An increase of mean creatinine values during therapy was described in all papers on fenofibrate (n = 7) and bezafibrate (n = 8) (range 8–18% and 8–40% respectively), and in three of four papers dealing with ciprofibrate (range 6–16%). No significant renal impairment was described in any of the eight articles reporting data on gemfibrozil therapy.

Conclusion

Therapy with fenofibrate, bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate may induce renal dysfunction. Gemfibrozil appears to be devoid of this side-effect.

### Fenofibric acid [^116CHaUi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Increases in Serum Creatinine

Increases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving fenofibrates. These increases tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules at risk for renal insufficiency such as geriatric patients and patients with diabetes. Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.5 Cholelithiasis

Fenofibrate may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found. Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with pre-existing gallbladder disease.

5.6 Increased Bleeding Risk with Coumarin Anticoagulants

Exercise caution when co-administering anticoagulants with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects in prolonging the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). To prevent bleeding complications, monitor the PT/INR frequently and adjust the dosage of the anticoagulant until the PT/INR has stabilized [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.7 Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis has been reported in patients taking fenofibrates. This occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct.

5.8 Hematologic Changes

Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of therapy with fenofibrates. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in individuals treated with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. Periodic monitoring of red and white blood cell counts is recommended during the first 12 months of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules administration.

### Effects of long-term fenofibrate treatment on markers of renal function in type 2 diabetes: the FIELD helsinki substudy [^114ofWfS]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy is associated with a marked increase of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Part of this risk has been explained by concomitant dyslipidemia, which is further aggravated in patients who develop diabetic nephropathy. This in particular is reflected in decreased HDL cholesterol and increased triglyceride (TG) levels. Interestingly, hypertriglyceridemia seems to be associated with the development and the progression of nondiabetic as well as diabetic kidney disease.

Fibrates are peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α agonists, designed to decrease TGs and LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol. Fenofibrate has been shown to reduce the progression of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study and the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS). In these studies, data on albuminuria were analyzed using a change between different albuminuria categories as an indicator of progression or regression. More patients showed regression to a lower level and fewer patients showed progression to a higher level of albuminuria in the fenofibrate group. Such categorical analysis is sensitive to changes in the variance of the data, and thus the results should be interpreted cautiously. In fact, the absolute values of albumin excretion rate (AER) did not change during the DAIS (15.2 vs. 12.7 μg/min, P = not significant [NS]).

Plasma creatinine levels seem to increase with the use of fibrates. The exact mechanism for this increase is not known. In a 2-week study in dyslipidemic subjects (n = 13), there was no effect of fenofibrate on creatinine clearance, explained by an increased urinary excretion of creatinine and, thus, no subsequent change in the creatinine clearance. A recent study, however, reported that the urinary excretion of creatinine remained unchanged even though para-aminohippurate clearance was decreased and cystatin C was increased. Thus, available data are rather confusing and do not address the important question of whether the fenofibrate-induced increase in plasma creatinine is or is not detrimental.

In this prespecified FIELD Helsinki substudy, we used several markers of albuminuria and renal function, including cystatin C, to further elucidate the existing controversy of fenofibrate therapy.

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^112k39G3]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The cystatin C results in the ACCORD Renal Study are consistent with the FIELD Helsinki substudy, which showed that an increase in cystatin C levels accompanied the initial increase in serum creatinine with fenofibrate. The results suggest that the physiological mechanism for the rapid increase in serum creatinine on initiation of fenofibrate therapy (and the reversion on cessation) is not specific for creatinine and rule out increased creatinine production or secretion as a plausible mechanism. However, more work needs to be done to confirm and elaborate these findings.

An unexpected benefit of this design was that it highlighted the differences in changes in serum creatinine and cystatin C in major subgroups of trial participants once these subgroups ceased on-trial therapy. These different responses would typically not have been identified in an on-drug/off-drug study that recruited without regard to the magnitude of the initial serum creatinine increase and analyzed the mean of the single active fenofibrate group, such as in the FIELD Trial. The selection of the case and control subgroups in this study also had its limitations, however. Interpretation of the serum marker trends in these groups during the trial and posttrial is complicated by the effect of single point-in-time selection of the extremes of percent change of serum creatinine and statistical regression to the mean. This study did not analyze the changes in the 28% of patients with intermediate response in percent serum creatinine after 3 months (2–20% change in serum creatinine). Furthermore, the choice of 20% and 2% as thresholds for change in serum creatinine was arbitrary, albeit that they are clinically meaningful levels of change/no change. Finally, participants who had significant worsening of renal function and required discontinuation of study medication are not included in this substudy. Despite these limitations, these results can assist clinical decision making for type 2 diabetic patients with comparable cardiovascular and renal profile according to their percent serum creatinine change in response to initiation of fenofibrate therapy.

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^112T9gwX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our nested case–control study showed a significant association between recent and current fibrate use and a reduced risk of MACE in patients with CKD. However, this association was not observed in patients treated with fibrates in the past. Regarding the class effect of fibrates on the risk of MACE, only the current use of pemafibrate was significantly associated with a reduced risk of MACE. There were no significant associations between the current use of bezafibrate and fenofibrate and the risks of MACE.

A previous meta-analysis showed that fibrate use was associated with lower cardiovascular events in patients with CKD with 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ≤ eGFR < 59.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Our study corroborated this observation and expanded the patient population by including those with an eGFR between 15 and 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2; this suggests that fibrate use may be effective in a broader range of patients with CKD. The mechanism of the beneficial impact of fibrate on MACE incidence may be explained by various effects such as reduced levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol, increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inhibition of albuminuria progression. Interestingly, a significant effect was observed for recent and current fibrate usage but not for past use, suggesting the importance of continuous fibrate therapy for cardioprotective benefits. This observation aligns with those of previous studies that highlighted the transient nature of the lipid-lowering effects of fibrates.

### Effect of fenofibrate on progression of diabetic retinopathy [^111hYDe1]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Fenofibrate therapy led to a trial-averaged reduction in eGFR of 8 mL/min/1.73m 2 compared to placebo. Fenofibrate is known to reversibly increase blood creatinine levels though there is also some evidence that it may offer renal protection. The fall in eGFR is clinically relevant given that the recommended dose of fenofibrate depends on eGFR and because it may complicate interpretation of eGFR results in people with diabetes, a group at elevated risk of developing chronic kidney disease. We observed no benefit on visual acuity, visual function or quality of life. This may reflect the generally mild retinopathy and well preserved vision of trial participants such that the trial was likely underpowered to demonstrate any benefit on these outcomes.

Accumulating evidence suggests that fenofibrate mediates its effect directly within the eye rather than through a reduction in circulating atherogenic lipids. In LENS, absolute reductions in atherogenic lipids were small (similar to ACCORD Lipid). Studies conducted in animal models of diabetic retinopathy have shown that both oral administration and intra-vitreal injection of fenofibrate reduce retinal vascular leakage and retinal inflammation, while a study of human retinal pigment epithelium cells suggests that fenofibric acid may play a protective role on the blood-retina barrier.

### Fenofibrate-induced osmotic nephropathy: a novel mechanism of acute kidney injury [^111jVAHr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Fibrates are a commonly used medication in the management of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. These agents have a well-documented association with reversible elevations in serum creatinine and in some instances acute kidney injury. The mechanism underlying the renal effects of fibrates are currently not well understood. We describe a case of acute kidney injury in a patient who was administered an unadjusted dose of fenofibrate in the setting of severe renal impairment. Kidney biopsy demonstrated extensive isometric vacuolization within tubular epithelial cells consistent with osmotic-type injury. Fenofibrate in this case was the likely causative agent based on the temporal relationship of drug administration and acute kidney injury. The acute kidney injury also recovered over a timeframe consistent with the known half-life of the drug metabolite. There were no other drugs, extreme instances of hyperglycemia, or intravenous (IV) agents administered to account for the biopsy findings. This case demonstrates a potential novel mechanism of fenofibrate-associated acute kidney injury with osmotic nephropathy. We review the current understanding of the effects of fenofibrate on the kidney and possible pathogenesis of osmotic nephropathy.

### Effects of fenofibrate and gemfibrozil on plasma homocysteine [^111zshpP]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Fenofibrate increases plasma homocysteine. Because the concentration of plasma homocysteine depends on renal function, we postulate that increases in plasma homocysteine are a result of the known impairment of renal function caused by fenofibrate. Gemfibrozil, another fibrate, does not affect renal function. In a crossover study we tested whether gemfibrozil would raise homocysteine. 22 patients who had hypertriglyceridaemia were given 900 mg gemfibrozil or 200 mg fenofibrate daily for 6 weeks. Lipids were altered similarly, but homocysteine, creatinine, and cystatin C were raised by fenofibrate but not by gemfibrozil (p for differences between treatment effects: 0.007, 0.006, and 0.040, respectively). We propose gemfibrozil should be the fibrate of choice.

### Residual macrovascular risk in 2013: what have we learned? [^112RTatm]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

An ancillary study of the ACCORD Lipid trial (supported by the R 3 i), which evaluated effects on postprandial lipaemia, provides a possible explanation as to why the benefit of fibrates is specific to patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Compared with the simvastatin monotherapy group, treatment with the combination of fenofibrate plus simvastatin led to significant reductions in postprandial exposure to triglycerides and apoB48, indicating a decrease in the accumulation of atherogenic, intestinally-derived TRL remnants. This effect of fenofibrate was selective to patients with elevated fasting triglycerides at baseline. Added to this, there is also evidence of benefit with fenofibrate on diabetes-related microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.

Despite this favourable profile of macro- and microvascular benefits, the efficacy of the current fibrates may be limited by uncertainties relating to the optimal level of PPARα-agonism, agonist-specific biologic responses, and the side effects of current synthetic agonists. Of relevance for patients already on statin therapy, is the increased risk of muscle-related symptoms with the combination of a statin and certain fibrates, specifically gemfibrozil. This does not appear to be an issue with fenofibrate, probably due to the lack of interference of fenofibrate on statin pharmacokinetics. Indeed, there was no adverse signal for myopathy in the ACCORD Lipid trial. Other commonly reported adverse effects include increases in homocysteine, creatinine and liver enzymes, markers of CVD, renal disease and hepatic dysfunction, respectively. In the ACCORD Lipid study, 48% of statin-treated patients who received the full dose of fenofibrate (160 mg/day) for at least 30 days before the 4-month follow-up showed > 20% increase from baseline in serum creatinine (versus 9% in the placebo group) at this visit. Both the ACCORD Lipid and the FIELD studies subsequently showed that increases in serum creatinine associated with fenofibrate were reversible, with levels returning to those observed in the placebo group about 6–8 weeks after cessation of treatment, and did not appear to detrimentally influence risk for CVD or deterioration in renal function. In the FIELD study, despite increasing creatinine levels, fenofibrate treatment was associated with less renal function decline, as shown by a slower rate of loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate over 5 years compared with placebo. However, in high-risk older patients with impaired renal function receiving multiple treatments likely to affect renal haemodynamics, this may be a relevant consideration.

### Uric acid predicts long-term cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes but does not mediate the benefits of fenofibrate: the FIELD study [^115TQ4Yc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the relationship between baseline uric acid (UA) levels and long-term cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to determine whether the cardioprotective effects of fenofibrate are partly mediated through its UA-lowering effects.

Methods

Data from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial were utilized, comprising 9795 adults with T2D randomly allocated to treatment with fenofibrate or matching placebo. Plasma UA was measured before and after a 6-week, active fenofibrate run-in phase in all participants. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationships between baseline UA, pre-to-post run-in reductions in UA and long-term cardiovascular outcomes.

Results

Mean baseline plasma UA was 0.33mmol/L (SD 0.08). Baseline UA was a significant predictor of long-term cardiovascular events, with every 0.1mmol/L higher UA conferring a 21% increase in event rate (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.29, P < .001). This remained significant after adjustment for treatment allocation, cardiovascular risk factors and renal function. The extent of UA reduction during fenofibrate run-in was also a significant predictor of long-term cardiovascular events, with every 0.1mmol/L greater reduction conferring a 14% lower long-term risk (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76–0.97, P = 0.015). This effect was not modified by treatment allocation (P interaction = .77).

Conclusions

UA is a strong independent predictor of long-term cardiovascular risk in adults with T2D. Although greater reduction in UA on fenofibrate is predictive of lower cardiovascular risk, this does not appear to mediate the cardioprotective effects of fenofibrate.

### Fenofibrate (lipofen) [^111TZt9Q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no available information on the presence of fenofibrate in human milk, effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Fenofibrate is present in the milk of rats, and is therefore likely to be present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, such as disruption of infant lipid metabolism, women should not breastfeed during treatment with LIPOFEN and for 5 days after the final dose

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of LIPOFEN have not been established in pediatric patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia or primary hyperlipidemia.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Assess renal function in geriatric patients and follow contraindications and dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6). While fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age, geriatric patients are more likely to have renal impairment, and fenofibric acid is substantially excreted by the kidney [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Consider monitoring renal function in geriatric patients taking LIPOFEN.

8.6 Renal Impairment

LIPOFEN is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis. Dosage reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with severe renal impairment have 2.7-fold higher exposure of fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared with healthy volunteers. Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The use of LIPOFEN has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. LIPOFEN is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities [Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Fenofibrate improves endothelial function and plasma myeloperoxidase in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an open-label interventional study [^115ZXREr]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Effect of fenofibrate on plasma myeloperoxidase

To our knowledge, no prior human study has examined the effect of fenofibrate on plasma MPO concentration. Given that MPO adversely influences LDL atherogenic properties and HDL functionality, it may be hypothesized that drugs reducing this enzyme level could have certain benefits in reducing the risk for atherosclerotic events.

Experimental and clinical studies provide support for a potential impact of statin therapy on tissue and plasma MPO levels both in animal models and in humans. In clinical studies, statins reduced circulating levels of MPO in patients with congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes and patients with diabetes on dialysis. The study conducted by Ndrepepa et al. demonstrated an association between therapy with beta-blockers on admission and reduced circulating levels of plasma MPO which was independent of cardiovascular risk factors, clinical characteristics and concomitant therapy in a consecutive series of patients with symptomatic CAD.

If our results regarding the beneficial effect of fenofibrate on plasma MPO and on endothelial function will be confirmed in larger populations of patients with T2DM, this drug could become a valuable option for reducing atherosclerotic process in this group of high cardiovascular risk patients as part of an early and comprehensive preventive strategy.

Safety issues

Our results regarding the decline in renal function are concordant with those in the FIELD and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) studies showing that fenofibrate caused an acute, sustained plasma creatinine increase. In a recent FIELD sub study, Davies et al. assessed fenofibrate's renal effects and found no evidence that the initial increase in plasma creatinine levels represented true renal injury, a finding that has important implications for clinical care. Moreover, it seems that despite initial and reversible increase in plasma creatinine levels, fenofibrate may delay albuminuria and GFR impairment in T2DM patients.

Limitations of the study

The main limitations of the present study are the relatively small number of patients included and the short duration of the fenofibrate treatment.

### Effects of fenofibrate therapy on renal function in primary gout patients [^112myNWL]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Independent predictors of increased SCr in gout patients

In the univariate analysis, age, BMI, duration of gout, tophus and hypertension were risk factors for nephrotoxicity (Table 1). The following covariates were introduced in a multivariate regression model: age, BMI, duration of gout, hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, tophus, cardiovascular disease, CKD, nephrolithiasis, any hepatic disease and family history of gout. CKD [odds ratio (OR)2.39 (95% CI 1.48, 3.869)] and tophus [OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.39, 3.78)] were significantly related to increased SCr induced by fenofibrate in the final multivariate regression model (Fig. 2), both of which can be regarded as independent predictors of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity in this cohort of gout patients.

Multivariate regression analysis of risk factors for fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity

CVD: cardiovascular disease.

We next explored the incidence of nephrotoxicity hierarchically in patients with tophus and/or CKD. Patients with tophus or CKD alone were susceptible to nephrotoxicity with incidences of 19.9% and 17.0%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2, available at Rheumatology online). The incidence increased to 31.0% when patients had both tophus and CKD (Supplementary Fig. 2, available at Rheumatology online). In a subgroup analysis based on eGFR (< 60, ≥ 60, < 90, ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2), we found that the lower the eGFR at baseline, the higher the incidence of nephrotoxicity after initiation of fenofibrate: 38.8%, 11.3% and 7.0%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2, available at Rheumatology online).

### Reversibility of fenofibrate therapy-induced renal function impairment in ACCORD type 2 diabetic participants [^112G3cao]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanism for the increase in creatinine is not understood. Potential mechanisms include increased muscular production of creatinine, decreased secretion from renal tubules, and a change in the glomerular filtration through altered hemodynamics. Hottelart et al. postulated that increased serum creatinine levels result from increased creatinine production. The investigators performed a crossover study of 15 patients with renal insufficiency (average creatinine clearance 69 mL/min) that had experienced at least a 10% increase in serum creatinine with fenofibrate therapy. Renal function was assessed following discontinuation of fenofibrate therapy and following rechallenge. Serum creatinine increased with fenofibrate therapy, but indices of both GFR (creatinine clearance, inulin clearance) and renal blood flow (p -aminohippuric acid clearance) were unaffected. A similar, small, cross-over study in healthy individuals found that while creatinine clearance was reduced by fenofibrate, neither GFR as measured by inulin clearance nor the rate of creatinine secretion changed. Similar changes have been seen in some but not all drugs in this class. Fifty-five patients treated with ciprofibrate showed similar results but no significant change was observed in 15 patients taking gemfibrozil. Similar results were observed by Westphal et al. in a cross-over study of 22 men with hypertriglyceridemia and normal renal function randomized to either micronized fenofibrate 200 mg/day or gemfibrozil 900 mg/day.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Assess renal function in geriatric patients and follow contraindications and dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. While fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age, geriatric patients are more likely to have renal impairment, and fenofibric acid is substantially excreted by the kidney [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider monitoring renal function in geriatric patients taking fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and those receiving dialysis. Dosage reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No difference was seen between controls and placebos (P = 0.9). At the trial close-out visit after a mean trial follow-up period of 5.2 years (range 5.0–5.6 years in the three groups), serum creatinine was still greater in cases than controls or placebos (1.11 ± 0.02 mg/dL versus 1.01 ± 0.02 mg/dL and 0.98 ± 0.01 mg/dL, respectively) although the difference in the means of the three groups decreased.

### Benefits and safety of long-term fenofibrate therapy in people with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment: the FIELD study [^111fjrHU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Study limitations

Our study had limitations. The MDRD Study four-variable formula may underestimate true GFR, particularly when eGFR is ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but is more accurate at lower levels. However, our findings essentially were unchanged if analyzed using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI-CKD) formula for derived GFR. The severity classification of eGFR is somewhat arbitrary, and within-individual variation in eGFR may have incorrectly allocated patients who were close to category cutoffs. However, baseline plasma creatinine and eGFR values in the FIELD Study were averaged over two pretreatment visits, and samples were analyzed at a central laboratory. In addition, the eGFR categories were based on standard clinical groupings to facilitate comparison with other studies. The number of patients in the group with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was low compared with the other two groups, with fewer events. Despite this, there was a general pattern of greater risk reduction secondary to fenofibrate in this group compared with the other two across a wide range of individual and composite end points, although these were not statistically significant except for CVD mortality. Although there was a slight imbalance in the numbers of individuals with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 between treatment groups, this was minor and unlikely to have confounded the effect of fenofibrate on total CVD reduction because it did not differ consistently across groups of renal function. Patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded; therefore, the study cannot address the safety issues for this group, for whom reduced clearance of fenofibrate and its metabolites has been reported. In a previous study, patients with severe renal impairment had a greater unbound fraction of active fenofibrate metabolites than those with normal renal function. This increase is balanced by greater renal clearance, except when creatinine clearance falls below 20 mL/min, at which point the unbound concentration increases accordingly and dose reduction becomes necessary.

### An update on the molecular actions of fenofibrate and its clinical effects on diabetic retinopathy and other microvascular end points in patients with diabetes [^112LRA5d]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Fenofibrate has multiple potential mechanisms of action that may account for its benefit on diabetic microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Effects on lipid characteristics and inhibition of inflammation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress may all provide protection. These mechanisms may similarly protect against microvascular complications in non–type 2 diabetes, but additional trials are required to prove this hypothesis.

Consistent clinical evidence indicates that fenofibrate is protective against the progression of DR and other diabetic microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. The greatest benefit on DR appears to be in those patients with at least minimal NPDR at the time treatment is started. Fenofibrate is well tolerated and does not appear to significantly increase the risk of long-term renal complications, despite modest short-term rises in circulating creatinine. In DR management, fenofibrate could be a useful adjunctive treatment to modifiable risk factor control and regular ophthalmic review. Its incorporation into clinical practice should be continually revised as more information becomes available.

### New fibrate use and acute renal outcomes in elderly adults: a population-based study [^111iG13K]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) have been shown to increase serum creatinine level in randomized trials.

Objective

To assess renal outcomes in elderly adults within 90 days of a new fibrate prescription.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

Ontario, Canada.

Patients

Patients aged 66 years or older with a new outpatient prescription for a fibrate or ezetimibe (comparator drug) between January 2004 and December 2008.

Measurements

Hospitalization for an increase in serum creatinine level (primary outcome) and consultation with a nephrologist, receipt of dialysis for severe acute kidney injury, all-cause mortality, and increases in serum creatinine level (secondary outcomes). All outcomes were assessed within 90 days of a new prescription for ezetimibe or a fibrate.

Results

Compared with ezetimibe users (n = 61,831), fibrate users (n = 19,072) were more likely to be hospitalized for an increase in serum creatinine level (adjusted odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3]) and were more likely to consult a nephrologist (absolute risk difference, 0.15% [CI, 0.01% to 0.29%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.3 [CI, 1.0 to 1.6]). There were no differences between groups in the risk for all-cause mortality or receiving dialysis for severe acute kidney injury. In a subpopulation of 1110 patients (fibrates, n = 220; ezetimibe, n = 890), 9.1% of fibrate users and 0.3% of ezetimibe users had an increase in serum creatinine level of 50% or more (absolute difference, 8.8% [CI, 4.5% to 13.1%]; odds ratio, 29.6 [CI, 8.7 to 100.5]). Risks were greater among fibrate users with chronic kidney disease.

Limitations

Because hospitalizations for an increase in serum creatinine level were underestimated, absolute differences may be misleading. Most patients (91%) were prescribed fenofibrate. Serum creatinine levels were measured as part of routine care and were not available for everyone or at predefined times.

Conclusion

New fibrate use in elderly adults was associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a small 90-day absolute increase in hospitalizations and nephrologist consultations. There was no detectable effect on dialysis for severe acute kidney injury or on mortality. The mechanism and clinical significance of the increase in serum creatinine level with fibrates is unclear.

### Evaluation of the incidence and risk factors for development of fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity [^113bj7Ci]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity has been described in two randomized controlled trials and several observational studies. However, little is known regarding its incidence and the population(s) at risk.

Objective

This study aims to quantify the incidence and identify potential risk factors for development of nephrotoxicity in patients receiving fenofibrate.

Methods

A retrospective, observational study was conducted in the South Texas Veterans Health Care System. Data were collected regarding baseline demographics, concurrent medical conditions, medications, laboratory results, and fenofibrate use.

Results

Within 6 months after initiation of fenofibrate in 428 patients, 115 (27%) experienced an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL. Any renal disease (P = 0.001), chronic kidney disease (P = 0.01), and diabetes (P = 0.02) were significantly more prevalent in patients with fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity. Patients with nephrotoxicity had significantly greater serum creatinine (1.2 [SD 0.3] vs. 1.1 mg/dL [SD 0.3], P = 0.0002) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (72 [SD 20] vs 81 mL/min/1.73 m² [SD 20], P < .0001) at baseline. These patients also had greater use of calcium channel blockers (P = 0.0003), furosemide (P = 0.02), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P = 0.02). The incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly greater in patients initiated on high-dose versus those on low-dose fenofibrate (P = 0.002). In a multivariable regression model, renal disease (P = 0.02), high-dose fenofibrate (P = 0.001), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker use (P = 0.02) were determined to be independent predictors of development of increased serum creatinine on fenofibrate.

Conclusion

This observational study suggests fenofibrate-associated nephrotoxicity occurs more frequently than previously reported, particularly in patients with renal disease and in those receiving high-dose fenofibrate or concomitant calcium channel blockers.

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^116nHzKj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been well described. However, the efficacy of fibrates on the risk of MACE in patients with CKD remains unclear.

Methods

We conducted a nested case-control study using data from a large administrative database that included more than 1.5 million Japanese patients. We defined cases as CKD patients with incidences of MACE and matched them with controls based on age, sex, calendar year of cohort entry and CKD stage. Fibrate exposure timing was categorized as current, recent or past. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between fibrate use and the risk of MACE.

Results

Our study included 47490 patients with CKD, with 15830 MACE identified during a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The numbers of fibrates used during the study period were 556 (3.5%) in the case group and 1109 (3.5%) in the control group. Fibrate use was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACE [odds ratio (OR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75–0.94], particularly for current (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68–0.97) and recent use (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48–0.90). Regarding the class effect of fibrates, pemafibrate use, but not bezafibrate or fenofibrate use, was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACE (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.528–0.997).

Conclusion

Recent and current fibrate use, especially pemafibrate use, was associated with a reduced risk of MACE in patients with CKD. This suggests the potential benefits of continuous fibrate therapy and the possible superiority of pemafibrate over other fibrates. However, further investigations in different populations are required to confirm the generalizability of these findings.

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^112eFrdX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

The high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been well described. However, the efficacy of fibrates on the risk of MACE in patients with CKD remains unclear.

Methods

We conducted a nested case–control study using data from a large administrative database that included more than 1.5 million Japanese patients. We defined cases as CKD patients with incidences of MACE and matched them with controls based on age, sex, calendar year of cohort entry and CKD stage. Fibrate exposure timing was categorized as current, recent or past. A conditional logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between fibrate use and the risk of MACE.

Results

Our study included 47 490 patients with CKD, with 15 830 MACE identified during a median follow-up of 9.4 months. The numbers of fibrates used during the study period were 556 (3.5%) in the case group and 1109 (3.5%) in the control group. Fibrate use was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACE [odds ratio (OR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75–0.94], particularly for current (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68–0.97) and recent use (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48–0.90). Regarding the class effect of fibrates, pemafibrate use, but not bezafibrate or fenofibrate use, was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACE (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.528–0.997).

Conclusion

Recent and current fibrate use, especially pemafibrate use, was associated with a reduced risk of MACE in patients with CKD. This suggests the potential benefits of continuous fibrate therapy and the possible superiority of pemafibrate over other fibrates. However, further investigations in different populations are required to confirm the generalizability of these findings.

### Effects of the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α / γ agonist aleglitazar on renal function in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a phase IIb, randomized study [^116Loy26]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The AleNephro trial evaluated the reversibility of effects of 52 weeks of treatment with aleglitazar as compared with pioglitazone on renal parameters in patients with T2D and moderate renal impairment (stage 3 CKD). As expected for a PPAR-α agonist, aleglitazar was associated with a reduction in eGFR during therapy that was not progressive, plateauing after 8 weeks, and was significantly greater than that of pioglitazone at end of treatment. The principal finding of this study was that the effects of both agents on renal function were reversible, with a decrease in eGFR with aleglitazar that was comparable (non-inferior) to that with pioglitazone by 8 weeks following withdrawal of treatment. Primary endpoint results were consistent using either the MDRD or the Cockcroft–Gault equation for eGFR calculation (data not shown). Furthermore, in patients with stage 3 CKD, MDRD provides an approximately equivalent estimation of eGFR compared with the CKD-Epi equation. In addition to meeting the primary endpoint, AleNephro showed that the decrease in eGFR observed with aleglitazar during the treatment period reversed during follow-up in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Hence, even in this high-risk group, aleglitazar did not adversely affect renal safety, similar to pioglitazone and fenofibrate. These reversible changes in eGFR and SCr are consistent with previous observations from SESTA-R and confirm data from the AleCardio trial, which investigated the effect of aleglitazar on cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndrome.

Although the mechanism of aleglitazar's effect on eGFR and SCr is unclear, the reversibility of the effect resembles that of PPAR-α class of compounds, the fibrates, and inhibitors of the RAAS system, on these renal function markers, which paradoxically leads to renoprotection rather than acute kidney toxicity. For example, in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, the increase in SCr during fenofibrate therapy returned to baseline following treatment cessation and was accompanied by significantly less decline in renal function (as measured by eGFR) compared with placebo. A meta-analysis comparing the effects of ACEi/ARB with other antihypertensives demonstrated a consistent renoprotective effect of ACEi/ARB over other antihypertensive drugs (and placebo) in patients with T2D, independent of blood-pressure-lowering effects.

### Effect of fenofibrate on progression of diabetic retinopathy [^1129s5zu]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population of people with diabetes and early retinopathy, fenofibrate led to a 27% lower risk of progression of, or treatment for, diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy compared with placebo over 4 years. Treatment with fenofibrate appeared similarly effective in participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and those with normal and or somewhat impaired kidney function.

The proportional effect of fenofibrate on the progression of retinopathy or maculopathy observed in LENS is quantitatively similar to that seen in subsidiary analyses from major cardiovascular trials. In the FIELD trial, the tertiary outcome of retinal laser therapy was proportionally reduced by 31% (164 [3.4%] events in 4895 participants allocated fenofibrate vs. 238 [4.9%] events in 4900 participants allocated placebo) over five years, and pooled data from three trials showed a 23% reduction in retinal laser compared to placebo. A FIELD imaging sub-study showed a 34% proportional reduction in a post-hoc composite outcome of two-step Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Severity Scale retinopathy progression, new macular edema or retinal laser (53 [11.1%] events in 512 participants vs. 75 [16.1%] events in 500 participants on placebo). In addition, the ACCORD Eye sub-study yielded a 40% proportional reduction in the composite outcome of three-step ETDRS retinopathy progression, retinal laser or vitrectomy (52 [6.5%] events in 806 participants vs. 80 [10.2%] events in 787 participants on placebo) over four years.

Fenofibrate plus statin — safety, regulatory status, and recommendation: Safety data found no increase in any adverse event endpoint including a creatine kinase at least five times the upper limit of normal, but significant increases were observed in liver function test transaminases at least three times the upper limit of normal and a renal safety endpoint of creatinine increase of ≥ 50%; an observational study of 1,538 primary prevention patients noted no significant differences in cognitive test results between fenofibrate and a statin versus a statin alone; combination therapy entails a higher pill burden with associated decrements in adherence and additional cost for those with co-pays, and based on this data the FDA removed the approval of combinations of statins with fenofibrate in 2016; given the lack of benefit in both primary and secondary prevention and the potential for harm including a possible increase in cardiovascular events in women, the Work Group decided upon a "Weak against" recommendation.

### The 2021–2022 position of Brazilian diabetes society on diabetic kidney disease (DKD) management: an evidence-based guideline to clinical practice. screening and treatment of hyperglycemia, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the patient with DKD [^111J3BRF]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

In the CARDS study, in 970 patients with eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, there was a 42% reduction in major cardiovascular events in the group using 10 mg atorvastatin and a 61% reduction in ischemic stroke, like that observed in the analysis all study patients (37% reduction in cardiovascular events (p = 0.4 interaction).

Statins have a modest effect on albuminuria and the rate of fall in GFR and appear not to affect the rate of hard renal events and progression to renal failure, as suggested in a meta-analysis with more than 143,000 participants.

The National Kidney Foundation recommends the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with pre-dialysis DM.

In the SHARP study (Study of Heart and Renal Protection), the combination of simvastatin with ezetimibe did not reduce the risk of primary outcomes in dialysis patients. These data indicate that, despite the significant reduction observed in LDL-cholesterol values, the use of statin should occur before the major loss of renal function. It is also not recommended to start statins in dialysis with the aim of primary prevention of cardiovascular events due to loss of efficacy. On the other hand, there is no data to recommend discontinuation of statins when they are already in use before starting dialysis, and, in this situation, their maintenance is suggested.

In the case of post-renal transplant patients, in the ALERT study, the use of statins was associated with a lower risk of cardiac death, infarction, and cardiac interventional procedures. Based on these results, the use of statins in patients with T2DM after kidney transplantation is also recommended.

The use of fibrates may be associated with a slight decrease in eGFR (a transitory effect that is reversed with the discontinuation of the drug), which is not secondary to kidney damage. Regarding the effect on albuminuria, fibrates offer little benefit in patients with DKD. Therefore, fibrates should only be used in the case of very high triglycerides (> 880 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis. The need to adjust doses according to renal function is highlighted.

The risk of developing myopathy increases with loss of kidney function and in combination with statins, especially gemfibrozil. The use of fenofibrate should be avoided if GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### Fenofibric acid (Fibricor) [^114hB5MN]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.3	Liver Function

Fenofibrate (administered over a range of doses with the higher dose equivalent to 105 mg fenofibric acid) has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)].

In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal of ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo.

When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related. In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg to 105 mg FIBRICOR per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg or less FIBRICOR per day, or placebo.

Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with chronic active hepatitis.

Baseline and regular, periodic monitoring of liver function, including ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with FIBRICOR, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.

5.4	Serum Creatinine

Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, such as the elderly and patients with diabetes.

5.5	Cholelithiasis

FIBRICOR, like fenofibrate, clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. FIBRICOR therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.

### Management of dyslipidemias in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113WUzHL]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the mortality rate in stage 5 CKD is even higher in patients with diabetes. CVD risk reduction includes control of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and BP. An LDL cholesterol goal of 70 mg/dl has been suggested for such high-risk patients. Most studies that have showed CVD risk reduction with statins have been in patients without CKD. However, some studies have had sufficient numbers of patients with CKD stages 2 to 3 to permit analysis, and these generally have shown CVD benefits similar to those found in patients without CKD. Studies that have shown benefit in patients who were on dialysis or after transplantation have been mixed, in part because CVD in such patients is far advanced and may not respond as well to intervention. As GFR falls, the dosages of many of the drugs that are used for the treatment of dyslipidemias need to be modified. In general, however, atorvastatin and fluvastatin dosages do not have to be modified. Drug interactions with cyclosporine also occur. In general, combinations of statins and fibrates should be avoided, and fenofibrate should be avoided in all patients with decreased GFR levels. Overall, on the basis of the very high risk for CVD in patients with diabetes and CKD, aggressive management of dyslipidemias is warranted, with an LDL goal of 70 mg/dl.

### Benefits of icosapent ethyl across the range of kidney function in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes: REDUCE-IT RENAL [^116DBEwv]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Tolerability and safety remained consistent within the entire study cohort. Adverse events occurred at similar rates with icosapent ethyl and placebo but more frequently among patients with lower eGFR. A safety profile similar to the full cohort was observed for icosapent ethyl compared with placebo across eGFR subgroups, including an increase in total bleeding events without an increase in serious central nervous system or gastrointestinal bleeding, and an increase in the rates of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Overall, bleeding rates were higher with decreasing eGFR, but the relative risks for all and serious bleeding were similar across eGFR categories, with no significant interaction observed. Atrial fibrillation/flutter event rates were higher in the lowest eGFR group, although absolute and relative risk differences were similar to those observed in other eGFR subgroups with no significant interaction observed.

CKD is strongly associated with dyslipidemia, and CVD remains the leading cause of mortality among patients with CKD. Commonly used cardiovascular medications that treat dyslipidemia may be ineffective among patients with severe CKD. The benefit of statin-based therapy decreases as eGFR declines. Limited data exist on the clinical benefit of nonstatin medications, such as niacin, among patients with CKD. Both gemfibrozil and fenofibrate are renally cleared so they either require dose reduction or should be avoided depending on the severity of CKD. The dyslipidemia of CKD is characterized primarily by hypertriglyceridemia and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, therapies targeting triglyceride reduction may modify cardiovascular risk. Three studies have examined the relationship between marine derived n-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes; however, all were performed in patients on hemodialysis and used a less tailored n-3 fatty acid formulation than icosapent ethyl. – Thus, there remains a critical need to test therapies for hypertriglyceridemia and related cardioprotection and ascertain their efficacy and safety among patients across the broad range of kidney disease.

### Fenofibrate-associated reversible acute allograft dysfunction in 3 renal transplant recipients: biopsy evidence of tubular toxicity [^116uTvgw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Renal transplant recipients are susceptible to hyperlipidemia and the development of atherosclerosis as a consequence of the immunosuppressive agents they require, which include corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and sirolimus. Fibric acid derivatives and 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are prescribed commonly to optimize lipid profiles and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in this type of setting. The authors describe 3 cases of reversible acute renal allograft dysfunction in patients treated with fenofibrate. Serum levels of monitored immunosuppressant agents remained therapeutic throughout the time period. Discontinuation of the fenofibrate resulted in the resolution of renal dysfunction. The pathologic changes to the proximal tubules in all 3 biopsy specimens were in keeping with a toxic rather than an ischemic etiology. Although the control of hyperlipidemia is crucial in the transplant patient population, the authors suggest that caution be exercised and serum creatinine levels be closely monitored in patients started on fibrates.

### Effect of fenofibrate on progression of diabetic retinopathy [^117CreBD]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Findings from cardiovascular outcome trials suggest that fenofibrate therapy may reduce the progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Methods

We recruited and followed adults with nonreferable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy using the national Diabetic Eye Screening (DES) program in Scotland. We randomly assigned participants to receive 145-mg fenofibrate tablets or placebo (taken daily or, in those with impaired renal function, on alternate days). The primary outcome was a composite of developing referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy (based on Scotland's DES grading scheme) or treatment (intravitreal injection, retinal laser, vitrectomy) for retinopathy or maculopathy.

Results

A total of 1151 participants were randomly assigned to treatment. During a median of 4.0years, progression to referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy, or treatment thereof, occurred in 131 (22.7%) of 576 participants in the fenofibrate group and 168 (29.2%) of 575 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.006). In the fenofibrate group compared with the placebo group, the frequencies for any progression of retinopathy or maculopathy were 185 (32.1%) vs. 231 (40.2%); hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.90 and for the development of macular edema were 22 (3.8%) vs. 43 (7.5%); hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.84. Seventeen (3.0%) participants assigned fenofibrate and 28 (4.9%) assigned placebo were given treatment for retinopathy (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.06). There was no effect on visual function, quality of life, or visual acuity. Trial-averaged estimated glomerular filtration rate was 7.9 (95% CI, 6.8 to 9.1) ml/min/1.73 m 2 lower in participants in the fenofibrate group compared with the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 208 (36.1%) participants allocated fenofibrate and 204 (35.5%) participants allocated placebo.

Conclusions

Fenofibrate reduced progression of diabetic retinopathy compared with placebo among participants with early retinal changes. (Funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03439345; ISRCTN number, ISRCTN15073006.).

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^113Tq2Rw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The class effect of fibrate on the risk of MACE

As we observed significant associations between current and recent use and the risk of MACE, we investigated the class effect of fibrates on the risk of MACE. The frequency of current no-fibrate use was similar between the two groups. Based on a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis, current pemafibrate use was significantly associated with a decreased risk of MACE (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.528–0.997) compared with non-current use. However, there was no significant association between current bezafibrate and fenofibrate use and the risk of MACE (Table 3).

### Fibrates and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients [^114Xuj83]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Another interesting finding — a significant association of current pemafibrate use, but not bezafibrate and fenofibrate use, with the risk of MACE — suggests a possible intra-class difference of fibrates on MACE. Pemafibrate is a newer-generation fibrate compared with fenofibrate and bezafibrate. Pemafibrate, a more potent and selective activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, may lead to more effective lipid-lowering effects, fewer drug–drug interactions, and fewer side effects compared with older fibrates. Furthermore, the PROMINENT study demonstrated a more pronounced decrease in serum C-reactive protein levels in pemafibrate users. These anti-inflammatory effects may also contribute to a reduction in the risk of MACE. Another advantage of pemafibrate over bezafibrate and fenofibrate is the difference in metabolic pathways. While fenofibrate and bezafibrate are mainly excreted via the kidneys, pemafibrate is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted via bile. This differential metabolism may have influenced the results of our study, which focused on patients with CKD. Pemafibrate was launched in Japan in 2018, but its use remains limited. Therefore, the reported observational studies were mainly trials evaluating blood lipids, and none has investigated their association with MACE. To our knowledge, this is the first observational study of pemafibrate to explore its involvement in the development of MACE. However, because pemafibrate is contraindicated in dialysis patients in Japan, we were unable to examine its impact on the risk of MACE in dialysis patients.
