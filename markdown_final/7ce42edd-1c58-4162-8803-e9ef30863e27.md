## Question

is gabapentin ok for geriatric patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gabapentin is appropriate for geriatric patients and how to use it safely if so. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics in older adults and how renal function changes with age. Then, I should verify the efficacy signals in the elderly from trials and labels. Next, I will examine safety concerns unique to older adults, including falls, delirium, and respiratory depression, especially with opioids. After that, I need to check guideline positions and Beers Criteria. Then, I will outline practical prescribing principles: indication, renal dosing, titration, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider alternatives and deprescribing, and synthesize a bottom-line recommendation with risk stratification by frailty and CKD status [^115PyrF2] [^116eVyYw].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation, because that drives everything in geriatrics. Gabapentin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, and older adults commonly have reduced creatinine clearance, which increases exposure at a given dose; labels consistently advise starting low and adjusting to creatinine clearance, which is exactly the pivot for geriatric dosing [^112DrBh2] [^113hAae8] [^116XCHAZ].

> Wait, let me verify the efficacy signal in older adults before assuming benefit. In postherpetic neuralgia trials, patients aged 75 and older actually had a larger treatment effect, likely reflecting higher exposure from reduced renal clearance; this supports potential efficacy in the elderly when dosed correctly, though I should be cautious not to over-interpret a pharmacokinetic amplification as superior intrinsic efficacy [^112DrBh2] [^113Ve3Sn].

> I need to check safety next, because geriatric harm often outweighs benefit. Common adverse effects like somnolence, dizziness, and ataxia increase with age and can precipitate falls and fractures; large observational data link gabapentinoids to higher hip fracture risk, with the signal amplified in frailty and CKD, so I should screen for these before prescribing [^115X5kGb] [^115PyrF2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about perioperative use. I initially thought gabapentin might reduce postoperative delirium by lowering opioid needs, but wait, a large randomized trial found no reduction in delirium despite modest opioid sparing, and a massive retrospective cohort found increased delirium, antipsychotic use, and pneumonia with perioperative gabapentin in older adults; so I should avoid routine perioperative gabapentin in geriatrics unless the indication is compelling and alternatives are inadequate [^1154Rjme] [^116eVyYw].

> I should confirm respiratory risk, especially with opioids. The FDA warns that gabapentinoids can cause serious breathing difficulties when combined with opioids or in patients with respiratory disease or in the elderly; Beers Criteria also flags concomitant gabapentinoid–opioid use as potentially inappropriate due to severe sedation and overdose risk, so I need to avoid that combination unless carefully transitioning and monitoring [^114FHDnN] [^112cAq66] [^112xRTKB].

> Let me consider renal toxicity and accumulation. In CKD, even standard doses can lead to encephalopathy, falls, and respiratory depression; starting doses above 300 mg/day of gabapentin in older adults with eGFR < 60 mL/min are associated with higher 30‑day risks of encephalopathy, falls, fractures, or respiratory depression, reinforcing the need for strict renal dosing and lower starting doses in this population [^111CBn3z] [^115nwMfi] [^1134SUfn].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. Trauma and surgical guidelines advise caution or avoidance of gabapentinoids in older adults due to sedation and falls, and geriatric perioperative guidance emphasizes that evidence is mixed and that risks may outweigh benefits in many older patients; this supports a conservative, indication‑specific approach rather than routine use [^112U9K5b] [^115TfNrQ] [^115eGAUU].

> I will now examine practical prescribing principles. For geriatric patients, I should confirm a clear neuropathic indication, estimate creatinine clearance with Cockcroft–Gault, and start at the low end of the range, for example 100–300 mg at bedtime, then titrate slowly every 3–7 days based on response and tolerability; I need to ensure renal dose adjustments at CrCl < 60 mL/min and avoid doses above 300 mg/day when CrCl is 15–30 mL/min, with further reduction if < 15 mL/min or on dialysis [^116XCHAZ] [^114GiU4p] [^113GsdvQ] [^111pRPB1].

> But wait, what about drug–drug interactions and polypharmacy. Gabapentin has minimal CYP interactions, yet its CNS depression is additive with opioids, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives; in older adults, I should minimize concurrent psychoactive medications and explicitly avoid gabapentinoid–opioid combinations except during a closely monitored transition, documenting rationale and monitoring plan if I must proceed [^112xRTKB] [^112cAq66].

> I should double-check monitoring and discontinuation plans. I will monitor for gait instability, confusion, somnolence, and edema, and if therapy is no longer indicated or ineffective after a reasonable trial, I will taper gradually over at least one week to mitigate withdrawal symptoms, extending the taper if the patient has been on therapy for months or is sensitive to CNS changes [^116XCHAZ] [^117NTWk8].

> Let me consider alternatives and deprescribing opportunities. Topical agents like lidocaine or capsaicin can reduce systemic exposure and fall risk, and acetaminophen remains first‑line for many pain syndromes in older adults; if gabapentin is already on board without clear benefit, a structured deprescribing conversation can reduce medication burden and adverse events, aligning with broader geriatric safety initiatives [^114DSRrj] [^113R7zMe] [^117W2zHh].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts where gabapentin may still be reasonable. For refractory neuropathic pain or pruritus in older adults with preserved renal function and low fall risk, a cautious trial with slow titration and explicit monitoring can be justified; conversely, in frailty, CKD, or when sedatives are unavoidable, I should prioritize alternatives and avoid gabapentinoids altogether when possible [^113JqW13] [^115nwMfi].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the risk–benefit calculus is individualized. Gabapentin is not inherently contraindicated in geriatrics, but its use should be indication‑specific, renal‑adjusted, and interaction‑aware, with vigilant monitoring for falls, delirium, and respiratory depression; in many older adults, especially those who are frail, have CKD, or require opioids, the harms likely outweigh the benefits, so I should default to avoidance unless there is a compelling neuropathic indication and a safer regimen cannot be arranged [^112DrBh2] [^112cAq66] [^116eVyYw].

Gabapentin can be used in older adults when indicated, but **start low, go slow, and adjust for renal function** to minimize sedation, dizziness, and falls [^112DrBh2] [^112U9K5b]. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid combining with opioids or other CNS depressants, and monitor closely for neuropsychiatric effects and renal function [^114FHDnN] [^112xRTKB]. It is **especially useful for neuropathic pain and postherpetic neuralgia**, but perioperative use increases delirium risk and should be avoided in frail or CKD patients without clear benefit [^116eVyYw] [^115TfNrQ].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older adults

- **Renal excretion**: Gabapentin is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys; age-related renal decline increases exposure and toxicity risk [^112DrBh2] [^113Ve3Sn].

- **Increased sensitivity**: Older adults have higher rates of dizziness, somnolence, and ataxia, increasing fall risk [^112DrBh2] [^1115YXa5].

- **Dose adjustment**: Required based on creatinine clearance; start low and titrate slowly [^116XCHAZ] [^112U9K5b].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Gabapentin is **effective for neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and restless legs syndrome** in older adults [^112DrBh2] [^117WfrLg]. Evidence is limited for chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia; use cautiously and monitor closely [^117W2zHh] [^111kaHJL].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, and peripheral edema are more frequent in older adults [^112DrBh2].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Falls, fractures, delirium, and respiratory depression, especially with opioids or other CNS depressants [^116eVyYw] [^114FHDnN].

- **Renal impairment**: Increased risk of encephalopathy and respiratory depression; dose must be adjusted [^111CBn3z] [^115nwMfi].

---

## Drug interactions

Gabapentin has minimal CYP interactions, but **additive CNS depression occurs with opioids, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives**, increasing overdose risk [^112xRTKB] [^114FHDnN]. Avoid concurrent use with opioids when possible; if unavoidable, monitor closely [^112cAq66].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at low doses and titrate slowly based on response and tolerability [^112DrBh2] [^112U9K5b].

- **Renal function**: Assess and adjust dosing regularly, especially in CKD [^112DrBh2] [^115nwMfi].

- **Avoid risky combinations**: Minimize use with opioids and other CNS depressants [^112xRTKB] [^114FHDnN].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for sedation, dizziness, confusion, and falls [^115nwMfi] [^1115YXa5].

---

## Special considerations

- **Perioperative use**: Associated with increased delirium, antipsychotic use, and pneumonia in older adults; use cautiously [^116eVyYw] [^115eGAUU].

- **Frailty and CKD**: Higher risk of adverse effects; consider alternatives or lower doses [^111CBn3z] [^115PyrF2].

- **Deprescribing**: Regularly reassess need and taper if ineffective or causing harm [^117W2zHh] [^116XCHAZ].

---

## Alternative medications and non-pharmacological interventions

Consider **duloxetine or topical agents (e.g. capsaicin, lidocaine) for neuropathic pain** [^113R7zMe] [^114fRGbh]. Non-pharmacological options include physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acupuncture.

---

Gabapentin is appropriate for older adults when indicated, but **requires careful dosing, monitoring, and avoidance of harmful combinations** to ensure safety and efficacy [^112DrBh2] [^112U9K5b].

8.5 Geriatric Use

The total number of patients treated with GABARONE in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were 75 years of age and older. There was a larger treatment effect in patients 75 years of age and older compared to younger patients who received the same dosage. Since gabapentin is almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, the larger treatment effect observed in patients ≥ 75 years may be a consequence of increased gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age-related decrease in renal function. However, other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse reactions were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.

Clinical studies of GABARONE in epilepsy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment in adult patients with compromised renal function is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric patients with renal insufficiency have not been studied.

Dosage adjustment in patients undergoing hemodialysis is necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Medication management — gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain in older adults — Gabapentin and pregabalin are effective treatments for neuropathic pain, but sedation and dizziness may limit their usefulness in the frail older adult. Because of delayed onset, gradual titration over weeks is recommended to improve tolerability and avoid the risk of oversedation and overdose. Because elimination is entirely through the renal system, dosing will require adjustment in patients with renal impairment.

### Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) [^1169spUi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 515 patients treated with HORIZANT in the 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials for RLS, 11% were 65 to 74 years of age and 1% were 75 years of age and older. Clinical trials of HORIZANT for the treatment of RLS did not include a sufficient number of patients 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger individuals.

In the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of HORIZANT for the management of PHN (n = 276 patients treated with HORIZANT), 37% were 65 to 74 years of age and 13% were 75 years of age and older. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable between the patients aged ≥ 18 to < 65 years and ≥ 65 to < 74 years. No overall differences in the safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Gabapentin is known to be almost exclusively excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, the frequency of dosing may need to be adjusted based on calculated creatinine clearance in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

The dose of HORIZANT should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^112cAq66]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pain management is a critical part of surgical care, and pain control is increasingly evaluated as part of quality measurement efforts. Pain control not only enhances patient satisfaction with care, but also speeds recovery and aids in patients' ability to participate in rehabilitation. In response to the opioid epidemic and with the goal of improving pain control, surgeons have increasingly initiated multimodal pain regimens to treat pain with a goal of reducing opioid use in the postoperative period. This regimen includes a wide range of nonopioid medications, including gabapentinoids. Studies indicate that a single preoperative dose of a gabapentinoid is associated with a decrease in postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours, and some societies began to recommend uptake of multimodal pain regimens, including consideration of gabapentinoids, to decrease pain for patients undergoing surgery. Unfortunately, gabapentinoids increase postoperative sedation, dizziness, and delirium in both the short and long term, and a more recent meta-analysissuggests that perioperative gabapentinoids may not in fact decrease pain as was hoped.

Older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) account for almost half of all patients undergoing surgery each year in the US. In this growing patient population, gabapentinoids are often poorly tolerated because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes associated with aging, comorbidities, and interactions with other medications. In addition, gabapentinoids are listed in the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria, which explicitly detail potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, including strong recommendations to avoid using gabapentinoids with opioids except when transitioning from one to the other, and include a caution to dose renally when necessary. Concomitant use has been shown to increase risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death, except when transitioning from one to the other. Additionally, postoperative prescribing of gabapentin is known to lead to prolonged use, with its own inherent risks of altered mental status and polypharmacy. Nevertheless, older age is one of several risk factors for receiving more opioids and multimodal pain medication in the postoperative period.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115TfNrQ]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant analgesics — gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They "reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels", and "gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn)", yet "limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect". Safety concerns include that "abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported", the directive to "Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD", and that they "produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids". Because "both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated", the page advises to "use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients".

### Running out of breath: the diminishing role of gabapentinoids in epilepsy [^117CT3FX]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

In epilepsy, gabapentin never fulfilled its promise. Over time, studies and clinical experience found it to be less efficacious for seizure control than older and newer competitors. This was emphatically demonstrated in the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) study of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Patients were randomized to one of 5 ASMs; gabapentin performed the worst, primarily because of poor efficacy. The authors concluded that "We see no reasons to prefer gabapentin to the standard drug carbamazepine, except where there might be individual mitigating factors".

With its dreams of dominance lost, gabapentin found a smaller role as a utility player, with its pharmacokinetic and safety profile allowing it to carve out a few niches in epilepsy. Most prominently, it was considered as an alternative for geriatric patients, who have a higher burden of comorbidities and medication interactions. An RCT comparing gabapentin, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine in new-onset epilepsy patients 65 years and older found it to be about as efficacious as lamotrigine in preventing seizures, and less frequently stopped than carbamazepine. This established gabapentin for a time as at least a reasonable alternative to lamotrigine in elderly patients, although clinical experience suggested that its side effect profile was less favorable. It has also maintained use as a (usually distant) alternative adjunctive therapy in pharmacoresistant therapy and as a choice for patients with epilepsy (or possible epilepsy) who also suffer from conditions such as tremor or neuropathic pain that might also respond to gabapentin.

### Perioperative gabapentin use and in-hospital adverse clinical events among older adults after major surgery [^116eVyYw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Gabapentin has been increasingly used as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen to reduce opioid use in perioperative pain management. However, the safety of perioperative gabapentin use among older patients remains uncertain.

Objective

To examine in-hospital adverse clinical events associated with perioperative gabapentin use among older patients undergoing major surgery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database included patients aged 65 years or older who underwent major surgery at US hospitals within 7 days of hospital admission from January 1, 2009, to March 31, 2018, and did not use gabapentin before surgery. Data were analyzed from June 14, 2021, to May 23, 2022.

Exposures

Gabapentin use within 2 days after surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was delirium, identified using diagnosis codes, and secondary outcomes were new antipsychotic use, pneumonia, and in-hospital death between postoperative day 3 and hospital discharge. To reduce confounding, 1:1 propensity score matching was performed. Risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% CIs were estimated.

Results

Among 967 547 patients before propensity score matching (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [7.4] years; 59.6% female), the rate of perioperative gabapentin use was 12.3% (119 087 patients). After propensity score matching, 237 872 (118 936 pairs) gabapentin users and nonusers (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [6.7] years; 62.7% female) were identified. Compared with nonusers, gabapentin users had increased risk of delirium (4040 [3.4%] vs 3148 [2.6%]; RR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23–1.34]; RD, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.75 [0.61–0.89] per 100 persons), new antipsychotic use (944 [0.8%] vs 805 [0.7%]; RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07–1.29]; RD, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.05–0.19] per 100 persons), and pneumonia (1521 [1.3%] vs 1368 [1.2%]; RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03–1.20]; RD, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.04–0.22] per 100 persons), but there was no difference in in-hospital death (362 [0.3%] vs 354 [0.2%]; RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.88–1.18]; RD, 0.00 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.05] per 100 persons). Risk of delirium among gabapentin users was greater in subgroups with high comorbidity burden than in those with low comorbidity burden (combined comorbidity index < 4 vs ≥ 4: RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.13–1.27] vs 1.40 [95% CI, 1.30–1.51]; RD, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28–0.53] vs 2.66 [95% CI, 2.08–3.24] per 100 persons) and chronic kidney disease (absence vs presence: RR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19–1.33] vs 1.38 [95% CI, 1.27–1.49]; RD, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.42–0.69] vs 1.97 [95% CI, 1.49–2.46] per 100 persons).

Conclusion and Relevance

In this cohort study, perioperative gabapentin use was associated with increased risk of delirium, new antipsychotic use, and pneumonia among older patients after major surgery. These results suggest careful risk-benefit assessment before prescribing gabapentin for perioperative pain management.

### Medication use quality and safety in older adults: 2023 update [^115ku6Jo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving the quality of medication use and medication safety are important priorities for healthcare providers who care for older adults. The objective of this article was to identify four exemplary articles with this focus in 2023. We selected high-quality studies that advanced this field of research. The chosen articles cover domains related to deprescribing/discontinuation, optimizing medication use, medication safety/adverse drug events, and other. The first study was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the patient-centered Shed-MEDS deprescribing intervention among older adults transitioning from the hospital to postacute care facilities (domain: deprescribing/discontinuation). The second study, a retrospective cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries, described the phenomenon of a prescribing cascade relic and evaluated continued potassium use after discontinuation of a loop diuretic (domain: optimizing medication use). The third study was a systematic review and meta-analysis describing the prevalence of drug-drug interactions among community-dwelling older adults (domain: other). Lastly, the fourth study was a retrospective cohort study among Medicare beneficiaries that evaluated concurrent gabapentin and opioid use and risk of mortality (domain: medication safety). Collectively, this review succinctly highlights pertinent topics related to promoting safe use of medications and promotes awareness of optimizing older adults' medication regimens.

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^111JtWLW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is postoperative use of gabapentinoids, a medication framed as opioid sparing, increasing, and is gabapentinoid use associated with decreased opioid prescribing among older adults?

Findings

In this serial cross-sectional study of postoperative pain medication prescribing for common surgical procedures in 494 922 Medicare recipients, gabapentinoid prescribing increased over a 5-year period from 2% to 5%. In this same period, opioid prescribing increased from 56% to 59%, as did concomitant prescribing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that postoperative gabapentinoid prescribing for older adults is rising in addition to rather than instead of opioid use, a combination recommended to be avoided in older adults.

### Initiation of pregabalin vs gabapentin and development of heart failure [^1131mUg8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is pregabalin associated with higher incidence of heart failure (HF) compared with gabapentin?

Findings

In this cohort study of 246 237 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 89 years with noncancer chronic pain, pregabalin was associated with a higher incidence of HF compared with gabapentin.

Meaning

The findings suggest that pregabalin should be prescribed with caution in older patients with noncancer chronic pain.

### Nonopioid analgesics for the perioperative geriatric patient: a narrative review [^1177QkTH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute perioperative pain in the geriatric patient can be challenging as the physiologic and pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging may predispose older patients to opioid-related side effects. Furthermore, elderly adults are more susceptible to postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by both poorly controlled postoperative pain and commonly used pain medications. This narrative review summarizes the literature published in the past 10 years for several nonopioid analgesics commonly prescribed to the geriatric patient in the perioperative period. Nonopioid analgesics are broken down as follows: medications prescribed throughout the perioperative period (acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), medications limited to the acute perioperative setting (N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, and local anesthetics), and medications to be used with caution in the geriatric patient population (gabapentinoids and muscle relaxants). Our search identified 1757 citations, but only 33 specifically focused on geriatric analgesia. Of these, only 21 were randomized clinical trials' and 1 was a systematic review. While guidance in tailoring pain regimens that focus on the use of nonopioid medications in the geriatric patient is lacking, we summarize the current literature and highlight that some nonopioid medications may extend benefits to the geriatric patient beyond analgesia.

### American Geriatrics Society abstracted clinical practice guideline for postoperative delirium in older adults [^116k4quU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Medium credibility.

Analgesia optimization to prevent postoperative delirium — Healthcare professionals should optimize postoperative pain control, preferably with nonopioid pain medications, to minimize pain in older adults to prevent delirium (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low). Adequate postoperative analgesia is associated with decreased delirium, and studies have found associations between increases in untreated pain and postoperative delirium; while evidence for prescribing nonopioid alternatives is less compelling, clinical studies of gabapentin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and celecoxib reported reduced incidence with nonopioid pain management. Potential harms include opioid risks such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, sedation, impaired judgment, altered psychomotor function, rash, pruritus, anaphylactic allergic reactions, and dependence, and the need for monitoring for respiratory depression; nonopioid medications also have potential harms.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentinoids, such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are antiepileptic medications that produce analgesia through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. These medications were traditionally used in the management of chronic neuropathic pain. However, some studies suggest that perioperative use of gabapentinoids may reduce acute postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. In addition, perioperative gabapentinoid use may also reduce the risk of developing persistent postsurgical pain although the evidence for this effect remains insufficient. Based on these findings, gabapentinoids have been included as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen in some ERPs. However, other studies have called into question the benefit of gabapentinoid use in the perioperative setting as they are associated with adverse effects, and their analgesic and opioid-sparing effects may in fact be clinically insignificant. In particular, use of gabapentinoids has been linked to sedation, visual disturbances, and dizziness that can hinder early postoperative mobilization and delay recovery. In addition, perioperative gabapentin use has been associated with risk of respiratory depression, especially in older patients and those receiving higher doses of opioids. Overall, the quality of evidence supporting the perioperative use of gabapentinoids remains low, and optimal dosing has not been clearly established. Furthermore, gabapentinoids are currently only available in oral formulations, which may limit their use in the acute postoperative setting. Therefore, while gabapentinoids are a potential opioid-sparing adjunct for management of postoperative pain, the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully considered for each individual patient. In particular, given their side effect profile, gabapentinoids should be used with caution in elderly patients as well as patients with renal dysfunction, which often necessitates dose reduction.

### Gabapentinoids-related delirium adverse events: a real-world study from 2004 to 2022 based on FAERS [^1125dv8C]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because gabapentinoids are so widely used, there are worries regarding safety, particularly in delirium. Our research offered fresh, practical proof of the safety of gabapentinoids for treating delirium. Using the FAERS database reveals that the reporting rates of delirium were higher in the gabapentinoids group than in the non-gabapentinoids group at the delirium levels in model 1,2,3, but no difference in delirium levels between the gabapentin group and the non-gabapentinoid group in the model 4. In elderly and male patients, the incidence of delirium with gabapentinoids was significantly increased. Given the advantages of the gabapentinoids group, the increased ROR does not suggest that doctors should limit the use of gabapentinoids, but rather that they should maintain the necessary level of awareness for any potential side effects.

### Pilot clinical trial of gabapentin to decrease postoperative delirium in older patients [^115QCKMm]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In this randomized pilot clinical trial, the authors tested the hypothesis that using gabapentin as an add-on agent in the treatment of postoperative pain reduces the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Postoperative delirium occurred in 5/12 patients (42%) who received placebo vs 0/9 patients who received gabapentin, p = 0.045. The reduction in delirium appears to be secondary to the opioid-sparing effect of gabapentin.

### Perioperative gabapentin does not reduce postoperative delirium in older surgical patients: a randomized clinical trial [^1154Rjme]. Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain and opioid use are associated with postoperative delirium. We designed a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, double-blinded trial to determine whether perioperative administration of gabapentin reduced postoperative delirium after noncardiac surgery.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 347) or gabapentin 900mg (N = 350) administered preoperatively and for the first 3 postoperative days. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium as measured by the Confusion Assessment Method. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, opioid use, and length of hospital stay.

Results

Data for 697 patients were included, with a mean ± SD age of 72 ± 6 yr. The overall incidence of postoperative delirium in any of the first 3 days was 22.4% (24.0% in the gabapentin and 20.8% in the placebo groups; the difference was 3.20%; 95% CI, 3.22% to 9.72%; P = 0.30). The incidence of delirium did not differ between the two groups when stratified by surgery type, anesthesia type, or preoperative risk status. Gabapentin was shown to be opioid sparing, with lower doses for the intervention group versus the control group. For example, the morphine equivalents for the gabapentin-treated group, median 6.7mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 1.3, 20.0mg), versus control group, median 6.7mg (25th, 75th quartiles: 2.7, 24.8mg), differed on the first postoperative day (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Although postoperative opioid use was reduced, perioperative administration of gabapentin did not result in a reduction of postoperative delirium or hospital length of stay.

Systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials do not support the off-label use of gabapentinoids for pain because the harms often outweigh the benefits. Nonetheless, gabapentinoid prescription rates continue to climb. Deprescribing gabapentinoids represents an opportunity to improve care, particularly among vulnerable older adults. The primary aim of this clinical trial was to increase gabapentinoid deprescribing using a novel approach of direct-to-consumer educational brochures intended to empower older adults to initiate a discussion on gabapentinoid risks and tapering with their clinican.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients
with Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication):

Creatinine clearance (CLCr) is difficult to measure in outpatients. In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault:

The use of gabapentin in patients less than 12 years of age with compromised renal function has not been studied.

2.4 Dosage in Elderly

Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients.

2.5 Administration Information

Administer gabapentin capsules orally with or without food.

Gabapentin capsules should be swallowed whole with water.

If the gabapentin dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).

### Higher-dose gabapentinoids and the risk of adverse events in older adults with CKD: a population-based cohort study [^111CBn3z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Gabapentinoids are opioid substitutes whose elimination by the kidneys is reduced as kidney function declines. To inform their safe prescribing in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), we examined the 30-day risk of serious adverse events according to the prescribed starting dose.

Study Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting & Participants

74,084 older adults (64% women; median age, 79 [interquartile range, 73–85] years) with CKD (defined for this study as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and excluding those receiving dialysis) and a newly prescribed gabapentinoid between 2008 and 2020 in Ontario, Canada.

Exposure

Higher-dose gabapentinoids (gabapentin > 300 mg/d or pregabalin > 75 mg/d) versus lower-dose gabapentinoids (gabapentin ≤ 300 mg/d or pregabalin ≤ 75 mg/d).

Outcomes

The primary composite outcome was the 30-day risk of a hospital visit with encephalopathy, a fall, or a fracture or a hospitalization with respiratory depression.

Analytical Approach

Comparison groups were balanced on indicators of baseline health using inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score analysis that generated a pseudosample for the reference group with a distribution of measured covariates similar to the exposed group. Weighted risk ratios were estimated using modified Poisson regression, and weighted risk differences were estimated using binomial regression. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted by estimated glomerular filtration rate category and type of gabapentinoid.

Results

Among 74,084 patients identified with CKD and a new prescription for gabapentin or pregabalin, 41% started at > 300 or > 75 mg/d, respectively. From this set of patients, a weighted study population with a size of 61,367 was generated. Patients who started at a higher dose had a higher 30-day risk of the primary outcome than patients who started at lower dose. Within the weighted population, the numbers of events for higher versus lower dose were 585 of 30,660 (1.9%) versus 462 of 30,707 (1.5%), respectively. The weighted risk ratio was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.13–1.42), and the weighted risk difference was 0.40% (95% CI, 0.21%-0.60%). In subgroup analyses, neither multiplicative nor additive interactions were statistically significant.

Limitations

Residual confounding.

Conclusions

In this population-based study, starting a gabapentinoid at a higher versus a lower dose was associated with a slightly higher risk of a hospital visit with encephalopathy, a fall, or a fracture or hospitalization with respiratory depression. If verified, these risks should be balanced against the benefits of using a higher-dose gabapentinoid.

### Gabapentin: pharmacology and its use in pain management [^112hZgvh]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Although its exact mode of action is not known, gabapentin appears to have a unique effect on voltage-dependent calcium ion channels at the postsynaptic dorsal horns and may, therefore, interrupt the series of events that possibly leads to the experience of a neuropathic pain sensation. Gabapentin is especially effective at relieving allodynia and hyperalgesia in animal models. It has been shown to be efficacious in numerous small clinical studies and case reports in a wide variety of pain syndromes. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. This evidence, combined with its favourable side-effect profile in various patient groups (including the elderly) and lack of drug interactions, makes it an attractive agent. Therefore, gabapentin should be considered an important drug in the management of neuropathic pain syndromes.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^114DSRrj]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in older adults — first-line and NSAID/opioid cautions: Acetaminophen is considered a first-line analgesic for older adults; however, drug clearance decreases with age, so reduce the maximum daily dose to 2,000 mg for patients over 80 years of age. Reduce doses for patients with an increased risk for hepatotoxicity as well, including those with heavy alcohol use, low body weight, and malnourishment. NSAIDs carry significant risk in the older adult, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding. Use these drugs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period, and avoid them altogether in patients with renal insufficiency, active upper gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet dysfunction, cardiac insufficiency, hyponatremia, hypovolemia, or hepatic impairment. NSAID use is not recommended in patients receiving full anticoagulation, and sustained use may reduce the cardioprotective effects of aspirin. When NSAIDs are used in the older adult, COX-2 selective agents (e.g., celecoxib) or gastroprotection with a proton pump inhibitor or misoprostol is recommended. Use considerable caution with other adjuvant analgesics in older adults. Skeletal muscle relaxants have significant anticholinergic effects and need to be avoided. Gabapentinoids may be effective for neuropathic pain, but sedation and dizziness limit usefulness in this population, and slow titration to lower effective doses is required. Finally, older adults are more susceptible to opioid-induced side effects, including respiratory depression, hypotension, delirium, constipation, and excessive sedation. With advancing age, opioids are associated with a prolonged half-life and prolonged pharmacokinetics.

### Initial treatment of epilepsy: special issues in treating the elderly [^114meVPM]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence of new-onset epilepsy is higher among the elderly, the most rapidly growing segment of the population, than in any other age group. New-onset seizures in elderly patients are typically cryptogenic or symptomatic partial seizures that require long-term treatment. Because seizures in the elderly are often readily controlled, considerations of tolerability and safety, including pharmacokinetics and the potential for drug interactions, may be as important as efficacy in the selection of an antiepileptic drug (AED). The newer AEDs introduced during the past decade offer advantages in this respect over older agents. Phenytoin is the most widely used AED in the United States, but its hepatic metabolism and associated enzyme induction, as well as its nonlinear pharmacokinetics, are particular disadvantages for elderly patients. Because of their potential effects on cognitive function, sedating AEDs such as phenobarbital and primidone have little place in the treatment of new-onset seizures in elderly patients. Carbamazepine also is an enzyme-inducing agent with significant potential for drug interactions. Among the newer AEDs, gabapentin and levetiracetam have good safety and cognitive effect profiles and do not interact with other drugs, and lamotrigine offers many of the same benefits. Oxcarbazepine has better tolerability than carbamazepine, and topiramate and zonisamide, although they have more cognitive side effects than the other new AEDs, can be considered for some elderly patients. Forthcoming data from the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Trial 428, as well as recent guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society, are likely to provide support for the use of selected second-generation AEDs as first-line agents for the treatment of epilepsy in elderly patients.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids — areas for future research in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) emphasize that the thirteen high quality prospective randomized controlled trials demonstrate that pregabalin is effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption after primary TJA; however, there is a lack of evidence regarding the most efficacious and safe dosage, frequency, and duration of treatment, and further research is needed to determine when pregabalin treatment should begin, how much and how often it should be given, and how long patients should take it after primary TJA. While thirteen high quality prospective randomized controlled trials were included, no study directly compared pregabalin to gabapentin and placebo, and in all included studies different multimodal analgesics and anesthetic regimens were utilized limiting the interpretation and generalization of the results; thus, a well-designed, powered, prospective randomized controlled trial with three groups directly comparing gabapentin to pregabalin and placebo should be performed to better understand the differences in efficacy. In addition, high quality studies are necessary to better understand the complications associated with gabapentinoids, such as respiratory depression, particularly when utilized with opioids, and this study should include patients of all ages including the elderly.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Gabapentin is present in human milk following oral administration. Adverse effects on the breastfed infant have not been reported. There are no data on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for GRALISE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from GRALISE or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of GRALISE in the management of
postherpetic neuralgia in patients less than 18 years of age has not been
studied.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The total number of patients treated with GRALISE in controlled clinical trials in patients with postherpetic neuralgia was 359, of which 63% were 65 years of age or older. The types and incidence of adverse events were similar across age groups except for peripheral edema, which tended to increase in incidence with age.

GRALISE is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Reductions in GRALISE dose should be made in patients with age-related compromised renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Because gabapentin is not metabolized, studies have not been
conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.

8.7 Renal Impairment

GRALISE is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. GRALISE should not be administered in patients with CrCL between 15 and 30 or in patients undergoing hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Gabapentin withdrawal syndrome in the presence of a taper [^115LBYhP]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case report of a geriatric patient with a 5-year history of gabapentin use for enhanced bipolar control, who was tapered off of gabapentin over 1 week. The patient displayed unique withdrawal symptoms after the taper of gabapentin.

Methods

The patient is an 81-year-old white female with a life-long history of schizoaffective disorder with bipolar type I tendencies who had been prescribed gabapentin for 5 years.

Results

The patient displayed moderate upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and somatic complaints 1 day after termination of gabapentin. These symptoms gradually worsened until 10 days after, at which time she acutely developed severe mental status changes, severe somatic chest pain, and hypertension. Physical examination, electrolytes, electrocardiogram, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography were all normal. Upon reintroduction of gabapentin, the patient returned to baseline within 1–2 days.

Conclusions

Gabapentin is widely utilized currently for the chronic treatment of recalcitrant migraines, bipolar illness, pain, and epilepsy. It has a wide therapeutic index with few side effects and drug interactions, is not hepatically metabolized, and is excreted by the kidneys. Past reports have suggested that some withdrawal symptoms can present after 1–2 days upon abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin after chronic use within young to middle-aged patients. These symptoms mimic that of alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal purportedly due to a similar mechanism of action. Unique to this case is that this geriatric patient developed debilitating withdrawal symptoms after a gradual, week-long taper of gabapentin along with flu-like symptoms. It is proposed herein that a gabapentin taper should follow a course similar to that of a benzodiazepine taper — slowly and over a period of weeks to months.

If the GABARONE dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).

### Gabapentinoids and risk of hip fracture [^1115YXa5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The exponential increase in gabapentinoid use has been particularly pronounced among older adults, especially after the expansion of the indication to include various painful syndromes (eg, neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia). By 2018, gabapentin was the sixth most dispensed medication by volume in the US, with utilization continuing to increase until 2021. A corresponding 8-fold increase in prescriptions for gabapentinoids in Australia was observed from 2012 to 2018, with 1 in 7 Australians aged 80 and older prescribed a gabapentinoid across this period. Pregabalin remains within the 10 most subsidized medications by volume in Australia in 2023.

Gabapentinoids have been marketed as a safer alternative to opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain. This may be partly responsible for decreasing opioid and increasing gabapentin use in US veterans between 2015 and 2019. However, more evidence is needed regarding gabapentinoids' adverse drug event (ADE) profile in older people. Gabapentinoids are actively transported across the blood-brain barrier and inhibit neurotransmitter release via multiple pathways. This explains why gabapentinoids have efficacy for various central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including seizures and neuropathic pain. It is also why gabapentinoids have CNS ADEs including somnolence, dizziness, gait disturbance, and balance disorder. These adverse events may increase the risk of falls and fractures in older people. Hip fractures are associated with the highest costs to individuals and health systems among all fragility fractures. One in 25 people aged 80 years or older experience a hip fracture each year, with 1 in 4 dying within 12 months. However, there is limited evidence regarding the possible association between gabapentinoids and hip fractures.

Selection of an appropriate medication can be informed by knowledge about patient factors that are associated with an increased risk of ADEs. Frailty and kidney impairment are 2 important considerations when prescribing for older people and may occur together or separately. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a useful clinical parameter for risk stratification. Frailty has also been associated with an increased risk of hip fractures. However, no studies have investigated whether frailer patients dispensed gabapentinoids are at greater risk of hip fractures than less frail patients. Similarly, gabapentinoids are predominately excreted through the kidneys and have a prolonged elimination half-life in patients with kidney impairment. No studies have investigated whether patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of hip fracture associated with gabapentinoids. The objective of our study was to investigate the overall association between gabapentinoids and the risk of hip fractures and the stratified association across age groups, frailty status, and history of CKD.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1111wf4y]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Non‑opioid pharmacologic therapy in chronic pain — scope, harms, and safety alerts — includes nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants including serotonin‑norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclics (TCAs), anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants, and these therapies are associated with risks in older adults, pregnant patients, and those with cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic comorbidities. NSAIDs have been associated with serious gastrointestinal and major coronary events and with about 30% of hospital admissions for preventable adverse drug reactions; CDC guidelines show moderate quality evidence (with small improvement) for NSAIDs in chronic low back pain, and for other pain conditions the guidelines strongly recommend the use of NSAIDs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are frequently prescribed with hopes that they can provide opioid‑sparing effects, but on December 19, 2019, the FDA required new warnings for gabapentinoids about risk of respiratory depression, noting reports of abuse alone and with opioids with serious consequences including respiratory depression and increased risk of opioid overdose death, and increases in non‑serious adverse events have been found with pregabalin and gabapentin (e.g., blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain; dizziness and peripheral edema with pregabalin).

### Gabapentinoids and risk of hip fracture [^115PyrF2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight that gabapentinoids are associated with higher odds of hip fracture in patients who are frail. This substantiates existing evidence that frail people are more susceptible to adverse drug events. Previous studies have shown that frailty score calculators could be successfully integrated into electronic health records to aid clinicians in decision-making at point-of-care. Our findings suggest a potential utility of frailty risk scores as a risk stratification tool and the importance of assessing risks of patients individually before prescribing gabapentinoids.

Our study also reports higher odds of hip fractures in patients with CKD who were dispensed gabapentinoids. In contrast, clinical trials on gabapentinoids have reported no increased risk of hip fractures. A recent systematic review suggested higher risks of adverse drug events (eg, lethargy, drowsiness, dizziness, fall, and fractures) among patients with CKD. However, specific studies on the association between hip fractures and gabapentinoids in CKD are scarce, with mainly 1 large observational study finding an increased risk of hip fracture in patients using high-dose gabapentinoids while receiving hemodialysis. American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria recommend dosage adjustment in patients with moderate and/or severe kidney impairment who are prescribed gabapentinoids. This is because gabapentinoids could accumulate in patients with kidney impairment and cause CNS ADEs. The higher risk we observed may be due to insufficient dosage adjustment or residual risk remaining after dose adjustment of gabapentinoids for patients with CKD; however, we were unable to investigate the modifying effect of doses in our study. Further studies examining the risk of hip fractures associated with different dosages of gabapentinoids among patients with different degrees of kidney impairment or dialysis status are needed.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115nwMfi]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids in CKD — Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) are eliminated solely by the kidneys, and adverse effects and safety signals include dizziness, somnolence, edema, and gait disturbance, with increased falls, fractures and altered mental status among users and highest risk for falls or fractures at doses ≥ 2400 mg/d. Among older patients with eGFR < 60, starting at a higher dose (gabapentin > 300 mg/d or pregabalin > 75 mg/d) was associated with a slightly higher risk (1.9% vs 1.5%) of hospital visit for encephalopathy, fall, fracture or respiratory depression within 30 days; among dialysis patients, gabapentinoids are associated with altered mental status, falls, and fracture, and concomitant use with an opioid was associated with increased risk of death compared to only opioids. Thus, gabapentinoids should be prescribed only when benefits clearly exceed risks, and use of lower doses and avoidance of concurrent administration with opioids or other sedating medications is suggested in patients with CKD or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

### Routine prescribing of gabapentin or pregabalin in supportive and palliative care: what are the comparative performances of the medications in a palliative care population? [^113TrqXB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and distressing problem faced by people with life-limiting illness that is often difficult to palliate. Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed as part of the routine approach to palliating neuropathic pain. Although they are often viewed as interchangeable agents, very little comparative data of their benefits and harms exists in clinical practice. Two previously reported pharmacovigilance studies that had used the same methodology for gabapentin and pregabalin were compared. These studies examined the benefits and harms of gabapentin and pregabalin after the medications had been routinely prescribed by clinicians working in a network of palliative care services using the same data collection tools with the same definitions and the same time points. Data were collected over 21 days from 282 patients prescribed either gabapentin or pregabalin for pain. Items included medication doses, pain scores, and adverse effects. In order to compare the medication responses, the final doses of pregabalin were converted to gabapentin does equivalents using previously published recommendations. The final pain scores were similar for both groups, and the reduction in pain were similar (OR = 11.2; 95% CI 3.9, 32.7, p < 0.001). However, this was achieved at lower doses of gabapentin compared to pregabalin. Those receiving gabapentin were more likely to experience harms (OR = 3.5; 95% CI 1.4, 9.1, p = 0.009) with the reported harms including somnolence, ataxia, nausea, tremor and nystagmus This hypothesis-generating work strongly supports the need for further trials to best delineate clinical differences in the GABA analogues.

### Gabapentin for pain management after major surgery: a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (the GAP study) [^111CGaSy]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Trial Design and Oversight

The GAP Study was a multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of gabapentin as an adjunct to standard multimodal analgesia. Participants, clinical care teams, and research teams were blinded to the treatment allocation. The trial protocol has been published previouslyand was approved by a National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee (Sheffield, United Kingdom), the United Kingdom Health Research Authority, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. It was registered with the ISRCTN (ISRCTN63614165). All participants provided written informed consent.

Patients

Adults aged 18 yr or older undergoing nonemergency cardiac, thoracic, or abdominal surgery were screened. Patients were expected to require a postoperative hospital stay of at least 2 days and be able to swallow during the intervention delivery period. Patients who were already taking antiepileptic medication (including gabapentinoids), who had a known allergy to gabapentin or had renal impairment (an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL·min⁻¹·1.73⁻¹), or who weighed less than 50 kg were excluded.

Trial Procedures

Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to gabapentin or placebo using a secure internet-based randomization system. Randomization was stratified by surgical specialty and site to ensure approximately equal allocation to gabapentin and placebo in each specialty and site. Allocations were permuted blocks of varying sizes, i.e. blocks of four, six, or eight.

The gabapentin group received 600 mg gabapentin preoperatively (as close to surgery as possible) and 600 mg/day (300 mg twice daily) postoperatively for 2 days, once able to swallow (i.e. after extubation). The placebo group were given identical capsules at the same dosing intervals. The dose and timing of the treatment were informed by the findings and recommendations from the most recent systematic review available at the time the study was designed. Dosing windows were classified as 6 h either side of the prescribed time point. Other analgesia prescribed (i.e. the standard multimodal regimen used) was at the discretion of the treating clinician.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^114V3Hzi]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse effects can be a major limiting factor for many therapies. TCAs have anticholinergic adverse effects, and may cause balance problems and cognitive impairment in elderly patients. In addition, the recently published update of the Beers criteria by the American Geriatrics Societyidentified TCAs as a class of drugs to avoid in older adults. Elderly patients treated with opioid analgesics can experience mobility problems, increased risk of hip fracture, and cognitive impairment. Also, given the complexity of opioid management, the American Pain Society and American Academy of Pain Medicine have suggested cautious initiation and titration of opioids in frail older persons or those with comorbidities. Gabapentinoids have a better safety profile than other oral therapeutics, although they can be associated with high incidence of dizziness, swelling, confused thinking, and somnolence.

Other factors, such as titration and treatment regimen, drug interactions, drug efficacy, and modes of administration or application, can also limit the use of several PHN treatment options. Topical agents, especially the lidocaine 5% patch, have a favorable safety profile, but they can be impractical for PHN involving the head and face, can have a burdensome application regimen (ie, capsaicin cream and patch), and can be ineffective as a monotherapy. Gabapentinoids can have complex and burdensome titration schedules often based on three-times-daily dosing. Among new formulations, gastroretentive gabapentin can simplify the patient's daily medication burden, improve patient acceptance and compliance with simpler once-daily dosing, and lower incidence of adverse events compared with other gabapentinoids. Furthermore, both topical lidocaine patches and gabapentinoids are good candidates for combination therapy, due to their low propensity for interactions with other drugs.

5.4 Somnolence/Sedation and
Dizziness

During the controlled epilepsy trials in patients older than 12 years of age receiving doses of gabapentin up to 1,800 mg daily, somnolence, dizziness, and ataxia were reported at a greater rate in patients receiving gabapentin compared to placebo: i.e., 19% in drug versus 9% in placebo for somnolence, 17% in drug versus 7% in placebo for dizziness, and 13% in drug versus 6% in placebo for ataxia. In these trials somnolence, ataxia and fatigue were common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of gabapentin in patients older than 12 years of age, with 1.2%, 0.8% and 0.6% discontinuing for these events, respectively.

During the controlled trials in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, somnolence, and dizziness were reported at a greater rate compared to placebo in patients receiving gabapentin, in dosages up to 3,600 mg per day: i.e., 21% in gabapentin-treated patients versus 5% in placebo-treated patients for somnolence and 28% in gabapentin-treated patients versus 8% in placebo-treated patients for dizziness. Dizziness and somnolence were among the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of gabapentin.

Patients should be carefully observed for signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression, such as somnolence and sedation, when gabapentin is used with other drugs with sedative properties because of potential synergy. In addition, patients who require concomitant treatment with morphine may experience increases in gabapentin concentrations and may require dose adjustment [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^117GnRRr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that new postoperative gabapentinoid prescribing is rising, without a downward trend in the proportion of patients receiving postoperative opioid prescribing. In fact, there may be an increase in postoperative opioid prescribing despite national attention on the opioid crisis. Although we found a downward trend in the OME prescribed per patient, this decrease is small. The use of gabapentinoid as opioid sparing does not appear to spare the proportion of patients receiving postoperative prescriptions for opioids from a surgical procedure, which is concerning for a medication that has its own inherent risks, especially when used concomitantly with opioids. Finally, closer attention needs to be paid to postoperative prescribing for older adults, especially when using multiple types of medications that can have adverse effects and adverse drug events.

### Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) [^111swsNY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Race: In the population pharmacokinetic study, the majority (94%) of subjects in the clinical studies was Caucasian, and no single other race was greater than 4%; therefore, the effect of race could not be studied.

Gender: There are no clinically meaningful differences in pharmacokinetics of HORIZANT between male and female patients.

Geriatric Patients: There are no clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetics of HORIZANT between geriatric patients (≥ 65 years of age) and younger patients (18 to < 65 years of age). However, the pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients may be affected by an age-related decline in renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal Impairment: Gabapentin clearance after dosing with HORIZANT is approximately proportional to CrCl. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) decreased in moderate (4.2 L/hr) and severe renal impairment patients (1.7 L/hr) compared with 6.0 to 9.3 L/hr in patients without renal impairment. Similarly, CLr was decreased to 3 and 1 L/hr in moderate and severe renal impairment patients, respectively, compared with 5 to 7 L/hr in non-renal impairment patients. Dosage reduction in patients with renal dysfunction not on dialysis is necessary.

Gabapentin is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. The mean percentage of gabapentin recovered following hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease was 29% (expressed as a proportion of the gabapentin released from HORIZANT). For patients with PHN on hemodialysis, dosage reduction is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. For patients with RLS on hemodialysis, treatment with HORIZANT is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Drug Interactions

Neither gabapentin enacarbil nor gabapentin are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes. Gabapentin enacarbil is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in vitro.

Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted to examine the potential for an interaction of gabapentin enacarbil with cimetidine and naproxen. No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between HORIZANT and other substrates of organic cation transporter type 2 (OCT2) and monocarboxylate transporter type 1 (MCT-1).

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^114njeoy]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of pregabalin extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data

In studies in which pregabalin (50 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to young rats from early in the postnatal period (Postnatal Day 7) through sexual maturity, neurobehavioral abnormalities (deficits in learning and memory, altered locomotor activity, decreased auditory startle responding and habituation) and reproductive impairment (delayed sexual maturation and decreased fertility in males and females) were observed at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg. The neurobehavioral changes of acoustic startle persisted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and locomotor activity and water maze performance at greater than or equal to 500 mg/kg in animals tested after cessation of dosing and, thus, were considered to represent long-term effects. The low effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive impairment in juvenile rats (50 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately equal to human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 660 mg/day. A no-effect dose was not established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical studies of LYRICA in neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 246 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 73 patients were 75 years of age or older.

In controlled clinical studies of LYRICA in neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, 282 patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 379 patients were 75 years of age or older.

In the pregabalin extended-release tablets neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia study, 422 patients 65 years of age and older received pregabalin.

No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Pregabalin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. See Dosage and Administration (2.5) for recommendations for dosing in patients with renal impairment.

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^115FPc53]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used for neuropathic pain in CKD patients but are not fully understood as this population remains excluded from efficacy and safety trials. Renal adjustments for the gabapentinoids are prodigiously recommended in the literature. However, current guidance is based on pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, but studies confirming efficacy of these dosing strategies are lacking. Considering their widespread use for numerous neuropathic pain conditions, studies evaluating their efficacy at recommended doses in renal impairment should be a priority for future research.

### Patterns of gabapentinoid use among long-term opioid users [^115wLwKt]. Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Understanding the clinical and demographic profile of patients on gabapentinoids can highlight areas of prescribing disparities, inform clinical practice, and guide future research to optimize effectiveness and safety of gabapentinoids for pain management. We used a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries to examine trends, patterns, and patient-level predictors of gabapentinoid use among long-term opioid users.

Methods

Using a national Medicare sample between 2014 and 2020, we examined factors associated with gabapentinoid use among long-term opioid users. We included Medicare eligible long-term opioid users with no prior gabapentinoid use. The primary outcome was gabapentinoid use after the long-term opioid use episode. Logistic regression was used to test the association with gabapentinoid use for year, age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, Medicare entitlement, low-income status, frailty, pain locations, anxiety, depression, opioid use disorder, and opioid morphine milligrams equivalent.

Results

Gabapentinoid use among long-term opioid users increased from 12.6% in 2014 to 16.8% in 2019 (p < .0001). Factors associated with increased gabapentinoid use were Hispanic ethnicity, back pain, nerve pain, and moderate or high opioid usage. Factors associated with decreased gabapentinoid use were older age and Medicare entitlement due to old age.

Conclusions

Variation of gabapentinoid use by socio-demographics and insurance status indicates opportunities to improve pain management and a need for shared therapeutic decision making informed by discussion between pain patients and providers regarding safety and effectiveness of pain therapies. Our findings underscore the need for future research into the comparative effectiveness and safety of gabapentinoids for non-cancer chronic pain in various subpopulations.

Frailty in older adults undergoing colorectal surgery — frail older adults should be managed with enhanced recovery protocols after surgery with modifications, as needed. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. Enhanced recovery protocols for managing patients after colorectal surgery are composed of multiple elements such as patient education, carbohydrate loading preoperatively and early feeding postoperatively, optimal fluid resuscitation, multimodality pain control, and early ambulation, and clinicians prescribing medications in the perioperative period should consider patients' unique medical history and current medications; medications that meet Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate medications for older adults should be used with caution or avoided altogether, and care should be taken when using gabapentin, which can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion in older adults, especially when taken with opioids.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^116JwMQg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Neuropathic medications — conditional recommendation, evidence, and dosing in CP/CPPS: Clinicians may prescribe medications for neuropathic pain including the classes of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in men with CP/CPPS, there was no significant difference at the primary endpoint of a response of 6-point drop in NIH-CPSI total scores (p = 0.07), but secondary outcomes showed improvements on NIH-CPSI subscores with 3.3 (pregabalin) versus 2.2 (placebo) of 21 points for pain (p = 0.04), 1.2 versus 0.6 of 10 points for urinary symptoms (p = 0.01), and 2.1 versus 1.4 of 12 points for QOL (p = 0.02), a higher Global Response Assessment response rate (31.2% versus 18.9%; p = 0.02), and improvement in total McGill Pain Questionnaire score (p = 0.01). This indicates that pregabalin may be effective in some patients; however, it should be noted that improvement of the NIH-CPSI subscores may be statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. There are no trials of gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitors in men with CP/CPPS; of the tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline is typically recommended over amitriptyline in elderly patients as it has fewer side effects and similar efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants are usually started at a low dose, typically 10 mg orally nightly, with doses titrated for effect up to 75 to 100 mg per day as tolerated, and caution is advised in older patients due to the anticholinergic risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. For gabapentin, treatment can be started at 900 mg/day (300 mg/day on day 1, 600 mg/day on day 2, and 900 mg/day on day 3), titrated to 1,800 mg/day for greater efficacy with doses up to 3,600 mg/day in some patients, with an even lower starting dose in younger CP/CPPS patients of 100–300 mg orally at night. Pregabalin is approved at 300 mg/day for post herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, a lower starting dose can be considered given response to 150 mg per day in the NIH trial, and it is approved at 450 mg/day for fibromyalgia; doses for both gabapentin and pregabalin need to be reduced in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min.

### Prolonged use of newly prescribed gabapentin after surgery [^111YhqA2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgeons have made substantial efforts to decrease postoperative opioid prescribing, largely because it can lead to prolonged use. These efforts include adoption of non-opioid pain medication including gabapentin. Like opioids, gabapentin use may be prolonged, increasing the risk of altered mental status and even overdose and death when taken concurrently with opioids. However, little is known about postoperative prolonged use of gabapentin in older adults.

Methods

We merged a 20% sample of Medicare Carrier, MedPAR and Outpatient Files with Part D for 2013–2018. We included patients > 65years old without prior gabapentinoid use who underwent common non-cataract surgical procedures. We defined new postoperative gabapentin as fills for 7days before surgery until 7days after discharge. We excluded patients whose discharge disposition was hospice or death. The primary outcome was prolonged use of gabapentin, defined as a fill > 90days after discharge. To identify risk factors for prolonged use, we constructed logistic regression models, adjusted for procedure and patient characteristics, length of stay, disposition location, and care complexity.

Results

Overall, 17,970 patients (3% of all eligible patients) had a new prescription for gabapentin after surgery. Of these, the mean age was 73years old and 62% were female. The most common procedures were total knee (45%) and total hip (21%) replacements. Prolonged use occurred in 22%. Those with prolonged use were more likely to be women (64% vs. 61%), be non-White (14% vs. 12%), have concurrent prolonged opioid use (44% vs. 18%), and have undergone emergency surgery (8% vs. 4%). On multivariable analysis, being female, having a higher Charlson comorbidity score, having an opioid prescription at discharge and at > 90days and having a higher care complexity were associated with prolonged use of gabapentin.

Conclusions

More than one-fifth of older adults prescribed gabapentin postoperatively filled a prescription > 90days after discharge, especially among patients with more comorbidities and concurrent prolonged opioid use, increasing the risk of adverse drug events and polypharmacy.

### Pain and the use of gabapentinoids in German nursing home residents-results from an analysis based on statutory health insurance data [^1159zEKp]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Marketing Of Gabapentinoids

Goodman and Brett suggest industry's aggressive marketing strategies might contribute to the increased prescribing rates of gabapentinoids. Data to support this notion are usually difficult to obtain but the high proportion of off-label use and the less frequent prescriptions for gabapentin which is available as a generic since 2004 might indicate it indeed could have been a contributing factor. The notion is further supported by reports showing pharmaceutical companies in Germany and the United States are spending considerably on advertisements. Here industry predominantly focuses on prescribing physicians through a variety of promotional strategies. Despite some initiatives to reduce the influence of companies, sponsoring of educational events and experts, for instance, is still common place in Germany and hence increasingly criticized. That non-medical reasons might contribute to the frequent off-label prescribing is also indirectly supported by experts. They recently highlighted that the present evidence is not sufficient to warrant the use of gabapentinoids for off-label indications. Their contention is based on meta-analyses showing a limited effectiveness of gabapentinoids to treat for instance low back and lumbar radicular pain, chronic non-specific backas well as cancer pain.

Adverse Events

Although gabapentin and pregabalin have similar pharmacodynamic properties, their pharmacokinetics are considerably different. The intestinal absorption of gabapentin, for instance, is saturable reducing its bioavailability dose-dependently from 80% at 100 mg to 27% at 1600 mg. Conversely, pregabalin shows a linear intestinal uptake rendering its bioavailability constant at ≥ 90%. Gabapentinoids are widely regarded as safe and well tolerated. This notion is based on their lack of protein binding and no known interference with major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the liver making drug interactions seem unlikely. Nevertheless, dose reductions are recommended in renal impairment as both drugs are eliminated mostly unchanged via renal excretion.

The reputation of gabapentin and pregabalin as usually benign medications might have contributed also to the high prescription prevalence and incidence observed here. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest this reputation might need revision especially in the elderly population. A recent meta-analysis, for instance, found the initiation of pregabalin was associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and problems with coordination. As similar adverse events have also been described for gabapentin, these medications might hence put elderly patients at a considerably higher risk of falls and aggravation of cognitive problems. Recent evidence further indicates gabapentin and pregabalin might increase the possibility for developing atrial fibrillation in the elderly population.

### Analysis of adverse effects of multimodal gabapentin in abdominal wall reconstruction [^112pCoD4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multimodal analgesia, a key component of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols, emphasizes the use of nonopioid analgesics. Preoperative and postoperative gabapentin is often included within multimodal analgesia because it has been shown to reduce postoperative opioid use. However, the role of gabapentin has been questioned because of concerns of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly. In an effort to better understand the specific role of gabapentin within the context of an established enhanced recovery after surgery protocol, the authors studied the prevalence of its adverse effects in patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction.

Methods

Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of 267 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction performed by a single surgeon was conducted. Demographic variables; operative details; postoperative analgesic use; the presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, or altered mental status; hypotension; negative Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores; and postoperative falls were recorded and analyzed according to postoperative gabapentin administration.

Results

Two hundred thirteen patients (80 percent) met inclusion criteria, of which 138 (65 percent) received postoperative gabapentin. Postoperative gabapentin use was not associated with dizziness, lightheadedness, or altered mental status; hypotension; negative Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores; or falls. Furthermore, even among those aged 65 years or older, postoperative gabapentin use was not significantly associated with these adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction, postoperative gabapentin administration was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. Further prospective analysis may better allow the characterization of the adverse effects of perioperative gabapentin.

### Risk of adverse outcomes during gabapentinoid therapy and factors associated with increased risk in UK primary care using the clinical practice research datalink: a cohort study [^113xchSy]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Gabapentin and pregabalin (gabapentinoids) are anticonvulsants drugs that are approved in the United Kingdom and European Union to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and, in the case of pregabalin, generalised anxiety disorder. During the last 2 decades, gabapentinoid prescribing has risen markedly in the United Kingdom and globally. Pain is the commonest reason for prescribing, and there is widespread off-label prescribing for non-neuropathic pain, despite a lack of evidence to support this. In the United Kingdom, it has been estimated that over 50% of gabapentinoid prescriptions were for unlicensed indications. Gabapentinoids were initially considered as safe medicines and nonaddictive, but a growing body of evidence has highlighted their potential to cause harm.

Around 60% of patients experience central nervous system (CNS) depressant side effects with gabapentinoids, including drowsiness, dizziness, and ataxia, which may increase the risk of falls leading to injury and fractures. In addition, gabapentinoids are frequently coprescribed with other CNS depressants including opioids and benzodiazepines, which may potentiate their respiratory depressant effect and further increase the risk of falls, especially in older people. Growing evidence has highlighted the misuse potential of gabapentinoids. An international adverse event database identified almost 12,000 reports of gabapentinoid abuse from 2004 to 2015, with > 75% reported since 2012. There has also been a rise in gabapentinoid-related deaths, with UK deaths involving gabapentinoids increasing from 12 in 2012 to 170 in 2016. Most gabapentinoid-related deaths involve other psychoactive and sedative drugs, with up to 90% also involving opioids. Pregabalin has been reported to have a higher misuse potential than gabapentin, which is thought to be due to its more rapid absorption and faster onset of action.

### Trends in the use of gabapentinoids and opioids in the postoperative period among older adults [^114fzSpk]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The prevalence and especially the acceleration of postoperative gabapentinoid prescribing among older adults is unknown. Similarly, it is uncertain whether this shift to multimodal medications has in fact moved the needle toward its intended outcome: decreased opioid prescribing. Further, the shift toward gabapentinoid use has taken place without attention to concomitant use of opioids, a potentially dangerous combination found to lead to serious adverse events, including overdose and death. Therefore, we sought to describe trends in prescribing of both postoperative gabapentinoids and concomitant opioids over a recent period by examining nationally representative Medicare data for multiple surgical procedures. We further sought to understand prescribing variation by procedure type.

### Gabapentin toxicity in patients with chronic kidney disease: a preventable cause of morbidity [^1134SUfn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is frequently used as an analgesic in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although gabapentin is well known for its favorable pharmacokinetics, it is exclusively eliminated renally, and patients with chronic kidney disease are at risk for toxicity. Existing literature on such risk is lacking.

Methods

We examined the Mayo Clinic Rochester database from 1998 to 2007 in patients with serum gabapentin measurements and known medical outcomes. A total of 729 patients were stratified according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate: group I, 126 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration greater than 90 mL/min/1.72 mm(2); group II, 594 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration less than 90 mL/min/1.72 mm(2) without dialysis; group III, 9 individuals with chronic dialysis.

Results

Patients in groups II and III had higher serum gabapentin levels (8.39 ± 0.32 microL/mL and 58.8 ± 10.22 microL/mL, respectively) than in group I (5.52 ± 0.32 microL/mL, P < .01). Toxicity occurred exclusively in groups II (5.56%) and III (77.8%); toxic manifestations were more severe in group III than in group II. Elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities were overrepresented in those with toxic manifestations. Gabapentin toxicity was suspected initially in only 41.5% of symptomatic cases.

Conclusion

Gabapentin toxicity in patients with chronic kidney disease is underrecognized. Patients with chronic kidney disease often receive inappropriately high gabapentin dosage for their kidney function, occasioning overt toxicity; advanced age and comorbidity predispose these patients for toxicity. Heightened awareness of such preventable risk, amid the chronic kidney disease epidemic, would be cost-effective and improve healthcare quality.

### Clinician perspectives on increased gabapentinoid prescribing in nursing homes [^1179NiMf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Though limited in scope, this study offers insights into increased NH gabapentinoid use, a subject lacking concrete data. Most NH prescriptions are started in other care settings, underscoring that NH prescribing increases are not siloed but rather engrained in global prescribing trends. To curb NH gabapentinoid increases, deprescribing existing prescriptions must be emphasized as much as limiting new NH prescriptions. Moreover, strategies reducing gabapentinoid use in other settings could positively impact downstream NH prescribing.

Deprescribing is complicated by the "sticky" nature of gabapentinoids, often initiated without clearly defined therapeutic goals or discontinuation criteria. Expanding federal mandates for gradual dose reductions to include gabapentinoids might aid in navigating these difficult decisions. Including gabapentinoids under current regulations for long‐stay psychotropics would also discourage their use as substitutes for other medications targeted by reduction measures, promoting accountability.

The preference for gabapentin over pregabalin highlights the influence of payors on prescribing practices. Many clinicians preferred pregabalin, yet financial and coverage constraints limited its application. Similar factors limit non‐drug therapies, which are time‐ and labor‐intensive. These are essential for reducing medication overuse but lack payor support. Until effective non‐pharmacologic solutions become as affordable and accessible as drugs, the over‐reliance on potentially harmful medications — and inequity in such prescribing — will persist.

The stark divergence of NH clinician opinions on gabapentinoid safety and efficacy is striking and could affect efforts to moderate NH increases. This underscores the need for regularly updated, consensus‐driven policy development considerate of different viewpoints and encourages ongoing research into effective, evidence‐based alternatives for managing pain and behavioral symptoms in NH residents.

### Gabapentinoids in total joint arthroplasty: the clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^113yAHhF]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — one study directly compared 75 mg of pregabalin twice a day for 6 weeks to 150 mg of pregabalin twice a day for 6 weeks postoperatively and found no difference in opioid consumption or complications between the two doses except for constipation which was more frequent in the low-dose group. The strength of recommendation is moderate. It is the opinion of the workgroup that gabapentinoids be used cautiously especially when given concurrently with opioids or used in the elderly given pregabalin is associated with increased risk of postoperative sedation, and recent publications by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other surgical subspecialties have highlighted these concerns regarding respiratory depression with concurrent use of opioids and gabapentinoids. A recent database study by Ohnuma et al. also found a dose-dependent association with gabapentinoids and postoperative pulmonary complications after total hip and knee arthroplasty. It is the opinion of the workgroup that pregabalin may cause increased sedative effects in the elderly and should be used with caution in this population, and given the limited high quality evidence evaluating safety and dosage, it is the consensus of this group that when gabapentinoids are utilized after primary TJA, the lowest clinically efficacious dose should be used to minimize the risk of complications.

### Pain and the use of gabapentinoids in German nursing home residents-results from an analysis based on statutory health insurance data [^1153GjTN]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blockade of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels containing α2δ1-subunits to reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release has become an increasingly popular pharmacological principle that is employed for a variety of diseases and conditions. The gabapentinoids, gabapentin and pregabalin, as the currently clinically available compounds in this class of medications are hence being used or have been trialed for management of for instance anxiety and bipolar disorders, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), chronic pruritus, epilepsy, hiccups, hot flashes, refractory cough, restless legs syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, substance abuse disorders, and tinnitus.–They are particularly popular in pain medicine and are therefore employed for the treatment of fibromyalgia, headaches, osteoarthritis, and post-operative as well as peripheral and central neuropathic pain. However, a considerable proportion of these uses are off-label. Off-label uses are uses outside of the approved licenses of the respective drug. They might be problematic because effectiveness and safety are not well supported by evidence. So far gabapentin, for instance, is only approved for the management of partial seizures and neuropathic pain associated either with diabetes (peripheral neuropathy) or herpes zoster infections (postherpetic neuralgia). Pregabalin, which was introduced to the market 10 years after gabapentin, is currently licensed for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain, partial seizures, and generalized anxiety disorders in Europe.

Although generally regarded as being well tolerated, both drugs can nevertheless induce side effects that might considerably interfere with quality of life and patient safety. As psychoactive compounds, their use might be associated with cognitive impairment, drowsiness, and dizziness, particularly in the elderly population. Consequently, they might increase the risk of falls or further aggravate the detrimental neurological effects (drowsiness, sedation, somnolence) of other centrally acting medications such as opioids, antidepressants, or sedatives. These adverse events appear even more important in light of recent publications challenging the clinical value of these compounds.

Because popularity of gabapentinoids is rising and because of evidence that psychotropic drugs are often inappropriately prescribed for elderly patients, monitoring of their correct use and identification of potential problematic developments become increasingly important. This applies especially to nursing home residents as they are regarded as highly vulnerable due to their common multiple health problems, frequent polypharmacy, and their often lacking ability to express their needs.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^113iq8cH]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain medications — gabapentin, carbamazepine, and pregabalin as adjuncts to opioids: We recommend using a neuropathic pain medication with opioids for neuropathic pain management in critically ill adults (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and we suggest using a neuropathic pain medication with opioids for pain management in ICU adults after cardiovascular surgery (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Across two ICU Guillain-Barré syndrome trials and two postcardiac surgery ICU trials, neuropathic agents reduced pain intensity on the 0–10 NRS (MD, –3.44 cm; 95% CI, –3.90 to –2.98; high quality) and decreased opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after initiation (MD, –13.54 mg [morphine equivalent]; 95% CI, –14.57 to –12.5; moderate quality), while postcardiac trials showed similar time to extubation (MD, +0.36 hr; 95% CI, –0.7 to +1.43; low quality) and ICU LOS (MD, –0.04 d; 95% CI, –0.46 to +0.38; low quality) between neuropathic and nonneuropathic groups.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^113R7zMe]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The availability of topical treatments with negligible systemic exposure may have particular advantages in the vulnerable population of older adults. Older patients taking oral, centrally acting treatments for neuropathic pain are at increased risk of systemic AEs as a result of age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes and polypharmacy. As such, a reduced incidence of systemic AEs, and limited drug─drug interactions when taken concomitantly with other pain medications, is a benefit of topical patch treatments in this population. Somnolence and dizziness, common AEs associated with the use of oral pain medications, can be associated with falls, and have been shown to be more common in older (≥ 60 years) than in younger adults receiving pregabalin. Reduction or withdrawal of psychotropic medications is recommended by the World Health Organization as a preventive measure for falls, the second leading global cause of accidental injury-related death. In our analysis, somnolence and dizziness were reported for 0.6% and 3.0%, respectively, of older adults who received the capsaicin patch, and for 1.0% and 4.4%, respectively, of patients who received control/SoC.

Most of the trials included in our analyses were pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating a single treatment of the capsaicin patch, in which the use of concomitant medications was kept stable over the trial duration. However, for one trial comparing multiple treatments with the capsaicin patch with SoC in a pDPN population, the use of concomitant neuropathic pain medication has been evaluated over 52 weeks. Whilst the percentage of patients using antidepressants, antiepileptics, and opioids remained fairly stable in the capsaicin patch 30-minute treatment group (10.9%, 28.2%, and 10.9% of patients at baseline, vs 11.0%, 29.5%, and 11.0% at end of trial, respectively), in the group treated with SoC the use of these medications increased considerably (from 7.7%, 32.3%, and 8.4% at baseline to 15.1%, 43.2%, and 11.6% at end of trial, respectively). Thus, it thus appears that patients treated with the capsaicin patch do not require additional concomitant oral neuropathic pain medication over time. This could be of particular benefit in older patients as polypharmacy and a high medication burden can become overwhelming, especially for those who cannot rely on help to take their medications, sometimes resulting in medication nonadherence and suboptimal management of chronic conditions.

ASIPP opioid guideline — co-administration with other drugs: In non-cancer pain patients on opioids, concomitant medications may cause harm, including "over sedation and drug overdose due to synergistic effect and alteration of drug metabolism". Benzodiazepines with opioids "negatively affect respiration", and in Medicare part D data "from 71,248 patients… during the first 90 days, concurrent benzodiazepine use is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of opioid-related overdose". In "patients who are chronic opioid abusers and on maintenance therapy with buprenorphine and methadone" there was a "high risk of overdose" without tolerance to benzodiazepine respiratory depression. Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) "can potentiate the respiratory depressant effects of opioid including overdose", and in a retrospective study "in 295 patients" their use "increases the risk of opioid related adverse effects"; patients taking opioids who were "65 years or older", female, post–orthopedic surgery, with specified comorbidities, or receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioids were "more likely to require reversal with naloxone".

### Initiation of pregabalin vs gabapentin and development of heart failure [^114jfuk7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 89 years with chronic noncancer pain and no history of HF, new users of pregabalin had higher rates of incident HF hospitalizations or ED visits and outpatient visits compared with new users of gabapentin. Practicing clinicians should undertake a careful assessment of ongoing cardiovascular risk factors and perform adequate risk-benefit counseling for older patients before prescribing pregabalin for chronic pain.

### Gabapentinoids in total joint arthroplasty: the clinical practice guidelines of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, hip society, and knee society [^115sdWnE]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Gabapentinoid dosing in primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — There is no difference in postoperative pain, opioid consumption, or complications between low-dose and high-dose gabapentinoids. However, the use of gabapentinoids may lead to increased risk of confusion among elderly patients and respiratory depression with concurrent use of opioids. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Three high quality studies evaluated the difference in dosing of gabapentinoids and their effects on postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and complications after primary TJA. Two studies evaluated high- and low-doses of gabapentin while one study evaluated high- and low-doses of pregabalin, and both studies that evaluated gabapentin found that there was no difference in pain scores between high- and low-dose gabapentin; one of these studies also evaluated opioid consumption and found there was no difference in opioid consumption between high- and low-dose gabapentin groups.

### Gabapentin (Gralise) [^114kx8RT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing GRALISE must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which products containing active components that are AEDs (such as gabapentin, the active component in GRALISE) are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that GRALISE contains gabapentin which is also used to treat epilepsy and that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.

5.2 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of gabapentin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If GRALISE is discontinued, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week or longer (at the discretion of the prescriber).

### Pharmacovigilance in hospice / palliative care: net effect of gabapentin for neuropathic pain [^116gqGMh]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain is a common concern of patients receiving hospice/palliative care. While it is possible for pain in many people to be well managed with simple analgesics and/or opioids, a proportion of patients experience neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system". Adjuvant analgesics are commonly recommended for the management of neuropathic pain. A wide array of adjuvant drug choices are available from within several main classes: the ones most commonly used are antidepressants and antiepileptics.

Gabapentin was originally approved in 1993 as an antiepileptic for treatment of complex partial seizures. It was developed as an analogue of γ-aminobutyric acid. Its site and mode of action in neuropathic pain are thought to be via modulation of the α and δ calcium channel subunits. Gabapentin is water soluble with a very high volume of distribution and is not metabolised but rather excreted unchanged in the urine at a rate proportional to creatinine clearance, requiring dose reduction in people with renal impairment. Plasma concentrations are proportional to the dose administered at doses up to 1800 mg/day. However, at higher doses, drug absorption becomes saturated, resulting in an effective dose 'ceiling' and adding to variability between patients. Its elimination half-life is 5–9 h.

### Gabapentinoid use and the risk of fractures in patients with inflammatory arthritis: nested case-control study in the clinical practice research datalink aurum [^113yxr1h]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

There are two key potential mechanisms by which gabapentinoids could lead to fractures. The first mechanism is that their central nervous system (CNS) effects (with dizziness, ataxia, and abnormal co-ordination listed as common/very common side-effects of gabapentin and pregabalin) could precipitate falls or other traumatic events that lead to fractures. Two studies identified in our literature review evaluated the relationship between gabapentinoid use and risks of fractures and falls separately, with contrasting findings: George et al. reported an increased risk of fractures (but not falls) with gabapentinoid use, compared to nortriptyline use, in 195,207 older adults, and Muanda et al. reported an increased risk of hospitalisation due to falls (but not fractures) with higher vs. lower dose gabapentin use in 74,084 older adults with CKD. As falls will be infrequently coded in Aurum, we indirectly examined this possibility by evaluating whether fracture risk was greatest in the time nearest to starting gabapentinoids (when CNS side-effects would be expected to be highest). Whilst we only observed an increased risk in shorter use deciles, as these still spanned 3.5 years following starting a gabapentinoid, it would point against a mechanism of action involving acute CNS effects occurring on drug initiation. The second mechanism is that gabapentinoids could detrimentally affect bone health. Some evidence supports this, with Kanda et al. reporting a deterioration of cancellous bone microstructure after 12 weeks in rats receiving gabapentin, which they postulated could effect bone mineral density with long-term use, and a cohort study examining the relationship between antiepileptic drug use and rates of hip bone mineral density loss in 4222 older males (mean follow-up 4.6 years) reporting that gabapentin users (compared with non-users of anti-epileptic drugs) had a 1.4- to 1.8-fold higher adjusted rate of annual bone mineral density loss.

### Perioperative opioid usage: avoiding adverse effects [^112oySkc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Opioids remain the most common analgesic tool for the surgeon, owing to their cost-effectiveness in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Aside from these attributes, opioids have significant side effects that are associated with morbidity and mortality. Specifically, obese patients, patients with sleep apnea, and the elderly may be at an increased risk of experiencing sedation and respiratory depression in response to opioids. Opioid reduction strategies prove useful for decreasing total opioid dose and, in turn, their associated adverse effects. Such strategies may include adjuvant nonopioid analgesics such as α-2 agonists, gabapentinoids, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonists as well as local, regional, or neuraxial anesthesia and modification of surgical technique where possible for operative patients. Patients may also present to surgeons while taking chronic opioids, including high-dose opioids and opioid agonist/antagonists. These clinical scenarios are associated with extreme challenges in postoperative analgesic management. With all opioid prescribing, other sedative medications should be limited or avoided as the risk for additive sedation is significant. This review aims to describe systematic methods to reduce opioid side effects and identify specific risk-reduction strategies within each risk group.

Methods

All participating sites received ethical waivers (as the work falls under quality assurance, quality improvement, performance monitoring and/or clinical audit study type) or approval for low-risk research. The study involved only the collection of routine data by treating clinicians already involved in the care of the patient, using data which are, or should be, routinely collected in order to monitor treatment outcomes, and precautions were taken to ensure non-identifiability of all data entered into the RAPID study (for instance, by the use of age rather than date of birth). Patients' and/or family members' consent was therefore not required for the study.

The study methods have been described in detail previously. An expert committee defined prespecified clinical benefit and harm fields based on the available literature relating to the use of gabapentin for neuropathic pain, selecting time points for benefits and harms according to its profile of action. The National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v4) Likert scales for grading effects were used. Non-identifying demographic and clinical data were entered pro forma using a 128-bit encrypted web portal. Data were recorded on consecutive patients at participating clinical sites.

### Prescribing patterns and off-label use of gabapentinoid agents at dhulikhel hospital, Nepal: a cross-sectional study [^117QhLMn]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There has been a substantial and consistent increase in multinational gabapentinoid consumption over the years where off-label prescriptions accounted for more than half of total prescriptions. Examining gabapentinoid usage patterns is crucial because of their increasing prevalence, particularly concerning off-label and non-medical use, which has been linked to various potential risks. In 2019, the United Kingdom (UK) government reclassified gabapentinoids as scheduled 3 (class C) controlled drugs in the UK because of the high risks and deaths associated with their misuse.

The study revealed that gabapentin was prescribed more often than pregabalin. This preference likely stems from gabapentin's longer history and established reliability in treating neuropathic pain. In contrast, pregabalin, despite being a newer drug, has faced issues with increased dependency and abuse in Nepal, which may have led to its less frequent prescription. Recent studies conducted in the United States have also identified gabapentin as the most commonly used gabapentinoid, possibly because of the classification of pregabalin as a controlled substance nationwide in the United States. However, studies from Oman and Australia reported greater usage of pregabalin, which was attributed to its more favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile.

Gabapentinoids were predominantly prescribed to middle-aged female patients, many of whom had comorbid conditions and insurance coverage. The majority of prescriptions were made in the orthopedics department for pain-related issues. Similar to previous studies, these prescriptions often addressed both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain, including musculoskeletal conditions. This pattern underscores their broad application within clinical practice despite limited formal approval.

Our study found that gabapentin and pregabalin were frequently used off-label across various departments. This practice may be influenced by factors such as the failure or contraindication of first-line medications, their role as adjuvant therapy, their use alongside surgical interventions, the clinical experience of prescribers, patient feedback, and literature-based guidelines. Gabapentinoids are commonly used off-label for orthopedic, neurological, and psychiatric conditions in pediatric, adult, and geriatric populations, highlighting the need for careful consideration in these settings.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114a5HmK]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Neuropathic pain causes substantial morbidity and healthcare utilization. Monotherapy with antidepressants or anticonvulsants often fails to provide relief. Combining different drugs sometimes provides improved analgesia and/or tolerability. More than half of patients receive 2 or more analgesics, and combination trials continue to emerge. This review comprehensively searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for relevant trials. Included studies are double-blind randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of 2 or more drugs vs placebo or at least one monotherapy in adults with neuropathic pain. Outcomes included measures of efficacy and adverse effects. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analyses compared combination to monotherapy wherever 2 or more similar studies were available. Forty studies (4741 participants) were included. Studies were heterogenous with respect to various characteristics, including dose titration methods and administration (ie, simultaneous vs sequential) of the combination. Few combinations involved a nonsedating drug, and several methodological problems were identified. For opioid-antidepressant, opioid-gabapentinoid, and gabapentinoid-antidepressant combinations, meta-analyses failed to demonstrate superiority over both monotherapies. In general, adverse event profiles were not substantially different for combination therapy compared with monotherapy. Despite widespread use and a growing number of trials, convincing evidence has not yet emerged to suggest superiority of any combination over its respective monotherapies. Therefore, implementing combination therapy-as second- or third-line treatment-in situations where monotherapy is insufficient, should involve closely monitored individual dosing trials to confirm safety and overall added benefit. Further research is needed, including trials of combinations involving nonsedating agents, and to identify clinical settings and specific combinations that safely provide added benefit.

### Gabapentin and pregabalin use and association with adverse outcomes among hemodialysis patients [^112VtcV9]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background Gabapentin and pregabalin are used to manage neuropathic pain, pruritus, and restless legs syndrome in patients on hemodialysis. These patients may be especially predisposed to complications related to these agents, which are renally cleared, but data regarding the risk thereof are lacking. Methods From the US Renal Data System, we identified 140,899 Medicare-covered adults receiving hemodialysis with Part D coverage in 2011. Using Cox regression models in which we adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, duration of exposure, number of medications, and use of potentially confounding concomitant medications, we investigated the association between gabapentin and pregabalin, modeled as separate time-varying exposures, and time to first emergency room visit or hospitalization for altered mental status, fall, and fracture. We evaluated risk according to daily dose categories: gabapentin (> 0–100, > 100–200, > 200–300, and > 300 mg) and pregabalin (> 0–100 and > 100 mg). Results In 2011, 19% and 4% of patients received gabapentin and pregabalin, respectively. Sixty-eight percent of gabapentin or pregabalin users had a diagnosis of neuropathic pain, pruritus, or restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin was associated with 50%, 55%, and 38% higher hazards of altered mental status, fall, and fracture, respectively, in the highest dose category, but even lower dosing was associated with a higher hazard of altered mental status (31%-41%) and fall (26%-30%). Pregabalin was associated with up to 51% and 68% higher hazards of altered mental status and fall, respectively. Conclusions Gabapentin and pregabalin should be used judiciously in patients on hemodialysis, and research to identify the most optimal dosing is warranted.

### Retrospective cohort study of the prevalence of off-label gabapentinoid prescriptions in hospitalized medical patients [^111itrT7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Gabapentinoid prescriptions are increasing in North America, with frequent off-label use despite limited proven efficacy. This retrospective cohort study describes prescribing trends among hospitalized patients with a focus on dosing and deprescribing. We examined consecutive inpatients between December 2013 and July 2017 on a 52-bed medical unit in Montréal, Canada. Prevalence of off-label use, median doses prescribed, and deprescribing trends were analyzed over time. Of 4,103 hospitalized patients, 550 (13.4%) were prescribed gabapentinoids preadmission, with two patients being coprescribed gabapentin and pregabalin (total 552 prescriptions). A minority (94/552, or 17%) were for approved indications. Although it was uncommon for gabapentinoids to be newly prescribed in hospital, preadmission gabapentinoids were also seldom deprescribed (65/495 patients discharged alive, or 13%). Given a high prevalence of use, limited efficacy, and potential harms, gabapentinoids may represent an ideal target for re-evaluation of indication and effectiveness in hospitalized adults, with consideration given to deprescribing.

### Neuropathic pain in cancer [^114fRGbh]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer-related neuropathic pain is common; it can be disease related or related to the acute or chronic effects of cancer treatment. For example, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy occurs in 90% of patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. Cancer treatments have become more effective; patients are living longer with cancer and there are more cancer survivors. However, side-effects (particularly neuropathy) have become more problematic. The key to management of cancer-related neuropathy is a considered assessment, remembering not to miss the opportunity of reversing the cause of the pain with appropriate oncological management. An increasing range of oncological therapies are available, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or one of the evolving approaches (e.g. immune therapies). Patients are often elderly and with comorbidities; therefore, all treatment decisions have to be made carefully and reviewed appropriately. Cancer pain is often of mixed aetiology or, if purely neuropathic, may be one of several pains experienced by a patient. For these reasons, opioids are used more frequently in patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain. Standard guidelines for the use of anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin and gabapentin), antidepressants (e.g. duloxetine and tricyclics), and topical treatments (e.g. capsaicin and lidocaine) may be applicable, but there is a lack of good-quality clinical trials in cancer-related neuropathic pain. Choice is dictated not just by age, drug interactions, and comorbidities, but also by the coexistence of many symptoms in patients with cancer. Treating more than one symptom with a particular neuropathic pain agent can avoid polypharmacy.

### Antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs for chronic non-cancer pain [^114PFPkw]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The development of newer classes of antidepressants and second-generation antiepileptic drugs has created unprecedented opportunities for the treatment of chronic pain. These drugs modulate pain transmission by interacting with specific neurotransmitters and ion channels. The actions of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs differ in neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain, and agents within each medication class have varying degrees of efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine) and certain novel antidepressants (i.e., bupropion, venlafaxine, duloxetine) are effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The analgesic effect of these drugs is independent of their antidepressant effect and appears strongest in agents with mixed-receptor or predominantly noradrenergic activity, rather than serotoninergic activity. First-generation antiepileptic drugs (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin) and second-generation antiepileptic drugs (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) are effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The efficacy of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain is comparable; tolerability also is comparable, but safety and side effect profiles differ. Tricyclic antidepressants are the most cost-effective agents, but second-generation antiepileptic drugs are associated with fewer safety concerns in elderly patients. Tricyclic antidepressants have documented (although limited) efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia and chronic low back pain. Recent evidence suggests that duloxetine and pregabalin have modest efficacy in patients with fibromyalgia.

### Algorithm for neuropathic pain treatment: an evidence based proposal [^114n9Cn9]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.

Trends by medication groups included increases in both opioid and gabapentinoid prescribing during the study period. There was an increase in gabapentinoid-only prescribing from 0.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.7%) in 2014 to 1.1% (95% CI 1.0%-1.2%) in 2018 (P < .001), a slight increase in opioid-only prescribing from 53.7% (95% CI, 53.3%-54%) in 2014 to 55.1% (95% CI, 54.7%-55.5%) in 2018 (P < .001), and an increase in concomitant opioid and gabapentinoid prescribing from 1.6% (95% CI, 1.5%-1.7%) in 2014 to 4.1% (95% CI, 4.0%-4.3%) in 2018 (P < .001). During the study period, patients undergoing surgery without a postoperative medication fill for an opioid and/or a gabapentinoid decreased from 43.6% (95% CI, 43.3%-43.9%) to 39.8% (95% CI, 39.4%-40.2%) in 2018 (P < .001).

### Mortality after concurrent treatment with gabapentin and opioids in older adults with spine diagnoses [^114d6Rj7]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Given the negative impact of opioid use on population health, prescriptions for alternative pain-relieving medications, including gabapentin, have increased. We wanted to determine whether people who filled gabapentin and opioid prescriptions concurrently ("gabapentin + opioids") had greater mortality than those who filled an active control medication (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or duloxetine) and opioids concurrently ("TCAs/duloxetine + opioids"). In this population-based, propensity score-matched cohort study, we identified Medicare beneficiaries with spine-related diagnoses from 2017 to 2019. We compared people treated with gabapentin + opioids (n = 67,133) to people treated with TCAs/duloxetine + opioids (n = 67,133) who were matched on demographic and clinical factors. The primary outcome was mortality at any time, and a secondary outcome was occurrence of a major medical complication at any time. Among 134,266 participants (median age 73.4 years; 66.7% female), 2360 died before the end of follow-up. No difference in mortality was observed between groups (adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for gabapentin + opioids 0.98 [0.90–1.06]; P = 0.63). However, people treated with gabapentin + opioids were at slightly increased risk of a major medical complication (1.02 [1.00–1.04]; P = 0.03) compared to those treated with TCAs/duloxetine + opioids. Results were similar in analyses (1) restricted to ≤ 30-day follow-up and (2) that required ≥ 2 fills of each prescription. When treating pain in older adults taking opioids, the addition of gabapentin did not increase mortality risk relative to addition of TCAs or duloxetine.

### Perioperative gabapentin linked to harms for older adults… [^112t1icE]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

For older adults, the use of gabapentin to manage pain after major surgery can lead to adverse events in the hospital. Perioperative gabapentin has increasingly been added to analgesia regimens to reduce opioid use among surgical patients. But a study in JAMA Internal Medicine casts doubt on the drug's benefit for people aged 65 years or older. The cohort study used data from the all-payer Premier Healthcare Database, which covers approximately 25% of annual inpatient admissions in the US. Perioperative gabapentin was used by 12. 3% of 967 547 patients through postsurgery day

### Serious breathing difficulties with gabapentin and pregabalin… [^114FHDnN]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12–19–2019 FDA Drug Safety Communication The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that serious breathing difficulties may occur in patients using gabapentin or pregabalin who have respiratory risk factors. These include the use of opioid pain medicines and other drugs that depress the central nervous system, and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that reduce lung function. The elderly are also at higher risk. Gabapentinoids are FDA-approved to treat a variety of conditions including partial seizures and nerve pain from spinal cord injury, shingles, and diabetes. Other approved uses include fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin was first approved in 1993 and pregabalin was first approved in 2004. Gabapentin is marketed under the brand names Neurontin and Gralise, and also as generics.
- Gabapentinoids include gabapentin and pregabalin.

They are FDA-approved to treat a variety of conditions including partial seizures; pain from damaged nerves that follows spinal cord injury, healing of shingles, or diabetes; fibromyalgia; and moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome.
- Gabapentin is marketed under the brand names Neurontin and Gralise, and as generics. Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin marketed under the brand name Horizant.
- FDA is warning that serious breathing difficulties may occur when gabapentin or pregabalin is taken with other medicines that depress the central nervous system such as opioids, in those patients who have underlying respiratory problems, or in the elderly. There is less evidence supporting the risk of serious breathing difficulties with gabapentinoids alone in otherwise healthy individuals, and we will continue to monitor this population for additional evidence.
- Adjust the dose of both gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with renal impairment and patients undergoing hemodialysis, because both drugs are excreted by the kidneys.
- Monitor for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, especially when co-prescribing gabapentinoids with an opioid or other CNS depressant such as a benzodiazepine or when prescribing to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, or elderly patients.

### Perioperative gabapentin use in older adults… [^1161KgzB]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In response to the opioid crisis, surgeons nationwide have sought to decrease opioid use by adopting opioid-sparing multimodal medication regimens to treat perioperative pain. 1 For example, gabapentinoids are now commonly administered during the perioperative period as part of "enhanced recovery after surgery" pathways, protocols designed to streamline and improve patient care after surgery. In fact, the use of gabapentinoids has tripled in the US over the past decade. 2 However, the safety of gabapentinoids in older adults has been questioned, and, according to the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults, 3 the medications are considered "potentially inappropriate" when used with opioids owing to increased risk of severe sedation-related adverse events.

While multimodal pain management is promoted in perioperative care by both anesthesia and surgical societies, specific guidelines for older adults fail to address the risks or benefits of gabapentinoids. 4 In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, the work of Park et al5 provides additional evidence of the potential harms of gabapentin use in older adults, key to understanding the overall risk-to-benefit ratio for prescribing gabapentinoids.

### Geriatric use… [^11255StV]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated.
2. 3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows: TABLE

1. Gabapentin Dosage Based on Renal Function. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

In these trials somnolence, ataxia and fatigue were common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of gabapentin in patients older than 12 years of age, with 1. 2%,
0. 8% and 0. 6% discontinuing for these events, respectively. In the placebo-controlled epilepsy studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0. 6% versus
0. 5% in patients receiving placebo. Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all epilepsy studies, 31 had status epilepticus. One of these reactions, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1. 3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and
0. 9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient withdrew due to emotional lability.

The overall incidence of adverse reactions and the types of adverse reactions seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse reactions increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by race.
