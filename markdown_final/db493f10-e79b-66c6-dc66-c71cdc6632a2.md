## Question

fosamax kidney stones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Fosamax (alendronate) causes kidney stones or if it might actually help prevent them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of alendronate and its effects on calcium handling. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about nephrolithiasis. Next, I will review clinical and epidemiologic evidence on bisphosphonates and stone risk. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility, including urinary calcium changes and crystal inhibition. Finally, I should integrate guideline perspectives and outline practical clinical implications, including renal function thresholds and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism, because that will anchor the physiologic reasoning. Alendronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which reduces calcium release from bone and can lower urinary calcium excretion, a key lithogenic driver in calcium stone formers [^27ce1bc5] [^fea5c2a2].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling before drawing conclusions. I need to check the FDA materials for any mention of kidney stones as an adverse effect. I do not see nephrolithiasis listed among common or uncommon adverse reactions for alendronate, and the labels emphasize renal impairment cautions rather than stone formation signals, which argues against a causal relationship between alendronate and stones in routine use [^e4b21b94] [^35ed08b6] [^438f9e8d].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence. A large prospective analysis in the Nurses' Health Study II found that among women with low bone density, bisphosphonate use was associated with a 32% lower risk of incident kidney stones, suggesting a protective association rather than harm, although confounding must be considered in observational designs [^85f72813]. Let me also consider smaller prospective data: a 3-year cohort in stone formers with hypercalciuria showed that alendronate reduced calciuria and improved bone mineral density, with even greater calciuria reduction when combined with thiazide therapy, reinforcing a beneficial effect on stone risk factors rather than a detrimental one [^8a257c1d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check mechanistic plausibility. By suppressing bone resorption, alendronate reduces the calcium load entering the circulation and thus can lower urinary calcium, which is a principal risk factor for calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones; additionally, emerging translational commentary proposes that bisphosphonates may exert direct inhibitory effects in the urinary space, though this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^4a946362] [^fea5c2a2].

> I need to ensure I account for renal function constraints, because accumulation of bisphosphonates can occur in CKD and may complicate interpretation. The FDA advises against alendronate use when creatinine clearance is less than 35 mL/min, and KDIGO cautions against bisphosphonates without a strong rationale when GFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², largely due to limited experience and potential for accumulation rather than a specific stone risk signal; in advanced CKD, adynamic bone disease is a concern, so any antiresorptive use requires individualized risk–benefit assessment and, in some cases, bone biopsy consideration [^35ed08b6] [^62069861] [^aee2beae] [^f0293739].

> Let me consider guideline perspectives to balance benefits and risks. Contemporary urology guidance prioritizes thiazides and alkali citrate for calcium stone formers with high urine calcium or low citrate, but acknowledges that antiresorptives can be considered in selected patients with low bone density, with attention to kidney function and monitoring of urine parameters; this aligns with the notion that alendronate can be part of a comprehensive strategy when bone disease coexists with nephrolithiasis [^45986fd5] [^2e6b55cc] [^dd06417c].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on calcium or vitamin D supplements; could that confound the picture. I should confirm that high-dose supplemental calcium, especially when combined with vitamin D, can increase urinary calcium and stone risk in some populations, whereas dietary calcium at 1,000–1,200 mg/day is generally protective by binding intestinal oxalate; thus, if a patient on alendronate forms stones, I would reassess total calcium intake, vitamin D status, and 24-hour urine chemistries rather than attributing causality to the bisphosphonate itself [^c1b271ba] [^04b39b02] [^01f80a40].

> I will now examine practical clinical implications. For patients with recurrent calcium stones and low bone density, alendronate can be a reasonable option to improve BMD and may modestly reduce stone risk via lower urine calcium, provided creatinine clearance is at least 35 mL/min; I should obtain baseline and follow-up 24-hour urine testing to document calciuria response and adjust the broader stone-prevention regimen accordingly, integrating sodium restriction, adequate dietary calcium, and citrate as indicated [^35ed08b6] [^2e6b55cc] [^027f59f2].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Fosamax (alendronate) does not cause kidney stones and may reduce stone risk in appropriate patients by lowering urinary calcium through inhibition of bone resorption; it is not contraindicated for stone formers per se, but should be avoided in significant renal impairment and used with attention to calcium–vitamin D intake and metabolic monitoring to optimize both skeletal and renal outcomes [^85f72813] [^8a257c1d] [^35ed08b6] [^45986fd5].

---

Fosamax (alendronate) **does not increase kidney stone risk** and may actually reduce it by lowering urinary calcium excretion [^4a946362] [^85f72813]. It is **safe to use in patients with normal renal function**, but should be avoided in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min) due to limited experience and potential accumulation [^35ed08b6] [^438f9e8d]. No specific monitoring for kidney stones is required with Fosamax, but general stone-prevention measures (adequate hydration, dietary sodium restriction, and moderation of calcium intake) are advisable for patients with a history of stones [^c1b271ba] [^ceadca22].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to kidney stone formation

Alendronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that **inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption**, reducing calcium release from bone and thereby lowering urinary calcium excretion [^27ce1bc5] [^fea5c2a2]. Hypercalciuria is a major risk factor for calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones; thus, by reducing urinary calcium, alendronate may theoretically reduce stone risk [^c1b271ba].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding kidney stone risk

### Observational studies

A large prospective cohort study (Nurses' Health Study II) found that **bisphosphonate use was associated with a lower risk of incident kidney stones** in women with low bone density (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.48–0.98) [^85f72813]. Another prospective cohort in patients with recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis and low bone density showed that alendronate reduced urinary calcium excretion and improved bone mineral density, suggesting a beneficial effect on stone risk factors [^8a257c1d].

---

### Clinical trials

Randomized controlled trials evaluating alendronate primarily focus on bone outcomes and **do not report increased kidney stone incidence** as an adverse effect. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (dyspepsia, esophagitis, abdominal pain) and musculoskeletal symptoms, with no significant increase in nephrolithiasis reported [^e4b21b94] [^56d86a87].

---

## Mechanisms influencing kidney stone risk

Alendronate influences kidney stone risk through **several mechanisms**:

- **Reduction in urinary calcium**: By inhibiting bone resorption, alendronate lowers urinary calcium excretion, a key lithogenic factor [^4a946362] [^85f72813].
- **Potential urinary crystal inhibition**: Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates may act as inhibitors in the urinary space, further reducing stone formation risk [^4a946362].
- **Minimal renal processing**: Alendronate is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, but its renal clearance is high, and accumulation is unlikely in patients with normal renal function [^1ce3b9f5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not specifically address** alendronate use in patients with kidney stones. However, general recommendations for calcium stone formers include:

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: ≤ 2.3 g/day to reduce urinary calcium excretion [^c1b271ba] [^ceadca22].
- **Adequate dietary calcium intake**: 1,000–1,200 mg/day to bind intestinal oxalate and reduce oxalate absorption [^c1b271ba] [^069aeab3].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake to dilute urine and reduce stone risk [^6ea37df1].

These measures are **compatible with alendronate use** and should be encouraged in patients with a history of kidney stones.

---

## Special considerations: renal impairment

Alendronate is **not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment** (creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min) due to limited experience and potential accumulation [^35ed08b6] [^438f9e8d]. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 35–60 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is necessary, but caution is advised [^35ed08b6] [^438f9e8d].

---

## Clinical monitoring and precautions

Routine monitoring for kidney stones is **not specifically required** for patients taking alendronate. However, general preventive measures and periodic assessment of renal function are advisable, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or other risk factors for nephrolithiasis [^5877f32c].

The sufficiency of patients' vitamin D status is best assessed by measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. In the 15-week trial mentioned above, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 22.2 ng/mL in the FOSAMAX PLUS D group and 22.1 ng/mL in the FOSAMAX only group. After 15 weeks of treatment, the mean levels were 23.1 ng/mL and 18.4 ng/mL in the FOSAMAX PLUS D and FOSAMAX only groups, respectively. The final levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at Week 15 are summarized in Table 4.

Patients (n = 652) who completed the above 15-week trial continued in a 24-week extension in which all received FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg/2800 international units) and were randomly assigned to receive either additional once weekly vitamin D32800 international units (Vitamin D35600 international units group) or matching placebo (Vitamin D32800 international units group). After 24 weeks of extended treatment (Week 39 from original baseline), the mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 27.9 ng/mL and 25.6 ng/mL in the vitamin D35600 international units group and vitamin D32800 international units group, respectively. The percentage of patients with hypercalciuria at Week 39 was not statistically different between treatment groups.

The distribution of the final levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at Week 39 is summarized in Table 5.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Of the patients receiving FOSAMAX in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), 71% (n = 2302) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 17% (n = 550) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. Of the patients receiving FOSAMAX in the United States and Multinational osteoporosis treatment studies in women, osteoporosis studies in men, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis studies, and Paget's disease studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1), (14.3), (14.4), (14.5)], 45%, 54%, 37%, and 70%, respectively, were 65 years of age or over. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6	Renal Impairment

FOSAMAX is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance values between 35–60 mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Purpose Of Review

Kidney stones are strongly associated with low bone density and bone fracture. Clinical management focuses on prevention of kidney stones and bone fracture. We reviewed literature of kidney stones and bone disease with a special focus on updates in therapeutic strategies. We will review the literature regarding dietary management, supplements, and medications and emphasize the recent studies on bisphosphonates and kidney stone management.

Recent Findings

Bisphosphonate medications are commonly used in management of low bone density. Previous studies showed that they reduce urinary calcium. A recent large prospective study found that bisphosphonates may reduce the risk of kidney stones in individuals who have low bone density. In addition to lowering urinary calcium, a recent study found that bisphosphonates may act as an inhibitor in the urinary space.

Summary

There are multiple dietary and pharmacologic strategies that can be considered for kidney stones and bone disease, such as low salt and normal calcium diet, as well as thiazides, alkali, and bisphosphonate medications. Bisphosphonates may have an important role in reducing bone resorption and reducing overall risk of kidney stone and bone disease.

Specific Populations

Gender: Bioavailability and the fraction of an intravenous dose of alendronate excreted in urine were similar in men and women.

Geriatric:

Alendronate Sodium

Bioavailability and disposition of alendronate (urinary excretion) were similar in elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment of alendronate is necessary.

Cholecalciferol

Dietary requirements of vitamin D3are increased in the elderly.

Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.

Renal Impairment:

Alendronate Sodium

Preclinical studies show that, in rats with kidney failure, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine. No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after 3 weeks dosing with cumulative intravenous doses of 35 mg/kg in young male rats. Although no formal renal impairment pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. FOSAMAX PLUS D is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal failure.

Drug Interactions

Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in patients given oral H2-antagonists is unknown.

In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%).

Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate.

5.2 Mineral Metabolism

Alendronate Sodium

Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAMAX PLUS D [see Contraindications (4)]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAMAX PLUS D.

Presumably due to the effects of alendronate on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.

Cholecalciferol

FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency (commonly defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 9 ng/mL). Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Vitamin D3supplementation may worsen hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with diseases associated with unregulated overproduction of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis). Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients.

5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes alendronate. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

In placebo-controlled clinical studies of FOSAMAX, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the FOSAMAX and placebo groups.

2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400–800 international units daily. FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units and 70 mg/5600 international units are intended to provide seven days' worth of 400 and 800 international units daily vitamin D in a single, once-weekly dose, respectively.

2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### Alendronate sodium and cholecalciferol (Fosamax PLUS D) [^24a419e3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with FOSAMAX. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of FOSAMAX 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. In one-year studies with once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to FOSAMAX but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.

Osteoporosis in Men

Treatment of men with osteoporosis with FOSAMAX 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg.

Cholecalciferol

Vitamin D is required for normal bone formation. Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, leading to increased parathyroid hormone levels and worsening of bone loss associated with osteoporosis. When taken without vitamin D, alendronate is also associated with a reduction in serum calcium concentrations and increased parathyroid hormone levels. In a 15-week trial, 717 postmenopausal women and men, mean age 67 years, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2.5 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) were randomized to receive either weekly FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units vitamin D or weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg alone with no vitamin D supplementation. Patients who were vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 9 ng/mL) at baseline were excluded. Treatment with FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units resulted in a smaller reduction in serum calcium levels (-0.9%) when compared to FOSAMAX 70 mg alone (-1.4%). As well, treatment with FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units resulted in a significantly smaller increase in parathyroid hormone levels when compared to FOSAMAX 70 mg alone (14% and 24%, respectively).

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Alendronate Sodium

Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

Cholecalciferol

Vitamin D3is produced in the skin by photochemical conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3by ultraviolet light. This is followed by non-enzymatic isomerization to vitamin D3. In the absence of adequate sunlight exposure, vitamin D3is an essential dietary nutrient. Vitamin D3in skin and dietary vitamin D3(absorbed into chylomicrons) is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3in the liver. Conversion to the active calcium-mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(calcitriol) in the kidney is stimulated by both parathyroid hormone and hypophosphatemia. The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium, renal calcium and phosphate excretion, bone formation and bone resorption.

Vitamin D is required for normal bone formation. Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate. Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, increased parathyroid hormone levels, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture. In severe cases, deficiency results in more severe hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, proximal muscle weakness, bone pain and osteomalacia.

Excretion

Alendronate Sodium

Following a single intravenous dose of [14C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the feces. Following a single 10-mg intravenous dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% confidence interval [CI]), and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following intravenous administration. The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with FOSAMAX (10 mg daily) the amount of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Cholecalciferol

When radioactive vitamin D3was intravenously administered to healthy subjects, the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4% of the administered dose, and the mean fecal excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 4.9% of the administered dose. In both cases, the excreted radioactivity was almost exclusively as metabolites of the parent. The mean half-life of baseline adjusted vitamin D3in the serum following an oral dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is approximately 14 hours.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of alendronate sodium PO (also known as Binosto, Fosamax):
- **Increased serum sodium**: use caution in patients requiring sodium restriction, including patients with a history of HF, hypertension, or other CVDs, as alendronate effervescent tablets contain 650 mg of sodium.
- **Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw**: use caution in patients with poor oral hygiene, periodontal and/or other dental diseases, ill-fitting dentures, undergoing invasive dental procedures, having comorbid disorders (such as cancer, anemia, coagulopathy, infection), or receiving chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or angiogenesis inhibitors. Perform a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before initiating alendronate.
- **Musculoskeletal pain, atypical femoral fracture**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as alendronate has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Evaluate patients with new thigh or groin pain to rule out an incomplete femoral fracture. Consider discontinuing treatment.
- **Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, esophagitis, esophageal perforation**: use caution in patients with active upper gastrointestinal diseases, including Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, gastritis, duodenitis, or peptic ulcers. Advise patients to take alendronate with an adequate amount of water and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes.

### Low bone density and bisphosphonate use and the risk of kidney stones [^85f72813]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Previous studies have demonstrated lower bone density in patients with kidney stones, but no longitudinal studies have evaluated kidney stone risk in individuals with low bone density. Small studies with short follow-up reported reduced 24-hour urine calcium excretion with bisphosphonate use. We examined history of low bone density and bisphosphonate use and the risk of incident kidney stone as well as the association with 24-hour calcium excretion.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a prospective analysis of 96,092 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. We used Cox proportional hazards models to adjust for age, body mass index, thiazide use, fluid intake, supplemental calcium use, and dietary factors. We also conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 2294 participants using multivariable linear regression to compare 24-hour urinary calcium excretion between participants with and without a history of low bone density, and among 458 participants with low bone density, with and without bisphosphonate use.

Results

We identified 2564 incident stones during 1,179,860 person-years of follow-up. The multivariable adjusted relative risk for an incident kidney stone for participants with history of low bone density compared with participants without was 1.39 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.20 to 1.62). Among participants with low bone density, the multivariable adjusted relative risk for an incident kidney stone for bisphosphonate users was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.98). In the cross-sectional analysis of 24-hour urine calcium excretion, the multivariable adjusted mean difference in 24-hour calcium was 10 mg/d (95% CI, 1 to 19) higher for participants with history of low bone density. However, among participants with history of low bone density, there was no association between bisphosphonate use and 24-hour calcium with multivariable adjusted mean difference in 24-hour calcium of -2 mg/d (95% CI, -25 to 20).

Conclusions

Low bone density is an independent risk factor for incident kidney stone and is associated with higher 24-hour urine calcium excretion. Among participants with low bone density, bisphosphonate use was associated with lower risk of incident kidney stone but was not independently associated with 24-hour urine calcium excretion.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Daily Dosing

The safety of FOSAMAX in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four clinical trials that enrolled 7453 women aged 44–84 years. Study 1 and Study 2 were identically designed, three-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational n = 994); Study 3 was the three-year vertebral fracture cohort of the Fracture Intervention Trial [FIT] (n = 2027) and Study 4 was the four-year clinical fracture cohort of FIT (n = 4432). Overall, 3620 patients were exposed to placebo and 3432 patients exposed to FOSAMAX. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in these clinical trials. In Study 1 and Study 2 all women received 500 mg elemental calcium as carbonate. In Study 3 and Study 4 all women with dietary calcium intake less than 1000 mg per day received 500 mg calcium and 250 international units Vitamin D per day.

Among patients treated with alendronate 10 mg or placebo in Study 1 and Study 2, and all patients in Study 3 and Study 4, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.8% in the placebo group and 1.8% in the FOSAMAX group. The incidence of serious adverse event was 30.7% in the placebo group and 30.9% in the FOSAMAX group. The percentage of patients who discontinued the study due to any clinical adverse event was 9.5% in the placebo group and 8.9% in the FOSAMAX group. Adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either FOSAMAX or placebo are presented in Table 1.

5.4	Osteonecrosis of the Jaw

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including FOSAMAX. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.

For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.

Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^eef12f14]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment and preventive medication — determinants and evidence summary: Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures, and absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit, while evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting; if future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).

### The efficacy and safety of medical and surgical therapy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cdf9c56c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Both medical and surgical therapy represent potential management options for patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Because uncertainty remains regarding both medical and surgical therapy, this systematic review addresses the efficacy and safety of medical therapy in asymptomatic patients or symptomatic patients who decline surgery and surgery in asymptomatic patients. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed from inception to December 2020, and included randomized controlled trials in patients with PHPT that compared nonsurgical management with medical therapy versus without medical therapy and surgery versus no surgery in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. For surgical complications we included observational studies. Paired reviewers addressed eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data for patient-important outcomes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals and used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess quality of evidence for each outcome. For medical therapy, 11 trials reported in 12 publications including 438 patients proved eligible: three addressed alendronate, one denosumab, three cinacalcet, two vitamin D, and two estrogen therapy. Alendronate, denosumab, vitamin D, and estrogen therapy all increased bone density. Cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Cinacalcet and vitamin D may have a small or no increase in overall adverse events. Very-low-quality evidence raised the possibility of an increase in serious adverse events with alendronate and denosumab. The trials also provided low-quality evidence for increased bleeding and mastalgia with estrogen therapy. For surgery, six trials presented in 12 reports including 441 patients proved eligible. Surgery achieved biochemical cure in 96.1% (high quality). We found no convincing evidence supporting an impact of surgery on fracture, quality of life, occurrence of kidney stones, and renal function, but the evidence proved low or very low quality. Surgery was associated with an increase in bone mineral density. For patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT, who are not candidates for parathyroid surgery, cinacalcet probably reduced serum calcium and PTH levels; anti-resorptives increased bone density. For patients with asymptomatic PHPT, surgery usually achieves biochemical cure. These results can help to inform patients and clinicians regarding use of medical therapy and surgery in PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^4fce69d4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical management

As an alternative to surgery, medical management can be utilised in some cases of nPHPT. Surgery may not be suitable for all patients – patients may decline surgery or alternatively be deemed unfit for surgery due to associated frailty or comorbidities. Medical management entails management of the complications of nPHPT such as osteoporosis, rather than the treating the underlying pathological cause of inappropriate PTH hypersecretion. As a result, medical management does not offer curative potential for nPHPT patients.

Limited investigation has been conducted on the impact of alendronate on BMD in a normocalcaemic cohort. One prospective open label randomised trial of 30 nPHPT postmenopausal women revealed improved BMD following alendronate administration. This trial involved comparison of two groups of 15 nPHPT women, with one group receiving oral alendronate in addition to cholecalciferol and the other group only cholecalciferol. Following 1 year of treatment, the alendronate group exhibited significant improvements in lumbar, femoral neck and hip BMD (p = 0.001) – a finding not observed in the control group.

Cinacalcet is commonly used in the management of hPHPT. NICE guidance suggests cinacalcet should be considered in symptomatic patients with calcium levels ⩾2.85 mmol/l as well as asymptomatic patients where calcium levels are ⩾3.0 mmol/l. With regards to the possible use of cinacalcet in nPHPT patients, one prospective randomised pilot study consisting of 10 PHPT patients (4 hPHPT and 6 nPHPT), demonstrated a significant decrease in the number and diameter of renal stones in both patient groups following provision of cinacalcet over a 10-month period. However, given the small sample size of this study, larger studies are needed to understand the true impacts of cinacalcet amongst nPHPT patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the patients receiving alendronate sodium in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), 71% (n = 2302) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 17% (n = 550) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. Of the patients receiving alendronate sodium in the United States and Multinational osteoporosis treatment studies in women, osteoporosis studies in men, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis studies, and Paget's disease studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1), (14.3), (14.4), (14.5)], 45%, 54%, 37%, and 70%, respectively, were 65 years of age or over. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

GI ulcer

GI intolerance is among the most common extraskeletal BP side effects. With a very poor GI absorption of < 1%, prolonged exposure of the GI mucosa to high BP concentrations could occur, carrying the risk for mucosa irritations. Because upper GI complications are frequently linked to improper administration of BPs, patients are advised to thoroughly follow the instructions for intake, namely to take BP on an empty stomach, with sufficient water, and to remain in an upright position for at least 30 minutes after intake, to minimize drug exposure to the esophagus.

The evidence of the association of GI complications and BP is inconclusive in the literature. Increased risk of upper GI bleeding (HR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02–1.71) was associated with alendronate after adjusting for risk factors in a study based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Likewise, a population‐based cohort study in Canada found increased risk for upper GI bleeding in patients aged > 80 years and individuals with a history of GI ulcer disease compared to younger patients in the first 4 months after BP treatment initiation. Although randomized clinical trials among postmenopausal osteoporotic women found high rates of upper GI tract events, incidences were similar for placebo and BP groups (alendronate or risedronate). Similar findings were reported in a cohort study based on US claims data, which compared rates of GI events within 12 months before and after oral BP treatment initiation for osteoporotic women aged ≥ 55 (26.6% versus 28% for GI events; 3.6% versus 3.9% for severe GI events), highlighting the high background rates of GI events. Results from our study are in line with these findings, showing no increased ulcer risk during BP exposure compared to unexposed patient time. Although a case–control study among the elderly found no increased risk for upper GI bleeding associated with oral BP use alone, bleeding risk was increased in those using BP in combination with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.12–3.57) and in those using NSAIDs alone. Our study did not take co‐medication that may alter the risk for GI ulcer (eg, proton pump inhibitor [PPI] or NSAIDs) into account, because several substances from both drug classes can be purchased over the counter in the UK and may be missed in the data.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of alendronate sodium tablet is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

In osteoporosis, alendronate was shown in a randomized controlled trial to significantly improve bone density compared with placebo, whereas etidronate was ineffective and monthly ibandronate was found comparable to weekly alendronate in safety and efficiency; hormone replacement therapy has led to some improvement but is seldom used because of safety concerns. Patients with PBC should be provided 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium and 1,000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed.

### Effects of aminobisphosphonates and thiazides in patients with osteopenia / osteoporosis, hypercalciuria, and recurring renal calcium lithiasis [^8a257c1d]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the effects of aminobisphosphonates and thiazides on renal lithogenic activity and bone mineral density in patients with recurring renal calcium lithiasis.

Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort study with 3 years of clinical follow-up data was performed. The study included 2 groups of patients with recurring calcium lithiasis, hypercalciuria, and bone mineral density loss. Group 1 included 35 patients who underwent treatment with 70 mg/wk alendronate. Group 2 included 35 patients who underwent treatment with 50 mg/d hydrochlothiazide and 70 mg/wk alendronate. Biochemical analysis was performed at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years, bone densitometry at baseline and 2 years, and clinical follow-up during the 3 years of treatment. The biochemical variables from the blood and urine samples, recurrent lithiasis, and bone mineral density were analyzed.

Results

Age, sex, baseline biochemical markers, and bone density showed no differences between the 2 treatment groups at the onset of treatment. After 2 years of treatment, group 1 showed a significant decrease in bone turnover markers and calciuria and significant improvement in bone mineral density. After 2 years of treatment, group 2 showed a decrease in calciuria and bone markers. At 2 years, the decrease in calciuria and the improvement in bone mineral density were greater in group 2 than in group 1, and the difference was statistically significant.

Conclusion

Aminobisphosphonates improve bone mineral density and slow lithogenic activity; however, administration of aminobisphosphonates in association with thiazides produced the same clinical effects and also reduced calciuria and improved bone mineral density.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^fea5c2a2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.

### Common and rare variants associated with kidney stones and biochemical traits [^30a0edb0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The association data presented here point to SLC34A1 as the kidney stone target at this locus. In support of this hypothesis, several studies demonstrate that rare variants in SLC34A1 are linked to hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis (OMIM:612286) and that SLC34A1 is the only gene at the locus that shows tissue-specific gene expression in kidney. Furthermore, the observed changes in biochemical traits reflect the function of SLC34A1 as a phosphate transporter. The kidney is the main regulatory organ of phosphate homeostasis and serum phosphate levels are reflected by a change in phosphate reabsorption. SLC34A1 is expressed in the brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells, where the bulk of phosphate reabsorption takes place, and appears to be responsible for ∼70% of total phosphate transport based on mouse models in which Slc34a1 has been knocked out. The reduction in serum PTH levels associated with the kidney stone variants likely results from a decrease in serum phosphate levels caused by diminished renal reabsorption as a consequence of the negative feedback loop that maintains serum phosphate levels.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^851c62a7]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) kidney stone evaluation — laboratory, imaging, and metabolic testing directives are as follows: clinicians should obtain serum intact parathyroid hormone level as part of the screening evaluation if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected (Clinical Principle), and primary hyperparathyroidism should be suspected when serum calcium is high or high normal; when a stone is available, clinicians should obtain a stone analysis at least once (Clinical Principle); clinicians should obtain or review available imaging studies to quantify stone burden (Clinical Principle); clinicians should perform additional metabolic testing in high-risk or interested first-time stone formers and recurrent stone formers (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B); metabolic testing should consist of one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet and analyzed at minimum for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium and creatinine (Expert Opinion), and primary hyperoxaluria should be suspected when urinary oxalate excretion exceeds 75 mg/day in adults without bowel dysfunction; clinicians should not routinely perform "fast and calcium load" testing to distinguish among types of hypercalciuria (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

The present study showed that high serum fasting OPG levels may be indicative of femoral neck BMD in patients with nephrolithiasis. A deeper knowledge of mechanisms involved in the association between OPG serum levels, bone integrity, and kidney stone disease can provide more robust scientific approaching for future therapeutic interventions.

### Oral bisphosphonate therapy for vitamin D intoxication of the infant [^391cdf9d]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin D intoxication in infancy has serious consequences attributable to acute hypercalcemia and subsequent hypercalcuria/nephrocalcinosis. Current treatments of patients with vitamin D intoxication are unsatisfactory and associated with prolonged hypercalcemia. We now report the use of oral alendronate sodium in a 3-month-old infant with vitamin D intoxication. Short-term oral alendronate sodium treatment effectively corrected hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria, decreased the duration of hospitalization, and appears safe in 15 months of observation.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^c572b73b]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Calcium safety and upper limits — In a Swedish prospective longitudinal cohort, calcium intake of more than 1,500 mg/day was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.67) for all-cause mortality, and a large study raised concerns about nephrolithiasis although the absolute risk of kidney stones was small (2.5% in the calcium-supplemented group versus 2.1% in the control group) with a mean total calcium intake of ∼2,100 mg. A study of more than 9,000 participants followed for 10 years found that postmenopausal women taking 500 to 1,000 mg of supplemental calcium had a significant survival advantage over women not taking supplements, while low dietary calcium intake (< 700 mg/day compared with 1,400 mg/day) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risks and a meta-analysis found no effect of calcium supplements on cardiovascular risk. In summary, studies to date suggest that dietary calcium may be preferred over supplemental calcium and that total calcium intake should not exceed 1,500 mg/day; increasing calcium intake beyond the recommended levels has not been shown to be useful and may be harmful.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^d6c2f37b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.

Osteoporosis in Men

Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate 70 mg.

Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Sustained use of glucocorticoids is commonly associated with development of osteoporosis and resulting fractures (especially vertebral, hip, and rib). It occurs in both males and females of all ages. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss. Alendronate decreases bone resorption without directly inhibiting bone formation.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^87825e41]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Low bone mineral density is a potential risk factor for symptom onset and related with hypocitraturia in urolithiasis patients: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^e848f119]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of urolithiasis is increasing worldwide, with a reported recurrence rate of 15 per 100 person-years. With the recognized relationship between urolithiasis and metabolic syndrome, the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, is also speculated to increase the prevalence of urolithiasis. Urolithiasis is not a direct life-threatening disease, but a recent study indicated that it could indirectly cause death with its slightly increasing trend. Therefore, prevention is essential in reducing its economic and medical burden; however, there are few useful biomarkers for monitoring and predicting disease severity and recurrence except for 24-h urine parameters.

Calcium-containing stones are the most prevalent, and this disease pathology is clearly based on the mineralization process. Patients with urolithiasis, especially those whose stones are composed of calcium oxalate and phosphate, are reported to have abnormal mineral laboratory findings, such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, as well as bone metabolic symptoms including fractures. The bone mineral density (BMD) of patients with urolithiasis is lower than that of those without stones; even the male adolescent population demonstrates similar findings. In particular, osteoporotic states often cause hypercalciuria in patients with urolithiasis due to deterioration in bone resorption. This evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of urolithiasis is linked to osteogenesis via mineral metabolism.

Worldwide guidelines recommend 24-h urine collection for patients considered high-risk stone formers, such as those with staghorn stones, recurrences, and comorbidities like metabolic syndromes. However, the examination of osteogenesis parameters, including BMD, is usually not recommended by experts despite the overlap between urolithiasis and osteogenesis. In contrast, with 24-h urine collection, few urologists examine BMD in patients with urolithiasis; hence, the clinical importance of monitoring BMD in patients with urolithiasis has not been fully understood.

We previously investigated the potential therapeutic influence of bisphosphonates on postmenopausal women with urolithiasis, who showed improved BMD and reduced risk of calcium phosphate stone formation. Since then, we have been monitoring BMD in patients with urolithiasis to better understand its role in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between BMD and clinical outcomes in urolithiasis, including not only mineral parameters such as 24-h urine collection but also symptoms and incidence of recurrences.

Eligible patients provided informed consent, were ≥ 18 and < 75 years old, nondiabetic (HbA1c < 6.5%, no known diagnosis of diabetes, no antidiabetic medication) and had experienced at least one kidney stone event in the past with the most recent kidney stone analyzed containing ≥ 80% calcium or ≥ 80% UA (which determined enrollment in one of the two subtrials). Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with secondary causes of kidney stones (severe eating disorders, chronic bowel disease, past intestinal or bariatric surgery, sarcoidosis, primary hyperparathyroidism and complete distal tubular acidosis), patients with untreated obstructive uropathy or genito-urinary infection, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD-EPI eGFR < 60 mL −1 min −1 1.73 m −2), kidney transplant recipients, pregnant and lactating women, known allergy to study drug, participation in another interventional clinical trial within 4 weeks before baseline or during this trial, inability to understand and follow the protocol as well as intake of drugs interfering with kidney stone formation (thiazide and loop diuretics; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (including topiramate); xanthine oxidase inhibitors; alkali (including potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate); 1,25-OH Vitamin D (calcitriol); calcium supplementation; bisphosphonates; denusomab; teriparatide; glucocorticoids). In patients where temporary suspension of interfering drugs was feasible, a washout period of 4 weeks was carried out before randomization. No payment or compensation was given to study participants. Both male and female participants (sex) were included. Gender data were not collected.

### Nephrolithiasis-associated bone disease: pathogenesis and treatment options [^cf6e1c4d]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis remains a formidable health problem in the United States and worldwide. A very important but underaddressed area in nephrolithiasis is the accompanying bone disease. Epidemiologic studies have shown that osteoporotic fractures occur more frequently in patients with nephrolithiasis than in the general population. Decreased bone mineral density and defects in bone remodeling are commonly encountered in patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. The pathophysiologic connection of bone defects to kidney stones is unknown. Hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia are two important risk factors for stone disease, and treatments with thiazide diuretics and alkali, respectively, have been shown to be useful in preventing stone recurrence in small prospective trials. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of these agents or other therapies in preventing continued bone loss in calcium stone formers. This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and potential treatments of bone disease in patients with nephrolithiasis.

Bisphosphonates — renal thresholds and IV administration precautions: Contraindications to oral or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates include pregnancy or hypersensitivity. Bisphosphonates should be used with caution, if at all, when kidney function is reduced, specifically at glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min for risedronate and ibandronate or < 35 mL/min for alendronate. Before zoledronate dosing, a creatinine clearance should be calculated using Cockcroft-Gault based on serum creatinine and actual body weight before each dose. Rapid IV administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates may decrease kidney function, particularly in older, dehydrated patients or those on diuretics or potentially nephrotoxic drugs.

Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Daily Dosing

The safety of alendronate sodium in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four clinical trials that enrolled 7453 women aged 44 to 84 years. Study 1 and Study 2 were identically designed, three-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational n = 994); Study 3 was the three-year vertebral fracture cohort of the Fracture Intervention Trial [FIT] (n = 2027) and Study 4 was the four-year clinical fracture cohort of FIT (n = 4432). Overall, 3620 patients were exposed to placebo and 3432 patients exposed to alendronate sodium. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in these clinical trials. In Study 1 and Study 2 all women received 500 mg elemental calcium as carbonate. In Study 3 and Study 4 all women with dietary calcium intake less than 1000 mg per day received 500 mg calcium and 250 international units Vitamin D per day.

Skeletal side effects

ONJ was very rare in the frailty cohort, with only 1.6 cases/100,000 person years. Incidence rates between 1 and 69/100,000 person years were reported in patients prescribed oral BPs.

Fractures of the subtrochanteric/distal femur or femur shaft were assessed as proxies for "atypical" femur fracture (AFF) in line with a previous observational study, because no specific codes to identify radiographically confirmed AFF were available in CPRD. Previous studies highlighted that only a small proportion (between 3% and 13%) of overall subtrochanteric/distal/shaft femur fractures are classified as "atypical" after radiographic assessment. Therefore, incidence rates retrieved from this study are markedly higher compared to previous reports on AFF in BP users. However, rates of 3.4/1000 person‐years for subtrochanteric/ femur shaft fractures were described in alendronate users, which is about 2.6‐fold higher compared to our incidence rate in the frailty cohort.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism-a reasonable option [^54174790]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder which is often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild stable biochemical abnormalities and lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss leading to an increased risk of fracture are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT. Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild stable PHPT, low fracture risk and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcaemia or with nephrolithiasis. For individuals with increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree to surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform management of PHPT.

Bisphosphonates

Because of their low lipophilicity, bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (1%-5%), having a further reduced bioavailability if not taken as indicated (fasting with a glass of water and least 30 minutes before any food or fluids). They are absorbed through paracellular transport and then partially bound in the hydroxyapatite in bone, which are liberated again after bone resorption and partially eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. Trace amounts of bisphosphonates may be found in the urine for up to 8 years following treatment discontinuation, with alendronate having a half-life of more than 10 years in bone. In CKD, bisphosphonates have a progressively prolonged half-life, possibly leading to accumulation in soft tissue, with ambiguous clinical impact. Although animal and numerous clinical studies have reported that bisphosphonates may cause direct nephrotoxicity (acute tubular necrosis, acute renal impairment, nephrotic syndrome, focal glomerulosclerosis), especially if administered IV, it is an uncommon adverse event and is minimized with adjustment of the dosage and prolongation of the infusion time. Their use is generally contraindicated in GFR < 35 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and it has been proposed to diminish their dosage by 50% when given in patients with CKD stage 4–5. Antiresorptive drugs may encourage the development of adynamic bone disease, which may increase fracture risk, a concern that has to be addressed when treating patients with end-stage CKD. Amerling et al found adynamic bone disease on bone biopsy evaluation in all of 13 patients with osteoporosis and CKD stage 2–4 that they studied. In animal models with CKD, the rate of bone turnover has no significant impact on the amounts of zoledronate accumulation or retention.

### Case report: disease mechanisms and medical management of calcium nephrolithiasis in rheumatologic diseases [^38d313e8]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment of bone mineral axis

It is appropriate to assess bone mineral density. While treatment with calcium supplements can potentially aggravate the stone risk in some cases, due to increased risk of GI absorption, increase in dietary calcium is appropriate to 800 to 1200 mg daily. In fact, diets low in calcium can actually increase stone risk by increasing risk of excess urine oxalate, as intestinal calcium helps to bind oxalate in the intestine and prevent excess oxalate absorption. Furthermore, in cases of fat malabsorption such as with Crohn's disease, calcium supplements with meals will increase oxalate binding with calcium in the intestine to prevent excess oxalate absorption. Most patients will benefit from vitamin D repletion as long as there is not an associated genetic or acquired predisposition to idiopathic hypercalciuria, as in sarcoidosis. If vitamin D is supplemented, it is prudent to reassess urinary calcium excretion with either 24 h urine or random urine calcium to creatinine ratios. If patients are found to have hypercalciuria, treatment with a thiazide type diuretic may be used to trigger increased renal reabsorption of calcium. As this can trigger urinary potassium loss, this may require increase use of potassium supplementation. Other mechanisms to stabilize bone may include bisphosphonate use (avoid if GFR < 30) or denosumab. In severe cases, teriparatide may be considered if not contraindicated by degree of kidney failure.

Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir.

5.10 Patients with Hemophilia

There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.

5.11 Nephrolithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving fosamprenavir calcium. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered.

5.12 Resistance/Cross-Resistance

Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect therapy with fosamprenavir calcium will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. Fosamprenavir calcium has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Methods

Study subjects

Potential participants attending the specialty clinic at Shariati university hospital, located in the city of Tehran-Iran, were invited to participate in this study. Eligible subjects with nephrolithiasis who had given written informed consent were entered into the study. All subjects had to be over the age of 18, willing and able to give written consent to the study, and had a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis. Participants were excluded if they had hyperparathyroidism, thyroid gland dysfunction, renal tubular acidosis, malignancy, longstanding corticosteroid intake. Other reasons for exclusion were use of estrogen, progesterone, bisphosphonate, calcitonin, heparins, and anti- inflammatory drugs, calcium, vitamin D and vitamin C supplements and treatment with thiazides diuretics. Information regarding nephrolithiasis in preceding years and medication use was retrieved by interviewing patients. The duration of kidney stone was considered as the difference between the current age of the subject and the age at the time of the first diagnosis of kidney stone. Ethics Committee approval was gained from Tehran University of Medical Sciences (code: EC- 00308) and all participants provided written informed consent.

Measurement of BMD

BMD measurement of the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and one femur was performed by dual – energy X- ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using Lunar DPX-MD device (Lunar Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin, 53,713. USA). Results were expressed as absolute values (g/cm2), Z-score and T-score. The threshold for establishing a diagnosis of Low bone mass was based on the World Health Organization definition.

### Early use of alendronate as a protective factor against the development of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in childhood-onset rheumatic diseases: a cross-sectional study [^ef69d386]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Interpretation

In our study, patients with childhood-onset rheumatic diseases who were treated with glucocorticoids had a higher prevalence of bone loss and vertebral fracture in comparison to the results reported from a national survey in Canada. This is probably because the cumulative glucocorticoid dose of the patients in this study (mean, 10,184 mg/m 2; SD, 4673 mg/m 2; data not shown in Table 1) was greater than that of the patients in the Canadian study (mean, 6369 mg/m 2; SD, 5146 mg/m 2).

In terms of the analysis of risk factors for the development of bone loss and osteoporosis, we found that early alendronate therapy was the only protective factor against the development of bone loss. As shown in Additional file 3: Table S3 and Additional file 4: Table S4, even if we focused on alendronate-treated participants alone, the initiation of alendronate therapy within 3 months after the start of glucocorticoid therapy clearly associated with a decreased frequency of bone loss. Glucocorticoid-induced bone loss occurs early after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy due to relatively higher bone resorption as a result of the suppression of bone formation by glucocorticoid treatment. In childhood, the larger imbalance of bone metabolism due to glucocorticoid treatment is particularly concerning because the bone turnover is relatively high in comparison to that in adulthood. Thus, early intervention to prevent bone loss in glucocorticoid-treated children should be discussed.

In contrast, we did not find any risk factors associated with the development of osteoporosis; this was probably due to the small number of participants who developed osteoporosis in our study population.

Although the fracture risk in glucocorticoid-treated children with rheumatic disease is unknown at the time of writing, a preventive approach should be considered for children undergoing glucocorticoid therapy because their treatment is likely to continue until adulthood.

Generalizability

The rate of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, which is recommended for glucocorticoid-treated children, was low in our study because they were not administered in most cases in order to avoid the development of urinary stones. This might affect the generalizability of our findings in terms of the impact of these factors on the development of bone loss.

### Nephrolithiasis [^ead131f0]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide, and decreasing stone growth and recurrence is critical to reducing morbidity. Preventative approaches vary with kidney stone type, so knowledge of stone composition and a thorough history and metabolic evaluation are necessary to individualize therapy. The cases presented herein highlight treatment strategies for the most common stone types seen in clinical practice with practical pearls for the nephrologist.

### Reduced bone formation and relatively increased bone resorption in absorptive hypercalciuria [^7596b6c4]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Absorptive hypercalciuria (AH), a common stone-forming condition characterized biochemically by intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium and hypercalciuria may be associated with bone loss. In AH type I (AH-1), hypercalciuria persists despite restriction in dietary calcium intake. We therefore hypothesized that the skeleton may contribute to the hypercalciuria in this subgroup of patients. Histomorphometric analysis of iliac crest biopsies were performed on nine stone-formers with AH-1 and on nine matched normal subjects. After stabilization on a stone-prevention diet, calcium homeostasis in the stone formers was then evaluated on inpatient constant metabolic diet before and after short-term blockade of bone resorption by alendronate (10 mg daily, 17 days total). Compared with controls, the stone-formers had lower indices of bone formation (osteoblast surface/bone surface 1.8 ± 2.1 vs 3.0 ± 1.5%, P = 0.04; wall thickness 35.8 ± 6.9 vs 47.2 ± 7.6%, P = 0.001) and relatively higher bone resorption (osteoclast surface/bone surface 0.4 ± 0.2 vs 0.2 ± 0.2%, P = 0.05). In the stone-formers, a short-term course of alendronate treatment corrected fasting urinary calcium (0.14 ± 0.06 to 0.06 ± 0.04 mg Ca/mg Cr, P = 0.001) and marginally reduced 24-h urinary calcium by 48 mg/day (P = 0.06). Increased intestinal calcium absorption and hypercalciuria persisted, but estimated calcium balance improved (P = 0.007). Our results suggest that the hypercalciuria of AH-1 originates primarily from intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium, but bone resorption in excess of bone formation may contribute.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: a cohort study [^2f8ace6f]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The absolute increase in the rate of adverse renal outcomes associated with stones was small: the unadjusted rate of ESRD was 2.48 per million person days in people with one or more episodes of stones, compared with 0.52 per million person days in people without stones. Corresponding unadjusted rates of new stage 3b–5 chronic kidney disease and sustained doubling of serum creatinine from baseline were 61.47 versus 25.53 and 7.69 versus 2.40 respectively.

The risk of adverse renal outcomes associated with kidney stones seemed to increase with the number of stone episodes, since the adjusted risk of ESRD and doubling of serum creatinine were both greater in patients with multiple episodes of stones as compared with those with a single episode or no stones (table 2).

Effect modification by age and sex

In analyses that separately evaluated the effect modification of age and sex (table 3, fig 2), the adjusted risk of ESRD associated with one or more episodes of stones (compared with those without stones) seemed greater for women than men (P value for interaction 0.003). Results were similar in the other two adverse renal outcomes, although this interaction was of borderline significance for new stage 3b–5 chronic kidney disease (P = 0.06). The risk of incident ESRD associated with one or more stone episodes (versus no stones) was not significantly higher in people aged < 50 years than in those aged ≥ 50 (P = 0.11), but the risk of the other two adverse renal outcomes was significantly greater in those aged < 50 than in those who were older (both P ≤ 0.01, table 3). Although the magnitude of the association between stones and adverse outcomes was greater for women than for men and for those aged < 50 years than for those aged ≥ 50, the risk of all three outcomes in those with at least one episode of stones was significantly higher than in those without stones in both sexes and both age strata (table 3). The absolute increase in the rate of ESRD was small for all age and sex subgroups (fig 2).

### Thiazide dose, urine calcium, and symptomatic kidney stone events [^1f0840ad]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

The study included 634 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [8.6] years; 339 men [53.5%] and 295 women [46.5%]; 2 Asian [0.3%], 12 Black [1.9%], 2 Hispanic [0.3%], 2 North American Native [0.3%], 602 White [95.0%], 2 of other races and ethnicities [0.3%], and 12 of unknown race and ethnicity [1.9%]). Figure 1 reveals significant associations between higher thiazide doses and greater 24-hour mean (SE) and percentage calcium reductions (low dose: −79.3 [7.6] mg/d [95% CI, −94.1 to −64.4 mg/d] and −18.9% [2.5%] [95% CI, −23.9% to −14.0%]; medium dose: −94.1 [6.4] mg/d [95% CI, −106.7 to −81.5 mg/d] and −25.5% [2.1%] [95% CI, −29.6% to −21.3%]; high dose: −104.6 [6.3] mg/d [95% CI, −117.0 to −92.3 mg/d] and −28.4% [2.1%] [95% CI, −32.6% to −24.4%]; P = 0.04 for absolute difference and P = 0.02 for percentage difference). The adjusted cumulative incidence of a symptomatic stone event at 4 years was 28.8% (95% CI, 21.1%-35.7%), 19.5% (95% CI, 12.9%-25.7%), and 18.0% (95% CI, 11.5%-24.0%) for patients in the low (mean [SD], 24 [61] mg/d), medium (mean [SD], −90 [25] mg/d), and high (mean [SD], −216 [74] mg/d) tercile, respectively, of calcium change after thiazide prescription (P = 0.04 for trend; Figure 2).

### Urolithiasis in children: medical approach [^069aeab3]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium

The association between sodium intake and calcium stone formation has been reported but has not been confirmed in all studies. Increased sodium intake is known to promote calciuria by competing for reabsorption at the level of the renal tubules. A low salt diet corresponding to less than 2 to 3 mEq/kg/d in children or less than 2.4 g/d in adolescents or adults is generally recommended for patients with hypercalciuria or calcium-containing stones. A low salt diet may also reduce urinary cystine excretion in patients with cystinuria.

Calcium

Until recently, higher calcium intake was thought to increase the risk of stone formation; however, there is substantial evidence now that a higher calcium containing diet is associated with a reduced risk of stone formation. A potential mechanism that might explain this paradox is that higher calcium intake effectively binds dietary oxalate in the gut, thereby reducing intestinal absorption and eventual urinary oxalate excretion. The current recommendation for stone formers is to curtail excess calcium intake, but calcium restriction is not recommended, in part, because of the long-term risk of osteoporosis. Excess consumption of vitamin D with or without calcium supplements can also induce excessive urinary calcium excretion.

Animal protein

There is compelling evidence for a role of dietary animal proteins (meat, fish, and poultry) in calcium oxalate stone formation. The metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in animal meat generates an acid load in the form of sulfuric acid. As a result, excessive dietary animal protein intake causes increased urinary calcium excretion and reduced urinary citrate excretion and pH. Vegetable and dairy protein sources do not seem to carry the same lithogenic potential. The consumption of excessive amounts of dietary animal protein also results in increased purine intake, increased uric acid production, and may contribute to both uricosuria and more acidic urine. In patients with cystinuria, there is little evidence to support the dietary restriction of proteins high in cystine content; however, reducing animal protein intake might be helpful by increasing urinary pH. Children with calculi are recommended not to eat excessive amounts of protein but should aim for 100% of the daily recommended allowance for age to supply adequate substrate for growth and nutrition.

### Elevations in serum and urinary calcium with parathyroid hormone (1–84) with and without alendronate for osteoporosis [^04ab2121]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

The effect of PTH therapy on serum and urinary calcium levels and the risk of hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria has not been formally evaluated.

Objective

The objective was to examine changes in serum and urinary calcium associated with PTH(1–84) therapy in the PaTH trial and the extent to which a defined algorithm resolved the elevated values.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Intervention

A total of 178 postmenopausal women were randomized to PTH(1–84) either alone or in combination with alendronate during the first year of the PaTH study.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The main outcome measures were fasting serum calcium at baseline and 1, 3, and 12 months and 24-h urinary calcium at baseline and 3 months.

Results

In 14% of participants, serum calcium more than 10.5 mg/dl (> 2.6 mmol/liter) developed. Following the defined algorithm, 58% of elevated measurements were normal on repeat testing; 38% required discontinuation of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and one necessitated a decrease in PTH injection frequency to normalize serum calcium. One participant developed transient hypercalcemia between study visits and required hospitalization; the episode resolved with iv hydration and PTH discontinuation. Baseline characteristics associated with the development of hypercalcemia were serum calcium [relative hazards = 1.9 per 0.5 mg/dl (0.12 mmol/liter); 95% confidence interval = 1.1–3.2] and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [relative hazard = 1.9 per 10 pg/ml (26 pmol/liter); 95% confidence interval = 1.2–3.1]. Fifteen women (8%) developed hypercalciuria [urinary calcium > 400 mg (100 mmol)/24 h or calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.4]; 80% of cases resolved after discontinuing calcium and vitamin D, 13% without intervention, and one after PTH injection frequency was decreased. Higher baseline urinary calcium excretion was associated with development of hypercalciuria [relative hazard = 1.5 per 50 mg/d (12.5 mmol/d); 95% confidence interval = 1.2–4.0]. Proportions of patients with elevated serum and urinary calcium were similar on single and combination therapy.

Conclusions

The frequency of episodic hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria in the PaTH trial was 21%. Episodes were generally mild, and nearly all cases resolved spontaneously or with discontinuation of calcium and vitamin D. The algorithms used to address hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in the PaTH trial proved effective in safely resolving clinical episodes of increased urinary or serum calcium and might therefore be helpful to clinicians caring for patients on PTH.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^2e6b55cc]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — pharmacologic therapy for recurrent calcium stones: Clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics to patients with high or relatively high urine calcium and recurrent calcium stones (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Thiazide dosages associated with a hypocalciuric effect include hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg orally, twice daily; 50 mg orally, once daily), chlorthalidone (25 mg orally, once daily), and indapamide (2.5 mg orally, once daily), and dietary prescription, especially restriction of sodium intake, should be continued when thiazides are prescribed to maximize the hypocalciuric effect and limit potassium wasting.

### Bisphosphonate safety and efficacy in chronic kidney disease [^f935ebf1]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

A new population-based study of elderly patients hospitalized for a fracture and treated with an oral bisphosphonate finds no increased risk of acute kidney injury. The safety and efficacy of bisphosphonates may be different in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effects on vascular calcifications need further study, because low bone turnover might exacerbate vascular calcifications in patients with CKD. Even if bisphosphonates prove safe, their efficacy in this population is uncertain.

### Osteoporosis and stone disease… [^2120416f]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Drugs associated with stone formation include triamterene and the sulfonamides, which have low solubility. Calcium and vitamin D supplements cause hypercalciuria, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which are used to treat glaucoma, increase the urinary pH and precipitate calcium phosphate. Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can also crystallize and form stones in the urinary tract. Urinalysis should be performed in patients with a first stone, and urine cultures should be obtained if infection is suspected. The presence of hexagonal cystine crystals may lead to the diagnosis of cystinuria. A low urinary pH is associated with uric acid stone formation, and a high urinary pH accompanied by a low serum bicarbonate concentration may occur with distal renal tubular acidosis. These patients are at risk for renal insufficiency. Calcium phosphate stones often occur in patients with renal tubular acidosis or hyperparathyroidism.

The pharmacologic treatment of calcium stones requires lowering urinary calcium excretion with thiazides and increasing the inhibitory activity of urine by increasing urinary citrate excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone are useful for achieving lower urinary calcium levels, 24 with the latter perhaps offering a more prolonged effect. The usual starting dosage of each agent is 25 to 50 mg once daily, with the dosage increased up to 50 mg twice daily as dictated by the results of repeated 24-hour urine collections. The major side effect of thiazides is hypokalemia, which leads to reductions in urinary citrate excretion. Therefore, thiazide therapy is usually accompanied by potassium citrate supplementation to replace potassium and replenish urinary citrate. The need to restrict dietary salt intake to minimize kaliuresis and maximize the effect of reducing calciuria should be reemphasized.

Potassium citrate comes in oral tablets and liquid forms. The usual dosage is 20 to 30 mEq taken twice daily as needed. Bone density may increase with the administration of thiazides, which appear to have some beneficial effect on fracture rates. 31 Bisphosphonates such as alendronate may also be beneficial. The bisphosphonates, which are now standard therapy for osteoporosis, also reduce urinary calcium excretion. 32 Therefore, therapy with thiazides and bisphosphonates may permit calcium supplementation in older stone formers who are at risk for osteoporosis.

### Thiazide dose, urine calcium, and symptomatic kidney stone events [^bd20354a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although thiazides are a mainstay of kidney stone prevention, one study (the Hydrochlorothiazide for Kidney Stone Recurrence Prevention [NOSTONE] trial) questioned their efficacy, leading some to argue against their use for this indication. Because thiazides are believed to mitigate stone formation by reducing urine calcium, one explanation for NOSTONE's null finding is that the calcium reductions were insufficient to affect recurrence risk. We conducted a cohort study quantifying the association between thiazide dose and calcium reduction and correlating calcium changes with symptomatic stone events.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

5.13 Kidney Stones

TOPAMAX increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in TOPAMAX-treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among TOPAMAX-treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking TOPAMAX for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) TOPAMAX treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1–24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. TOPAMAX is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

TOPAMAX is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The concomitant use of TOPAMAX with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.

Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.

An increase in urinary calcium and a marked decrease in urinary citrate was observed in TOPAMAX-treated pediatric patients in a one-year active-controlled study [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. This increased ratio of urinary calcium/citrate increases the risk of kidney stones and/or nephrocalcinosis.
