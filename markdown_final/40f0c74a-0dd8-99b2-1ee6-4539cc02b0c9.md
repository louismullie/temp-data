## Question

What is the mangment of her2 positive breast cancer stage 1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of stage I HER2-positive breast cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define stage I and confirm HER2 status. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment goals and whether de-escalation is appropriate. Next, I will examine locoregional management, followed by adjuvant systemic therapy options, including when to use paclitaxel plus trastuzumab versus standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. After that, I need to check duration of anti-HER2 therapy, cardiac monitoring, and the role of pertuzumab. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, summarize a practical algorithm, and ensure the recommendations align with current ESMO, ASCO, and NCCN guidance.

> Let me first confirm the disease definition and staging, because management hinges on precise classification. Stage I HER2-positive breast cancer is typically T1a–T1c N0 M0, meaning invasive tumors 1 cm or smaller (T1a ≤ 0.5 cm, T1b 0.5–1 cm, T1c 1–2 cm) with no regional nodal or distant metastases, and HER2 positivity is defined by IHC 3+ or ISH amplification with a ratio > 2.0 or average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0, which I should double-check against guideline criteria before proceeding [^a9d49ce4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prognosis. Although stage I disease is generally favorable, HER2 positivity confers higher recurrence risk even in small, node-negative tumors, and retrospective data suggest recurrence rates up to roughly 30% at 5–10 years in T1a/b HER2-positive disease, which is why adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy is often considered despite small size, though I need to balance this against toxicity and absolute benefit in shared decision-making [^917ee489] [^80dd6a66].

> Next, I should review the overarching treatment goals and whether de-escalation is appropriate. The modern approach emphasizes tailoring therapy: escalation for higher-risk disease and de-escalation for low-risk disease, with stage I HER2-positive tumors often falling into a de-escalation paradigm when clinically low risk, provided we do not compromise outcomes; this principle is reflected in contemporary ESMO and ASCO guidance and supported by trials exploring shorter or less intensive regimens [^53453698] [^05d502a5].

> I will now examine locoregional management, and I need to ensure I align with standard practice. For stage I disease, upfront definitive surgery with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation or mastectomy is standard, with sentinel lymph node biopsy considered for clinically node-negative patients; neoadjuvant therapy is generally not indicated for T1a/b N0 HER2-positive disease outside of trials, so surgery-first is the default approach here [^a0c821f1] [^d72c54eb].

> Now, for adjuvant systemic therapy, I should confirm the preferred de-escalated option for low-risk stage I disease. Paclitaxel plus trastuzumab for 12 weeks followed by trastuzumab to complete 1 year is a validated, less intensive regimen for small, node-negative HER2-positive tumors, with long-term data showing 10-year invasive disease-free survival around 91%, breast cancer-specific survival near 99%, and very low heart failure rates; this is endorsed by NCCN and reflected in ESMO's consideration of shorter anti-HER2 durations in selected low-risk settings [^083f13ab] [^0a29fa7a] [^bacc7735].

> Wait, let me verify the standard-duration alternative for patients who can tolerate more intensive therapy or who have higher-risk features within stage I. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy plus 1 year of trastuzumab remains appropriate for many patients, with meta-analytic data demonstrating a one-third reduction in recurrence and mortality when trastuzumab is added to chemotherapy; regimens commonly use a taxane with trastuzumab, and concurrent administration is preferred over sequential, while avoiding concomitant anthracycline and trastuzumab to limit cardiotoxicity [^3c8543c9] [^d8aff1c7] [^88828eb7].

> I should confirm the duration of anti-HER2 therapy and cardiac surveillance. One year of trastuzumab total is standard, with ESMO noting that in selected low-risk cases a 6-month course may be noninferior, though I need to be cautious and individualize this; throughout therapy, baseline, periodic, and post-treatment cardiac function assessments are recommended, with additional checks if symptoms arise or if cardiotoxic risk is higher [^e98083ea] [^bacc7735] [^78b5adc6].

> Let me consider the role of pertuzumab, because I do not want to over-treat. Dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab is supported in the neoadjuvant setting and in node-positive adjuvant disease, but for small, node-negative stage I tumors, routine addition of pertuzumab is not recommended; thus, I should reserve pertuzumab for higher-risk presentations rather than apply it broadly to stage I disease [^1179ba5d] [^794dcd8b] [^c11273d8].

> But wait, what if the patient has very small, indolent biology or significant comorbidities. For T1a/b, node-negative, hormone receptor–positive disease with favorable features, some clinicians and patients may reasonably consider omitting chemotherapy and using trastuzumab monotherapy or even observation after surgery, acknowledging that evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized; shared decision-making is essential here, and I should document the rationale and uncertainties clearly [^f9dfcbfa] [^80dd6a66].

> I should double-check special scenarios that could shift management. If imaging or clinical assessment suggests nodal disease or if final pathology reveals nodal involvement, the risk category changes and consideration of standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, and possibly pertuzumab if node-positive, becomes appropriate; conversely, if the patient is found to be HER2-low rather than HER2-positive, anti-HER2 therapy would not be indicated and management would follow HR-positive, HER2-negative pathways, underscoring the need for accurate HER2 testing and classification [^794dcd8b] [^99642c6d].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Confirm stage I, node-negative HER2-positive disease and HER2 status; proceed with definitive surgery; for low-risk T1a/b N0, offer paclitaxel plus trastuzumab for 12 weeks followed by trastuzumab to complete 1 year, with consideration of a 6-month total anti-HER2 duration in carefully selected low-risk cases; for T1c or patients with higher-risk features within stage I, consider standard chemotherapy plus 1 year of trastuzumab; monitor cardiac function at baseline, every 3 months during active therapy, and periodically thereafter; and engage in shared decision-making to incorporate patient preferences, comorbidities, and absolute risk-benefit considerations [^083f13ab] [^e98083ea] [^78b5adc6].

> Finally, I need to ensure the strength of evidence and guideline concordance are explicit. The paclitaxel–trastuzumab regimen is supported by prospective data and NCCN endorsement for low-risk stage I disease, while the broader benefit of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy is established by large randomized trials and meta-analyses; ESMO and ASCO endorse tailored anti-HER2 therapy with attention to duration and cardiac safety, reinforcing the de-escalation approach for appropriately selected stage I patients [^083f13ab] [^3c8543c9] [^53453698] [^04e8050b].

For stage 1 HER2-positive breast cancer, **upfront surgery** (breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy) is standard [^a0c821f1], followed by **adjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab** for 12 weeks, then trastuzumab to complete 1 year [^083f13ab] [^e98083ea]. This regimen balances efficacy and toxicity, with 10-year invasive disease-free survival of 91.3% and very low heart failure rates (0.5%) [^083f13ab]. For patients with higher-risk features (e.g. T1c, grade 3, or hormone receptor–negative), consider standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab [^04e8050b]; for low-risk T1a/b, node-negative cases, trastuzumab alone may be considered after shared decision-making [^f9dfcbfa]. Cardiac function should be monitored regularly during trastuzumab therapy [^78b5adc6] [^31301843].

---

## Surgical management

- **Primary surgery**: Upfront surgery is standard for stage 1 HER2-positive breast cancer, either breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with whole-breast radiation or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy [^a0c821f1] [^53453698].

- **Axillary evaluation**: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to assess nodal status, guiding adjuvant therapy decisions [^9505ad3a].

---

## Adjuvant systemic therapy

### Standard adjuvant therapy

The **paclitaxel plus trastuzumab regimen** is preferred for low-risk stage 1 HER2-positive disease (T1a/b, node-negative) [^083f13ab]: 12 weeks of paclitaxel with trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab to complete 1 year [^e98083ea]. This approach yields excellent long-term outcomes — 10-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) 91.3%, breast cancer-specific survival 98.8%, and overall survival 94.3% — with very low cardiotoxicity (heart failure 0.5%) [^083f13ab].

---

### Alternative adjuvant therapy

For higher-risk stage 1 disease (e.g. T1c, grade 3, or hormone receptor–negative), **standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab** is considered [^04e8050b]. Common regimens include docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide with trastuzumab, or anthracycline-based regimens (e.g. AC-T) with trastuzumab, balancing efficacy and cardiotoxicity [^88828eb7].

---

### Trastuzumab-only therapy

In select low-risk patients (T1a/b, node-negative, hormone receptor–positive), **trastuzumab alone** may be considered after shared decision-making, acknowledging limited evidence and the need for individualized assessment [^f9dfcbfa] [^80dd6a66].

---

## Cardiac monitoring

Regular **cardiac function assessment** is essential during trastuzumab therapy, with echocardiography or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans at baseline, every 3 months during treatment, and periodically after completion [^78b5adc6] [^31301843].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| T1a/b, node-negative, low-risk | Paclitaxel + trastuzumab for 12 weeks, then trastuzumab to complete 1 year [^083f13ab] |
| T1c, grade 3, or hormone receptor–negative | Standard chemotherapy + trastuzumab for 1 year [^04e8050b] |
| Very low-risk T1a/b, node-negative, hormone receptor–positive | Trastuzumab alone (after shared decision-making) [^f9dfcbfa] |

---

Stage 1 HER2-positive breast cancer is managed with **upfront surgery** followed by **adjuvant paclitaxel plus trastuzumab** for low-risk disease, with escalation to standard chemotherapy plus trastuzumab for higher-risk features. Regular cardiac monitoring is essential, and treatment should be individualized through shared decision-making.

### Evolving standards of care and new challenges in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer [^4f0b52f0]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) has rapidly evolved over the last 20 years. Major advances have led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of 7 HER2-targeted therapies for the treatment of early-stage and/or advanced-stage disease. Although oncologic outcomes continue to improve, most patients with advanced HER2-positive BC ultimately die of their disease because of primary or acquired resistance to therapy, and patients with HER2-positive early BC who have residual invasive disease after preoperative systemic therapy are at a higher risk of distant recurrence and death. The concept of treatment de-escalation and escalation is increasingly important to optimally tailor therapy for patients with HER2-positive BC and is a major focus of the current review. Research efforts in this regard are discussed as well as updates regarding the evolving standard of care in the (neo)adjuvant and metastatic settings, including the use of novel combination therapies. The authors also briefly discuss ongoing challenges in the management of HER2-positive BC (eg, intrinsic vs acquired drug resistance, the identification of predictive biomarkers, the integration of imaging techniques to guide clinical practice), and the treatment of HER2-positive brain metastases. Research aimed at superseding these challenges will be imperative to ensure continued progress in the management of HER2-positive BC going forward.

Amplification and/or overexpression of ERBB2, the gene encoding HER2, can be found in 15–20% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor clinical outcomes. Relentless research efforts in molecular biology and drug development have led to the implementation of several HER2-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, constituting one of the best examples of bench-to-bedside translation in oncology. Each individual drug class has improved patient outcomes and, importantly, the combinatorial and sequential use of different HER2-targeted therapies has increased cure rates in the early stage disease setting and substantially prolonged survival for patients with advanced-stage disease. In this Review, we describe key steps in the development of the modern paradigm for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer, including selecting and sequencing new-generation HER2-targeted therapies, and summarize efficacy and safety outcomes from pivotal studies. We then outline the factors that are currently known to be related to resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, such as HER2 intratumoural heterogeneity, activation of alternative signalling pathways and immune escape mechanisms, as well as potential strategies that might be used in the future to overcome this resistance and further improve patient outcomes.

### Management of small HER2-positive breast cancers [^80dd6a66]. The Lancet: Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Trastuzumab has revolutionised the treatment of HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer and is now standard of care in combination with chemotherapy for patients with tumours larger than 1 cm. However, 5 years after publication of the landmark trials establishing the efficacy of the drug, the management of small (≤ 1 cm), HER2-positive tumours remains difficult. Most small breast cancers have a good prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely recommended. However, retrospective data suggest that some small HER2-positive cancers might have a worse clinical outcome than others. This notion raises the key clinical question of whether patients with small HER2-positive cancers should be offered adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy. The pivotal adjuvant trastuzumab trials did not include patients with tumours smaller than 1 cm, but a subset analysis of one trial showed that patients with tumours 1–2 cm in size derived at least as much clinical benefit from 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab as did the overall cohort. Clinicians face the dilemma of whether the potential reduction in risk of recurrence in this patient group warrants the toxic effects and risks of adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab. In this review, we discuss the evidence for prognosis of small HER2-positive cancers, and for possible benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab. We suggest potential treatment strategies and clinical trial designs to address this important issue. On the basis of present evidence, we recommend that the benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab should be discussed with patients with small, HER2-positive breast cancer.

### Challenges in the management of advanced, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer [^fae45513]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer accounts for the majority-up to 80%-of all breast cancers. The evolution of breast cancer from early stage to the metastatic setting leads to increased heterogeneity, the occurrence of new mutations, and the development of treatment resistance representing a great challenge for management decisions. Unfortunately, little data exist to offer guidance in this context, and a reliance on traditional clinical parameters remains when deciding on optimal treatment. In advanced-stage oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) disease, ongoing issues include the choice between endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, the appropriate sequence of treatment agents, and the incorporation of biological agents, such as everolimus, into the treatment armamentarium. In metastatic disease, repeated biopsies can help to reassess the receptor or genetic mutational status; however, the evidence to support this approach is limited. In this Review, we examine the current evidence that can guide treatment decisions in patients with advanced-stage ER+ breast cancer, discuss how to tackle these therapeutic challenges and provide suggestions for the optimal management of this patient population.

### Management of HER2-positive breast cancer in Asia: consensus statement from the Asian oncology summit 2009 [^3fcb1a29]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients with breast cancer positive for human epidermal growth-factor receptor type 2 (HER2) are an important subgroup for consideration in the Asian context. Rationally designed, anti-HER2 targeted agents that can substantially improve treatment outcomes have become commercially available, but are still too costly for some groups in developed countries and for underdeveloped and developing nations. This review discusses the available evidence for optimum management of HER2-positive early and advanced breast cancer, and how this evidence can be applied to Asian countries with different levels of health-care resources and economic development — using framework provided by the Breast Health Global Initiative. We provide a brief overview of HER2 testing and discuss management of early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, and formulate a consensus statement for the management of breast cancer in the context of basic, limited, enhanced, and maximum health-care resource availability.

### Management of early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer [^5eb54490]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy dramatically improved the prognosis of early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. However, 15%-31% of patients still develop disease recurrence, on the basis of long-term follow-up of adjuvant pivotal trials. A better understanding of tumor biology has led to the development of optimized anti-HER2 drugs and add-on strategies to further improve survival outcomes. In the neoadjuvant setting, dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus chemotherapy has increased the rate of pathologic complete response, a surrogate marker of improved long-term outcome; yet, in the adjuvant setting, it has led to small benefits in invasive disease-free survival. Extended adjuvant therapy with the irreversible pan-HER2 inhibitor neratinib is an option for selected patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive disease who have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Additionally, the use of the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-emtansine has led to a significant improvement in invasive disease-free survival for patients with residual disease following neoadjuvant therapy and has taught us the importance of using preoperative therapy to adapt adjuvant treatment. Nevertheless, recurrences in the brain remain an important caveat, and not all patients benefit to the same extent from anti-HER2 therapies. Biologic heterogeneity within HER2-positive disease may modulate treatment response and prognosis. De-escalating treatment strategies to avoid unnecessary treatments and toxicities, without compromising outcomes, have become a crucial focus of research. To stratify patient risks and optimize treatment selection, other biomarkers including intrinsic subtype, level of HER2, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes should be further evaluated. We discuss the latest evidence on the current approach of early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer and present future perspectives on its management.

First-line Treatment Options Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Chemotherapy The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab and a single-agent chemotherapeutic should be the standard first-line treatment for most patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 extracellular domain II, which prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors and together with trastuzumab allow a more comprehensive signaling blockade. Median PFS in the lapatinib group was 8. 3 months. 23Based on all the accumulated evidence, dual HER2 blockade and endocrine therapy could be considered in the first-line setting in highly selected patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy and/or have very low tumor burden.

28Second, although no predictive biomarker has been validated today, high levels of HER2 protein or ERBB2 mRNA expression, or lack of HER2 intratumor heterogeneity, might help better select patients for T-DM1. 29Third, T-DM1 has also been evaluated in the first-line setting in the MARIANNE phase III trial. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors HER2-positive breast cancers usually contain high expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and present frequent expression of programmed cell death protein ligand 1. 51The combination was safe and six of 40 PD-L1-positive patients achieved an objective response. There were no objective responses among the PD-L1–negative patients. 51Moreover, 202 patients with HER2-positive pretreated metastatic breast cancer have been randomly assigned in KATE2 phase II trial to T-DM1 in combination with atezolizumab compared with T-DM1 alone. The results showed a trend for an improved PFS in patients with PD-L1–positive disease. 52The safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of each drug. Exploratory immune-related biomarkers in KATE2, such as PD-L1 gene expression, effector T-cell gene signature, CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, seemed to be associated with better PFS.

### ASO author reflections:' right-sizing' the treatment approach for small HER2 positive breast cancers [^029c7e82]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Present

Current guidelines recommend treatment with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) primarily for node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients, while stage I disease is generally managed with upfront surgery. This approach is echoed in the article, "trends in the management of small HER2 positive breast cancers", which highlights treatment patterns among patients with cT1N0 breast cancer. The use of NAT rose from 7.1% in 2018 to a peak of 30.2% in 2021, before declining to 9.1% in 2022. This fluctuation reflects the evolution in clinical practice influenced by key trial results that emphasize tailored treatment strategies for small HER2-positive tumors. Furthermore, adjuvant therapy over the study period tended to be less aggressive, potentially improving treatment adherence and completion rates. In addition, nodal upstaging after primary surgery in clinically node-negative patients occurred in 14.1% of cases, suggesting a limited benefit from treatment with NAT compared with surgery first.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in clinical practice for early-stage node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: challenges and considerations [^2f11513f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative breast cancer have traditionally relied on clinical and pathologic parameters. However, the molecular heterogeneity and the complex tumor genome demand more sophisticated approaches to the problem. Several multigene-based assays have been developed to better prognosticate the risk of recurrence and death and predict benefit of therapy in this patient population. Oncologists are often faced with the challenge of incorporating these various complex genome-based biomarkers along with the traditional biomarkers in clinical decision-making. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer are helpful in providing a general recommendation. However, uncertainty remains in the absence of definitive data for various clinical scenarios. This case report describes a postmenopausal woman with stage I breast cancer that is low-grade and ER-rich, and has an intermediate Oncotype DX recurrence score of 28.

### Chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab [^3af8980c]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The prognosis of pT1N0M0/stage I breast cancer has generally been considered so favourable that these patients are not routinely offered adjuvant systemic therapy. However, biological heterogeneity within pT1N0M0 dictates diverse outcomes within the subgroup. HER2 gene amplification or protein overexpression is uncommon in pT1N0M0 disease, but, when present, is clearly associated with a higher risk of recurrence. The role of anti-HER2 therapy in these patients is controversial. Few women with node-negative, small tumours were included in the adjuvant trastuzumab trials. There are no robust data on trastuzumab in this patient subset, although subgroup analyses suggest that proportional benefits are independent of T and N. With current guidelines and scheduling, committing to adjuvant trastuzumab involves concurrent chemotherapy, 1 year of treatment and potential cardiotoxicity. A further challenge with anti-HER2 therapy is the potential benefit in patients with demonstrable HER2 positivity within a predominantly HER2-negative tumour. The decision for therapy requires a yes/no answer, but HER2 status derives from a continuum of gene copy number and protein expression. The diagnostic threshold is made more complex by heterogeneity of the HER2 status within a tumour. This review focuses on available data for HER2-positive pT1N0M0 disease and explores the significance of intratumoural HER2 heterogeneity.

Locoregional treatment of cT1–3, cN0 or cN+, M0 disease — patients with early-stage operable breast cancer initially undergo upfront definitive surgery (BCS or mastectomy), and adjuvant systemic therapy if indicated, based on primary tumor characteristics. Some patients with early-stage operable HER2-positive or triple-negative disease may be treated with preoperative systemic therapy first, followed by surgery. Radiation is typically sequenced after definitive surgery and after systemic chemotherapy (if delivered). Several randomized trials document that mastectomy is equivalent to BCT, which includes BCS with WBRT with respect to OS as primary treatment for the majority of patients with stage I and stage II breast cancers (category 1). The optimal choice of surgery is based on a shared decision made by the patient and clinician after discussing benefits and risks of mastectomy versus BCT in regards to long-term survival, risk of local recurrence, and the impact on cosmetic outcome and overall QOL.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has recently emerged as a targetable subset of breast tumors, based on the evidence from clinical trials of novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. This evolution has raised several biological and clinical questions, warranting the establishment of consensus to optimally treat patients with HER2-low breast tumors. Between 2022 and 2023, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) held a virtual consensus-building process focused on HER2-low breast cancer. The consensus included a multidisciplinary panel of 32 leading experts in the management of breast cancer from nine different countries. The aim of the consensus was to develop statements on topics that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline. The main topics identified for discussion were (i) biology of HER2-low breast cancer; (ii) pathologic diagnosis of HER2-low breast cancer; (iii) clinical management of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer; and (iv) clinical trial design for HER2-low breast cancer. The expert panel was divided into four working groups to address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above. A review of the relevant scientific literature was conducted in advance. Consensus statements were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This article presents the developed statements, including findings from the expert panel discussions, expert opinion, and a summary of evidence supporting each statement.

### Current and future management of HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer [^24ab63e9]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed and/or amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers, conferring an aggressive tumor behavior but also an opportunity for targeted therapies. In the advanced setting, the prognosis of patients suffering from this disease has greatly improved after the introduction of new anti-HER2 drugs beyond trastuzumab. For most patients, a taxane combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the first-line setting, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine in second line, should be considered the standard of care today. However, chemo-free anti-HER2 strategies in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer could also be considered in selected patients. In the third-line setting and beyond, several emerging anti-HER2 therapies are becoming available, including tucatinib, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (DS-8201a), neratinib, and margetuximab-cmkb. In addition, new compounds and combinations are showing promising results in the late-line setting. The treatment landscape of HER2-positive advanced disease is evolving constantly, active drugs such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine are moving to early-stage, many biomarkers, including quantification of HER2 itself, are being explored to improve patient selection, and patient populations with specific needs are emerging, such as those with brain metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of the current and future management of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer stage at diagnosis, presentation, and patient management [^47aba32f]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in breast cancer management forcing clinicians to potentially alter treatment recommendations. This study compared breast cancer stage at diagnosis and rates of neoadjuvant therapy among women presenting to our institution before and during COVID-19.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis from March 2020-August 2020 (during-COVID-19) were compared with March 2019-August 2019 (pre-COVID-19). We compared stage at diagnosis, clinical/demographic features, and neoadjuvant therapy use between the time periods.

Results

A total of 573 patients included: 376 pre-COVID-19, 197 during-COVID-19. Method of cancer detection was by imaging in 66% versus 63% and by physical findings/symptoms in 34% versus 37% of patients comparing pre-COVID-19 to during-COVID-19, p = 0.47. Overall clinical prognostic stage did not differ significantly (p = 0.39) between the time periods, nor did cM1 disease (2% in each period); 23% pre-COVID-19 and 27% during-COVID-19 presented with cN+ disease (p = 0.38). Neoadjuvant therapy use was significantly higher during-COVID-19 (39%) versus pre-COVID-19 (29%, p = 0.02) driven by increased neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) use (7% to 16%, p = 0.002), whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy use did not change (22% vs. 23%, p = 0.72). In HR+/HER2- disease, NET use increased from 10% pre-COVID-19 to 23% during-COVID-19 (p = 0.001) with a significant increase in stage I patients (7 to 22%, p < 0.001) and nonsignificant increases in stage II (18 to 23%, p = 0.63) and stage III (9 to 29%, p = 0.29).

Conclusions

Breast cancer stage at diagnosis did not differ significantly during-COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19. More patients during-COVID-19 were treated with NET, which was significantly increased in stage I HR+/HER2- disease.

### Breast cancer [^a17287d2]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide and is curable in ~70–80% of patients with early-stage, non-metastatic disease. Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.

### Small HER2-positive, node-negative breast cancer: who should receive systemic adjuvant treatment? [^917ee489]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer with combined trastuzumab and chemotherapy has become standard in patients with HER2-positive tumors and a diameter of > 1 cm or positive lymph nodes. Currently, there are no data directly supporting the use of adjuvant treatment, including trastuzumab, in patients with HER2-positive tumors, a diameter of ≤ 1 cm and no nodal involvement (pT1a, bpN0M0). However, 6%-10% of these small tumors are HER2 positive, and there is good evidence for an inferior clinical outcome in these patients, with recurrence rates of up to 30% after 5–10 years. Assumed that the relative risk reduction is similar to larger tumors, the absolute benefit should be large enough to consider adjuvant treatment. This review addresses current data regarding the prognosis of small HER2-positive tumors and discusses potential factors to individualize adjuvant treatment in patients with small HER2-positive tumors.

### Optimal management of early and advanced HER2 breast cancer… [^408f1c77]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

The initial studies of HER2-positive breast cancer focused on advanced disease, in which a novel monoclonal antibody directed against HER2 was shown to have single-agent activity in tumors that overexpressed HER2. The TH3RESA study reported efficacy of T-DM1 for a heavily pretreated population, confirming the role of T-DM1 in advanced HER2-positive cancers. This randomized phase III study compared T-DM1 to physician's choice therapy and demonstrated an improved PFS of 6. 2 months for T-DM1 compared with
3. 3 months for physician's choice therapy. 26 In the first-line setting, a phase II study comparing T-DM1 to trastuzumab and docetaxel showed improvements in PFS of 14. 2 months for T-DM1 compared with
9. 2 months for trastuzumab, with an HR of 0.
59. Targeting of two pathways.

Laboratory studies suggested that angiogenic pathways were active in HER2-positive cancers, leading to the idea of targeting both VEGF and HER2. With approximately half of HER2-overexpressing cancers also being estrogen receptor –positive, endocrine and anti-HER2 agents are an obvious combination in the advanced setting. An initial phase II study was done with trastuzumab and letrozole, with a 3. 3-month PFS for the endocrine therapy alone and a
14. 1-month PFS for the anti-HER2 therapy and endocrine therapy. More recently, a number of studies have been initiated with checkpoint inhibitors and either trastuzumab or T-DM1 in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Preclinical laboratory work, as well as the demonstration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in HER2-positive breast cancer, has led to excitement in this area and a number of studies.

61Thus, in addition to evaluating a novel HER2-targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting, this study is addressing whether 2 years of HER2-targeted therapy improves outcomes compared with 1 year. A prespecified early analysis at the 2-year mark demonstrated that invasive DFS was significantly improved for patients who received neratinib, especially those with hormone receptor–coexpressing cancer.

### Management of early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^d21f5e1c]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Biologic heterogeneity within HER2-positive disease may modulate treatment response and prognosis. De-escalating treatment strategies to avoid unnecessary treatments and toxicities, without compromising outcomes, have become a crucial focus of research. To stratify patient risks and optimize treatment selection, other biomarkers including intrinsic subtype, level of HER2, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes should be further evaluated. We discuss the latest evidence on the current approach of early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer and present future perspectives on its management. A better understanding of tumor biology and HER2 signaling has led to the development of additional HER2-directed therapies including dual HER2 inhibition, which involves adding a second anti-HER2 therapy together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

Pertuzumab, another monoclonal antibody that binds to HER2 and prevents HER2/HER3 dimerization, one of the most powerful heterodimers that activates cell proliferation and survival, was the second anti-HER2 agent incorporated into the treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Escalation Strategies Patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer and higher risk of recurrence are generally defined as having tumors ≥ 2 cm and/or node-positive disease. Those patients should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, the presence of residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant treatment, ie, patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response, leads to increased risk of relapse.

As demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis with more than 3, 700 patients randomly assigned in 11 neoadjuvant trials, and at a median follow-up of 61 months, poor prognosis features at baseline such as tumor size and nodal status remain independent prognostic factors even after achieving a pCR. 32Therefore, most guidelines recommend continuing dual HER2 blockade to complete 1 year if available, in high-risk patients at baseline. 33–35. The results from the phase II PREDIX HER2 trial show that neoadjuvant T-DM1 for six cycles was associated with similar rates of pCR and less toxicity, as standard therapy with docetaxel, plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab. 40Overall, pCR was obtained in 46% of patients treated with DTP and 44% with T-DM1.

### Treatment of breast cancer [^9505ad3a]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after cancer treatment. This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.

### Treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: current status and future perspectives [^b76bcb69]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

The advent of HER2-directed therapies has significantly improved the outlook for patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer. However, a significant proportion of these patients still relapse and die of breast cancer. Trials to define, refine and optimize the use of the two approved HER2-targeted agents (trastuzumab and lapatinib) in patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer are ongoing. In addition, promising new approaches are being developed including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HER2 or other HER family members, antibodies linked to cytotoxic moieties or modified to improve their immunological function, immunostimulatory peptides, and targeting the PI3K and IGF-1R pathways. Improved understanding of the HER2 signaling pathway, its relationship with other signaling pathways and mechanisms of resistance has also led to the development of rational combination therapies and to a greater insight into treatment response in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Based on promising results with new agents in HER2-positive advanced-stage disease, a series of large trials in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings are planned or ongoing. This Review focuses on current treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and aims to update practicing clinicians on likely future developments in the treatment for this disease according to ongoing clinical trials and translational research.

### Improved survival of young patients with breast cancer 40 years and younger at diagnosis [^efdc3030]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our results indicate that the prognosis and outcome of young women with breast cancer improve with modern multidisciplinary management that includes neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, surgery, radiation, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy according to their tumor characteristics and stage. Newer modalities of treatment have more recently also shown improvement in the outcome and survival of patients with breast cancer. Clinical trials with the new anti-HER2 agents in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings and metastatic settings in HER2-positive disease, - cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors in the metastatic and adjuvant setting in hormone receptor–positive disease, immunotherapy in the metastatic and neoadjuvant setting in TNBC, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA mutationshave shown improvement in survival of patients with breast cancer.

In conclusion, we report high survival rates in young patients diagnosed below age 40 years with breast cancer treated with modern multidisciplinary management. We report survival rates of 89% at 5 years and 76% at 10 years. Best results are seen in patients with early breast cancer; patients with stages I and II had an OS of 96.0% at 5 years and 87.1% at 10 years, whereas patients with stage III had an OS of 77.0% at 5 years and 66.0% at 10 years.

Modern multidisciplinary management, guided by biology and modern therapies, can help us remove the stigma of poor prognosis in young women with breast cancer. Our data, coming from a LMIC, show that improvement is achievable everywhere when resources are available and treatment is accessible.

### Towards personalized treatment for early stage HER2-positive breast cancer [^05d502a5]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Advances in HER2-targeted therapies have improved the survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The standard-of-care treatment for localized disease has been chemotherapy and 1 year of adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy, typically with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. Despite the effectiveness of this treatment, disease relapse occurs in a subset of patients; thus, focus has been placed on escalating treatment by either combining different HER2-targeted agents or extending the duration of HER2-targeted therapy. Indeed, dual HER2-targeted therapies and extended-duration anti-HER2 therapy, as well as adjuvant therapy with the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1, have all been approved for clinical use. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that some patients do not derive sufficient benefit from these additional therapies to offset the associated toxicities and/or costs. Similarly, the universal use of chemotherapy might not benefit all patients, and treatment de-escalation through omission of chemotherapy has shown promise in clinical trials and is currently being explored further. The future of precision medicine should therefore involve tailoring of therapy based on the genetics and biology of each tumour and the clinical characteristics of each patient. Predictive biomarkers that enable the identification of patients who will benefit from either escalated or de-escalated treatment will be crucial to this approach. In this Review, we summarize the available HER2-targeted agents and associated mechanisms of resistance, and describe the current therapeutic landscape of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, focusing on strategies for treatment escalation or de-escalation.

### Management of advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer and brain metastases: ASCO guideline update… [^7b4fb275]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Recommendations Introduction 1With the development of HER2-targeted therapies, survival has improved for patients with both early-stage and metastatic breast cancers. HER2 positivity is a known risk factor for the development of brain metastases. Although only a small fraction of patients presenting with early-stage breast cancer will relapse with the brain as the first site of recurrence, up to 5% of patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy will present with CNS as the first site of relapse, and brain metastases are increasingly common in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with up to half of patients experiencing brain metastases over time. 2Therefore, there is an increasing need to optimize initial treatments for brain metastases as well as to develop strategies to manage subsequent intracranial progression events.

This guideline addresses what is known about the management of patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer and brain metastases. This guideline will not provide comprehensive recommendations for the management of non-CNS disease in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer or provide guidance on HER2 testing, other than noting that quality HER2 testing is required for appropriate identification and management of patients with HER2-positive disease. The ASCO clinical practice guideline on systemic therapy for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer accompanies this article, 3and the ASCO-College of American Pathologists issued a joint clinical practice guideline on HER2 testing in breast cancer. 4 5and the companion recommendations for systemic therapy. 3 Guideline Questions.

2Sperduto et al 2found that the worst survival in patients with breast cancer brain metastases were those with KPS ≤ 60, age ≤ 60 years, > 1 brain metastasis, active extracranial disease, and triple-negative histology. In some studies, although HER2-positive status was associated with relatively good survival among patients with breast cancer brain metastases, there was a shorter interval from diagnosis of primary breast cancer to the development of brain metastases in both patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and those with triple-negative breast cancer. 14The investigators showed the results of 398 patients who had received ≥ second-line systemic therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with BMs at baseline; 115 of 398 patients experienced disease progression because of new brain metastases. One hundred twenty-six of those participants had measurable brain lesions, in which overall response rate was 21. 4%.

It is important when treating a patient who has advanced breast cancer to establish the biologic characteristics of the tumor. In addition to knowing the hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone), human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) should be evaluated. The measurement of this parameter is essential to optimizing the systemic management. This article reviews the biology of HER2, testing for HER2, clinical studies evaluating HER2-based therapies, side effects (specifically cardiotoxicity), and strategies for HER2-based therapies.

Systemic therapy for both early-stage and metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer has seen significant evolution over the last 20 or more years. Innovative trials leveraging the prognostic and predictive information that neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides has led to preoperative systemic therapy becoming the overwhelmingly favored sequencing in the early-stage setting. However, deintensification of therapy is important to consider for patients with good-risk disease or significant comorbidities. Finally, with the abundance of newly approved agents, drug sequencing in the second-line setting has become an important and individualized decision for patients with metastatic disease.

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^3c8543c9]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).

Findings

Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14·4 months and median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5 to 11·9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0·66, 95% CI 0·62 to 0·71; p < 0·0001) and death from breast cancer (0·67, 0·61 to 0·73; p < 0·0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9·0% (95% CI 7·4 to 10·7; p < 0·0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6·4% (4·9 to 7·8; p < 0·0001), with a 6·5% reduction (5·0 to 8·0; p < 0·0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0·4%, –0·3 to 1·1; p = 0·35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0–1 after randomisation (0·53, 99% CI 0·46 to 0·61), with benefits persisting through years 2–4 (0·73, 0·62 to 0·85) and 5–9 (0·80, 0·64 to 1·01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5·7% [95% CI 3·1 to 8·3], 6·8% [4·7 to 9·0], and 10·7% [7·7 to 13·6] in N0, N1–3, and N4+ disease).

Interpretation

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.

### Systemic therapy for hormone receptor-positive / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early stage and metastatic breast cancer [^d400ec10]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

Hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer is defined by the presence of the estrogen receptor and/or the progesterone receptor and the absence of HER2 gene amplification. HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer accounts for 65%-70% of all breast cancers, and incidence increases with increasing age. Treatment varies by stage, and endocrine therapy is the mainstay of treatment in both early stage and late-stage disease. Combinations with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors have reduced distant recurrence in the early stage setting and improved overall survival in the metastatic setting. Chemotherapy is used based on stage and tumor biology in the early stage setting and after endocrine resistance for advanced disease. New therapies, including novel endocrine agents and antibody-drug conjugates, are now changing the treatment landscape. With the availability of new treatment options, it is important to define the optimal sequence of treatment to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing toxicity. In this review, the authors first discuss the pathologic and molecular features of HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and mechanisms of endocrine resistance. Then, they discuss current and emerging therapies for both early stage and metastatic HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, including treatment algorithms based on current data.

### Impact of timing of trastuzumab initiation on long-term outcome of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: the "one thousand HER2 patients" project [^a80951e1]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Neo-adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer has also been studied. In the NOAH trial, the incorporation of trastuzumab into an anthracycline-taxane neo-adjuvant regimen produced a higher rate of pathological complete response (pCR) and prolonged disease-free survival compared to the same pre-operative chemotherapy without trastuzumab.

Attempts to improve on the results of treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, have principally involved the incorporation of additional anti-HER2 drugs into existing regimens. There has been less focus on the possibility that optimised scheduling might improve outcomes. For example, the time interval between the initial diagnosis of breast cancer and the administration of the first dose of trastuzumab can vary hugely in clinical practice, ranging from a few weeks, in the case of neo-adjuvant early concomitant therapy, to over 6 months in the case of sequential adjuvant treatment. In two retrospective studies extreme delays in initiation of adjuvant trastuzumab, and delayed systemic therapy in general were both associated with inferior outcomes in HER2-positive disease. Neither study included neo-adjuvant treatments.

To date, no (neo)adjuvant trastuzumab-chemotherapy schedule has been proven to be superior to any other and no prospective or retrospective study has addressed neo-adjuvant trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy versus the same adjuvant therapy. In an attempt to address these issues we designed a study of all patients who were treated in our institution with anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive stages I-III breast cancer.

Neoadjuvant therapy to allow the delay of surgery.

The clinical management guidelines for BC were recently updated in the COVID-19 era. Clinical cases eligible for neoadjuvant treatment are, as follows:
TNBC, HER2-positive, and luminal B tumors ≥ 2 cm and/or with positive axilla (≥ N1).
Luminal A tumors stage T1-T2 and N0-N1 (neoadjuvant endocrine therapy [NET] may be recommended, especially in postmenopausal patients).
Inflammatory and locally advanced BC (NET or neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NCT]).
Any type — to complete NCT that has already been initiated.

Specifically, for estrogen receptor–positive and HER2-negative patients, both the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Cancer Society have stated that NET is an option to enable deferral of surgery by 6–12 months in clinical stage I or II BCs according to menopausal status. In addition, the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program has developed a guideline for BC management during the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of tumor biology and stage.

Although constraints are often present in terms of resources, workforce, and hospital bed availability in the COVID-19 pandemic, causing a delay in procedures, both NET and NCT appear to be safe choices to postpone surgery in nonurgent indications of estrogen receptor–positive early-stage BC, also potentially contributing to a reduction in outpatient visits.

When NCT is proposed, there is a suggestion for using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as support to diminish neutropenia. Regarding choices of chemotherapy regimens for early-stage BC, especially for TN, luminal B, and HER2-positive BCs, the recommendation is to follow the usual guidelines for these biologic subtypes. Chemotherapy schedules may be modified from weekly to every 3-week schedule, for example, to minimize hospital visits.

### Tailoring therapy to be just right in HER2-Positive early-stage breast cancer: the goldilocks problem | JCO oncology practice… [^fa92471f]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Historically, these drugs have been initially studied in patients with metastatic disease. Therapeutic candidates with encouraging antitumor activity are then investigated in the curative setting, leading to dramatically improved outcomes in some cases. Overall, although some HER2-positive breast cancers demonstrate profound sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies, others exhibit de novo or acquired resistance and resultant disease recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. Breast cancer clinicians and scientists have come to learn the hard way that not all HER2-positive breast cancers are alike. As expertly discussed by Pernas and Tolaney 1in the accompanying Review, recent advances in the field acknowledge this fact by using escalation strategies in high-risk patients and de-escalation strategies in low-risk patients. To date, risk stratification in HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer has relied primarily on clinical and pathologic staging, both pre- and post-treatment.

As illustrated in Figure 1 of the review, patients with suspected stage I disease are offered up-front surgery, followed by trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting if surgery confirms the clinical staging. Patients with clinical stage II or III breast cancers are offered neoadjuvant polychemotherapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. 2and high levels of HER2 heterogeneity 3are predictors of poor response to HER2-targeted therapy, whereas high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is a positive predictive marker. 4Efforts are underway to operationally define this population using a variety of novel approaches. For example, data from the PAMELA trial demonstrated that multiplex tools such as the PAM50 predict responsiveness to HER2-targeted therapies using gene signature analyses. 5Building on this, the ELPIS trial plans to enroll patients with stage I breast cancers that are HER2-enriched according to the PAM50 score, piloting the complete omission of surgery in patients without evidence of residual disease after neoadjuvant paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab.

### Proposed treatment guidelines for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Europe [^e6c268b8]. Annals of Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed/amplified in 20%-30% of human breast tumors and is a marker for a poor prognosis. For these reasons, HER2 has been selected as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. Oncologists can no longer ignore the importance of HER2 status for treatment algorithms in breast cancer. In light of the consequences of HER2 status on treatment selection, further research is warranted to refine and standardize HER2 testing in order to minimize false-negative results and optimize selection of treatment pathways. The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) trastuzumab (Herceptin) has proven valuable in treating HER2-positive, advanced-disease patients. and the availability of this novel biologic agent has important implications for clinical practice. This review describes a set of guidelines based on the current options for treatment of breast cancer. Two important factors have been taken into account in compiling these recommendations: (1) the lack of level I evidence to convincingly demonstrate the value of HER2 as a predictive marker for resistance or sensitivity to chemo- and hormonal therapy, and (2) the recently published pivotal phase II and III trial data proving the efficacy of trastuzumab as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

NCCN invasive breast cancer — systemic treatment of recurrent unresectable (local or regional) or stage IV (M1) disease: ER- and/or PR-negative; HER2-positive — includes Systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy, then Continue therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity and See BINV-28 for Principles of Survivorship, followed by Alternate systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy until progression. Most patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy to palliate advanced breast cancer, and at each reassessment clinicians should assess value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Consider no further HER2-targeted therapy and continue supportive care; The potential side effects of additional lines of therapy may outweigh any clinical benefit in a patient who has a compromised performance status. Patient preference must be taken into account. The optimal duration of trastuzumab in patients with long-term control of disease is unknown. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^5a460d0f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy — continuation and maintenance: If a patient is receiving HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy combinations, the chemotherapy should continue for approximately 4–6 months (or longer) and/or to the time of maximal response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. When chemotherapy is stopped, clinicians should continue the HER2-targeted therapy; no further change in the regimen is needed until the time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: Intermediate; Strength of recommendation: Moderate.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy for breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^1ee0efe9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer (neoadjuvant therapy, HR+ HER2-), ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor to increase locoregional treatment options in postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2- disease. Consider offering endocrine therapy for disease control if surgery is not intended.

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^19a09d8e]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Results

Individual patient-level data were obtained from all seven identified, relevant trials (table), providing data for 13 864 women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer who had been randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus trastuzumab or chemotherapy alone between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Of these women, 3685 (26·6%) had breast cancer recurrence. 2738 (19·7%) deaths occurred, of which 347 (12·7%) were from causes unrelated to breast cancer and without recorded disease recurrence. Median follow-up was 10·7 years (IQR 9·5–11·9). Trial inclusion criteria were HER2-positive tumours, with most trials requiring that these should be either lymph node-positive or high-risk if node-negative (generally defined as grade 3, tumour > 1 cm if ER-negative or > 2 cm if ER-positive; table). HER2 status was based on local immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in-situ hybridisation testing, with some studies requiring central laboratory confirmation.
