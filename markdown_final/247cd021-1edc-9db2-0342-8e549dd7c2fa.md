## Question

58 yo F with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low-dose prednisone presents with fever, hypotension (BP 90/60), and malaise. Blood cultures pending. You consider empiric antibiotics and plan to give IV ceftriaxone 2g and IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for broad coverage, including possible *Pneumocystis jiroveci* pneumonia, as she is immunosuppressed. No known sulfa allergy. Labs: Na 135, K 4.9, Cr 1.2, WBC 2.2, platelets 85K, LFTs mild elevation. Start ceftriaxone and TMP-SMX?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to start empiric IV ceftriaxone 2 g and IV trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for a 58-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and low-dose prednisone who presents with fever, hypotension, and malaise, and how to weigh risks, benefits, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this is sepsis or septic shock. Then, I should verify the appropriateness of ceftriaxone for empiric coverage. Next, I will examine the indication and dosing of TMP-SMX for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and whether it is justified empirically here. After that, I need to check for drug–drug interactions, especially with methotrexate, and assess hematologic and renal risks. Finally, I will consider alternatives, monitoring, and a practical, risk-mitigated plan with de-escalation triggers [^e85a83bf] [^13a53ace].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Fever with hypotension in an immunocompromised host meets criteria for sepsis and raises concern for septic shock; in this setting, empiric antibiotics should not be delayed while awaiting cultures, and early broad-spectrum therapy improves outcomes when infection is likely, with a commitment to de-escalation once data return [^e85a83bf] [^13a53ace].

> Now, ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily is reasonable empiric coverage for community-acquired sepsis in many adults, covering common gram-negatives and streptococci; I should confirm local epidemiology and resistance patterns, but as initial monotherapy for suspected community-acquired sepsis without specific risk factors for MRSA or resistant gram-negatives, this is appropriate and aligns with sepsis principles and CAP/HAP guidance for early-onset, low-risk scenarios, with escalation if risk factors emerge or the patient deteriorates [^13a53ace] [^f3cb627a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TMP-SMX. I initially thought to add it for PCP coverage because she is immunosuppressed, but wait, let me verify the indication and dose. TMP-SMX for PCP treatment is dosed at 15–20 mg/kg/day of the trimethoprim component in divided doses, typically for 21 days, and is reserved for confirmed or strongly suspected PCP with compatible respiratory findings; using it empirically for sepsis without respiratory involvement is not indicated and exposes the patient to harm [^13816686] [^04c5250e].

> I need to check the drug–drug interaction with methotrexate. TMP-SMX can inhibit renal tubular secretion and compete for protein binding, increasing methotrexate levels and risking myelosuppression; case reports and observational data describe cytopenias with concomitant TMP-SMX, and FDA labeling warns of blood dyscrasias and marrow suppression, so combining them in an already cytopenic patient is risky and generally avoided unless the indication is compelling [^57ba47ed] [^52069a06] [^5eb86b8f].

> Next, I should review hematologic risk. The patient has leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which heightens vulnerability to drug-induced marrow suppression; TMP-SMX is associated with agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and her baseline cytopenias lower the threshold for clinically significant toxicity, reinforcing the need to avoid TMP-SMX unless clearly indicated for PCP or another proven target [^52069a06] [^5eb86b8f].

> Let me consider renal and electrolyte risks. With creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, she has mild renal impairment; TMP-SMX can cause hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, and high-dose regimens increase these risks, so even if PCP were suspected, I would need close electrolyte and renal monitoring and dose adjustment, which is harder to justify empirically without a respiratory target [^52069a06] [^5eb86b8f].

> But wait, what if the concern is truly PCP because of immunosuppression and steroids? I should double-check the pretest probability. In the absence of dyspnea, hypoxemia, or diffuse interstitial pneumonia on exam or imaging, empiric PCP therapy is not warranted; if respiratory symptoms or hypoxia emerge, I would obtain a chest CT and induced sputum or bronchoscopy with DFA or PCR, and only then initiate TMP-SMX at treatment doses with adjunctive steroids if severe, while monitoring closely for marrow toxicity and drug interactions [^13816686] [^04c5250e].

> I will now examine alternatives for PCP prophylaxis if the risk is high enough to warrant prevention rather than treatment. For patients on high-dose glucocorticoids, especially with additional immunosuppressants, guidelines suggest considering PCP prophylaxis with TMP-SMX at lower prophylactic doses, but given her cytopenias and methotrexate co-therapy, I would favor an alternative such as atovaquone or inhaled pentamidine, balancing efficacy and toxicity, and reassessing risk as steroids are tapered [^f398b480] [^e8066e46] [^62c19df2].

> Next, I should review the overall empiric plan and de-escalation strategy. Ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily is appropriate initial therapy for community-acquired sepsis while cultures are pending; I should add vancomycin if there are risk factors for MRSA or if local epidemiology warrants it, and broaden gram-negative coverage if there are risks for resistant organisms or if the patient deteriorates; once cultures and clinical data return, I must narrow or stop antibiotics to minimize resistance and toxicity [^13a53ace] [^e85a83bf].

> Final decision: I should not start TMP-SMX empirically here because there is no clinical evidence of PCP, the patient has baseline cytopenias, and there is a meaningful risk of methotrexate interaction and marrow suppression; instead, I will start ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily now, escalate empiric therapy only if indicated by evolving risk factors or clinical status, and immediately evaluate for a respiratory source if symptoms suggest PCP, at which point I would initiate guideline-concordant TMP-SMX treatment with close monitoring and consider prophylactic alternatives if the risk profile warrants prevention rather than treatment [^13816686] [^e85a83bf] [^f398b480].

Do not start TMP-SMX empirically in this patient. The combination of **methotrexate and TMP-SMX** increases the risk of severe myelosuppression, and the patient already has leukopenia and thrombocytopenia [^57ba47ed] [^52069a06]. TMP-SMX is also contraindicated in severe renal impairment and can cause hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, which are especially dangerous in immunocompromised patients [^31f5252f] [^52069a06]. Ceftriaxone alone is appropriate empiric coverage for sepsis in RA; add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present, and reserve TMP-SMX only if PCP is confirmed or strongly suspected with compatible clinical and radiographic findings [^13a53ace] [^13816686].

---

## Pharmacological interactions and risks

### Methotrexate and TMP-SMX interaction

- **Myelosuppression risk**: TMP-SMX inhibits renal tubular secretion and hepatic metabolism of methotrexate, increasing methotrexate levels and causing severe myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia) [^57ba47ed] [^e32274b0].
- **Clinical evidence**: Multiple case reports and observational studies document significant cytopenias when TMP-SMX is combined with methotrexate [^57ba47ed] [^e32274b0].
- **Current cytopenias**: The patient already has WBC 2.2 × 10⁹/L and platelets 85 × 10⁹/L, increasing the risk of life-threatening marrow suppression.

---

### Additional risks of TMP-SMX in this patient

- **Renal impairment**: TMP-SMX can cause hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and crystalluria, and is contraindicated in severe renal impairment; the patient's creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL suggests mild impairment, increasing adverse event risk [^52069a06] [^31f5252f].
- **Severe adverse reactions**: TMP-SMX is associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, and aseptic meningitis, which are more frequent in immunocompromised patients [^52069a06] [^6b896a67].
- **Hemolysis**: Risk in G6PD deficiency, which should be considered in patients with anemia or jaundice [^52069a06].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Avoid combination**: Guidelines and expert reviews advise avoiding TMP-SMX with methotrexate due to significant myelosuppression risk [^e32274b0].
- **Alternative prophylaxis**: If PCP prophylaxis is needed, consider atovaquone or inhaled pentamidine, especially with cytopenias or renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Empiric therapy**: For sepsis in immunocompromised patients, ceftriaxone alone is appropriate initial therapy; add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present, and reserve TMP-SMX for confirmed or strongly suspected PCP [^13a53ace] [^13816686].

---

## Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen

Given the patient's immunocompromised state, current cytopenias, and renal function, the following regimen is recommended:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | 2 g IV every 24 hours | Broad-spectrum coverage for common sepsis pathogens; minimal renal adjustment; no significant interaction with methotrexate |
| Vancomycin | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours (adjust based on renal function) | Add if MRSA risk factors are present (e.g. prior MRSA, recent hospitalization, chronic wounds) |

---

## Monitoring and adjustments

- **Close monitoring**: Track CBC, renal function, and electrolytes every 48–72 hours initially, given cytopenias and renal impairment.
- **Clinical reassessment**: Re-evaluate at 48–72 hours; de-escalate antibiotics based on cultures and clinical response [^e85a83bf].
- **PCP evaluation**: If respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, or compatible imaging emerge, obtain chest imaging and consider bronchoscopy; start TMP-SMX only if PCP is confirmed or strongly suspected, with close hematologic monitoring [^13816686].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not start TMP-SMX empirically in this patient because of the **high risk of severe myelosuppression** from interaction with methotrexate, existing cytopenias, and additional risks of renal and hematologic toxicity. Use ceftriaxone alone for empiric coverage, add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present, and reserve TMP-SMX for confirmed or strongly suspected PCP with careful monitoring.

Q fever treatment and management—summary recommendations state that because of the delay in seroconversion often necessary to confirm diagnosis, antibiotic treatment should never be withheld pending laboratory test results or discontinued on the basis of a negative acute specimen, and in contrast, treatment of chronic Q fever should be initiated only after diagnostic confirmation. Treatment for acute or chronic Q fever should only be provided for patients with clinically compatible cases and not based on elevated serologic titers alone. Doxycycline is the drug of choice, and 2 weeks of treatment is recommended for adults, children aged ≥8 years, and for severe infections in patients of any age. Children aged <8 years with uncomplicated illness may be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole or a shorter duration (5 days) of doxycycline. Women who are pregnant when acute Q fever is diagnosed should be treated with trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole throughout the duration of pregnancy. Serologic monitoring is recommended after an acute Q fever infection to assess possible progression to chronic infection, and the recommended schedule for monitoring is based on the patient’s risk for chronic infection.

Patient B

An adolescent girl sought medical advice regarding years of muscle and joint pain, backaches, headaches, and lethargy. She had received a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but sought a second opinion from an alternative medicine clinic and was told she had chronic Lyme disease. The patient was treated with oral antibiotics, including rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline, for 3 months; these were discontinued because of abnormal liver enzyme test results Three months later, a PICC was placed to administer IV antibiotics, including ceftriaxone. After receiving both IV and oral antibiotic therapy for 5 months without improvement, the antibiotics were discontinued, but the PICC was not removed.

One week after antibiotics had been discontinued, the patient developed pallor, chills, and fever to 102.9°F (39.4°C); after consultation with the alternative medicine clinic, she was given another dose of ceftriaxone through the PICC. Later that day she was evaluated in an emergency department with fever to 105.3°F (40.7°C), hypotension, and tachycardia consistent with septic shock. Blood and PICC tip cultures grew Acinetobacter spp. She was hospitalized in an intensive care unit and required vasopressors as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection. The PICC was removed, and the patient was eventually discharged after several weeks of hospitalization.

### Serious infections with antirheumatic therapy: are biologicals worse? [^ac8be94a]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current evidence for the role of antirheumatic therapy in the development of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prednisone is clearly associated with increased infectious risk, but no definitive data link methotrexate to infection. Emerging data suggest that biological agents also pose increase infectious risk, particularly when used in combination with corticosteroids or methotrexate. Further research is needed in this important aspect of RA treatment. In the meantime, the author recommends that physicians should remain vigilant for serious infections in their patients with RA and use appropriate vaccines and screening procedures to mitigate their risk.

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive hyperinflammatory haematological condition often associated with malignancy, infection or rheumatological disorders. HLH has rarely been associated with medications, including antibiotics. We describe a case of a patient without significant medical history who presented with HLH following treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Additionally, we will discuss the possible mechanism of medication-induced HLH as well as the successful use of dexamethasone as the sole treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease is critical and medication-induced HLH should be considered in cases without a clear aetiology. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of TMP/SMX-induced HLH that was successfully treated with steroid monotherapy and just the second case report of TMP/SMX-induced HLH.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [^b158a655]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia : Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

Crystalluria : During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are “slow acetylators” may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old female with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with weekly methotrexate, type 2 diabetes mellitus, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and two previously documented COVID-19 infections (most recently documented 6 months prior) presented to the emergency department with one week of dyspnea and malaise after a trip to the Gulf Shores. She had a COVID-19 exposure and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting three days prior to admission. In the emergency department her initial vital signs demonstrated an oxygen saturation of 72% on room air, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 76/50 mmHg, and a temperature of 98.2 F. Her initial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell count of 13.7 10 3 /µL, serum creatinine of 2.3 m/dL, procalcitonin of 6.4 ng/mL and a lactic acid level of 8.8 mmol/L. Legionella urine antigen was not tested. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse bilateral consolidations concerning for multifocal pneumonia. She was resuscitated with IV fluids and a norepinephrine infusion was started for persistent hypotension and shock. She received supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather face mask and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) were initiated. Due to the severity of her critical illness, she was transferred by helicopter to a tertiary care center for further management.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was fever clearance time (FCT): that is, the time from the first dose of the study drug until a temperature of ≤37.5°C was recorded for at least 48 hours.

The secondary endpoint was treatment failure, defined as the occurrence of at least 1 of the following events: FCT >7 days (168 hours) after treatment initiation; clinical failure and requirement for rescue treatment as judged by the study physician and the attending physician; blood culture positive for S. Typhi or paratyphoid fever on day 7 of treatment (microbiological failure); culture-confirmed or syndromic enteric fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment; development of any complication (eg, clinically significant bleeding, decline in Glasgow Coma Scale, perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, and need for hospital admission within 28 days after the initiation of treatment). The time to treatment failure was defined as the time from the first dose of treatment until the date of the earliest failure event. Adverse events were also secondary endpoints and defined as grade 3/4 adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events of any grade leading to modification of study drug dose, or interruption/early discontinuation.

Patients who met the criteria for treatment failure were given intravenous ceftriaxone 60 mg/kg once daily (maximum dose 2 g/day) for 7 days if they had culture-confirmed enteric fever. Those with sterile blood cultures were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 60 mg/kg once daily (maximum dose 2 g/day) and oral doxycycline (4 mg/kg/day) in 2 divided doses (maximum 200 mg/day) for 7 days.

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions

Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products,(see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Respiratory Tract Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment.

Respiratory Failure 

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to weeks of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole products in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions 

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim immediately and institute appropriate management.

### Infections in older adults [^10835c98]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Infections in elderly patients can prove diagnostically challenging. Age-related factors affecting the immune system in older individuals contribute to nonspecific presentations. Other age-related factors and chronic conditions have symptoms that may or may not point to an infectious diagnosis. Delay in administration of antimicrobials can lead to poor outcomes; however, unnecessary administration of antimicrobials can lead to increased morbidity and contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms. Careful clinical assessment and consideration of patient history and risk factors is crucial.

### A rare case of pulmonary toxoplasmosis in a patient with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis on chronic methotrexate and corticosteroid therapy [^06805342]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary toxoplasmosis is a serious pulmonary condition caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii It typically affects immunocompromised patients presenting acutely with cough, fever, myalgias, arthralgias and lymphadenopathy, and chronically with persistent cough and dyspnoea. Because of its protean features, it can mimic many more common lung conditions in the immunocompromised patient, including atypical pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia and interstitial lung disease. In this article, we present the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented to our hospital with persistent dyspnoea and cough, initially suspected to have an arthritis-related interstitial lung disease. She received a final diagnosis of pulmonary toxoplasmosis after lung biopsy demonstrated Toxoplasma cysts, later confirmed by serology. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resulted in significant improvement of her respiratory symptoms after 3 months.

A 70-year-old woman, resident of a nursing home presented with complaints of fever for 1 day. Initial history, physical examination and laboratory tests were consistent with the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome; blood culture from peripheral and central perm catheter were sent. Patient was started on empiric antibiotics and aggressive hydration. Blood cultures from peripheral access and central perm catheter grew Elisabethkingia meningoseptica on the second day. Patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for septic shock where patient needed vasopressors. Antibiotics were switched to intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, perm catheter was removed and catheter tip culture was sent. Catheter tip grew E meningoseptica (45 colony forming units). Patient showed excellent treatment response to intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and was weaned off pressors on day 4 with uneventful stay afterwards.

Case Presentation

A 54-year-old Indian woman presented with low-grade fever and cough with expectoration for 1 month. Fever was not associated with any chills or night sweats. Expectoration was minimal in amount and mucoid in nature. Her appetite was decreased, without any significant weight loss. She denied any history of dyspnea or hemoptysis. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 1 year previously and was initially started on methotrexate and short-term glucocorticoids. At the time of presentation, she was taking methotrexate 15 mg weekly and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. Her joint disease was controlled on immunomodulators. She had no other comorbid condition, and she was a never smoker. She neither traveled within or outside India in the past nor came in contact with patients with pulmonary TB. A chest radiograph was done because a prior workup showed an ill-defined solitary nodular lesion in the right lower zone. She took a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate, but that was of no benefit.

### Management of rheumatoid arthritis: update from ACR-AAFP (...) [^5b5f8c18]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Initial Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis For patients without previous DMARD use, treatment recommendations are stratified by disease activity using patient ratings and inflammation measures. Moderate to High Disease Activity With moderate to high disease activity, methotrexate is the best initial treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate has stronger evidence of disease-modifying activity than the other csDMARDs, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. Although some bDMARDs and tsDMARDs have evidence of better outcomes, methotrexate is safe and effective, with convenient dosing and low cost. Combination therapy is not recommended for initial treatment because it is unnecessary for many patients and incurs higher toxicity and cost. Recommendations for methotrexate therapy are summarized in.

|If symptoms do not improve sufficiently with oral methotrexate, switch to subcutaneous methotrexate before changing or adding medications| Neither short- nor long-term glucocorticoid therapy is recommended as standard initial treatment, although some patients may require short-term glucocorticoid therapy in addition to DMARDs to aid with symptom control. Adjusting Antirheumatic Therapy For patients without adequate symptom control on methotrexate alone, another medication should be added. Studies demonstrate that triple therapy, a combination of methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine, is as effective as adding a bDMARD or tsDMARD. The ACR recommends adding a bDMARD or tsDMARD based on a more rapid improvement in symptoms and the greater persistence of therapy in observational studies. Yet, the cost of triple therapy is significantly less and may be appropriate for some patients.

For patients taking triple therapy, discontinuing sulfasalazine should be considered before hydroxychloroquine. If patients are taking methotrexate and a bDMARD or tsDMARD, tapering methotrexate should be considered first because the bDMARD or tsDMARD was added after methotrexate alone was ineffective. Coexisting Conditions For patients with subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules, methotrexate is recommended as initial therapy unless nodules progress. Switching to a different DMARD is then recommended. Although preexisting lung disease is a risk factor for methotrexate-related pneumonitis, the risk is uncertain and other therapies can also worsen lung disease. Methotrexate is recommended with careful monitoring.

Case report

A 46-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (treated with infliximab, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine), latent tuberculosis (treated 6 years prior), hypertension, and osteoporosis presented for evaluation of a left lower extremity pretibial ulceration. Physical examination of the left pretibial leg revealed a 1.5 cm ulcer with a violaceous border and overlying yellow heme-crusted fibrinous exudate (Fig 1). The patient was initially treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and levofloxacin. After the polymerase chain reaction results from the National Jewish Medical Center identified M. chelonae, the patient was transitioned to clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 6 months. 1 month after the resolution of her left lower extremity ulcer (Fig 1), a new ulcer developed superior to the previous ulcer (Fig 1), which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction as M. immunogenum.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^52069a06]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra): 
- Antimicrobial resistance: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- Blood dyscrasias: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- Crystalluria: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- Decreased blood glucose: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- Decreased platelet count: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- Decreased serum sodium: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- Hemolysis: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- Hepatic necrosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- Increased risk of adverse events: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- Increased serum potassium: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- Infusion-related reactions: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim infusion can cause local irritation and inflammation in cases of extravasation.
- Lung injury: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- Metabolic acidosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains propylene glycol as a solvent, which at high doses can cause metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis.
- Severe cutaneous adverse reactions: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.
- Sulfite sensitivity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions in susceptible patients.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and acute respiratory failure in adolescents and young adults [^07f8f71f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) associated with an increased 30-day risk of hospital visits for acute respiratory failure among healthy adolescents and young adults compared with amoxicillin or cephalosporins?

Findings

In this cohort study of adolescents and young adults aged 10 to younger than 25 years in Ontario, Canada, initiation of TMP-SMX was associated with a significantly higher 30-day risk of a hospital visit for acute respiratory failure compared with amoxicillin and cephalosporins. The absolute risk increase was small (0.02%) but consistent across sensitivity analyses.

Meaning

These findings support the US Food and Drug Administration’s warning regarding the risk of acute respiratory failure with TMP-SMX in healthy adolescents and young adults, and clinicians and regulators should carefully weigh this risk when prescribing TMP-SMX and consider updates to prescribing guidelines and product labeling.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^13a53ace]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

Clostridium difficile—first choice oral vancomycin; alternative fidaxomicin, with the comment that “Fidaxomicin not currently recommended for people <18 years of age” and that metronidazole remains acceptable for nonsevere Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children and as a second-line agent for adults with nonsevere CDI. Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica—antimicrobial therapy is usually not indicated for uncomplicated infection; therapy should be considered for groups at increased risk for invasive infection (neonates up to 3 months old; persons >50 years old with suspected atherosclerosis; persons with immunosuppression, cardiac disease, or significant joint disease). Salmonella enterica Typhi or Paratyphi—first choice ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin; alternatives include ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or azithromycin. Shigella—first choice azithromycin or ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone; alternatives include TMP-SMX or ampicillin if susceptible, and clinicians should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 µg/ml or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible. Most clinical laboratories do not test for azithromycin susceptibility.

Gonococcal acute bacterial arthritis—N. gonorrhoeae is not an uncommon pathogen among adolescents with ABA; parenteral therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin, typically ceftriaxone, should be started, and oral therapy generally should be considered only after antibiotic susceptibility data are available. Due to increasing resistance, cefixime is no longer routinely recommended, though oral options may include high dose oral cefixime or a fluoroquinolone if susceptibility has been documented; although routine fluoroquinolone use is not usually recommended in children < 18 years old because of toxicity concerns, use in this circumstance is appropriate, and when gonococcal infection is documented, evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections including HIV and syphilis is warranted.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^13816686]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment—first-line TMP-SMX and adjuncts: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI), and outpatient oral TMP-SMX is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease (AI); lower doses may also be effective though randomized controlled data are unavailable, and the dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens, and leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on outcome is uncertain. Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). In moderate-to-severe disease—defined by room air PaO2 <70 mmHg or A-a (alveolar-arterial) gradient ≥35 mmHg—patients should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^e70b635b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever in adults—The majority of acute Q fever cases resolve spontaneously within 2–3 weeks, even without treatment, but symptomatic patients with confirmed or suspected acute Q fever, including children with severe illness, should be treated with doxycycline. Doxycycline is the most effective treatment for Q fever, and treatment is most effective when given in the first 3 days of symptoms, shortens the illness, and reduces the risk for severe complications. If doxycycline is contraindicated because of allergies, other antibiotic regimens that can be used include moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin. Treatment for acute Q fever is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons or for those whose symptoms have resolved, although it might be considered in those at high risk for developing chronic Q fever; in one study, those who eventually had chronic Q fever were more likely to have not received appropriate doxycycline treatment during their acute illness. Patients with acute Q fever should undergo a careful clinical assessment to determine whether they might be at risk for progression to chronic Q fever, including review of possible immunosuppressive conditions, pregnancy testing when appropriate, and assessment for vascular and heart valve defects because certain valvular lesions might not be detectable by auscultation.

### Principles of antibiotic therapy in severe infections: optimizing the therapeutic approach by use of laboratory and clinical data [^cf7930c6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasingly daunting problem of antimicrobial resistance has led to an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, as well as on the bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrum empirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves de-escalation of therapy or even its discontinuation.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced aseptic meningitis-not just another sulfa allergy [^6b896b67]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)-induced aseptic meningitis (TSIAM) and discuss the features, possible mechanisms, evaluation, and treatment options relevant for the allergist.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed using the terms aseptic meningitis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole.

Study Selections

Cases were included that fit the case definition of headache, neck pain, or change in mental status with elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count or protein attributable to TMP-SMX or either medication alone.

Results

Forty-one patient cases were reviewed. There was a predominance of female patients and patients with autoimmune disease reported. Fever, headache, neck pain, and altered mental status were the most common findings reported in TSIAM reactions. Severe reactions ranged from hypotension to seizure and unconsciousness or coma. Typical cerebrospinal fluid findings included elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, elevated protein, and normal glucose. Symptoms quickly remitted with withdrawal of TMP-SMX, typically over 48 to 72 hours. Full recovery was typically experienced, although permanent paraplegia was reported in 1 case. The mechanism of reaction is unknown, although an IgE-mediated reaction is unlikely. Many patients experienced multiple TSIAM reactions before the diagnosis was made. Diagnosis can be confirmed with drug challenge or graded test dosing when necessary. Patients with TSIAM subsequently reacted to TMP and SMX alone and therefore should be advised to avoid these 2 classes of medication after diagnosis.

Conclusion

TMP-SMX is the most common antibiotic to cause drug-induced aseptic meningitis. By being aware of this reaction, allergists are well poised to diagnose TSIAM and prevent future reoccurrences for the patient.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^4dfb9d73]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile .

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Adjunctive treatment with Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia

Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in a randomized placebo controlled trial4. Co-administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and leucovorin during treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be avoided.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra): 
- Antimicrobial resistance: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- Blood dyscrasias: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- Crystalluria: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- Decreased blood glucose: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- Decreased platelet count: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- Decreased serum sodium: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- Hemolysis: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- Hepatic necrosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- Increased risk of adverse events: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- Increased serum potassium: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- Lung injury: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- Severe cutaneous adverse reactions: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.

Precautions and contraindications

Contraindications to the TMP–SMX prophylaxis must be considered: documented hypersensitivity, megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deficiency, severe renal impairment and porphyria. Caution must also be exercised in patients with impaired renal function, impaired hepatic function, severe drug allergies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or blood dyscrasias. The potential for myelosuppression or drug interactions may necessitate consideration of an alternative prophylactic agent.

Myelosuppression has been associated with TMP–SMX use in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Conversely, in a study of adult patients with acute leukaemia, no significant difference in myelosuppression was found when TMP–SMX (1 double strength tablet twice daily) was compared with placebo. The original reports of efficacy of TMP–SMX for prophylaxis did not demonstrate significant myelosuppression. However, when used for prophylaxis against bacteraemia following autologous bone marrow transplantation, the time to neutrophil recovery is significantly longer in patients receiving TMP–SMX, compared to patients receiving ciprofloxacin. We recommend that an alternative prophylactic agent be used in at-risk patients with expected myelosuppression >7 days (Table 3).

In patients receiving chemotherapy with methotrexate, pancytopenia may occur if prophylactic TMP–SMX is used concurrently. The sulphamethoxazole component may increase toxicity of methotrexate by displacement from binding sites or reduced renal excretion (;). Small studies of children with acute leukaemia have demonstrated both increased free methotrexate and no change in plasma concentration of methotrexate when co-administered with TMP–SMX. In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with up to 25 mg methotrexate per week who received TMP–SMX prophylaxis, no patient developed myelosuppression. Conversely, there are a number of case reports of significant adverse events with the combination (;;;). We therefore recommend an alternative prophylactic agent in the setting of concurrent methotrexate therapy (Table 3).

Prophylaxis with TMP–SMX may not be tolerated in patients with advanced malignancy and reduced oral intake due to nausea or dysphagia. This may not have been a significant contributor to duration of prophylaxis in our series as only one out of 13 cases of PCP were utilising palliative care services at the time of diagnosis. Further study is required to address the question of appropriateness of commencing prophylaxis in the setting of palliation.

Case report

We present a 61-year-old woman with a past medical history of psoriasis and a surgical history of a vaginal hysterectomy 20 years prior and sacrospinous ligament suspension for pelvic organ prolapse 15 years earlier. She was admitted for a 9-month history of sanguinopurulent vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and cutaneous ulcers, which were associated with persistent low-grade fevers, chills, fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, and weakness. The patient initially presented to an outside urogynecology clinic 1 month after symptom onset (8 months prior to this admission), where an “infected stitch” was removed using sacrospinous ligament suspension. Over the next 7 months, the patient completed courses of ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin, without improvement. She was evaluated by a second gynecologist more than 8 months after symptom onset. Vaginal cultures grew Bacteroides (species unknown), and abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed right-sided hydronephrosis secondary to an abnormal vaginal process, including marked thickening, enhancement, and areas of ill-defined fluid. Because of these results, she was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. During this antibiotic course, painful pustular lesions on the patient's face, hands, and feet, and she was admitted for possible infectious endocarditis. Of note, the patient had a 2-year history of scalp psoriasis refractory to topical corticosteroids and was being treated with ixekizumab for approximately 1 year. Approximately 2 months prior to admission, the medication was discontinued by the patient. Upon admission, the patient was started on vancomycin; subsequently, antibacterial coverage was broadened with the addition of metronidazole and ceftriaxone.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6 
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician’s discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)).Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

### Streptococcus pneumoniae causing septic arthritis with shock and revealing multiple myeloma [^c0a2eea0]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors present the case of a 43-year-old male who presented at the emergency department, with a mean arterial pressure of 48 mm of Hg, a sinus tachycardia of 142/min and shallow breathing at 30/min. Two days previously, he started a high-grade fever with a concomitant reddish and painful left knee and right elbow, without any treatment. Septic shock was diagnosed and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics combining ceftriaxone and vancomycin and vasopressors (norepinephrine). The painful knee and elbow joints were aspirated and cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's clinical condition improved progressively and after investigation, the diagnosis of multiple myeloma was concluded. Pneumococcal septic arthritis, an extraordinary cause of septic arthritis, is a manifestation of an underlying disease and can be responsible for septic shock. Its diagnosis should direct further investigations. It can occur in patients with joint disease but should emphasise the search of systemic immunosuppression.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [^14e30bdd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

Table 1: Drug Interactions with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).

### Impact of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on clearance of high-dose methotrexate in adult patients [^5c537196]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is an antineoplastic dosing strategy used to treat various cancers including primary central nervous system lymphoma. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is commonly used for antibiotic prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia infections in this patient population. Significant drug-drug interactions between TMP/SMX and methotrexate (MTX) leading to adverse outcomes have been documented, primarily in adult patients taking MTX for rheumatologic conditions.

Methods

This study is a single-center, retrospective, cohort study comparing outcomes in patients where TMP/SMX was held during HDMTX and patients who received concurrent prophylactic TMP/SMX during treatment. The primary end point was mean MTX level at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Secondary end points included rate of nonhematologic toxicity, rate of hematologic toxicity, median days to MTX clearance, and frequency of glucarpidase utilization.

Results

In total, 248 cycles of HDMTX were analyzed from 221 individual patients. One hundred ninety-one cycles were administered without prophylactic TMP/SMX, and 57 were administered with TMP/SMX. The median MTX level at 24, 48, and 72 hours in those without versus with prophylactic TMP/SMX was 4.30 versus 4.30, 0.29 versus 0.30, and 0.14 versus 0.15, respectively. Similarly, rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities did not differ significantly between groups with the exception of neutropenia; however, there was no corresponding increased rate of neutropenic fever. Only one patient received glucarpidase and had not received TMP/SMX.

Conclusion

Prophylactic TMP/SMX had minimal interaction with HDMTX and does not lead to increased time to clearance or clinically relevant toxicities. Prophylactic TMP/SMX can be safely administered with HDMTX in adult patients.

### A family physician's guide to monitoring methotrexate-AAFP (...) [^b66dbd77]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

3–5 Many physicians use methotrexate for its steroid-sparing properties in patients with asthma and others who may have side effects related to corticosteroid use. 6 The key to the success of methotrexate in treating any of these diseases is the recognition that low-dose therapy achieves efficacy while minimizing side effects. It is not uncommon for a family physician to monitor the efficacy and safety of methotrexate therapy in a patient receiving concurrent care from the subspecialist who prescribed the drug. Monitoring of serum aspartate aminotransferase and serum albumin levels is recommended for all patients receiving methotrexate. 8 These laboratory assessments were correlated with serious liver disorders in a mail survey of rheumatologists. 11 Approximately 30 percent of all patients on long-term therapy have AST elevation. Values exceeding two times the normal level for a period of one month warrant discontinuation of therapy.
7.

8, 12 Current studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis suggest that liver biopsies are not cost-effective for at least the first 10 years of methotrexate use in patients with normal values on liver function tests. 8 Routine surveillance liver biopsies are not recommended for rheumatoid arthritis patients who take the recommended dose. PULMONARY TOXICITY Pulmonary abnormalities are emerging as the more common major toxic effects of methotrexate use. 7 Symptoms include persistent dry, nonproductive cough, dyspnea or both. Patients may also have fever. Pulmonary toxicity is unrelated to the cumulative dose and has occurred in early and late stages of therapy. 7 In one case-control study, increased age was the strongest predictor of lung injury. 15 The clinical trials have revealed a higher incidence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in those with psoriasis.

13 Pulmonary toxicity is also associated with a divided weekly dose regimen rather than a full weekly dose regimen.
13. BONE MARROW TOXICITY Bone marrow effects are rare but are associated with the following conditions: high doses of methotrexate, underlying renal disease, infection, folate deficiency, increased age, low albumin and concurrent use of trimethoprim. Monitoring signs of myelosuppression can reduce complications such as severe anemia, potential bleeding and sepsis. 8 Patients with aplastic anemia need to be treated with leucovorin rescue. 13.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^33905281]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

At its core, the narrow-focused debate surrounding the timing of antimicrobial therapy is inherently flawed. The appropriate treatment of the septic patient requires a rapid multimodal response including fluid resuscitation, source control, and pressors (if required). Antimicrobials are only one part of this equation. In cases of life threatening septic shock, broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. However, the harmful effects of inappropriate antimicrobials should be mitigated, whenever possible, by using culture-guided therapy and delayed initiation. In all cases, resuscitation and source control should be the highest priority. Bloos and colleagues’ study is a reminder that antimicrobials, while important, are not the only tools in our arsenal against infectious disease.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^9df0b637]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis—empiric therapy selection guidance states that for previously healthy children with community-acquired sepsis, a third-generation cephalosporin may be sufficient, while vancomycin should be added in settings where MRSA or ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci are prevalent and an aminoglycoside may be added or a carbapenem substituted when ceftriaxone resistance in gram-negative bacteria is common. For immunocompromised patients or hospital-acquired sepsis, antimicrobial therapy should begin with an anti-pseudomonal third- or higher-generation cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, or an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. For neonates, therapy should also include ampicillin for listeria and consideration for empiric acyclovir if there is a clinical concern for HSV. For a suspected or documented intra-abdominal source, therapy should include broad coverage for gastrointestinal pathogens including anaerobic bacteria, using either an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination or carbapenem, or by adding clindamycin or metronidazole. During local influenza season in patients with proven sepsis with sepsis complicating an influenza-like illness, empiric antiviral therapy should be started while awaiting the respiratory virus testing. Patients at higher risk of antibiotic-resistant infection because of past infection or colonization, local epidemiology, or recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use should receive an individually tailored empiric therapeutic regimen, and in suspected toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis empiric treatment should include clindamycin or linezolid to limit toxin production and enhance bacterial clearance; in regions endemic for rickettsial or parasitic pathogens, clinicians should consider adding relevant empiric coverage. For children at risk for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens may require more than one agent to broadly cover potential pathogens.

### Methotrexate drug interactions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review [^57ba47ed]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have comorbidities that require multiple medications. Several of these medications may alter the efficacy or increase the toxicity of methotrexate (MTX). The purpose of our study was to determine which drugs used in combination with MTX (excluding disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, folic and folinic acid, corticosteroids, and biologic agents) enhance side effects or toxicity of MTX or lower its efficacy.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed with Medline, Embase, Cochrane Register and Database, and abstracts from the 2006/2007 annual congresses of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. A manual search of the citation lists of retrieved publications was performed.

Results

Of the 1172 articles identified, 67 were included: 21 pharmacokinetics studies, 5 observational studies, and 78 case reports. Most medications do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics profile of MTX. Among the clinical studies, cytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes were the main reported toxicities. The use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was mentioned as a risk factor for developing cytopenia in one observational study and in 17 case reports. Thirty case reports of cytopenia were attributed to the use of concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including acetylsalicylic acid. Two studies described mild abnormalities of liver enzymes with the use of isoniazid, and one study with the use of high-dose ASA.

Conclusion

Based on the published literature, MTX has limited drug interactions, with the exception of TMP-SMX and high-dose ASA, which can exacerbate toxicity of MTX. The clinical significance of these interactions has not been substantiated by extensive clinical observations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^be16052a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3—Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin <2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^70f046e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.
