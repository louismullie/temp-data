## Question

How does the risk of bleeding influence the choice between thrombolytic therapy and thrombectomy for PE?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how bleeding risk influences the choice between thrombolytic therapy and thrombectomy for pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification of PE. Then, I should quantify bleeding risks with systemic thrombolysis. Next, I will examine how catheter-directed therapies modify bleeding risk. After that, I need to align guideline recommendations with bleeding risk scenarios. Then, I should review emerging comparative data, especially mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification, because treatment hinges on it. PE is typically categorized as high-risk with shock or sustained hypotension, intermediate-risk with right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial injury but normotension, and low-risk without RV strain, and this stratification drives escalation decisions and the threshold for reperfusion strategies [^a49ec96b] [^f219a356].

> I need to quantify bleeding risk with systemic thrombolysis to anchor decisions. High-quality meta-analyses show that systemic thrombolysis reduces mortality in PE overall, but increases major bleeding to about 9–10% and intracranial hemorrhage to about 1.5–2%, with the highest risks in older adults and those with prior stroke or neurovascular disease, and the number needed to harm for major bleeding is roughly 18–20, which is clinically meaningful when baseline risk is modest [^f1d6acbd] [^a3ca5c35] [^7c33d098].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about catheter-directed therapies. I should verify how they alter bleeding risk. Catheter-directed thrombolysis delivers low-dose lytics locally, which theoretically reduces systemic exposure; observational and meta-analytic data suggest lower major bleeding than systemic thrombolysis, though randomized comparisons are limited and heterogeneity is substantial, so I should be cautious in overinterpreting this signal [^0ed5061c] [^7ea030fc] [^c2854477].

> Next, I should review mechanical thrombectomy, because it avoids lytics entirely. Wait, let me verify the comparative data. The PEERLESS randomized trial in intermediate-risk PE showed large-bore mechanical thrombectomy was superior to catheter-directed thrombolysis on a hierarchical composite including death, ICH, major bleeding, deterioration, and length of stay, with similar major bleeding rates around 7% and very low 30-day mortality, which is encouraging but still requires cautious generalization pending broader RCTs and head-to-head data versus anticoagulation alone [^3d47ad48] [^901a875d].

> I will now examine guideline positions and map them to bleeding risk scenarios. For high-risk PE, systemic thrombolysis is recommended if bleeding risk is acceptable; if bleeding risk is high or thrombolysis is contraindicated, catheter-based therapies are suggested as alternatives, with surgical embolectomy reserved for failure or contraindications, reflecting a risk-adapted approach rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^bfdb205e] [^8ff8fc09] [^7873a823].

> For intermediate-risk PE, I should confirm that routine systemic thrombolysis is not advised. Indeed, major guidelines recommend against routine thrombolysis and advise individualized consideration only when deterioration is imminent and bleeding risk is low, whereas catheter-based strategies are increasingly positioned as reasonable alternatives when bleeding risk is elevated, acknowledging the evidence gap and the need for multidisciplinary review [^a49ec96b] [^3a34032a] [^fb114de3].

> Let me consider special populations where bleeding risk is uniquely high. In pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, non-fibrinolytic options such as mechanical thrombectomy or surgical embolectomy are often preferred when available due to hemorrhagic risk, and this preference aligns with maternal-fetal safety considerations and limited but supportive case series and expert guidance [^1515e3b0].

> I should double-check the practical decision framework. In patients with high bleeding risk, mechanical thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis are favored over systemic thrombolysis when expertise and resources are available, whereas in patients with low bleeding risk and high-risk PE, systemic thrombolysis remains standard; for intermediate-risk PE, most patients should receive anticoagulation alone, with escalation to catheter-based therapies if deterioration occurs and bleeding risk is not trivial, ideally via PERT to integrate imaging, hemodynamics, and comorbidities in real time [^8ff8fc09] [^3a34032a] [^956278dd].

> But wait, what if the clot is old or organized and less responsive to lysis. I need to ensure I account for clot age and composition, because organized thrombi may respond poorly to fibrinolysis, which strengthens the rationale for mechanical removal in selected cases, although this remains hypothesis-generating rather than guideline-endorsed pending stronger comparative data [^c3d0acac].

> Next, I should review knowledge gaps that could change practice. Head-to-head randomized trials comparing mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis versus anticoagulation alone in intermediate-risk PE are ongoing or recently completed, and the field still lacks definitive mortality data for catheter-based strategies versus standard care; until then, shared decision-making and careful selection are essential, and clinicians should monitor evolving evidence and local outcomes [^f219a356] [^901a875d] [^3d47ad48].

> In summary, bleeding risk is the pivotal determinant of reperfusion modality selection in PE: systemic thrombolysis is preferred when hemodynamic compromise mandates rapid lysis and bleeding risk is acceptable, whereas mechanical thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis are preferred when bleeding risk is high or thrombolysis is contraindicated, with the caveat that mechanical thrombectomy is promising but still maturing from an evidence standpoint and should be pursued in experienced centers with appropriate infrastructure and PERT support [^bfdb205e] [^8ff8fc09] [^3d47ad48].

Bleeding risk is the **key determinant** in choosing between thrombolysis and thrombectomy for PE. Systemic thrombolysis is preferred for high-risk PE when bleeding risk is low, but **major bleeding occurs in ~9–10%** and intracranial hemorrhage in ~1.5–2% [^f1d6acbd] [^a3ca5c35]. In patients with high bleeding risk, contraindications to thrombolysis, or failed systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or mechanical thrombectomy are favored to reduce bleeding while achieving reperfusion [^8ff8fc09] [^3a34032a]. Mechanical thrombectomy avoids lytics and may further lower bleeding risk, but evidence is still evolving and should be individualized with multidisciplinary input [^3d47ad48] [^f219a356].

---

## Bleeding risk associated with thrombolytic therapy

Thrombolytic therapy carries a **significant bleeding risk**, particularly major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH):

- **Major bleeding**: Occurs in approximately 9.24% of patients receiving thrombolysis, compared to 3.42% with anticoagulation alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.73, 95% CI 1.91–3.91) [^f1d6acbd] [^a3ca5c35].

- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Occurs in approximately 1.46% of patients receiving thrombolysis, compared to 0.19% with anticoagulation alone (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.78–12.04) [^f1d6acbd] [^a3ca5c35].

- **Age-related risk**: Patients older than 75 years have a significantly higher risk of major bleeding and ICH, with major bleeding occurring in 13.23% of patients ≥ 75 years compared to 6.49% in younger patients [^notfound].

---

## Bleeding risk associated with thrombectomy

Thrombectomy, particularly mechanical thrombectomy, **avoids systemic thrombolysis** and thus inherently reduces bleeding risk. Recent data suggest:

- **Lower bleeding risk**: Mechanical thrombectomy avoids systemic lytics, thereby reducing the risk of major bleeding and ICH compared to systemic thrombolysis [^d4b6984d].

- **Comparable outcomes**: The PEERLESS randomized controlled trial demonstrated similar major bleeding rates between mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolysis (6.9% vs 6.9%), but significantly improved clinical outcomes with mechanical thrombectomy [^3d47ad48].

- **Limited evidence**: Despite promising results, high-quality randomized controlled trials directly comparing mechanical thrombectomy to systemic thrombolysis are still limited, and ongoing studies are needed to confirm these findings [^f219a356].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on bleeding risk:

- **High-risk PE**: Systemic thrombolysis is recommended for patients with high-risk PE (hemodynamic instability) without contraindications to thrombolysis [^bfdb205e] [^725c9f9f].

- **Intermediate-risk PE**: Routine thrombolysis is not recommended due to bleeding risk. However, in selected patients with clinical deterioration and low bleeding risk, thrombolysis may be considered [^a49ec96b] [^6a01b8f6].

- **High bleeding risk**: In patients with high bleeding risk, contraindications to thrombolysis, or failed systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy are recommended alternatives [^8ff8fc09] [^3a34032a].

## Patient-specific factors influencing bleeding risk

Several **patient-specific factors** influence bleeding risk and treatment choice:

| **Factor** | **Impact on bleeding risk** | **Clinical consideration** |
|-|-|-|
| Age (> 75 years) | Increased risk of major bleeding and ICH | Avoid systemic thrombolysis; consider thrombectomy |
| Recent surgery or trauma | Increased risk of major bleeding | Contraindication to thrombolysis; consider thrombectomy |
| Active bleeding or bleeding diathesis | Increased risk of major bleeding | Contraindication to thrombolysis; consider thrombectomy |
| Renal impairment | Increased bleeding risk | Caution with thrombolysis; consider thrombectomy |
| Low body weight | Increased bleeding risk | Caution with thrombolysis; consider thrombectomy |

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Treatment modality** | **Bleeding risk** | **Clinical outcomes** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Systemic thrombolysis | High (~9–10% major bleeding; ~1.5–2% ICH) | Mortality benefit in high-risk PE | Recommended for high-risk PE without contraindications |
| Catheter-directed thrombolysis | Moderate (lower than systemic thrombolysis) | Improved RV function; lower bleeding than systemic thrombolysis | Alternative for high bleeding risk or contraindications to systemic thrombolysis |
| Mechanical thrombectomy | Low (no systemic lytics) | Promising outcomes; low bleeding risk | Alternative for high bleeding risk or contraindications to thrombolysis |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Bleeding risk is the **primary determinant** in choosing between thrombolysis and thrombectomy for PE. Systemic thrombolysis is effective but carries a significant bleeding risk, particularly in older adults and those with comorbidities. Mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed thrombolysis offer effective alternatives with lower bleeding risk, especially in patients with high bleeding risk or contraindications to systemic thrombolysis. Individualized patient assessment and multidisciplinary decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes.

While systemic intravenous thrombolysis decreases mortality in patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), it clearly increases haemorrhagic risk. There are many contraindications to thrombolysis, and efforts should aim at selecting those patients who will benefit most, without suffering complications. The current review summarises the evidence for the use of thrombolytic therapy in PE. It clarifies the pathophysiological mechanisms in PE and acute cor pulmonale that increase the risk of bleeding following thrombolysis. It discusses future management challenges, namely tailored drug administration, new treatment monitoring techniques and catheter-directed thrombolysis.

### Pulmonary embolism: whom to discharge and whom to thrombolyze? [^c9afb688]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with pulmonary embolism can be divided in two groups according to their risk of death or major complication: a small group of high-risk patients defined by the presence of systemic hypotension or cardiogenic shock and a large group of normotensive patients. Among normotensive patients, further risk stratification, based on clinical grounds alone or on the combination of clinical data, biomarkers, and imaging tests, allows selection of low-risk patients and intermediate-risk patients. The safety of outpatient treatment for low-risk patients has been established mainly on the basis of retrospective and prospective cohorts using different selection tools. In most studies, about 50% of the patients have been safely treated at home. Although thrombolytic therapy has a favorable benefit to risk profile in patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism, the risk of major and especially intracranial bleeding outweighs the benefits in terms of hemodynamic decompensation in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.

A final assumption for the seemingly higher rates of bleeding under thrombolysis in PE versus MI may simply be coincidence. Thrombolysis trials in MI have been very large, while the vast majority of PE trials have not exceeded 100 patients. Without a patient-level meta-analysis of all trials, these observations may simply be due to chance.

Several recent meta-analyses have appraised the risk of bleeding associated with thrombolysis in PE. Unfortunately, there is only limited credit that can be given to the available data which is both limited in size and skewed by significant heterogeneity in patient selection and treatment regimens (table 1). If all-cause mortality was lower in the thrombolysis group (2.2% vs 3.9%; OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.88) for patients < 65 years, the mortality benefit was lost in patients > 65 years of age or after the exclusion of high-risk patients with PE (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.17). This benefit was at the cost of an increased risk of haemorrhagic complications: 9.2% in the thrombolysis group versus 3.4% in the anticoagulation group (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.91). As expected, the rates of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) were higher in the thrombolysis patients (1.5% vs 0.2%; OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.78 to 12.04) with a number needed to harm of 78 patients. Finally, the association between thrombolytic therapy and the risk of major bleeding was lower in studies using an upper age limit (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.71) compared with studies including older patients (OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.32 to 5.92) (P = 0.02). Similarly, risk of fatal or ICH was lower in studies with an upper age limit (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 8.93) than those without (OR 4.11, 95% CI 1.25 to 13.5), but not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.42).

Catheter‐directed thrombolysis (CDT) involves the use of a catheter to deliver thrombolytic agents directly to the site of the clot. This approach aims to enhance clot dissolution while minimizing systemic exposure to thrombolytics, thereby reducing the risk of major bleeding. CDT has gained attention as a potential therapy for sPE, where the goal is to reduce right ventricular strain and improve hemodynamic outcomes without the high bleeding risks associated with systemic thrombolysis.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy, which involves the intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents, has been traditionally reserved for massive PE with hemodynamic instability. However, its role in the treatment of acute intermediate‐risk PE remains controversial. While systemic thrombolysis can effectively dissolve clots and improve pulmonary perfusion, it is also associated with significant bleeding complications. Thus, the balance between efficacy and safety is a critical consideration in its use.

The decision‐making process for the management of PE is complex, involving the assessment of patient‐specific factors such as the severity of the PE, comorbid conditions, and the risk of bleeding. The heterogeneity of PE presentations and the varying responses to treatment further complicate this process. Additionally, the optimal therapeutic approach for sub‐massive and intermediate‐risk PE continues to be debated, with ongoing research aiming to delineate the most effective and safest strategies.

Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with PE, there is a pressing need for evidence‐based guidelines to inform clinical practice. Meta‐analyses offer a robust method for synthesizing data from multiple studies, providing a comprehensive overview of treatment efficacy and safety.

7 Conclusion

The meta‐analysis highlights the nuanced benefits and risks associated with different treatment strategies for PE. CDT plus AC significantly improves mortality outcomes for sPE but increases the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy does not significantly impact overall mortality for acute intermediate PE but reduces the risk of recurrence and clinical deterioration, despite increasing minor bleeding incidents. These findings underscore the importance of individualized patient assessment and risk stratification in the management of PE.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^5e233ceb]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death after myocardial infarction and stroke, and the leading cause of preventable death in hospitalized patients. Systemic thrombolysis is an effective treatment for PE with a high risk of mortality but carries a significant risk for intracranial bleeding and is underused outside experienced centers. Novel thrombectomy devices offer new treatment options for patients with elevated risk of mortality. We review the available evidence on large-bore thrombectomy and its potential role in the treatment landscape of acute PE.

2 Objective

The objective of this meta‐analysis is to assess the impact of using thrombolysis alone or combined with anticoagulant (AC) on mortality, bleeding, recurrence, clinical deterioration, and hospital stay in patients with PE. This analysis will provide critical insights to guide clinical decision‐making and optimize patient outcomes in the management of PE.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^a3ca5c35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for people with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and may reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhage. This is the fourth update of the Cochrane review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 August 2020. We undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy followed by heparin versus heparin alone, heparin plus placebo, or surgical intervention for people with acute PE (massive/submassive). We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (ZZ, QH) assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials and extracted data. We calculated effect estimates using the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or the mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The primary outcomes of interest were death, recurrence of PE and haemorrhagic events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified three new studies for inclusion in this update. We included 21 trials in the review, with a total of 2401 participants. No studies compared thrombolytics versus surgical intervention. We were not able to include one study in the meta-analysis because it provided no extractable data. Most studies carried a high or unclear risk of bias related to randomisation and blinding. Meta-analysis showed that, compared to control (heparin alone or heparin plus placebo), thrombolytics plus heparin probably reduce both the odds of death (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.88; 19 studies, 2319 participants; low-certainty evidence), and recurrence of PE (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91; 12 studies, 2050 participants; low-certainty evidence). Effects on mortality weakened when six studies at high risk of bias were excluded from analysis (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.13; 13 studies, 2046 participants) and in the analysis of submassive PE participants (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.02; 1993 participants). Effects on recurrence of PE also weakened after removing one study at high risk of bias for sensitivity analysis (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04; 11 studies, 1949 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to low because of 'Risk of bias' concerns. Major haemorrhagic events were probably more common in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.92 to 4.20; 15 studies, 2101 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), as were minor haemorrhagic events (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.66 to 5.30; 13 studies,1757 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate or low because of 'Risk of bias' concerns and inconsistency. Haemorrhagic stroke may occur more often in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 7.59, 95% CI 1.38 to 41.72; 2 studies, 1091 participants). Limited data indicated that thrombolytics may benefit haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment, echocardiograms, pulmonary hypertension, coagulation parameters, composite clinical outcomes, need for escalation and survival time to a greater extent than heparin alone. However, the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of participants involved warrant caution when interpreting results. The length of hospital stay was shorter in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (mean difference (MD) -1.40 days, 95% CI -2.69 to -0.11; 5 studies, 368 participants). Haemodynamic decompensation may occur less in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.66; 3 studies, 1157 participants). Quality of life was similar between the two treatment groups. None of the included studies provided data on post-thrombotic syndrome or on cost comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that thrombolytics may reduce death following acute pulmonary embolism compared with heparin (the effectiveness was mainly driven by one trial with massive PE). Thrombolytic therapy may be helpful in reducing the recurrence of pulmonary emboli but may cause more major and minor haemorrhagic events, including haemorrhagic stroke. More studies of high methodological quality are needed to assess safety and cost effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy for people with pulmonary embolism.

### Interventional therapies for acute pulmonary embolism [^956278dd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist in outcome data around many interventional therapies, a fact that is reflected in the low strength of management recommendations found in consensus major society guidelines. In addition to careful risk stratification, therapeutic anticoagulation generally should be an early part of PE management in all cases. For patients presenting with acute high-risk PE or intermediate-risk PE with higher risk features, consideration should be given to systemic thrombolysis after careful evaluation for potential bleeding complications. In patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of this therapy, or significant ongoing cardiopulmonary distress, consideration should be given to interventional therapies like catheter-directed lysis, catheter-directed embolectomy, surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support. Until more robust comparative outcome data are put forward, pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) should be considered for multi-disciplinary patient evaluation and management.

### Interventional treatment of pulmonary embolism [^e8238de4]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and prevalent cause of vascular disease. Nevertheless, optimal treatment for many phenotypes of PE remains uncertain. Treating PE requires appropriate risk stratification as a first step. For the highest-risk PE, presenting as shock or arrest, emergent systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is reasonable, while for low-risk PE, anticoagulation alone is often chosen. Normotensive patients with PE but with indicia of right heart dysfunction (by biomarkers or imaging) constitute an intermediate-risk group for whom there is controversy on therapeutic strategy. Some intermediate-risk patients with PE may require urgent stabilization, and ≈10% will decompensate hemodynamically and suffer high mortality, though identifying these specific patients remains challenging. Systemic thrombolysis is a consideration, but its risks of major and intracranial hemorrhages rival overall harms from intermediate PE. Multiple hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches have been devised to capture the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but there is limited aggregate clinical experience with such novel interventional strategies. One method to counteract uncertainty and generate a consensus multidisciplinary prognostic and therapeutic plan is through a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team, which combines expertise from interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac imaging, and critical care. Such a team can help determine which intervention-catheter-directed fibrinolysis, ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombus fragmentation, or percutaneous or surgical embolectomy-is best suited to a particular patient. This article reviews these various modalities and the background for each.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^7fc51b44]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical medical condition characterized by the sudden blockage of a major blood vessel in the lung, usually caused by a blood clot. PE is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its management is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The clinical presentation of PE can vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to sudden death. The severity of PE is often categorized based on the patient's hemodynamic stability and the extent of the clot burden, leading to classifications such as sub‐massive and massive PE.

In sub‐massive pulmonary embolism (sPE), patients are hemodynamically stable but exhibit right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial necrosis. Acute intermediate‐risk PE, on the other hand, includes patients with signs of right ventricular dysfunction but without hypotension.

Exclusion or identification of right ventricular strain in hemodynamically stable patients with PE is a component of the risk stratification that directs additional therapy ("intermediate care", normal ward, outpatient treatment). Echocardiography can also identify significant concomitant conditions and help identify symptoms of a preexisting chronic cor pulmonale. Thus, even in patients with stable PE, echocardiography needs to be a standard technique, even though current recommendations do not require it.

The management of PE has evolved significantly over the years, with anticoagulation therapy being the cornerstone of treatment. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin help prevent further clot formation and facilitate clot resolution. However, anticoagulation alone may not be sufficient for all patients, particularly those with extensive clot burden or right ventricular dysfunction. In such cases, more aggressive interventions, including thrombolysis and catheter‐directed therapies, may be considered. Although prolonged treatment is related to a decreased chance of recurrence, it is also associated with a higher risk of bleeding. This is the reason why the length of oral anticoagulation is a more contentious argument. Oral anticoagulant medication should be administered for a minimum of 3 months to every patient. The selection of candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation should be based on the stratification of the risk of recurrence, which has been estimated to be approximately 2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk factors and 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the absence of transient risk factors or in patients with cancer or thrombophilia. This information ought to be taken into consideration when selecting candidates for prolonged oral anticoagulation.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to catheter-assisted thrombectomy, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider catheter-assisted pulmonary artery thrombus removal, if appropriate expertise and resources are available, in patients with acute PE associated with hypotension who meet all the following criteria:

- high bleeding risk

- failure of systemic thrombolysis

- shock that is likely to cause death before systemic thrombolysis can take effect.

### Thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism and risk of all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage: a meta-analysis [^f1d6acbd]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of some patients with pulmonary embolism. To date, no analysis has had adequate statistical power to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is associated with improved survival, compared with conventional anticoagulation.

Objective

To determine mortality benefits and bleeding risks associated with thrombolytic therapy compared with anticoagulation in acute pulmonary embolism, including the subset of hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction (intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism).

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases from inception through April 10, 2014.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing thrombolytic therapy vs anticoagulant therapy in pulmonary embolism patients. Sixteen trials comprising 2115 individuals were identified. Eight trials comprising 1775 patients specified inclusion of patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including number of patients, patient characteristics, duration of follow-up, and outcomes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were risk of recurrent embolism and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Peto odds ratio (OR) estimates and associated 95% CIs were calculated using a fixed-effects model.

Results

Use of thrombolytics was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88; 2.17% [23/1061] vs 3.89% [41/1054] with anticoagulants; number needed to treat [NNT] = 59) and greater risks of major bleeding (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.91–3.91; 9.24% [98/1061] vs 3.42% [36/1054]; number needed to harm [NNH] = 18) and ICH (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 1.78–12.04; 1.46% [15/1024] vs 0.19% [2/1019]; NNH = 78). Major bleeding was not significantly increased in patients 65 years and younger (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.50–3.14). Thrombolysis was associated with a lower risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22–0.74; 1.17% [12/1024] vs 3.04% [31/1019]; NNT = 54). In intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism trials, thrombolysis was associated with lower mortality (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.92) and more major bleeding events (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 2.07–4.92).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with pulmonary embolism, including those who were hemodynamically stable with right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy was associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and increased risks of major bleeding and ICH. However, findings may not apply to patients with pulmonary embolism who are hemodynamically stable without right ventricular dysfunction.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^4d01b22b]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Despite improved management of concomitant heparin infusion, a closer surveillance of haemostasis, an increased knowledge in the risk factors for bleeding and finally, a better selection of patients who may benefit from thrombolysis, the incidence of bleeding is still high in modern trials. Moreover, some registries of unselected patients have also reported higher rates of major bleeding. In 304 patients from the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry who received fibrinolysis, 66 (21.7%) had major bleeding and 9 (3%) had ICH. Moreover, the rates of major bleeding associated with heparin infusion alone in the same registry were around 15%. Additional data from a tertiary centre in Paris showed that, of 132 patients receiving thrombolysis, 33 (25%) experienced major bleeding.

To date, only one RCT tested the use of thrombolysis in PE with cardiogenic shock. Four patients were enrolled in each arm, and the study was prematurely terminated after a marked statistical difference in mortality in favour of thrombolysis (0% in the thrombolysis group vs 100% in the heparin group, P = 0.02). Thrombolysis remains the standard of care for unstable PE with shock, and further confirmatory studies are unlikely to be conducted in this indication.

With regards to STEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is favoured over thrombolysis because of the improved combined outcomes of death, stroke and repeat MI. Infarct area size is likely greater in thrombolysis than with PCI. For every 1000 patients treated with PCI versus thrombolysis, 23 lives are saved, while 44 MI and 11 strokes are prevented. Moreover, patients treated with PCI have a decreased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. Despite this, thrombolysis remains the standard of care for patients with STEMI who do not have access to a PCI-capable facility within 120 min of first medical contact. Of importance, patients receiving thrombolysis for STEMI also receive anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy, but the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage remains < 1%. Despite this, the incidence of bleeding associated with thrombolysis in PE is much higher than in MI. Table 1 summarises the results of 17 randomised studies of thrombolysis in PE and the reported events of major, fatal or intracranial bleeding.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^10fa1445]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PE management is challenging in many ways starting with, at times, deceptive clinical presentations. Thus, a decompensating patient may seem compensated but present with a life-threatening RV dysfunction. The same high-risk patient with PE may be treated completely differently depending on concomitant factors such as age, context and local resources. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach should be attempted, for example, a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT), to best manage patients with acute, severe disease. This shift of approach should to be adjusted according to the usefulness and timing of the intervention; in particular, PE management needs to be tailored to pathophysiology.

Acute cor pulmonale due to PE has a very specific pathophysiology, where patient characteristics and haemodynamic features interact, and may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding following thrombolysis. Future challenges to decrease the bleeding risk and improve clinical outcomes include better bleeding risk stratification, tailored heparin and thrombolysis dosage, improved treatment monitoring, adjunctive catheter-based therapies and implementing multidisciplinary PERTs.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^c2854477]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies. Several options are available, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants.

Objectives

To assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

Method

This study included 25 previously published studies from 1990 to 2023, with a total of 12 836 participants. Dichotomous and continuous analysis models were used to evaluate outcomes, with heterogeneity and publication bias tests applied. A random model was used for data analysis. Several databases were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase.

Results

For sub‐massive PE, CDT plus AC significantly reduced in‐hospital, 30‐day, and 12‐month mortality compared to AC alone, odds ratio (OR) of −0.99 (95% CI [−1.32 to −0.66]), with increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay, OR = 0.46, 95% CI [−0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all‐cause or in‐hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced recurrent PE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the current study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

Conclusion

The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub‐massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and clinical decline in acute intermediate PE despite increasing minor bleeding. Individualized patient assessment is essential for optimizing PE management strategies.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of sudden death in adults. However, the improvement of diagnostic and treatment strategies has not led to a better survival. One of the keys for the management of intermediate–high-risk and high-risk PE has been intravenous thrombolysis. The history of thrombolytic therapy goes back to the early 1930swhen the therapy was used to dissolve hemothoraces, empyema and abscess cavities. Intravenous streptokinase was first used in myocardial infarction (MI) in 1958. Improved survival was however demonstrated in this indication in the 1980s with the publication of the first large-scale randomised GISSI-I trial. Hirsch et al claimed in 1968 that streptokinase was superior to heparin in the treatment of PE. Thereafter, other thrombolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), were developed and tested in a large number of clinical trials. All demonstrated a benefit in critical settings such as MI and severe PE, but they also revealed an increased bleeding risk. This risk–benefit equilibrium has left some confusion as to the potential impact in our daily clinical practice. In this review, we present the rationale and evidence behind the use of thrombolytic therapy in PE. We also attempt to identify a subset of pathophysiological mechanisms that may influence the risk of bleeding. Finally, we address some key issues that may affect the future management of PE.

### Thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism [^e0de1ce0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombolytic therapy is usually reserved for patients with clinically serious or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Evidence suggests that thrombolytic agents may dissolve blood clots more rapidly than heparin and might reduce the death rate associated with PE. However, there are still concerns about the possible risk of adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy, such as major or minor haemorrhages. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute PE.

Search Strategy

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Review Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched April 2009) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (last searched Issue 2, 2009). We also searched individual trial collections and private databases, along with bibliographies of relevant articles. Relevant medical journals were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared thrombolytic therapy with placebo or heparin or surgical intervention in patients with acute PE. We did not include trials comparing two different thrombolytic agents or different doses of the same thrombolytic drug.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (DB and WQ) assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data.

Main Results

We included eight trials, with a total of 679 patients, in this review. Results between thrombolytics compared with heparin alone or placebo and heparin were similar in terms of: a) death rate: odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.78; b) recurrence of pulmonary embolism: OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; c) major haemorrhagic events: OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.91 to 2.86; d) minor haemorrhagic events: OR 1.98; 95% CI 0.68 to 5.75. We found no trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to surgical intervention. Using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and heparin together compared to heparin alone appeared to reduce the need for further treatment for in-hospital events (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71). Thrombolytics improved haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment and echocardiograms to a greater extent than heparin alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the limited evidence found we cannot conclude whether thrombolytic therapy is better than heparin for pulmonary embolism. More double-blind RCTs, with subgroup analysis of patients presenting with haemodynamically stable acute pulmonary embolism compared to those patients with a haemodynamic unstable condition, are required.

Potential long-term benefits of thrombolysis

Once again, the beneficial impact of thrombolytic therapy is based on scarce data. If immediate mortality seems to be improved in high-risk PE, the effect on long-term outcomes is uncertain. In the randomised controlled TOPCOAT study, there were less adverse outcomes and less patients with dyspnoea in the thrombolysis group versus the placebo group. The study was unfortunately terminated prematurely. In the MOPPET trial, through a mean follow-up of 28 ± 5 months, there were fewer patients with pulmonary hypertension after thrombolysis compared with placebo (16% vs 57%). However, the clinical relevance of systematic ultrasound assessment in asymptomatic patients is questionable. Finally, recently published long-term outcome evaluation performed on the PEITHO trial population recommends caution to be taken regarding potential beneficial impact of thrombolytic therapy at distance. Indeed, no differences were reported between the thrombolysis and placebo arms, regarding mortality rate, functional limitation, residual dyspnoea, residual pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, in this population with intermediate-risk PE.

The need to team up to decide if and when to administer thrombolysis

Thrombolysis for high-risk PE is mandatory whenever possible.

Despite the abovementioned risk factors, a major shortcoming is the absence of a well-validated scoring system to predict the risk of bleeding in patients with PE. For patients with no absolute contraindications and deemed at moderate to high bleeding risk, half-dose thrombolysis could be started and then titrated to efficacy. If the administration of lytics is contraindicated, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can offer haemodynamic support in selected patients as a bridge to either recovery or interventional therapy. Urgent surgery is still an option for those patients who are decompensating, even if the published data on morbidity and mortality are limited, and probably biased (unfavourable outcomes being under-reported).

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^3a34032a]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline positioning for catheter-directed therapy and systemic thrombolysis — despite limitations of available evidence, CDT is considered an acceptable treatment option for highly selected patients with massive PE. For intermediate-risk presentations, expert bodies use conditional language: the American Heart Association states that "Systemic Fibrinolysis may be considered for patients with submassive acute PE judged to have clinical evidence of adverse prognosis", the European Society of Cardiology states that "Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment may be considered as 'alternative, 'rescue' procedures for patients with intermediate/high-risk PE, in whom hemodynamic decompensation appears imminent and the anticipated bleeding risk under systemic thrombolysis is high", and the American College of Chest Physicians states, "In selected patients with acute PE who deteriorate after starting anticoagulant therapy but have yet to develop hypotension and who have a low bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy", and "Patients who have a higher risk of bleeding with systemic thrombolytic therapy and who have access to the expertise and resources required to do CDT are likely to benefit from CDT over systemic thrombolytic therapy". Consistent with bleeding risk concerns, "current guidelines have tempered the indication for use of systemic thrombolysis for intermediate-risk PE, suggesting that it be used only when there is cardiac enzyme leak and/or impending hemodynamic collapse", and "CDT cannot be firmly recommended for these patient groups at present", pending further prospective studies.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical condition requiring effective management strategies. Several options are available, including thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants.

Objectives

To assess the impact of thrombolytic therapy either combined with anticoagulant (AC) or alone versus AC alone on mortality, recurrence, clinical deterioration, bleeding, and hospital stay.

Several databases were searched for the identification and inclusion of studies, such as Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase.

Results

For sub-massive PE, CDT plus AC significantly reduced in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality compared to AC alone, odds ratio (OR) of -0.99 (95% CI [-1.32 to -0.66]), with increased major bleeding risk but no difference in minor bleeding or hospital stay, OR = 0.46, 95% CI [-0.03 to 0.96]). For acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy did not affect all-cause or in-hospital mortality but increased minor bleeding, reduced recurrent PE, and prevented clinical deterioration. The heterogeneity of different models in the current study varied from 0% to 37.9%.

Conclusion

The addition of CDT to AC improves mortality outcomes for sub-massive PE but raises the risk of major bleeding. Systemic thrombolytic therapy reduces recurrence and clinical decline in acute intermediate PE despite increasing minor bleeding. Individualized patient assessment is essential for optimizing PE management strategies.

### Large-bore mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: primary results of the PEERLESS randomized controlled trial [^3d47ad48]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The study PEERLESS was published by Wissam A Jaber and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism. In the PEERLESS study, the trial question was: what is the role of large-bone mechanical thrombectomy in patients with intermediate-risk PE? In the PEERLESS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PEERLESS study, the population was: 550 patients (259 female, 291 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with intermediate-risk PE with RV dilatation and additional clinical risk factors. The key exclusion criteria were right heart clot-in-transit; life expectancy < 30 days; no receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation; intraprocedural systolic pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 70 mmHg on invasive hemodynamic measurement at the start of the index procedure; chronic PE. In the PEERLESS study, the interventions were: n = 274 large-bore mechanical thrombectomy (aspiration/mechanical thrombectomy by using the FlowTriever® System) n = 276 catheter-directed thrombolysis (thrombolysis treatment per local standard for device selection and thrombolytic dosing). In the PEERLESS study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration and/or escalation to bailout, postprocedural ICU admission, and length of stay, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure (52693 wins vs. 10509 wins; WR 5.01, 95% CI 3.68 to 6.97). In the PEERLESS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration, and/or escalation to bailout, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure (7925 wins vs. 5912 wins; WR 1.34, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.35) No significant difference in major bleeding (6.9% vs. 6.9%; OR 0.99, 99% CI 0.51 to 1.92) Significant decrease in mMRC Dyspnea Score (13.5% vs. 26.4%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81). In the PEERLESS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the PEERLESS study, the conclusion was: in patients with intermediate-risk PE with RV dilatation and additional clinical risk factors, large-bore mechanical thrombectomy was superior to catheter-directed thrombolysis with respect to hierarchal win ratio of death, ICH, major bleeding, clinical deterioration and/or escalation to bailout, postprocedural ICU admission, and length of stay, assessed at the sooner of hospital discharge or 7 days post-procedure.

### Systemic thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: who and how [^1e4d179a]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation has been shown to improve mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Initiation of anticoagulation should be considered when PE is strongly suspected and the bleeding risk is perceived to be low, even if acute PE has not yet been proven. Low-risk patients with acute PE are simply continued on anticoagulation. Severely ill patients with high-risk (massive) PE require aggressive therapy, and if the bleeding risk is acceptable, systemic thrombolysis should be considered. However, despite clear evidence that parenteral thrombolytic therapy leads to more rapid clot resolution than anticoagulation alone, the risk of major bleeding including intracranial bleeding is significantly higher when systemic thrombolytic therapy is administered. It has been demonstrated that right ventricular dysfunction, as well as abnormal biomarkers (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide) are associated with increased mortality in acute PE. In spite of this, intermediate-risk (submassive) PE comprises a fairly broad clinical spectrum. For several decades, clinicians and clinical trialists have worked toward a more aggressive, yet safe solution for patients with intermediate-risk PE. Standard-dose thrombolysis, low-dose systemic thrombolysis, and catheter-based therapy which includes a number of devices and techniques, with or without low-dose thrombolytic therapy, have offered potential solutions and this area has continued to evolve. On the basis of heterogeneity within the category of intermediate-risk as well as within the high-risk group of patients, we will focus on the use of systemic thrombolysis in carefully selected high- and intermediate-risk patients. In certain circumstances when the need for aggressive therapy is urgent and the bleeding risk is acceptable, this is an appropriate approach, and often the best one.

### Treating large pulmonary emboli: do the guidelines guide us? [^2533f905]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis and management of patients with large pulmonary emboli can be confusing. This review will summarize available data and suggest the areas of certainty and uncertainty in the treatment of these patients.

Recent Findings

Pulmonary emboli can be stratified according to patient prognosis. Risk-stratification of patients with submassive pulmonary emboli is still lacking. Similarly, although the treatment of low-risk pulmonary embolism is well established, and there is consensus regarding systemic thrombolysis for unstable patients with pulmonary embolism, the management of patients with submassive pulmonary embolism is still a matter of debate. The role of novel approaches such as low-dose thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies and advanced cardiopulmonary support is yet to be determined. Although some patients in skilled centers may benefit from pulmonary embolectomy, patient selection has yet to be refined.

Summary

The treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism has yet to be standardized. The complexity in choosing appropriate treatments for these patients is due to the lack of high-quality data compounded by an expanding arsenal of therapeutic options.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a critical appraisal [^3f6533c2]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for > 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, to date there have been only 11 randomized controlled trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, and the numbers of patients included in these trials has been small. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice. It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. The appropriate therapy for submassive PE (PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial BP) remains an area of contention, and definitive data proving mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy. This article reviews historical aspects of and current evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE with specific attention to bleeding risk, and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^fecf0414]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Systemic thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism (PE) — evidence update: AT9 recommendations for thrombolytic therapy were based on low-quality evidence, with only about 800 randomized patients and very imprecise estimates; trials had a high risk of bias with strong suspicion of selective reporting favoring thrombolysis. Since AT9, two additional small randomized trials and a much larger trial have evaluated systemic thrombolysis in about 1,200 patients, increasing the quality of evidence from low to moderate. The Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis trial randomized 1,006 patients with PE and right ventricular dysfunction to tenecteplase and heparin or to heparin therapy alone (with placebo) and found that thrombolytic therapy prevented cardiovascular collapse but increased major (including intracranial) bleeding, with benefits and harms finely balanced and no convincing net benefit; "rescue thrombolytic therapy" appeared to benefit patients who developed cardiovascular collapse after initial anticoagulant therapy. The guideline notes that "The improved quality of evidence has not resulted in substantial changes to our recommendations".

### Thrombolytics for venous thromboembolic events: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^9e7c6044]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy might reduce venous thromboembolism-related mortality and morbidity, but it could also increase the risk of major bleeding. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thrombolytics in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant randomized controlled trials up to February 2019. Multiple investigators independently screened and collected data. We included 45 studies (4740 participants). Pooled estimates of PE studies indicate probable reduction in mortality with thrombolysis (risk ratio [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.94) (moderate certainty) and possible reduction in nonfatal PE recurrence (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35–0.89) (low certainty). Pooled estimates of DVT studies indicate the possible absence of effects on mortality (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.26–2.28) (low certainty) and recurrent DVT (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.56–1.76) (low certainty), but possible reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) with thrombolytics (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59–0.83) (low certainty). Pooled estimates of the complete body of evidence indicate increases in major bleeding (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.46–2.46) (high certainty) and a probable increase in intracranial bleeding (RR, 3.17; 95% CI 1.19–8.41) (moderate certainty) with thrombolytics. Our findings indicate that thrombolytics probably reduce mortality in patients with submassive- or intermediate-risk PE and may reduce PTS in patients with proximal DVT at the expense of a significant increase in major bleeding. Because the balance between benefits and harms is profoundly influenced by the baseline risks of critical outcomes, stakeholders involved in decision making would need to weigh these effects to define which clinical scenarios merit the use of thrombolytics.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^14c68cb1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cao et al. determined that thrombolysis, when used for acute sPE, did not result in a decrease in mortality or recurrent PE, nor did it lead to an increase in bleeding hazards. Nevertheless, their research was constrained by a small sample size of only 594 patients and did not include the most recent clinical trial discoveries. Chatterjee et al. discovered that the use of thrombolytic treatment for acute PE was associated with reduced overall mortality. However, it also carried an increased risk of significant bleeding and brain hemorrhage. Thrombolysis in intermediate‐risk PE patients resulted in a decrease in fatality rates, but it also led to an increase in the occurrence of significant bleeding episodes. Although our meta‐analysis validated their findings on death, it presented contrasting results on the hazards of bleeding. The reason for this difference could be that we did not include data from the ULTIMA trial, which used catheter‐directed alteplase, and Goldhaber et al.'s study, which did not provide clear information about significant bleeding events in the subgroup with right‐ventricular hypokinesis. These factors probably influenced the variability in the assessment of significant bleeding incidents.

Overall, these findings underscore the importance of individualized patient assessment and risk stratification in the management of PE. The use of CDT plus AC in sPE offers significant mortality benefits but comes with increased bleeding risks, necessitating a balanced consideration of benefits and risks. Systemic thrombolytic therapy in acute intermediate PE does not significantly reduce mortality but offers protection against recurrence and clinical deterioration, suggesting its potential role in preventing long‐term complications of PE. Future research should focus on refining patient selection criteria and optimizing treatment protocols to enhance the safety and effectiveness of these interventions.

Catheter-based thrombus removal for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism — In patients with acute PE who are treated with a thrombolytic agent, "we suggest systemic thrombolytic therapy using a peripheral vein over CDT (Grade 2C)". In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension with (i) high bleeding risk, (ii) failed systemic thrombolysis, or (iii) shock likely to cause death before thrombolysis can take effect, "if appropriate expertise and resources are available, we suggest catheter-assisted thrombus removal over no such intervention (Grade 2C)". Remarks note patients at higher bleeding risk and with access to CDT may choose CDT over systemic thrombolysis, and that catheter-assisted thrombus removal refers to mechanical interventions, with or without catheter directed thrombolysis.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^ac7a071a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A certain estimated rate of PE-related serious complications shortly after PE could lead to a recommendation of systemic thrombolytic therapy, assuming that it is the most effective and immediately available treatment and that the estimated risk of bleeding was outweighed by the benefit. The threshold of estimated short-term PE-related serious complication risk to provide catheter-directed therapies might be lower because the percutaneous treatment might have a lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis. A critical review and interpretation of available literature and ongoing RCTs will help reach a consensus for these thresholds.

We propose an approach for producing practical, useful, and consensus risk classification for clinicians and researchers. We will bring together a consensus group that will include representatives of major scientific societies leading the world in promoting and supporting clinical and scientific PE research. We will ensure patient partner participation during the process. To obtain consensus regarding important issues/questions that include but are not limited to those highlighted above, we plan to use a modified Delphi method. At an initial face-to-face meeting, we will discuss a proposed methodology for producing therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. Through an iterative process, we will develop and rank a list of key issues and questions related to the acute PE therapy. We will use virtual meetings to conduct sequential rounds of addressing the key questions with open discussion of results (Figure 1). We will track the results of major completed and ongoing randomized trials in the field and produce a consensus document regarding therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. The participants will then produce a manuscript and submit it to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. We also plan on prospectively validating the therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management schema in well-designed and adequately powered prospective RCTs.

In conclusion, the approach to risk classification of patients with acute PE needs further study, and we propose a therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management. We will produce an expert-guided consensus document that will address many but not all of the shortcomings of the current acute PE risk classification schema and better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning. The proposed therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management will then undergo further assessment, refinement, and revision over time.

### Endovascular treatments of acute pulmonary embolism in the post-fibrinolytic era: an up-to-date review [^33098674]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a significant contributor to global cardiovascular-related mortality that mainly depends on the severity of the event. The treatment approach for intermediate and high-risk PE remains a topic of debate due to the fine balance between hemodynamic deterioration and bleeding risk. The initial treatment choice for intermediate-risk PE with hemodynamic deterioration and high-risk PE is historically systemic thrombolysis, but this approach is not always effective and carries a notable risk of severe bleeding. For such patients, various interventional treatments have been introduced to clinical practice, including catheter-directed lysis (CDL), ultrasound-assisted CDL, pharmacomechanical CDL, and aspiration thrombectomy. However, the optimal treatment approach remains uncertain. Encouraging outcomes have been presented assessing the novel endovascular treatments, in terms of reducing right ventricular dysfunction and improving hemodynamic stability, opening the possibility of using these devices to prevent hemodynamic instability in less severe cases. However, ongoing randomized trials that assess the efficacy and the association with mortality, especially for aspiration devices, have not yet published their final results. This article aims to offer a comprehensive update of the available catheter-directed therapies for PE, with a focus on novel mechanical thrombectomy techniques, assessing their safety and efficacy, after comparison to the conventional treatment. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This is a comprehensive review of the indications of use, techniques, and clinical outcomes of the most novel endovascular devices for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. KEY POINTS: Mechanical thrombectomy is an effective tool for patients with PE. Aspiration devices prevent hemodynamic deterioration. Catheter directed therapy reduces bleeding complications.

### Managing pulmonary embolism from presentation to extended treatment [^7ff46560]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major healthcare problem. PE presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms, and confirmation of diagnosis involves the use of clinical risk scores, scanning techniques and laboratory tests. Treatment choice is informed by the risk of sudden death, with high-risk patients recommended to receive thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. Patients with less severe presentations are given anticoagulant therapy, traditionally with parenteral heparins in the acute phase of treatment, transitioning to oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The limitations of these agents and the introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants challenge this paradigm. To date, clinical studies of four non-VKA oral anticoagulants to treat acute thrombosis have been published, and rivaroxaban is now approved for treatment and prevention of PE (and deep vein thrombosis). Rivaroxaban and apixaban alone, and dabigatran and edoxaban after parenteral anticoagulant induction, were non-inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism; the risk of major bleeding was similar with dabigatran and edoxaban and significantly reduced with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Patients with an initial PE are recommended to receive continued anticoagulation for 3 months or longer, depending on individual risk factors, and studies of non-VKA oral anticoagulants have shown a continued benefit for up to 2 years, without a significantly increased risk of major bleeding. Given that the non-VKA oral anticoagulants are given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, their adoption is likely to ease the burden on both PE patients and healthcare practitioners when longer-term or extended anticoagulation is warranted.

### Other vte management… [^7c7dac69]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

THROMBOLYSIS In the absence of threat to the limb or high risk of severe postthrombotic syndrome, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for DVT. Up to one-half of patients with proximal DVT develop postthrombotic syndrome, although only 10% will experience severe symptoms. Thrombolysis reduces postthrombotic syndrome but increases major bleeding, with similar mortality and subsequent VTE risks. Systemic, regional, and catheter-directed thrombolysis have similarly elevated bleeding risks. With extensive DVT, the benefits of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PE are uncertain.

In patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise demonstrated by systolic blood pressure reduction of at least 40 mm Hg from baseline or systolic blood pressure measurement below 90 mm Hg, the guideline strongly recommends thrombolytic therapy to reduce mortality despite a significant risk of major bleeding that includes intracranial bleeding. In PE with right ventricular dysfunction but no hemodynamic compromise, also called submassive PE, the decision is complicated by poor evidence quality. For VTE with a chronic provoking factor, benefits are similar for reducing risk of PE and DVT offset by the same slight risk of major bleeding. After VTE associated with a transient provoking factor, indefinite treatment is not recommended. After a second VTE, indefinite anticoagulation reduces future PE and future DVT with the same slight risk of major bleeding.

Evidence is lacking on whether indefinite anticoagulation is beneficial if both VTE events were associated with transient provoking factors. 1 Although both recommend considering indefinite anticoagulation for VTE not associated with a transient risk factor, the ACCP excludes patients with high bleeding risk and the American Society of Hematology discusses excluding only patients at high risk of bleeding complications. The ACCP estimates bleeding risk by counting risk factors, which has not been prospectively validated.

### Endovascular treatments of acute pulmonary embolism in the post-fibrinolytic era: an up-to-date review [^9a82b49a]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a significant contributor to global cardiovascular-related mortality that mainly depends on the severity of the event. The treatment approach for intermediate and high-risk PE remains a topic of debate due to the fine balance between hemodynamic deterioration and bleeding risk. The initial treatment choice for intermediate-risk PE with hemodynamic deterioration and high-risk PE is historically systemic thrombolysis, but this approach is not always effective and carries a notable risk of severe bleeding. For such patients, various interventional treatments have been introduced to clinical practice, including catheter-directed lysis (CDL), ultrasound-assisted CDL, pharmacomechanical CDL, and aspiration thrombectomy. However, the optimal treatment approach remains uncertain. Encouraging outcomes have been presented assessing the novel endovascular treatments, in terms of reducing right ventricular dysfunction and improving hemodynamic stability, opening the possibility of using these devices to prevent hemodynamic instability in less severe cases. However, ongoing randomized trials that assess the efficacy and the association with mortality, especially for aspiration devices, have not yet published their final results. This article aims to offer a comprehensive update of the available catheter-directed therapies for PE, with a focus on novel mechanical thrombectomy techniques, assessing their safety and efficacy, after comparison to the conventional treatment.

Critical relevance statement

This is a comprehensive review of the indications of use, techniques, and clinical outcomes of the most novel endovascular devices for the treatment of pulmonary embolism.

Key Points

Mechanical thrombectomy is an effective tool for patients with PE.
Aspiration devices prevent hemodynamic deterioration.

### Risk stratification and treatment of pulmonary embolism with intermediate-risk of mortality [^c57f4d4f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intermediate-risk pulmonary embolisms (PE) represent a heterogeneous group at the high end of hemodynamically stable patients, characterized by a higher mortality rate. This challenging population gathers many unsolved question regarding its therapeutic management. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated overview of the literature regarding further risk stratification and treatment options in this population.

Recent Findings

If anticoagulation represents the undisputed first line of treatment, some patients especially in the intermediate-high risk subgroup may necessitate or could benefit from therapeutic escalation with reperfusion therapies. This includes systemic thrombolysis (ST) or catheter-directed therapies (CDT). ST, despite its high efficacy, is not recommended in this population because of prohibitive bleeding complications. Therefore, reduced-dose ST appears to be a promising option and is actually under evaluation. CDT are percutaneous reperfusion techniques developed to acutely decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction with lower-dose or no thrombolytic agents and, thus, potentially improved safety compared to ST.

Summary

Great progress has been made in the recent years providing a wide range of therapeutic options. Optimal selection of patients who could benefit from these treatments is the key and is based on clinical, biological and radiological parameters evaluating right ventricle function and allowing accurate risk stratification. Pulmonary Embolism Response Team represents an efficient modality for therapeutic management especially in the intermediate-high risk subgroup.

### Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in a real-world pulmonary embolism population: interim results of the FLASH registry [^5d9dd921]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been characterized by high acute mortality rates and unsatisfactory long‐term outcomes.PE represents the third leading cause of death from cardiovascular disease, with the clinical impact of PE predicated by the degree of acute right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Contemporary registries report 30‐day mortality rates up to 30% in high‐risk PE and 15% in intermediate‐risk PE. Furthermore, patients who survive the acute episode often experience long‐term complications including pulmonary hypertension, exercise intolerance, dyspnea, and reduced quality of life.

The ideal treatment for PE patients at risk for progressive decompensation would allow for safe, rapid debulking of the pulmonary arteries (PA) to improve acute right heart strain and prevent long term consequences of pulmonary vascular obstruction. Historically, systemic and catheter‐directed thrombolytics have represented the dominant therapies to improve acute RV failure. In the landmark PEITHO trial, intermediate‐risk PE patients treated early with thrombolytics had less hemodynamic deterioration compared to anticoagulation alone. These results parallel earlier thrombolytic trials which included both intermediate‐risk and high‐risk PE patients. The consistent trade‐off with thrombolytic therapy in these trials, however, was an increased major bleeding rate of up to 10%, including an intracerebral hemorrhage rate of up to 2%. Therefore, the need for careful consideration of thrombolysis risks versus benefits has been paramount when considering advanced treatment.

Considering new fibrinolytic agents or regimens?

The use of thrombolytic agents is heterogeneous. Streptokinase was, historically, the main agent due to low cost and limited evidence in favour of other agents. Pharmaceutical engineering then developed 'second generation' fibrin-specific thrombolytic agents. The 'third generation' thrombolytics is characterised by improved pharmacokinetic properties, including a longer half-life due to a resistance to natural inhibitors; improved fibrin specificity and binding, which increased resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1) and reduced immunogenicity. However, despite a massive investment of the pharmaceutical industry, the effects of second-generation and third-generation thrombolytics are somewhat disappointing. Both fundamental and in vitro data from animal studies have not shown significant improvements. Streptokinase is still the most widely used thrombolytic for the treatment of acute MI and by extension, PE. As pointed by Levine 25 years ago, 'The risk of extracranial bleeding is virtually identical, regardless of the thrombolytic agent used within the approved dose ranges. Thus, the concept that relative fibrin specificity per se would protect against serious systemic bleeding has been proved incorrect'. he incidence of the three major conditions requiring thrombolysis, namely STEMI, PE and ischaemic stroke, is unlikely to decrease in the following years. We can only hope for further drug or drug regimen developments with better targeting of fibrin clot and decreased haemorrhagic events.

Reconsidering targets for the management of PE using tailored heparin and thrombolytic infusions?

The PEITHO study also emphasised the challenge of the concomitant use of heparin infusions. All patients from both the tenecteplase and control groups received a significant heparin bolus, which resulted in an activated partial thromboplastin time of 2.0–2.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. The safety outcome results in the intention-to-treat analysis were an 11.5% rate of major bleeding, a 6.3% rate of major extracranial bleeding and a 2% rate of haemorrhagic stroke. This high incidence of bleeding associated with thrombolysis is in contrast to the International Cooperative of Pulmonary Embolism Registry, which reported a 22% incidence of major bleeding and a 3% incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage. The major bleeding rate associated with heparin infusion alone in the same registry was approximately 15%.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease occurring in 60–112 per 100 000 people/year. According to prospective cohort studies, the case fatality rate in the acute phase ranges from 7 to 11%. – Nevertheless, acute PE represents a wide spectrum of clinical presentations with varying clinical outcomes. To guide the management of acute PE, the European Society of Cardiologyand the American Heart Associationhave proposed a three-level risk stratification scheme based on haemodynamic status and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) or myocardial injury. High-risk (or massive) PE is defined as an acute PE with sustained systemic arterial hypotension. Intermediate-risk (or submassive) PE is defined by the presence of RVD or injury in the absence of arterial hypotension. Finally, low-risk PE is defined by the absence of hypotension and of markers of RVD or injury.

In 1970, the first randomized trial comparing urokinase with heparin for patients with PE was publishedand 7 years later, streptokinase was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high-risk PE. Since then, thrombolytic therapy has been shown to induce faster clot dissolution and haemodynamic improvement compared with heparin alone. – However, more than three decades later, the role of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with non-high-risk PE remains controversial. Previous meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate a positive impact of thrombolytic treatment on total mortality and suggested an increase in major haemorrhage. – These studies were limited by the relatively small number of patients included in randomized trials.

Current guidelines recommend thrombolytic therapy for patients with high-risk PE in the absence of contraindications. Thrombolysis is not recommended on a routine basis for patients with intermediate-risk PE but may be considered following individual risk-to-benefit analysis. More recently, further evidence regarding the role of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute PE was published, including the large multicentre PEITHO trial.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing anticoagulation plus systemic thrombolysis with anticoagulation alone for patients with acute PE. We also sought to identify potential subgroups of patients with a favourable risk–benefit ratio and planned to separately analyse studies according to their criteria of PE severity.

4.2 Systemic Thrombolytic Versus AC Alone

For the management of acute intermediate PE, systemic thrombolytic therapy was compared to AC alone. Analyzing seven studies, the results showed no significant difference in all‐cause mortality between the systemic thrombolytic therapy group and the AC group (p = 0.1851, OR = −0.40, 95% CI [−1.00 to 0.19]), with negligible heterogeneity (I ² = 0.0%). Additionally, nine studies indicated no significant difference in in‐hospital mortality between the two groups (p = 0.4336, OR = −0.26, 95% CI [−0.92 to 0.40]), with negligible heterogeneity (I ² = 0.0%).

In terms of bleeding events, four studies revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.63, 95% CI [1.29 to 1.97]), with negligible heterogeneity (I ² = 0.0002%). Conversely, nine studies showed no significant difference in major bleeding between the two groups (p = 0.1142, OR = 0.71, 95% CI [−0.17 to 1.58]), although there was moderate heterogeneity (I ² = 33.5%).

The analysis also examined the recurrence of PE. Six studies indicated a significant reduction in recurrent PE with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = −1.97, 95% CI [−2.77 to −1.17]), with negligible heterogeneity (I ² = 0.0%). Moreover, seven studies demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy compared to AC alone (p < 0.0001, OR = −1.30, 95% CI [−1.70 to −0.90]), also with negligible heterogeneity (I ² = 0.0%).

These detailed findings provide valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness and safety of different treatment strategies for managing PE. The data underscore the benefits and risks associated with each treatment approach, guiding clinical decision‐making for optimal patient outcomes.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8879199e]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

Thrombolytic therapy induces faster clot dissolution than anticoagulation in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage. We reviewed the risks and benefits of thrombolytic therapy in the management of patients with acute PE.

Methods and results

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled studies comparing systemic thrombolytic therapy plus anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in patients with acute PE. Fifteen trials involving 2057 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality (OR; 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36–0.96). This reduction was not statistically significant after exclusion of studies including high-risk PE (OR; 0.64, 95% CI: 0.35–1.17). Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the combined endpoint of death or treatment escalation (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.22–0.53), PE-related mortality (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14–0.60) and PE recurrence (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.27–0.94). Major haemorrhage (OR; 2.91, 95% CI: 1.95–4.36) and fatal or intracranial bleeding (OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.25–8.11) were significantly more frequent among patients receiving thrombolysis.

Conclusions

Thrombolytic therapy reduces total mortality, PE recurrence, and PE-related mortality in patients with acute PE. The decrease in overall mortality is, however, not significant in haemodynamically stable patients with acute PE. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increase of major and fatal or intracranial haemorrhage.

### Perioperative and intermediate outcomes of patients with pulmonary embolism undergoing catheter-directed thrombolysis vs percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy [^748f13ce]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous interventions, including catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT), are currently performed in 6.6% of high-risk patients with PE. These endovascular options already promise an improved risk-benefit ratio and the technology continues to advance rapidly. Previous comparative analyses have favored CDT over systemic thrombolysis, with lower mortality (6.12% vs 14.9%), fewer readmissions (7.6% vs 10.6%), and fewer bleeding-related fatalities (8.4 vs 18.1%), and some practitioners have transitioned to catheter-based lysis as the preferred option. Most recently, new PMT devices have come onto the market, promising quicker clearance of thrombus, more rapid improvement in hemodynamics, and fewer bleeding complications with single-session treatment. However, despite its rapid adoption, there have not been robust data suggesting that PMT is, in fact, superior to CDT. In particular, one multi-center study reported a significantly lower total length of intensive care unit (ICU) time required for patients treated with PMT vs CDT (2.8 ± 3.0 days vs 3.8 ± 2.0; P = 0.009), but found no significant differences in mortality, bleeding, postprocedure mechanical support, or complications between the two groups.

Given this situation where clinical practice has run well ahead of robust supporting data, we would like to address this gap in the data by directly comparing outcomes between PMT and CDT for intermediate- to high-risk patients with PE. Our study focuses on the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of these evolving approaches, while adding to the literature helping clinicians choose between an array of treatment options. This direct comparison of two competing strategies contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting PMT as a safe, effective, and promising intervention for acute intermediate- and high-risk patients with PE.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^6eafa65d]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and outlook

The pathophysiology of life-threatening PE is a spiral of an acute increase in right ventricular afterload, ballooning, and increased wall tension of the right ventricle, leading to reduced perfusion, septal shift, impaired left ventricular function, and thus systemic malperfusion, eventually causing obstructive shock with right heart failure. High-risk patients should be offered full-dose thrombolysis in the absence of contraindications. Intermediate-risk patients not improving or deteriorating on anticoagulation alone, as well as high-risk patients with at least relative contraindications to thrombolysis, should be evaluated for thrombectomy. To date, the available data is not compelling enough to recommend catheter-directed thrombolysis as the interventional strategy of choice. Bleeding risks are still elevated compared to anticoagulation alone, and the incremental benefit of CDT over reduced-dose thrombolysis via a peripheral vein, which can be performed in the safe environment of an ICU, is unclear. Modern thrombectomy techniques have proven effective in reducing right ventricular afterload and improving hemodynamic and functional parameters. The goal of interventional treatment, based on current data, is to reduce right ventricular afterload or achieve hemodynamic stabilization, not necessarily complete thrombus clearance from the pulmonary arteries. However, for novel thrombectomy procedures only non-interventional observational studies are available so far. While these results are impressive, RCTs are lacking for the routine recommendation of thrombectomy in high-risk patients, potentially as an alternative to thrombolysis. For the two systems with the largest evidentiary basis to date, the Inari FlowTriever and the Penumbra Indigo Aspiration Systems, these trials are underway (Table 2). High-risk patients remain the most challenging cohort to study since it is ethically difficult to perform RCTs in patients with life-threatening conditions as these studies are likely to suffer from high bias due to crossover between treatment arms. Acute PE not only carries significant mortality but also causes considerable morbidity due to post-PE syndromes and CTEPH. Whether modern catheter techniques can reduce the incidence of these conditions by decreasing thrombus burden and how this might influence the technical endpoints of intervention as well as patient selection is also the subject of ongoing studies.

### Thrombolysis for acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^18547b57]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism is controversial. To compare with anticoagulation alone, no analysis before has determined whether thrombolytic therapy is associated with improved survival or lower incidence of adverse clinical outcomes for intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.

Objective

This meta-analysis was performed to assess mortality benefits, bleeding and recurrent pulmonary embolism risks associated with thrombolytic therapy compared with anticoagulation in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.

Methods

The Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing thrombolytic therapy with anticoagulation in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism patients (in which the mortality data were reported) from inception to August 5, 2014. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism and minor bleeding. The pooled relative risk (RR), Mantel-Haenszel corresponding method and fixed-effect model were used to estimate the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Eight clinical randomized controlled trials involving 1755 patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism were included. Patients treated with thrombolytics presented lower mortality than patients in the anticoagulation cohort (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28–0.97; 1.39% [12/866] vs. 2.92% [26/889]). Compared with anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a higher risk of major (RR, 3.35; 95% CI, 2.03–5.54; 7.80% [64/820] vs. 2.28% [19/834]) and minor (RR, 3.66; 95% CI, 2.77–4.84; 32.78% [197/601] vs. 8.94% [53/593]) bleeding. Furthermore, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a lower incidence of recurrent pulmonary embolism (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15–0.73; 0.73% [6/826] vs. 2.72% [23/846]).

Conclusion

Compared with anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism is associated with lower all-cause mortality and recurrent pulmonary embolism risk despite increased major and minor bleeding risks.

### Large-bore mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: primary results of the PEERLESS randomized controlled trial [^901a875d]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

A positive finding across treatment arms was the overall low rate of all-cause mortality within 30 days of intervention, which was similar for LBMT and CDT (0.4% and 0.8%; P = 0.62). PEITHO reported a 3.2% 30-day all-cause mortality rate with therapeutic anticoagulation. Furthermore, a meta-analysis reported 2.9% acute mortality in patients with intermediate-risk PE treated with anticoagulation in 8 RCTs. In PEERLESS, 94.7% of patients were classified as having intermediate-high-risk PE, indicating increased risk of early mortality. The all-cause mortality rates observed for both interventions were nominally lower than historical reports for medical management, suggesting that this patient population can undergo catheter-based therapy with a low likelihood of mortality. However, although these mortality rates are encouraging for intervention broadly, the relative influence of treatment effect versus patient population on these outcomes remains unknown without comparison against conservative medical management. The lack of comparison with anticoagulation alone as the standard of care for intermediate-risk PE is a major limitation of this study. Several RCTs are investigating this important question, including the ongoing PEERLESS II trial, HI-PEITHO trial (Higher-Risk Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis), and PE-TRACT trial (Pulmonary Embolism–Thrombus Removal With Catheter-Directed Therapy). –

The extent to which clinical outcomes observed in this study can be generalized to the broader PE patient population at large is unknown, especially in terms of ICH and major bleeding outcomes. Despite careful efforts during study design, we were ultimately unable to enroll patients with bleeding risks representative of the PE population encountered in routine practice. Therefore, our ability to draw conclusions about comparative bleeding outcomes is limited. The low prevalence of relative contraindications to thrombolytics (4.2%) and VTE-BLEED scores ≥ 2 (26.4%), coupled with the brisk rate of enrollment in the nonrandomized LBMT registry for patients with contraindications to thrombolytics (n = 142), including 57 (40.1%) who were enrolled because of a condition other than the absolute contraindications prespecified in the study protocol, suggests that clinical equipoise may have shifted during the study. This observation is consistent with contemporary analyses from real-world administrative databases that report that mechanical thrombectomy is being used in an increasing proportion of acute PE cases at the expense of CDT.

Future considerations in patient management

Improving patient selection for thrombolysis in PE

The variable clinical results for thrombolysis in PE have been influenced by inappropriate patient selection, for which adverse events and bleeding risks have outweighed the benefits of clot fragmentation. An important challenge in PE management is patient risk stratification. Cho et al showed that in haemodynamically stable patients with PE 37% had evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on ultrasound assessment. Grifoni et al confirmed in their prospective clinical outcome study that 30% of normotensive patients had RV dysfunction with 10% progressing to shock with a hospital mortality of 50%. These patients with latent haemodynamic impairment may require more aggressive therapeutic strategies.

Offering thrombolysis as a rescue therapy in decompensating patients?

One approach is to treat patients with RV dysfunction but no shock with a heparin infusion, and use thrombolysis as a bailout therapy for the decompensating patient. The risk–benefit analysis would be easier to justify. However, the results of the PEITHO randomised trial did not favour this approach, probably because the key treatment of cor pulmonale is removal of the causa prima. More than 1000 patients with moderate to severe (but all intermediate-risk) PE with RV dysfunction who received thrombolysis showed a statistically significant reduction in morbimortality within the 7 days after randomisation (death or haemodynamic decompensation: OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.02). Moreover, in the heparin-only group, 23 patients died despite 15 of them receiving thrombolysis (with tenecteplase) as rescue therapy. We may also emphasise that causes of death at 30 days in the placebo group included three haemodynamic collapses, three recurrent PEs, three respiratory failures and two sudden and unexplained deaths, and haemodynamic collapses were three times more frequent in the heparin-only group (1.6% vs 5%, OR 0.30, 95% IC 0.14 to 0.68), P = 0.002). Therefore, the PEITHO randomised trial demonstrated that in patients with RV dysfunction heparin infusion without thrombolysis or with delayed thrombolysis may increase mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, any potential advantage of thrombolysis was counterbalanced by a five times increased risk of major bleeds and a 10-fold increased risk of (mainly haemorrhagic) stroke.

### Interventional therapies for pulmonary embolism [^f219a356]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the leading cause of in-hospital death and the third most frequent cause of cardiovascular death. The clinical presentation of PE is variable, and choosing the appropriate treatment for individual patients can be challenging. Traditionally, treatment of PE has involved a choice of anticoagulation, thrombolysis or surgery; however, a range of percutaneous interventional technologies have been developed that are under investigation in patients with intermediate-high-risk or high-risk PE. These interventional technologies include catheter-directed thrombolysis (with or without ultrasound assistance), aspiration thrombectomy and combinations of the aforementioned principles. These interventional treatment options might lead to a more rapid improvement in right ventricular function and pulmonary and/or systemic haemodynamics in particular patients. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials on the safety and efficacy of these interventions compared with conservative therapies is lacking. In this Review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology of PE, provide assistance with decision-making on patient selection and critically appraise the available clinical evidence on interventional, catheter-based approaches for PE treatment. Finally, we discuss future perspectives and unmet needs.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^00d1526e]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

I feel it is too unsafe to perform thrombolysis: what are the surgical and non-surgical alternatives?

If thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated and a patient has significant accessible PE and persisting haemodynamic compromise then embolectomy, performed by an open surgical or catheter-based approach, should be considered. Older case series observed mortality rates for surgical embolectomy of > 20%; however an intraoperative mortality of 6% was reported in 47 consecutive patients. Catheter-directed therapies include mechanical disruption of thrombi by catheter, ultrasound or pressurised saline injection. Suction may be used to perform thrombectomy or aspirate fragments of macerated emboli following other techniques. A recent meta-analysis observed 87% clinical success. Local intra-clot thrombolytic was used in 67% of cases and was associated with superior clinical success, postulated due to increased thrombus surface area exposed to thrombolysis after fragmentation. Major complications of catheter-directed therapy including pulmonary artery rupture and massive haemoptysis were seen in 2.4% of cases while haemodynamic deterioration due to fragmented emboli was unpredictable. Although the incidence of major bleeding in the meta-analysis was low (18 non-cerebral haemorrhages requiring transfusion and 1 intra-cerebral haemorrhage reported in 594 patients) the absolute risk of bleeding related to intra-clot thrombolysis in an individual patient with a contraindication to systemic thrombolysis is not clear. There are few data comparing thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy and catheter-based intervention as primary treatment for massive PE. Current guidelines restrict surgical embolectomy to situations when thrombolysis has failed or is contraindicated. Although there is increasing interest in the expansion of surgical embolectomy to the initial management of massive PE, randomised trial data are required.

Suggested approach: No comparative data exist to guide primary management of massive PE in the presence of a strong contraindication to systemic thrombolysis. Management is dependent on local availability of cardiothoracic surgery and catheter-based therapy.

### Thrombolytic therapy vs. anticoagulation for PE… [^e885022a]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

to the editor: We read with interest Dr. Almoosa's article, "Is Thrombolytic Therapy Effective for Pulmonary Embolism. ", 1 and would like to comment on some points. Thrombolytic therapy results in more clot lysis than treatment with heparin alone. 2 However, both treatments produce similar improvement in pulmonary perfusion. 2 So, the answer to the title question is, yes, thrombolytic therapy is effective for pulmonary embolism. What remains debatable are the indications of thrombolytic agents in PE. 3 was only capable of demonstrating a mortality benefit greater than 15 to 20 percent. Lesser reductions would not have been detected. Other trials showed a trend toward reduction in mortality in the group treated with thrombolysis, but mortality was not significantly altered. 4 If more patients had been included, statistical significance might have been reached.

One small trial 5 has shown a dramatic survival advantage favoring thrombolytic therapy in patients with massive PE and systemic hypoperfusion. Those patients are now considered to have an absolute indication for thrombolytic therapy. 2 Therefore, the appropriate treatment for PE should be based on risk stratification rather than a global approach. Among hemodynamically stable patients, those with anatomically small clots that cause no elevation in pulmonary artery pressure and no right ventricular dysfunction, the potential advantages of thrombolysis are counterbalanced by its risks and costs. The appropriate treatment in such patients remains heparin anticoagulation. Patients with normal hemodynamic parameters but right ventricular dysfunction generate the most controversy with regard to treatment. 2 Right ventricular dysfunction clearly defines patients at high risk for clinical deterioration, and these patients are excellent candidates for thrombolytic therapy.

3 A recent trial 6 that evaluated 719 patients with right ventricular dysfunction reported a 30-day mortality of 11. 1 percent in the anticoagulant group, compared with
4. 7 percent in the thrombolytic group. Most important, a statistically significant reduction was achieved in the rate of PE recurrence:

18. 7 percent versus
7. 7 percent, in the thrombolytic group and anticoagulant group, respectively. Although this trial was not randomized, the results might have some validity. As with acute myocardial infarction, one would expect that a larger randomized multicenter study will eventually give the definitive indications for thrombolytic therapy in such patients.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^2c38fe34]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included having undergone major surgery within the past 3 weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52), weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37), and having at least one of the following characteristics (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting more than 10 min, bilirubin level greater than 3 mg/dL, or dementia.

The systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute intermediate PE did not show a significant impact on all‐cause or in‐hospital mortality compared to AC alone. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that while thrombolytic therapy can be beneficial in high‐risk PE, its advantages in intermediate‐risk PE are less clear. However, our analysis revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy, which corroborates the known bleeding risks associated with thrombolytics. Interestingly, the significant reduction in recurrent PE and clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy suggests that it may offer protective benefits against PE recurrence and subsequent complications. These findings support the notion that systemic thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in preventing the progression and recurrence of PE, particularly in patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration.

### Systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54bdef90]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The benefits of thrombolytic therapy must be weighed against the risk of haemorrhagic complications. The rate of major bleeding complications reported in our meta-analysis in patients allocated to thrombolytic therapy (9.9%) is similar to that reported by Wan et al.(9.1%) and Dong et al.(10.4%). In contrast to our meta-analysis, these previous reports failed to demonstrate a significant association between thrombolytic therapy and major bleeding. This difference appears to result mainly from the inclusion of the PEITHO trial in our meta-analysis, which included more patients than all other studies together and a higher proportion of elderly patients with a higher bleeding risk. Interestingly, our subgroup analysis suggested a higher risk for both major bleeding and fatal or intracranial haemorrhage in patients treated by tenecteplase compared with those treated with alteplase, probably because two of the three studies using tenecteplase, had the oldest populations of all 15 studies included in this meta-analysis. As also previously reported by others, the inclusion of older patients was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in our analysis.

Given the non-negligible risks of systemic thrombolytic treatment and the relatively low risk of early mortality among patients with acute PE, research has recently focused on minimization of thrombolysis-related risks by dose reduction, a strategy of catheter-delivered, ultrasound-assisted administration of thrombolytic treatment, and the identification of intermediate-risk patients with a potentially favourable risk-to-benefit ratio for thrombolytic therapy. Identification of intermediate-risk patients based on RVD and/or laboratory biomarkers was performed in three studies, with a trend towards reduced mortality of borderline significance. Right ventricular dysfunction and laboratory markers of myocardial injury have been widely validated as adverse prognostic markers in patients with PE. – However, the observed mortality rate in the control group (2.6%) in studies including intermediate-risk PE, was lower than reported in large cohort studies of unselected PE patients, which may have limited the conclusiveness of this subgroup analysis. This low mortality rate might be explained by the selection criteria of randomized trials and probably also by the close monitoring of the patients included in the trials on intermediate-risk PE. Since most of the studies included PE patients with a wide spectrum of severity, an individual data meta-analysis is warranted to specifically assess treatment benefit in patients with intermediate risk PE, or to identify a subgroup of patients with a favourable risk–benefit ratio.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — systemic thrombolysis recommendations: in patients with acute PE associated with hypotension (eg, systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) and without a high bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (Grade 2B). In most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, we recommend against systemically administered thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In selected patients with acute PE who deteriorate after starting anticoagulant therapy but have yet to develop hypotension and who have a low bleeding risk, we suggest systemically administered thrombolytic therapy over no such therapy (Grade 2C).

### Thrombolysis compared with heparin for the initial treatment of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials [^5533bf8c]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials and meta-analyses have reached conflicting conclusions about the role of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods and Results

We performed a meta-analysis of all randomized trials comparing thrombolytic therapy with heparin in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Eleven trials, involving 748 patients, were included. Compared with heparin, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death (6.7% versus 9.6%; OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.12, P for heterogeneity = 0.48), a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding (9.1% versus 6.1%; OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.46), and a significant increase in nonmajor bleeding (22.7% versus 10.0%; OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.54; number needed to harm = 8). Thrombolytic therapy compared with heparin was associated with a significant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death in trials that also enrolled patients with major (hemodynamically unstable) pulmonary embolism (9.4% versus 19.0%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92; number needed to treat = 10) but not in trials that excluded these patients (5.3% versus 4.8%; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.30), with significant heterogeneity between these 2 groups of trials (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Currently available data provide no evidence for a benefit of thrombolytic therapy compared with heparin for the initial treatment of unselected patients with acute pulmonary embolism. A benefit is suggested in those at highest risk of recurrence or death. The number of patients enrolled in randomized trials to date is modest, and further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute pulmonary embolism appears warranted.

### Mechanical thrombectomy vs catheter-directed thrombolysis for high-risk pulmonary embolism: a target trial emulation [^4c4a10a6]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this largest cohort of older adults hospitalized for high-risk PE, patients treated with MT and CDT experienced similar short-term and long-term mortality. While both treatment modalities may be equally effective, future randomized clinical trials confirming the causal relationship of MT and CDT with patient outcomes of high-risk PE are warranted.

Perspective

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: In high-risk PE, this observational study implementing a target trial emulation framework found no evidence that mortality, readmission, and bleeding events differed between patients treated with MT vs CDT.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Randomized clinical trials are needed to verify the causal effects of MT vs CDT in patients with high-risk PE, as well as the causal effects of catheter-based therapies vs the standard of care.

### All contraindications to thrombolysis for life-threatening pulmonary embolus should be considered relative [^52867ae8]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal; however, timely thrombolytic therapy can be life saving. Guidelines advocate the use of thrombolysis for massive PE in patients with an acceptable bleeding-risk profile. Nonetheless, estimating what constitutes an acceptable bleeding risk in those with life-threatening PE is a clinical challenge, and even contraindications considered 'absolute' may present lesser risk than leaving PE untreated. We discuss the case of a 77-year-old man who received thrombolysis for a massive PE 4 weeks following admission with a significant intracerebral bleed. There was rapid resolution of hypotension and hypoxia and he survived to be discharged home. This case is used to illustrate that no potential therapy should be discounted in patients faced with acute life-threatening PE. Decisions to thrombolyse patients with traditional contraindications-even those considered absolute-must be taken by clinicians able to weigh relative risks.

### Perioperative and intermediate outcomes of patients with pulmonary embolism undergoing catheter-directed thrombolysis vs percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy [^40e11ca4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Multicenter retrospective analysis of prospectively collected registry data (TriNetX database).
- **Key Findings**: Propensity score-matched acute pulmonary embolism patients, treated with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy vs catheter-directed thrombolysis (1102 patients) demonstrated a lower risk of perioperative bleeding complications and hemodynamic improvement with less pulmonary hypertension and myocardial infarction with mechanical thrombectomy. Long-term chronic pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure rates were also lower.
- **Take Home Message**: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is associated with a superior safety profile and possibly improved long-term clinical outcomes.

Over the past two decades, the incidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) has doubled with 60,000 to 100,000 patients dying from PE in the United States each year. This increase has prompted a critical examination of existing treatment modalities and protocols. Currently, the most common guideline-based treatment options for massive and submassive PE are systemic thrombolysis or open surgical thromboembolectomy. Interestingly, clinical practices seem to have diverged somewhat from clinical guidelines, with studies indicating that only 30% of unstable patients with PE receive systemic thrombolytics. Presumably, practitioners are concerned about a major bleeding rate of > 20% with thrombolytics, and the perioperative complications of open surgical thromboembolectomy, which is often considered too invasive for elderly patients. Newer catheter-based options for thrombus aspiration have emerged as promising alternatives for the treatment of massive and submassive PE in the absence of robust supporting data.

### Thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism… [^7c33d098]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

More recent consensus guidelines have cited a pressing need for outcomes data regarding thrombolytics from contemporary trials, especially in hemodynamically stable patients with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. 7 Several recent trials have evaluated the role of thrombolytics in PE for these patients without definitive results, particularly for the end point of mortality. 8–11 Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of all randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy in PE. We aimed to ascertain associations of thrombolytic therapy with bleeding risk and potential mortality benefits, with special attention paid to the subpopulation of patients presenting with intermediate-risk PE. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a greater risk of major bleeding compared with anticoagulant therapy. There was a 9.

24% rate of major bleeding in the thrombolytic therapy cohort and a
3. 42% rate in the anticoagulation cohort. With the exclusion of ULTIMA, the analysis of trials of intermediate-risk PE revealed a persistent association with lower mortality. Major bleeding remained associated with use of thrombolytics in each case. These findings are consistent with reports from the Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis trial, the largest randomized trial of thrombolytic therapy in PE, which showed higher rates of bleeding outcomes in elderly patients older than 75 years. 8 It should be noted that all included trials specified standard exclusion criteria for thrombolytic therapy, including recent major surgery or trauma; active or recent bleeding; intracranial trauma, hemorrhage, or mass; severe uncontrolled hypertension; pregnancy; and recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, among others.

Thrombolytic therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality in patients with PE, including the subset of patients with hemodynamically stable PE associated with RV dysfunction. The associated risks of major bleeding and ICH were significantly elevated with thrombolytic therapy, although there may be reduced harm in patients younger than 65 years. Results reported here should not be construed to apply to patients with low-risk PE.

### Mechanical thrombectomy vs catheter-directed thrombolysis for high-risk pulmonary embolism: a target trial emulation [^96234256]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death across the globe, and the in-hospital mortality of high-risk (ie, hemodynamically unstable) PE can range up to 50%. In particular, the mortality of older adults with PE has been reported to be 5 times higher than the younger population, even after survival to discharge.

While the treatment modalities generally include anticoagulation and systemic thrombolysis, there have been advancements in catheter-based therapies (CBTs), including percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). MT is a technique where a large-bore aspiration catheter is advanced to the pulmonary artery to remove the thrombi obstructing the pulmonary arterial flow. CDT entails the local infusions of low-dose thrombolytics, sometimes with ultrasound assistance, in the pulmonary artery. These newer modalities have been gaining attention due to their potential to restore pulmonary circulation safely and effectively by reducing clot burden without administering full-dose thrombolytics or any thrombolytics at all. Indeed, the current guidelines recommend CBTs as class IIa for patients with high bleeding risk based on the previous reports evaluating short-term outcomes or surrogate endpoints.,

Recently, the PEERLESS trial showed similar 7-day mortality and bleeding risks between the patients with intermediate-risk PE treated with MT vs CDT. However, questions remain about which of the 2 modalities, MT or CDT, yields more favorable outcomes in the high-risk PE with longer follow-up. In particular, given the high morbidity and mortality of PE even after survival to discharge in older adults, evaluating comparative outcomes of this population with extended follow-up will be informative.

In this study, we implemented a target trial emulation framework to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of MT vs CDT in high-risk PE and to provide insights into the longer-term outcomes in the older population.

### Impact of the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy on the mortality of patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^1c8a74bd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear. Previous meta-analyses have not separately reported the proportion of patients with submassive PE.

Objective

We assessed the effect of thrombolytic therapy on mortality, recurrent PE, clinical deterioration requiring treatment escalation and bleeding in patients with submassive PE.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized controlled trials comparing adjunctive thrombolytic therapy with heparin alone as initial treatments in patients with acute submassive PE, and reported 30-day mortality or in-hospital clinical outcomes.

Results

A total of 1510 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. No significant differences were apparent in the composite endpoint of all-cause death or recurrent PE between the adjunctive thrombolytic therapy arm and the heparin-alone arm (3.1% vs. 5.4%; RR, 0.64 [0.32–1.28]; P = 0.2). Adjunctive thrombolytic therapy significantly reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of all-cause death or clinical deterioration (3.9% vs. 9.4%; RR, 0.44; P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant associations for major bleeding when adjunctive thrombolytic therapy was compared with heparin therapy alone (6.6% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.2).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that adjunctive thrombolytic therapy does not significantly reduce the risk of mortality or recurrent PE in patients with acute submassive PE, but that adjuvant thrombolytic therapy prevents clinical deterioration requiring the escalation of treatment in patients with acute submassive PE. Bleeding risk assessment might be the most successful approach for improving clinical outcomes and patient-specific benefit.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^7cc0baf6]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Increased bleeding risk following thrombolysis in PE

The treatment of PE has followed a similar path to that of MI both in terms of therapeutic advancements and changes in management. Thus, understanding the effects of thrombolysis in ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), for which numerous very large randomised studies have been conducted, undoubtedly helps to understand the effects in patients with PE. In 1992, Levine et al reviewed the haemorrhagic complications of thrombolytic therapy in both MI and venous thromboembolism. First, the authors observed a higher rate of bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE compared with MI. They hypothesised that this could be due to a more prolonged period of lytic therapy, as well as an increase in patient comorbidities. Second, they identified older age, smaller stature and female gender as risk factors for major extracranial bleeding in patients with MI. These were also risk factors for intracranial bleeding in PE. Additionally, aggressive adjunctive therapy with heparin increased the risk of intracranial bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^fb114de3]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment recommendations according to current guidelines

Clinical management of PE with high mortality risk includes cautious volume administration, aggressive oxygenation and treatment of hypercapnia, with a low threshold for vasopressors and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators for refractory hypoxemia. Intubation should be avoided due to the risk of transient hypoxemia, hypotension, sedation-related suppression of endogenous sympathetic activation and the risk of worsening right ventricular afterload from positive pressure ventilation. All patients should receive anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Based on robust meta-analyses registries, the 2019 ESC guidelines recommend systemic thrombolysis for high-risk patients or those of lower risk but signs of clinical deterioration (class 1b recommendation), while catheter-based procedures are reserved for cases where thrombolysis is contraindicated or ineffective (class IIa) (Fig. 1). Due to the high procedural success rates of novel thrombectomy devices and signals of reduced mortality and bleeding risks, a 2022 ESC consensus statement proposes interventional strategies as viable alternative to thrombolysis for deteriorating intermediate-risk patients, even in the absence of thrombolytic contraindications. Surgical embolectomy is reserved for cases with significant clot-in-transit or failure of less invasive alternatives with 30-day mortality and 5-year survival rates similar to thrombolysis in elected patients and experienced centers. The placement of cava filters for the prevention of further embolization belonged to the earliest interventions offered in PE and is still considered when anticoagulation is contraindicated or fails. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) can serve as a bridging strategy for catastrophic PE until definitive treatment.

### Catheter directed lysis and thrombectomy of submassive pulmonary embolism [^abf93997]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially highly morbid disease. However, there are a broad range of clinical presentations, varying from asymptomatic to life-threatening hemodynamic compromise. Accordingly, the aggressiveness of treatment for acute PE must be adjusted to the acuity of the presentation and patient-specific comorbidities. Thrombolysis is FDA approved for massive PE with hemodynamic compromise. However, this therapy has associated risk, most notably intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding complications. This has prompted interest in catheter-directed therapies to mechanically remove thrombus and to locally deliver reduced doses of thrombolytics. Guidelines support use of this catheter-based strategy in cases of increased bleeding risk or high acuity with insufficient time for systemic pharmacologic therapy to be effective. We present the case of an 83-year-old man with acute high-risk PE and worsening hemodynamic and respiratory status who was treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and rheolytic thrombectomy. There was significant improvement in thrombus burden, symptoms, and hemodynamic parameters including right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressures. However, his course was complicated by intracranial hemorrhage and access site hematoma, demonstrating that even reduced doses and local delivery of thrombolytics do not ensure freedom from bleeding complications.

### Endovascular treatments of acute pulmonary embolism in the post-fibrinolytic era: an up-to-date review [^d4b6984d]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Future perspectives

Mechanical thrombectomy for PE is undergoing rapid advancements, both in the novelties brought by the manufacturers and in clinical evidence to guide treatment choices. As such, taking into account the important results obtained in ongoing randomized trials, thrombectomy is gaining authority and popularity in the treatment of specific clinical conditions. However, the main issue is to tailor treatment for patients given the variety of available options and clinical scenarios. While randomized trials are essential for evidence-based decision making, it's impractical to compare each method of mechanical thrombectomy with each other or with systemic therapy for every PE scenario. Although RCT's comparing aspiration catheters to other therapies are ongoing, to the best of our knowledge to date there are no completed RCT's comparing mechanical thrombo-aspiration devices to other therapies, leaving clinicians to base their decisions on well-conducted prospective single-arm studies.

While acute PE studies highlighting clinical improvements often focus on short-term outcomes, the long-term effects and the association with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and functional impairment in survivors are crucial but challenging to investigate. In conclusion, aspirational thrombectomy for PE may offer a valid solution for both patients with intermediate and high risk by preventing immediate hemodynamic deterioration and by reducing post-hospital mortality rates. The use of thrombolysis is less frequently necessary as the clot may be quickly removed mechanically in most of the cases. The field is evolving rapidly with ongoing trials, but the main challenge is integrating this growing evidence into individualized care pathways for the diverse needs of acute PE patients.

Objective

This review discusses the most recent data on the endovascular methods currently available for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), with a special focus on mechanical thrombectomy. Systemic thrombolysis does not appear sufficient to reduce mortality in patients who develop hemodynamic instability and is inevitably linked with significant side-effects such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and other major adverse effects (MAEs). Furthermore, even patients who initially appear stable may deteriorate and become unstable if PE is extensive. Aspiration thrombectomy may offer a valid solution for such patients offering fast clinical improvement without the high risk of hemorrhagic complications, as demonstrated by several single-arm studies and interim-results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We haven't yet reached a post-fibrinolytic era however there is no doubt that there is a number of valid solutions available that need to be taken into consideration for the management of such patients.

### Thrombolytic therapy in acute venous thromboembolism [^3f3c0a41]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), the use of thrombolytic agents or thrombectomy is required to immediately restore blood flow to thrombosed vessels. Nevertheless, systemic thrombolysis has not clearly been shown to improve outcomes in patients with large clot burdens in the lung or legs as compared with anticoagulation alone; this is in part due to the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage in a small percentage of patients to whom therapeutic doses of a thrombolytic drug are administered. Algorithms have been developed to identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes resulting from large clot burdens and at low risk for major bleeding in an effort to improve outcomes in those receiving thrombolytic therapy. In acute pulmonary embolism (PE), hemodynamic instability is the key determinant of short-term survival and should prompt consideration of immediate thrombolysis. In hemodynamically stable PE, systemic thrombolysis is not recommended and should be used as rescue therapy if clinical deterioration occurs. Evidence is accumulating regarding the efficacy of administering reduced doses of thrombolytic agents systemically or via catheters directly into thrombi in an effort to lower bleed rates. In acute deep venous thrombosis, catheter-directed thrombolysis with thrombectomy can be used in severe or limb-threatening thrombosis but has not been shown to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. Because the management of acute VTE can be complex, having a rapid-response team (ie, PE response team) composed of physicians from different specialties may aid in the management of severely affected patients.

### Mechanical thrombectomy vs catheter-directed thrombolysis for high-risk pulmonary embolism: a target trial emulation [^8eabdd40]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications

Our findings did not indicate the significant survival benefits of MT over CDT or vice versa. Theoretically, MT is expected to be more effective for larger clots in the proximal parts of the pulmonary artery, while CDT can be effective for smaller clots in the distal parts, given the nature of thrombolytic infusions. Although our data lack granularity with regard to the locations of the emboli or their hemodynamic influence, it should be noted that the presence of hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest itself does not necessarily determine the optimal modality of the interventions. Additionally, the similar outcomes following MT vs CDT in this study will be informative in the absence of completed randomized trials, since our analyses provided the comparative outcomes of older adults according to the modalities using the largest sample size available to date. Currently, the standard of care for high-risk PE is prompt reperfusion with systemic thrombolysis, with the cost of a high risk of bleeding. Future trials should focus on the effectiveness of MT or CDT compared to the standard of care, especially in patients with a high risk of bleeding.

Study Limitations

Our study had limitations. First, our estimations were subject to the influence of unmeasured confounders. Our databases did not include information on vital signs, pulmonary artery pressure, or echocardiographic/radiologic imaging, which can contribute to residual confounding. However, it should be noted that our IV analysis, which can potentially overcome unmeasured confounding, also showed no evidence that the mortality differed between the 2 groups. Second, detailed information on the treatment regimen was not available. Since the dose and duration of thrombolytics infusion or the diameter of the catheter introducers can affect the outcomes, future studies with prespecified regimens will be beneficial. Third, since data extraction using ICD-10 codes is not 100% sensitive or specific, there may be a misclassification bias. In particular, the absolute incidences of some outcomes, such as intracranial hemorrhage, were few, which prevented us from performing reliable estimation. However, as the positive predictive value of ICD-10 codes for intracranial hemorrhage was reported to be high in another database, the impacts of this bias on the estimation on a relative scale in our study might not be of substantial concern. Fourth, our analysis for health care spending was relatively underpowered, as we conducted complete case analyses for health care spending by linking a 20% random sample of the Carrier file. Fifth, our findings may not be applicable to the younger population since we focused on individuals aged 65 to 99 years.

### Pulmonary embolism in 2017: how we got here and where are we going? [^fb3ec8e6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, both the Urokinase Pulmonary Embolism and Urokinase-Streptokinase Pulmonary Embolism trials began the quest to develop thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). The goals of these studies were the immediate reduction in clot burden, restoration of hemodynamic stability, and improved survival. Major bleeding became the major barrier for clinicians to employ these therapies. From 1980s to the present time, a number of studies using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for achieving these same above outcomes were completed but major bleeding continued to remain an adoption barrier. Finally, the concept of bringing the thrombolytic agent into the clot has entered the quest for the Holy Grail in the treatment of PE. This article will review all the major trials using peripheral thrombolysis and provide insight into the need for a team approach to pulmonary care (Pulmonary Embolism Response Team), standardization of pulmonary classification, and the need for trials designed for both short- and long-term outcomes using thrombolysis for selected PE populations.

### Outcomes in high-risk pulmonary embolism patients undergoing flowTriever mechanical thrombectomy or other contemporary therapies: results from the FLAME study [^48b3195a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemodynamically unstable high-risk, or massive, pulmonary embolism (PE) has a reported in-hospital mortality of over 25%. Systemic thrombolysis is the guideline-recommended treatment despite limited evidence. The FLAME study (FlowTriever for Acute Massive PE) was designed to generate evidence for interventional treatments in high-risk PE.

Methods

The FLAME study was a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel group, observational study of high-risk PE. Eligible patients were treated with FlowTriever mechanical thrombectomy (FlowTriever Arm) or with other contemporary therapies (Context Arm). The primary end point was an in-hospital composite of all-cause mortality, bailout to an alternate thrombus removal strategy, clinical deterioration, and major bleeding. This was compared in the FlowTriever Arm to a prespecified performance goal derived from a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 53 patients were enrolled in the FlowTriever Arm and 61 in the Context Arm. Context Arm patients were primarily treated with systemic thrombolysis (68.9%) or anticoagulation alone (23.0%). The primary end point was reached in 9/53 (17.0%) FlowTriever Arm patients, significantly lower than the 32.0% performance goal (P < 0.01). The primary end point was reached in 39/61 (63.9%) Context Arm patients. In-hospital mortality occurred in 1/53 (1.9%) patients in the FlowTriever Arm and in 18/61 (29.5%) patients in the Context Arm.

Conclusions

Among patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy with the FlowTriever System, a significantly lower associated rate of in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes was observed compared with a prespecified performance goal, primarily driven by low all-cause mortality of 1.9%.

### Pulmonary embolism: risk assessment and management [^cd841f2f]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant burden on health and survival. Its severity ranges from asymptomatic, incidentally discovered subsegmental thrombi to massive, pressor-dependent PE complicated by cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. Rapid and accurate risk stratification is therefore of paramount importance to ensure the highest quality of care. This article critically reviews currently available and emerging tools for risk-stratifying acute PE, and particularly for distinguishing between elevated (intermediate) and low risk among normotensive patients. We focus on the potential value of risk assessment strategies for optimizing severity-adjusted management. Apart from reviewing the current evidence on advanced early therapy of acute PE (thrombolysis, surgery, catheter interventions, vena cava filters), we discuss recent advances in oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, and with new direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to profound changes in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism in the near future.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^5e19b509]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) position statements — catheter-directed therapy (CDT) for pulmonary embolism (PE): SIR notes that no intracranial bleeding events were observed in the latest prospective studies and that available evidence has not shown an advantage of higher‑cost US‑assisted thrombolysis catheters versus standard infusion catheters; SIR recognizes methodologic limitations of existing studies for submassive PE and that the impact of early CDT on long‑term risk of post‑PE syndrome (PPS) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) remains unclear; a research consensus panel including 19 experts concluded that a randomized trial of CDT versus anticoagulation alone is a primary research priority; SIR supports the use of CDT in carefully selected patients with proximal acute massive PE, states that at present the available data are insufficient to support the routine use of CDT for patients with submassive PE and that such patients should be closely monitored for deterioration with multidisciplinary notification, encourages data collection with institutional review board oversight and strongly recommends periodic review for quality improvement with careful bleeding risk assessment, and suggests precautions including that patients should be routinely observed in an advanced care unit, US guidance for venous puncture should be routinely used to reduce bleeding risk, and use of the AngioJet Rheolytic Thrombectomy System should probably be avoided except in the context of a prospective study.

### Outcomes in high-risk pulmonary embolism patients undergoing flowTriever mechanical thrombectomy or other contemporary therapies: results from the FLAME study [^1236a36a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

See Editorial by

High-risk, or massive, pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized by hemodynamic instability and right ventricular (RV) strain leading to acute right heart failure, hemodynamic collapse, and death, with reported in-hospital mortality over 25%. – Current treatment guidelines recommend prompt initiation of anticoagulation followed by reperfusion treatment with systemic thrombolytic therapy. These guidelines are based on limited data. Additionally, randomized trials of systemic thrombolysis in largely intermediate-risk patients have demonstrated major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage rates of 9.2% and 1.5%, respectively. These bleeding risks are greater in high-risk PE populations.

Data in high-risk PE patients are generally lacking, as these patients have been largely excluded from randomized trials and single-arm studies of PE treatments. – A retrospective multicenter study of large-bore mechanical thrombectomy (LBMT) in a patient population including high-risk PE and severely ill intermediate-risk PE showed excellent outcomes with 97% of patients surviving through follow-up. But with limited high-quality clinical evidence available for interventional treatments in high-risk PE, guidelines recommend catheter-directed treatment only in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis or who fail systemic thrombolytic treatment.

Interventional studies in high-risk PE have inherent randomization challenges related to the low incidence, the emergent presentation, and likely high rates of crossover or combined treatment approaches. Given these challenges, nonrandomized studies with prespecified performance goals were suggested by a Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association as an important initial step to generate evidence in this population. The FLAME study (FlowTriever for Acute Massive PE) was designed based on this Scientific Statement to evaluate outcomes in consecutive high-risk PE patients treated with LBMT using a prespecified performance goal developed from a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.

### Outcomes in high-risk pulmonary embolism patients undergoing flowTriever mechanical thrombectomy or other contemporary therapies: results from the FLAME study [^19432874]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Hemodynamically unstable high-risk, or massive, pulmonary embolism (PE) has a reported in-hospital mortality of over 25%. Systemic thrombolysis is the guideline-recommended treatment despite limited evidence. The FLAME study (FlowTriever for Acute Massive PE) was designed to generate evidence for interventional treatments in high-risk PE.

Methods:

The FLAME study was a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel group, observational study of high-risk PE. Eligible patients were treated with FlowTriever mechanical thrombectomy (FlowTriever Arm) or with other contemporary therapies (Context Arm). The primary end point was an in-hospital composite of all-cause mortality, bailout to an alternate thrombus removal strategy, clinical deterioration, and major bleeding. This was compared in the FlowTriever Arm to a prespecified performance goal derived from a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis.

Results:

A total of 53 patients were enrolled in the FlowTriever Arm and 61 in the Context Arm. Context Arm patients were primarily treated with systemic thrombolysis (68.9%) or anticoagulation alone (23.0%). The primary end point was reached in 9/53 (17.0%) FlowTriever Arm patients, significantly lower than the 32.0% performance goal (P < 0.01). The primary end point was reached in 39/61 (63.9%) Context Arm patients. In-hospital mortality occurred in 1/53 (1.9%) patients in the FlowTriever Arm and in 18/61 (29.5%) patients in the Context Arm.

Conclusions:

Among patients selected for mechanical thrombectomy with the FlowTriever System, a significantly lower associated rate of in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes was observed compared with a prespecified performance goal, primarily driven by low all-cause mortality of 1.9%.

### Plugging the gaps: catheter-based interventions in elderly patients presenting with pulmonary embolism [^01fb07fa]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The first is systemic thrombolysis, either at "full dose", typically 100 mg of alteplase over 2 hours for an adult of median body weight, or at half dose, with the aim of minimizing bleeding complications. The data that doing so avoids bleeding while maintaining efficacy are limited, and the basic principle is open to question — to bleed, one must have a potential bleeding source, in which case why would 50 mg of alteplase be substantially less likely to cause bleeding than 100 mg? It might, though, and the ongoing PEITHO 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining "half dose" lytic against anticoagulation in intermediate-risk PE will help to clarify this.

The conundrum of bleeding vs reperfusion goes through the minds of front-line clinicians regularly, leading to a substantial withholding of what should be considered life-saving thrombolysis for high-risk PE. Why would this occur when, without reperfusion, the mortality for high-risk PE may be over 50%?. A psychologist might say that, when reperfusion therapy is withheld, the disease is responsible for the outcome, whereas a therapy delivered that causes death by intracranial hemmorhage is thought by some to have died at the hands of the decision-maker. This has left clinicians in a situation whereby more than half of all patients with high-risk PE are treated only with heparin ± vasopressor/inotropic support, leaving a major gap in treatment for the sickest patients with PE. Surgical thrombectomy, involving cardiopulmonary bypass, has had many decades to fill this gap, but only a small minority are treated with this strategy.

Secondly, this gap has increasingly been filled with catheter-based therapies (CBTs). One example is catheter-based thrombolysis, with lower doses of lytic delivered directly into the pulmonary arteries in the hope of maintaining efficacy at decreased bleeding risk. The theory is that smaller thrombolytic doses are immediately taken up by the clot and may result in lower circulating concentrations of lytic, especially given protocols incorporating doses as low as 8 to 12 mg of alteplase. However, there remain 2 concerns with catheter lysis for high-risk PE. First, to leverage the theoretical lower risks of bleeding from catheter lysis, response time may be delayed and leave patients waiting in a potentially deadly hemodynamic spiral of shock. Secondly, the bleeding concerns remain, albeit at a magnitude smaller compared with systemic lytics.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^874c0275]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In a large population-based study including 9705 patients with PE receiving thrombolysis, of which 176 experienced intracranial bleeding (1.8%), a logistic regression model identified four independent prognostic factors: peripheral vascular disease, age > 65 years, MI and previous stroke with residual deficit. The latter being by far the most significant risk factor (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.97 to 2.01, P = 0.007).

Interestingly, in the context of MI, important predictors of bleeding were similar to those found in the PE population and included increased age, lighter weight, female gender, African ancestry and those that had invasive procedures.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^6ebabb31]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Several decades ago, local administration of alteplase in the pulmonary artery did not offer any benefit compared with systemic intravenous administration. However, catheter-assisted thrombolysis, whereby thrombolysis is administered locally, could be of interest in patients at high bleeding risk. In a review, Kuo et al concluded that it was a safe and effective treatment for acute and high-risk PE. One example is the EkoSonic Ultrasound-Accelerated Thrombolysis System (EKOS) technique, which uses ultrasonic energy to disrupt the structure of the thrombus, leaving it more susceptible to thrombolytic agents. The catheter combines numerous side-holes that infuse thrombolytics with a filament that includes multiple miniature ultrasound transducers. This recently FDA-approved technique should be delivered only in expert centres. The ULTIMA study demonstrated that for patients with PE at intermediate risk of adverse events EKOS treatment was clinically superior to anticoagulation with heparin alone in the improvement of RV function at 24 hours. The SEATTLE II study confirmed these results also showing an improvement in RV function and pulmonary pressure, while decreasing the number of ICHs. However, there are no solid data on hard and longer-term outcomes such as chronic pulmonary hypertension and mortality, and it is still unknown whether focused thrombolysis using catheter assistance is more efficient and less risky than systemic thrombolysis.

There is now a broader spectrum of management strategies for patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk PE. We suggest that the management of patients with high-risk PE could undergo a developmental approach analogue to that observed in MI, with systemic thrombolysis being used in patients at low risk of bleeding or not accessible to catheter therapy because of time delay or haemodynamic instability while focused catheter-assisted thrombolysis will be restricted to patients at high risk of bleeding. In our view, thrombolysis should be administered only to high-risk patients with PE at low risk of bleeding. However, catheter-based therapies could be preferred for high risk of bleeding patient presenting with intermediate–high-risk PE. Its place in intermediate-risk patients with PE remains to be established in proper clinical trials. At this stage, however, any treatment that would be at variance with the 1B recommendation of the 2016 guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians that 'in most patients with acute PE not associated with hypotension, we recommend against thrombolytic therapy' should be considered with extreme caution.

### Aspiration of thrombus for intermediate-risk subacute pulmonary embolism [^cd7309b3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the most common cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke. Konstantinides (Eur Heart J 41(4):543–603, 2020) Current guidelines categorize patients with PE as being at low, intermediate, and high risk of early death, with the intermediate-risk group experiencing the greatest uncertainty regarding treatment recommendations. Rapid reduction of the thrombus load by thrombolysis significantly reduces symptoms and decreases mortality, but is accompanied by a high risk of bleeding. Meyer (N Engl J Med 370(15):1402–11, 2014) Mechanical thrombectomy (CDTE) have been proven safe and efficient, yet current ESC guidelines suggest the utilization of catheter interventions only for hypotensive patients with high bleeding risk, failed systemic thrombolysis, and cardiogenic shock or if a patient does not respond to conservative therapy Konstantinides (Eur Heart J 41(4):543–603, 2020). Here, we report a case of an intermediate-risk patient with pulmonary embolism who underwent thrombus aspiration and showed significant improvement in symptoms after treatment.

### Thrombolysis versus anticoagulation for the initial treatment of moderate pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^62c08d51]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized trials and meta-analyses have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the risk benefit ratio of thrombolytic therapy or anticoagulant therapy in patients with moderate pulmonary embolism. To investigate the effect of initial thrombolysis and anticoagulant therapy in patients with moderate pulmonary embolism, we performed an updated meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and CNKI databases for randomized controlled trials focusing on moderate pulmonary embolism. We then performed a meta-analysis of all randomized trials comparing thrombolytic therapy with heparin treatment in subjects with moderate pulmonary embolism.

Results

Fifteen trials involving 1,247 subjects were included. Compared with anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death (1.94% vs 5.87%, odds ratio (OR) of 0.37, 95% CI 0.21–0.66, P for heterogeneity = .49), a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding (3.57% vs 2.67%, OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70–2.58), and a significant increase in non-major bleeding (12.78% vs 3.65%, OR 4.12, 95% CI 2.37–7.17). Thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in recurrent pulmonary embolism or death in trials that enrolled both foreign subjects (3.46% vs 7.76%, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23–0.86) and Chinese subjects (0% vs 3.72%, OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05–0.73). With regard to moderate pulmonary embolism, comparison of thrombolysis and anticoagulation showed a nonsignificant heterogeneity between the 2 trial groups (P = 0.12).

Conclusions

Both mortality and pulmonary embolism recurrence are decreased with thrombolysis compared with heparin treatment in patients with moderate pulmonary embolism. The risk of non-major bleeding is increased, but the risk of major bleeding is not.

### Acute pulmonary embolism: a paradigm shift in interventional treatment and interdisciplinary care? [^c3d0acac]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis: who is likely to benefit?

According to current guidelines, accelerated intravenous administration of alteplase (100 mg alteplase over the course of 2 h) is preferred to prolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents streptokinase and urokinase, which are less fibrin-specific and may require discontinuation of heparin administration. Systemic thrombolysis about halves the risk of cardiovascular collapse in high-risk patients, with a 1.5% risk of intracranial bleeding compared to an estimated 0.7% with anticoagulation alone. The risk is highest in patients with prior cerebrovascular events, cardiovascular diseases or advanced age. The benefit of thrombolysis for intermediate-risk patients is unclear which is why this cohort is probably historically undertreated. Although thrombolysis reduces short-term mortality and recurrent PE risk, no long-term benefit on mortality or cardiovascular outcomes, such as the incidence of pulmonary hypertension, has been demonstrated. Another aspect to consider when administering thrombolysis is that its effectiveness depends on the age and composition of the clot; older, connective tissue-rich thrombi are less susceptible to fibrinolysis, explaining failures of treatment response. The aforementioned 2020 registry study, which analyzed data from the German Federal Statistical Office between 2005 and 2015 including 885.806 patients, showed that thrombolysis reduced the risk of in-hospital death by 60% in unstable patients without prior resuscitation events, which is in line with historical data. Although only about one-third of patients are expected to have contraindications to thrombolysis, it was ordered in only about 25% of patients post-resuscitation and 15% of unstable patients without prior resuscitation. The disproportionately rare use outside of experienced centers reflects a common dilemma and is probably owed to the challenges of risk stratification, fear of intracranial bleeding, uncertain individual efficacy and the lack of established "time is tissue" paradigms as in ischemic stroke or acute coronary syndrome. The recommended maximum doses for systemic thrombolysis in myocardial infarction, stroke and PE are similar, with the dosing calculation for PE being a transfer of experience from the other two vascular territories that receive only a fraction of the cardiac output. Concepts using half or even a quarter of the standard dose were demonstrated to be safe and effective, particularly in patients with relative contraindications to thrombolysis and undergo further investigation, i.e. in the ongoing PEITHO-3 trial.

### Revisiting ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism: insights from new data [^c742b3f0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

High‐risk patients with PE demonstrated a 4‐fold increase in periprocedural death compared with intermediate‐high‐risk patients, highlighting the challenges of treating massive PE. Even with rapid reperfusion, the hemodynamic collapse and RV failure often seen in these patients may require a combination of therapies, such as USAT paired with mechanical thrombectomy, to improve outcomes.

The ERASE PE study lacks long‐term follow‐up data on outcomes such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, recurrent PE, and postdischarge death. This limits the ability to assess the durability of USAT's benefits beyond the acute phase. Furthermore, without a direct comparator group, it remains unclear how USAT fares against other treatments like anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, or mechanical thrombectomy.

Ongoing trials such as HI‐PEITHO (A Randomized Trial of Ultrasound‐Facilitated), Catheter‐Directed, Thrombolysis Versus Anticoagulation for Acute Intermediate‐High Risk Pulmonary Embolism and PEERLESS will help define USAT's place within the PE treatment landscape. HI‐PEITHO compares USAT to anticoagulation, while PEERLESS evaluates the FlowTriever system (mechanical thrombectomy) against USAT. These trials will be crucial in determining whether mechanical embolectomy, which eliminates thrombolytic‐associated bleeding risks, should be prioritized over USAT.

Moreover, findings from the SUNSET‐sPE (Standard Versus Ultrasound‐Assisted Catheter Thrombolysis for Submassive Pulmonary Embolism) trial raise questions about the added benefit of ultrasound in USAT compared with catheter‐directed thrombolysis alone. Larger, more robust trials are needed to clarify whether USAT's unique mechanism offers significant clinical advantages over simpler, more cost‐effective interventions.

The ERASE PE study provides valuable insights into the real‐world application of USAT, demonstrating its ability to significantly reduce RV overload and pulmonary artery pressure in patients with intermediate‐high‐ and high‐risk PE. While USAT remains a strong option for carefully selected patients, particularly those at high risk, its bleeding risks necessitate cautious use. As trials like HI‐PEITHO and PEERLESS continue, the role of USAT versus emerging nonthrombolytic treatments, such as mechanical thrombectomy, will become clearer. Ultimately, the future of PE management will likely hinge on balancing rapid, effective reperfusion with minimizing adverse events to optimize both short‐ and long‐term outcomes.

### Management of high-risk pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^1515e3b0]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-associated high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is among the most frequent causes of maternal mortality in the Western world, by causing hemodynamic instability and circulatory failure through a large thrombotic pulmonary obstruction. The very challenging management of these dramatic situations comprises the need to quickly select a therapy of pulmonary reperfusion or hemodynamic replacement, while taking into account both maternal and fetal risks. In this review, we discuss the role of risk stratification in pregnancy-associated PE and the available evidence to support the use of thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombectomy/thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Despite the lack of comparative studies and solid evidence, most reported cases of high-risk pregnancy-associated PE have been treated with thrombolysis, with high maternal and fetal survivals, and thrombolysis is suggested by guidelines in life-threatening PE. For women in the peripartum and early post-partum period, non-fibrinolytic treatments may be preferred as a first-line treatment, if available, because of the particularly high bleeding risk. In all cases, pregnancy-associated high-risk PE requires a multidisciplinary approach involving PE response teams and obstetricians.

### Large-bore mechanical thrombectomy versus catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism: primary results of the PEERLESS randomized controlled trial [^038a027c]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomization was 1:1 and stratified by a VTE-BLEED score ≥ 2 (higher bleeding risk) or < 2 (lower bleeding risk). – After completion of data entry of baseline patient information in the electronic data capture system, stratification and randomization occurred automatically, and the assignment was provided to the site electronically through the system. The original study protocol required ≥ 35% of patients to have a VTE-BLEED score ≥ 2; however, this requirement was removed by protocol amendment because of lower-than-expected enrollment of patients with elevated scores. Participants were followed up at 24 hours (± 8 hours), hospital discharge, and at 30 days (+15 days). Postprocedural imaging was performed at the 24-hour visit; the specific modality (echocardiography or CTPA) was not mandated but was required to match that used for baseline RV assessment.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on catheter-directed therapy for acute pulmonary embolism [^0ed5061c]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Catheter-directed therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism — risk–benefit rationale and potential advantages — randomized evidence indicates that systemic thrombolytic therapy in submassive PE demonstrated a survival benefit but also a much higher risk of major bleeding than anticoagulation, making the risk-to-benefit ratio uncertain for clinical decision-making. It is reasonable to hypothesize that delivering a lower overall thrombolytic agent dose via catheter could mitigate major bleeding risk; flow studies showed that a systemically administered drug makes little contact with an obstructing embolus and most drug flows away toward nontarget vessels, whereas pharmacologic CDT overrides this by directly infusing drug into the thromboembolic target vessel under image guidance. Consequently, targeted drug delivery with CDT can achieve low-dose thrombolysis that may reduce bleeding risk, and relative to systemic drug therapy, local CDT may improve drug effectiveness, allow a lower drug dose to be used, and result in fewer bleeding complications.

### Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism: focus on recent randomized trials [^674a5bb2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although early pulmonary revascularization is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk (massive) pulmonary embolism, it remains controversial in patients with intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism until recently. Recent published data on the management of high-risk and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism patients will be the main focus of this review.

Recent Findings

The PEITHO trial supports the rationale of risk stratification in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism. Patients with right ventricular dilation on echocardiography and positive cardiac troponin test have a high intermediate risk of complication and death. Thrombolysis prevents hemodynamic collapse in these patients but with an increased risk of major bleeding particularly in older patients (> 75 years). Reduced dose of thrombolysis and catheter-based reperfusion with or without fibrinolysis have shown promising results.

Summary

Thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism. Surgical embolectomy is recommended in case of absolute contra-indication to thrombolysis. In patients with acute right ventricular dysfunction on cardiac imaging and myocardial injury, thrombolysis should be considered if they are 75 years or less of age and are at low risk of bleeding. Full-dose thrombolysis may be excessively risky in patients over 75 years. In patients with either RV dilation or elevated cardiac biomarker, thrombolysis is not recommended.

### Midterm prognosis of patients with pulmonary embolism receiving catheter-directed thrombolysis or systemic thrombolysis: a nationwide population-based study [^7ea030fc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In our analysis, we found that for patients with PE, CDT might be more effective than ST in terms of reducing in‐hospital mortality, all‐cause mortality, and recurrent PE, whereas the bleeding risk of both forms of treatment is essentially equal. This result should be cautiously validated in further randomized trials to confirm our findings and guide clinical practice.

### NCT06833827 |' thrombectomy in high-risk pulmonary… [^b548c978]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism require immediate reperfusion therapy on top of anticoagulation. The standard reperfusion treatment in these patients is full-dose systemic thrombolysis. This carries a significant risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage. Catheter-directed thrombectomy is a promising alternative to systemic thrombolysis with a more direct effect on reducing pulmonary artery clot burden and very likely a better safety profile. Randomized trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of CDT in high-risk patients are currently unavailable. The investigators hypothesize that in high-risk PE patients, CDT is superior to the current standard of systemic thrombolysis in terms of mortality and adverse events, i.e., is associated with a lower composite incidence of all-cause mortality, treatment failure, major bleeding and all-cause stroke.

The investigators also hypothesize that CDT will lead to a shorter length of stay at the intensive care unit and in-hospital, faster recovery, and better long-term quality of life. Objective: To determine whether CDT in high-risk PE relative to systemic thrombolysis is: High risk for mortality, i.e.
- post cardiac arrest, OR
- obstructive shock or the need for vasopressors to maintain an adequate blood pressure), OR. An absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis, i.e.
- History of hemorrhagic stroke
- Ischemic stroke in past 6 months
- Central nervous system neoplasm
- Major trauma, major surgery or major head injury in past 3 weeks.
- Active bleeding, life-threatening or into a critically organ/area; OR known severe bleeding diathesis with previous bleeding fulfilling these criteria
- Reperfusion therapy, or placement of a non-retrieved inferior vena cava filter for acute pulmonary embolism in the past 3 months.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^665607fd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Thrombolytic therapy during resuscitation for pulmonary embolism-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: perhaps not the ideal solution for everyone [^e5bad498]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Javaudin et al. recommended that for cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) for which a cause is not obvious, pulmonary embolism (PE) should be suspected if the initial rhythm is nonshockable and there is a history of thromboembolism (TE). In accordance with the guidelines of the American Heart Association, these patients could be treated with systemic thrombolysis (ST) during resuscitation (low level of evidence). We would like to add some comments. First, recent studies have shown that ultrasound-facilitated catheter fibrinolysis relieves right ventricular pressure overload with a lower risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage than historical rates with ST. However, further research is required to determine the optimal application of this technique in the setting of acute PE. Second, the insertion of an emergency veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) catheter should be considered before starting ST. VA-ECMO can be a lifesaving therapeutic consideration, either as an adjunct to definitive management strategies (surgical/catheter embolectomy, thrombolysis) or on its own. According to a recent systematic review, VA-ECMO for selected patients with massive PE is associated with good outcome.

Third, after failure of thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy or catheter embolectomy should be considered in selected centers. Fourth, published cases of thrombolysis for massive PE during pregnancy and the postpartum period suggest acceptable maternal and fetal survival even with CA. In the postpartum period, given the high risk of major bleeding with thrombolysis, other therapeutic options (catheter or surgical thrombectomy, VA-ECMO) should be considered if available. Lastly, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a pulmonary vascular disease caused by chronic obstruction of major pulmonary arteries and often occurs after an initial PE or TE. The authors note the importance of a past history of PE or TE as a risk factor and should therefore consider CTEPH as well. CTEPH can be cured by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), a challenging procedure for which patient selection and perioperative management are complex, requiring significant experience. We had a 45-year-old patient with CTEPH who, after failed thrombolysis, was transferred to another center for PEA and achieved a full recovery. Thrombolysis may not be the cure for everyone. A clear step by step approach should be considered in case of failed thrombolysis.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^05734e62]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

6 Limitations

This meta‐analysis has some limitations. There was variability among the included studies regarding design, patient populations, intervention protocols, and outcome measures, which could be resolved using a random‐effects model. Publication bias remains a possibility, especially since studies with negative or inconclusive results are less likely to be published. Inconsistent reporting of outcomes and the focus on short‐term outcomes posed challenges, providing limited information on long‐term effects. In addition, the current study did not discuss the impact of differences in anticoagulant dosages or timing of thrombolysis. Only English‐language studies were included, potentially excluding relevant research in other languages and affecting the comprehensiveness of the findings.
