## Question

Platelet 433

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a platelet count of 433 × 10^9/L, including whether it is thrombocytosis, what the likely etiologies are, what workup is indicated, and what treatment or follow-up steps are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the unit and whether 433 represents thrombocytosis. Then, I should verify the reliability of the laboratory result and exclude spurious causes. Next, I will classify the thrombocytosis as reactive versus clonal and outline the initial evaluation. After that, I should consider disease-specific contexts where 433 × 10^9/L carries special meaning, such as giant cell arteritis or myeloproliferative neoplasms. Finally, I will synthesize management and follow-up recommendations, including when to observe, when to treat the underlying cause, and when to refer to hematology [^115dVSvN].

> Let me first confirm the unit and definition. A platelet count of 433 × 10^9/L equals 433,000/μL, which exceeds the conventional upper limit of normal for adults (about 150–450 × 10^9/L), so this qualifies as mild thrombocytosis; wait, I initially thought the upper limit was 400, but I should correct that — most laboratories use 450 × 10^9/L as the upper limit, so 433 is borderline rather than frankly elevated, though still above the commonly cited 400 × 10^9/L threshold used in some studies and guidelines [^116yS7mA] [^112zndQt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check for spurious causes before labeling this as true thrombocytosis. I should verify the automated count with a peripheral smear to exclude pseudothrombocytosis from platelet clumping, giant platelets, or instrument artifacts, and I should repeat the CBC to ensure persistence, because transient elevations can occur with inflammation, infection, or sampling issues; if the elevation is new, I should also review for recent blood loss, iron deficiency, or acute illness that could drive a reactive rise [^116EFhoB] [^115dVSvN].

> Next, I should classify the thrombocytosis as reactive (secondary) versus clonal (primary). Mild elevations in the 400–500 × 10^9/L range are far more often reactive, driven by interleukin-6–mediated thrombopoietin stimulation from infection, inflammation, malignancy, iron deficiency, or tissue injury; clonal myeloproliferative neoplasms such as essential thrombocythemia typically present with higher counts and characteristic clinical-laboratory features, so I should prioritize identifying secondary causes first in this range [^116yS7mA] [^115dVSvN].

> I will now examine the initial workup. I need to check for infection or inflammation with CRP/ESR, assess iron status with ferritin and transferrin saturation, and review the CBC for microcytosis or anemia suggesting iron deficiency; I should also consider occult malignancy risk when thrombocytosis is new or unexplained, especially gastrointestinal cancers, given the association of elevated platelets with undiagnosed cancer in population data, and I should tailor cancer screening to age, sex, and risk factors rather than ordering indiscriminate tests [^116yS7mA] [^1118RWMT].

> But wait, what if the clinical context changes the significance of 433 × 10^9/L? In suspected giant cell arteritis, a platelet count above 400 × 10^9/L modestly increases the likelihood of a positive temporal artery biopsy and can be a useful supportive marker alongside ESR/CRP, so I should factor that into pretest probability if vasculitis is on the table; conversely, in patients with established myeloproliferative neoplasms, 433 × 10^9/L would be considered well-controlled and below typical cytoreductive targets, so I should avoid overtreatment in that scenario [^111PZaqL] [^115eWYnV].

> Let me consider management principles now. For mild reactive thrombocytosis around 433 × 10^9/L, observation and treatment of the underlying cause are usually sufficient; antiplatelet therapy is not routinely indicated solely for a count in this range unless there are other vascular risk factors or a clonal MPN diagnosis, and even in low-risk ET, aspirin decisions should be individualized based on JAK2 status and bleeding risk rather than the platelet number alone; I should double-check that I am not extrapolating ET management to reactive thrombocytosis, which would be inappropriate [^115dVSvN] [^115pMfyU].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence. If the initial evaluation is unrevealing and the patient is asymptomatic, repeating the CBC in 3–6 months to document stability or resolution is reasonable; if the count rises, persists without explanation, or exceeds 600 × 10^9/L, I should reconsider clonal etiologies and consider JAK2/CALR/MPL testing and, if indicated, bone marrow evaluation, recognizing that the positive predictive value of molecular testing improves with higher counts and compatible clinical features [^115dVSvN] [^112EFuZM].

> Hold on, I should verify referral thresholds. Hematology referral is appropriate if the platelet count continues to increase beyond 600 × 10^9/L, if there are concurrent erythrocytosis or leukocytosis suggesting an MPN, if there is a history of thrombosis or bleeding, or if the diagnosis remains unclear after a reasonable evaluation; conversely, a single borderline value of 433 × 10^9/L in an otherwise well patient does not mandate specialist referral by itself [^115dVSvN].

> In summary, a platelet count of 433 × 10^9/L represents mild, borderline thrombocytosis; I need to ensure the result is real and persistent, search for reactive causes such as iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, or malignancy, and avoid reflex cytoreduction or antiplatelet therapy in the absence of a clonal diagnosis or compelling vascular risk context; with targeted evaluation and appropriate follow-up, most such cases resolve with management of the underlying condition rather than platelet-directed treatment [^116yS7mA] [^115dVSvN].

A platelet count of 433 × 10⁹/L is a **mild thrombocytosis** (normal 150–400 × 10⁹/L) [^112zndQt] and is most often reactive to infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, or recent surgery [^114qxXds] [^1117Hsvw]. Persistent or rising counts warrant evaluation for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera, with JAK2/CALR/MPL testing and bone marrow biopsy if indicated [^112EFuZM]. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause; cytoreduction is reserved for ET with high-risk features or extreme thrombocytosis (> 1,500 × 10⁹/L) [^115eWYnV] [^114FFkVj]. Aspirin may be considered for vascular risk or ET, but is generally avoided if counts exceed 1,000 × 10⁹/L due to bleeding risk [^115DrqQ3] [^115pMfyU].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Thrombocytosis is defined as a platelet count > 400 × 10⁹/L; 433 × 10⁹/L represents **mild thrombocytosis** [^112zndQt] [^112LSkeL]. Mild thrombocytosis is common and usually reactive; however, persistent or rising counts may signal underlying disease and warrant further evaluation [^115dVSvN].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Thrombocytosis is classified as **primary (clonal)** or **secondary (reactive)** [^115dVSvN]:

| **Category** | **Etiology** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary (clonal) | Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) | - Essential thrombocythemia (ET) <br/> - Polycythemia vera (PV) <br/> - Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) <br/> - Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [^notfound] |
| Secondary (reactive) | - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Iron deficiency <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Recent surgery <br/> - Splenectomy | - Bacterial infections <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Iron deficiency anemia <br/> - Solid tumors <br/> - Postoperative states [^notfound] |

---

Given the mild elevation, **reactive causes are most likely**, but persistent or rising counts require evaluation for MPNs [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### Initial assessment

Initial assessment should include a **history** covering recent infections, inflammation, surgery, bleeding, iron deficiency, malignancy, and family history, and a **physical examination** assessing for splenomegaly, signs of infection/inflammation, and bleeding/thrombosis [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Repeat CBC**: Confirm persistence and trend [^notfound].
- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP, ESR to assess reactive causes [^114qxXds].
- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation to evaluate iron deficiency [^notfound].
- **JAK2 V617F mutation testing**: Indicated if persistent thrombocytosis or suspicion of MPN [^112EFuZM].
- **CALR and MPL mutation testing**: If JAK2 negative and MPN suspected [^notfound].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if MPN suspected or diagnosis unclear [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Mild thrombocytosis is often benign, but persistent elevations can increase **thrombotic risk**, particularly in MPNs [^1168VZtk]. Complications include arterial/venous thrombosis, bleeding (especially with extreme counts), and progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia in MPNs [^114FueTC] [^115eWYnV].

---

## Management strategies

### Reactive thrombocytosis

For reactive thrombocytosis, **treat the underlying cause** — infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, or malignancy [^notfound]. Observation with periodic CBCs is appropriate once the cause is addressed [^notfound].

---

### Primary thrombocytosis (MPNs)

- **Risk stratification**: Age, thrombotic history, cardiovascular risk, and platelet count guide therapy [^115eWYnV].
- **Low-risk patients**: Aspirin if no contraindications; observe if counts stable [^115pMfyU].
- **High-risk patients**: Cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, ruxolitinib) to reduce thrombotic risk [^115eWYnV].
- **Extreme thrombocytosis (> 1,500 × 10⁹/L)**: Cytoreduction indicated regardless of other risk factors [^115eWYnV] [^114FFkVj].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular CBCs** to track trends and response to therapy, with ongoing clinical reassessment for new symptoms or complications. Therapy should be adjusted based on counts, symptoms, and complications [^115pMfyU].

---

## Patient education

Patient education should explain the meaning of thrombocytosis, its common causes, and the importance of follow-up. Patients should be taught to recognize **signs of thrombosis** (chest pain, dyspnea, leg swelling, neurologic deficits) and **bleeding** (easy bruising, petechiae, mucosal bleeding) and to seek prompt care for new symptoms [^notfound].

---

A platelet count of 433 × 10⁹/L is a **mild thrombocytosis** — most often reactive — and persistent or rising counts require evaluation for MPNs. Management targets the cause, with cytoreduction for high-risk MPNs or extreme counts; aspirin may be used selectively, and regular monitoring ensures safe, effective care.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: what is the evidence for treatment? [^1138BuPS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage. The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking. In this review, we discuss current treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Refined cytogenetic-risk categorization for overall and leukemia-free survival in primary myelofibrosis: a single center study of 433 patients [^112AWUKw]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Comparison of clinical characteristics among cytogenetic categories

Based on the above, 12 cytogenetic categories were initially considered and compared for their presenting clinical and laboratory features (Table 1). Significant differences were noted in regards to platelet count considered as a continuous variable (P < 0.0001), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 10 9 /l; P = 0.0001) and leukopenia (leukocyte count < 4 × 10 9 /l; P < 0.0001) (Table 1). These differences were also evident when analysis was restricted to patients with favorable karyotype; the incidences of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were highest in patients with sole 20q- (41 and 38%, respectively) and lowest in those with sole 13q- (0 and 0%, respectively) (Table 1).

### Practical management of the haemorrhagic complications of myeloproliferative neoplasms [^115DrqQ3]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Drug‐associated platelet dysfunction is another relevant factor to consider. As has been mentioned previously, platelet dysfunction due to underlying use of antiplatelet agents and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatories in MPNs can lead to significant bleeding. Antiplatelet agents play a role in thrombosis prevention in MPNs and are recommended especially in high‐risk disease. However, given the bleeding risk associated with extreme thrombocytosis, it has been suggested that omission of aspirin when the platelet count is higher than 1000 × 10 9 /l should be considered, regardless of thrombotic risk, to offset the additional effect of therapy‐associated platelet dysfunction. There are little robust data to specify a safe threshold for anti‐platelet use. One group analysed bleeding rates in patients with ET and early PMF. While they showed an increased risk of bleeding in ET patients with a platelet count higher than 1000 × 10 9 /l, this was not statistically significant. A study of low‐dose aspirin in 433 patients with low‐risk ET, 162 of whom had an underlying JAK2 mutation and 271 a CALR mutation, reported increased rates of bleeding in CALR ‐mutated patients receiving aspirin compared with observation alone (12.9 vs 1.8 episodes/1000 patient years), but no reduction in thrombosis. Conversely, those with JAK2 ‐mutated disease treated with aspirin suffered fewer thrombotic events without any increase in bleeding observed. Of note, 35% of the CALR group had a platelet count of over 1000 × 10 9 /l compared with 14% of the JAK2 group. Differences in platelet biology between JAK2 ‐ and CALR ‐mutated ET, might account for some of the increased bleeding risk noted in patients with extreme thrombocytosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to evaluation of thrombocytopenia, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to do not use the platelet count alone as a bleeding predictor. Take into account the cause of thrombocytopenia, platelet function, and patient- and procedure-related risk of bleeding when deciding on the need for prophylactic platelet transfusion.

### The interaction of thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, and platelet transfusion in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a multicenter observational study [^116HPx49]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the total of 433 patients, 419 were eligible for further analyses (Additional file 1: S3. Flowchart). At ICU admission, median platelet count was 179·10 9 /L [119–253·10 9 /L]. An overview of baseline characteristics can be found in Table 1. To highlight, most patients had a peripheral cannulation configuration (N = 356, 86%), and over half of the patients was cannulated using a surgical technique (N = 227, 56%). The nadir platelet count at the first day of ECMO showed an average 49·10 9 /L [6–102·10 9 /L] decrease when compared to the last known value before cannulation.

Table 1
Baseline demographics, stratified by nadir platelet count during ECMO

BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ECPR, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Hb, hemoglobin; SOFA, sequential organ failure assessment

✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱✱✱ p < 0.001, n.s. non-significant (P > 0.05)

Nearly all patients developed a thrombocytopenia during ECMO (398/418, 95%), of which two third already during the first day (273/406, 67%, missing = 13). During ECMO, lowest platelet count was < 50·10 9 /L in 179 patients (43%), 50–100·10 9 /L in 159 patients (38%), and 100–150·10 9 /L in 60 patients (14%). An overview of the degree of thrombocytopenia is shown in Fig. 1. The largest proportion of severely thrombocytopenic patients was found at day 5, when 70 out of the remaining 244 patients had a platelet count < 50·10 9 /L (29%). With the exception of the yet severely thrombocytopenia patients, the platelet course showed an initial decrease in platelet count, followed by a stabilization and further platelet recovery, as shown in Fig. 2. This same trend was found independent of overall hemorrhage and transfusion status (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

### Refined cytogenetic-risk categorization for overall and leukemia-free survival in primary myelofibrosis: a single center study of 433 patients [^1113Y2zj]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

We have previously identified sole +9, 13q- or 20q-, as 'favorable' and sole +8 or complex karyotype as 'unfavorable' cytogenetic abnormalities in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In this study of 433 PMF patients, we describe additional sole abnormalities with favorable (chromosome 1 translocations/duplications) or unfavorable (−7/7q-) prognosis and also show that other sole or two abnormalities that do not include i(17q), −5/5q-, 12p-, inv(3) or 11q23 rearrangement are prognostically aligned with normal karyotype, which is prognostically favorable. These findings were incorporated into a refined two-tired cytogenetic-risk stratification: unfavorable and favorable karyotype. The respective 5-year survival rates were 8 and 51% (hazard ratio (HR): 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2–4.3; P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis confirmed the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-independent prognostic value of cytogenetic-risk categorization and also identified thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10 9 /l) as another independent predictor of inferior survival (P < 0.0001). A similar multivariable analysis showed that karyotype (P = 0.001) and platelet count (P = 0.04), but not IPSS (P = 0.27), predicted leukemia-free survival; the 5-year leukemic transformation rates for unfavorable versus favorable karyotype were 46 and 7% (HR: 5.5, 95% CI: 2.5–12.0; P < 0.0001). This study provides the rationale and necessary details for incorporating cytogenetic findings and platelet count in future prognostic models for PMF.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### Learning by counting blood platelets in population studies: survey and perspective a long way after bizzozero [^1175Nm5L]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Platelet count represents a useful tool in clinical practice to discriminate individuals at higher risk of bleeding. Less obvious is the role of platelet count variability within the normal range of distribution in shaping the individual's disease risk profile. Epidemiological studies have shown that platelet count in the adult general population is associated with a number of health outcomes related to hemostasis and thrombosis. However, recent studies are suggesting a possible role of this platelet index also as an independent risk factor. In this review of adult population studies, we will first focus on known genetic and non-genetic determinants of platelet number variability. Next, we will evaluate platelet count as a marker and/or a predictor of disease risk and its interaction with other risk factors. We will then discuss the role of platelet count variability within the normal distribution range as a contribution to disease and mortality risk. The possibility of considering platelet count as a simple, inexpensive indicator of increased risk of disease and death in general populations could open new opportunities to investigate novel platelet pathophysiological roles as well as therapeutic opportunities. Future studies should also consider platelet count, not only platelet function, as a modulator of disease and mortality risk.

### The clinical significance of thrombocytopenia in sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NLPd9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In scientific literature, there is a lack of consensus regarding the prognostic significance of TCP. Different studies present conflicting data on its impact. The prognostic significance of platelet counts and platelet parameters have been explored throughout different studies. Some studies found the platelet count to be associated with short-term all-cause mortality, however, the majority of these studies involved diverse groups of critically ill trauma and surgical septic patients or were limited to single platelet measurements taken upon admission. Conversely, alternative studies failed to find any similar association, or found inconsistent effects depending on the patient's status.

TCP is universally defined as platelet counts less than < 150 × 10 9 /L, and is considered to be the most common hemostatic abnormality in ICU patients with a prevalence of 50%. In critically ill patients, TCP is considered a poor prognostic marker of clinical outcomes, and is commonly used as part of SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) scores in the ICU to predict outcomes. This has been demonstrated in multiple studies showing that TCP in ICU-admitted patients was associated with lower chances of recovery and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the severity of the degree and duration of TCP seems to be associated with higher likelihood of longer ICU stay, end-organ damage, and worse prognosis. While the absolute platelet count seems to be a poor correlate in the prediction of mortality, the percentage of decrease in platelet levels compared to the initial baseline has demonstrated to be a more effective indicator.

Cirrhosis, immunosuppression and bloodstream infection have been identified as risk factors for the development of TCP. Interestingly, one of the notorious risk factors of developing TCP in critically ill patients is the presence of sepsis and septic shock. Sharma and colleagues compared the outcomes in septic patients with and without TCP, and have demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the risk of mortality in patients with TCP. Moreover, the prevalence of higher SOFA scores, vasopressor requirements, and serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in thrombocytopenic patients, which are by themselves markers for worse clinical outcomes in septic patients.

Sepsis is characterized by a life-threatening disruption of homeostasis caused by the immune system leading to organ dysfunction. While the process is often initiated with a vigorous systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), it is often followed by an compensatory anti-inflammatory response (CARS), both of which could cause disruption of cellular processes including the number and functionality of platelets.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^112HTVP5]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

### Refined cytogenetic-risk categorization for overall and leukemia-free survival in primary myelofibrosis: a single center study of 433 patients [^111pjFtg]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

We have previously identified sole +9, 13q- or 20q-, as 'favorable' and sole +8 or complex karyotype as 'unfavorable' cytogenetic abnormalities in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In this study of 433 PMF patients, we describe additional sole abnormalities with favorable (chromosome 1 translocations/duplications) or unfavorable (-7/7q-) prognosis and also show that other sole or two abnormalities that do not include i(17q), -5/5q-, 12p-, inv(3) or 11q23 rearrangement are prognostically aligned with normal karyotype, which is prognostically favorable.

The respective 5-year survival rates were 8 and 51% (hazard ratio (HR): 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2–4.3; P < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis confirmed the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-independent prognostic value of cytogenetic-risk categorization and also identified thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10(9)/l) as another independent predictor of inferior survival (P < 0.0001). A similar multivariable analysis showed that karyotype (P = 0.001) and platelet count (P = 0.04), but not IPSS (P = 0.27), predicted leukemia-free survival; the 5-year leukemic transformation rates for unfavorable versus favorable karyotype were 46 and 7% (HR: 5.5, 95% CI: 2.5–12.0; P < 0.0001). This study provides the rationale and necessary details for incorporating cytogenetic findings and platelet count in future prognostic models for PMF.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^116Gmm9d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Platelet count testing before endoscopy — use and frequency — indicates that a platelet count is not routinely advised unless there is a suspicion of thrombocytopenia based on the history or physical examination, and that thrombocytopenia occurs in less than 1% and results in altered care in 0.3% or less of surgical patients.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115pMfyU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) antiplatelet evidence and dosing — In patients without high-risk factors or extreme thrombocytosis, aspirin alone (n = 176) versus aspirin plus hydroxyurea (n = 182) with hydroxyurea titrated to maintain platelets between 200 x 10^9/L to 400 x 10^9/L did not reduce vascular events or myelofibrotic or leukemic transformation. A retrospective analysis suggests low-dose aspirin may not be beneficial in low-risk CALR-mutated ET; among 433 low-risk ET patients (271 CALR, 162 JAK2 V617F), low-dose aspirin did not affect thrombosis risk but was associated with higher bleeding in CALR-mutated ET. For symptom control, twice-daily aspirin at a 100-mg dose has been found more effective than once-daily aspirin (100 mg); one randomized trial found that a dosing interval of 12 hours heightened effectiveness, and twice-daily aspirin (37.5 mg per dose) versus once-daily (75 mg) improved platelet inhibition. Aspirin twice daily may be considered for refractory symptoms, and risks and benefits of higher dose aspirin (> 100 mg) must be weighed; it may be appropriate only in carefully selected patients.

### Thrombocytosis in patients with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis [^111PZaqL]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the platelet counts, complete blood counts, and Westergren sedimentation rates (WESR) of patients with a biopsy positive for giant cell arteritis (GCA) with those of patients with negative biopsies.

Design

Retrospective, case-control series.

Method

The medical records of 91 consecutive patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy for possible GCA, over an 8-year period, were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Values obtained for the complete blood counts, including platelet counts, WESR, and biopsy results of 91 consecutive patients undergoing temporal artery biopsy were analyzed.

Results

The mean platelet count of 47 patients with positive temporal artery biopsies (433 x 10(3)/microl) was significantly higher than that of 44 patients with negative temporal artery biopsies (277 x 10(3)/microl), P < 0.0001. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean WESR between the biopsy-positive (82 mm/hour) and biopsy-negative (70 mm/hour) groups, P = 0.12. The sensitivity of an elevated WESR for biopsy-positive patients was greater (79%; 95% confidence interval, 64%-89%) than that of an elevated platelet count (57%; 95% CI, 42%-72%). However, the specificity (91% [95% CI, 78%-97%] versus 27% [95% CI, 15%-43%]), positive predictive value (87% [95% CI, 70%-96%] versus 54% [95% CI, 41%-66%]), and negative predictive value (67% [95% CI, 53%-78%] versus 55% [95% CI, 32%-76%]) favored an elevated platelet count compared with WESR, or to the combination of platelets and WESR, as a better test for diagnosing GCA in the 91 patients studied. The area under the receiver operating characteristic function for platelets (0.72) was greater than that for WESR (0.59) or the combination of platelets and WESR (0.65).

Conclusions

In patients suspected of having GCA, an elevated platelet count greater than 400 x 10(3)/microl is a useful marker of a positive temporal artery biopsy.

Intrapartum platelet count — literature findings are insufficient to assess whether a routine platelet count predicts anesthesia-related complications in uncomplicated parturients; one observational study reported platelet count and fibrinogen values are associated with the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage (Category B2 evidence), and other observational studies and case reports suggest a platelet count may be useful for diagnosing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, and other conditions associated with coagulopathy (Category B3/B4-B evidence); survey findings indicate consultants and ASA members strongly agree that the anesthesiologist's decision to order or require a platelet count should be individualized and based on patient history, physical examination, and clinical signs.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^111jiXwh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 2: Avoid platelet transfusion in asymptomatic children at least 1 year of age with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and a platelet count > 10 × 10 3 /μL unless an invasive procedure is planned.

The second ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against transfusing platelets into children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia conditions such as bone marrow failure or malignancy who experience a platelet count above 10 × 10 3 /μL unless signs and/or symptoms of bleeding develop or the patient is to undergo an invasive procedure. In children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, attainment of higher platelet transfusion thresholds (above 10 × 10 3 /μL) has not been associated with a decreased risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions, although usually well tolerated, can have significant adverse effects after multiple transfusions, thus exposing children to an increased risk for acute transfusion reactions, viral and bacterial infections, and platelet alloimmunization.

Platelets are an expensive, resource-intensive, biologic product, and the stewardship of this life-supporting, limited blood supply is critical to patient safety. The recommendation for a prudent use of platelet transfusions is consistent with the recently published clinical guidelines established by multiple professional medical organizations, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, BSH, and ASCO. It is important to note that the ASH-ASPHO recommendation is not intended to include children younger than 1 year of age, does not account for additional comorbidities and medications that may alter bleeding risk (ie, in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation), and is not relevant to patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (eg, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

### Refined cytogenetic-risk categorization for overall and leukemia-free survival in primary myelofibrosis: a single center study of 433 patients [^111A2qyh]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 433 patients with PMF, which included the 200 patients from our previous report, constituted this study population; presenting clinical and laboratory features are outlined in Table 1. Dates of diagnosis spanned from January 1978 to November 2009. Median age at diagnosis was 65 years (range 14–92) and 268 (62%) were males. The IPSS-risk distributions could be accurately assigned for 384 patients: low in 46 (12%) patients, intermediate-1 in 97 (25%), intermediate-2 in 93 (24%) and high in 148 (39%). Twenty-six percent of the patients presented with thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10 9 /l) and 17% with leukopenia (leukocytes < 4 × 10 9 /l). JAK2 V617F mutation analysis was performed in 174 patients and mutational frequency was 60%.

At the time of this report, 269 (62%) patients had died and median follow-up of patients who were alive was approximately 4 years. During this period, 34 (8%) cases of leukemic transformation were documented. As expected, the IPSSeffectively delineated patient groups with different prognosis (Figure 1); median survivals in low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high IPSS-risk categories were 15, 7, 3.6 and 2.2 years, respectively (P < 0.0001). The corresponding 5-year survival rates were 85, 65, 40 and 19% with hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 7.7 (4.4–13.6; P < 0.0001), 4.0 (2.2–7.1; P < 0.001), 2.0 (1.1–3.6; P = 0.02) for high, intermediate-2 and intermediate-1-risk groups, respectively.

### Can maternal inflammatory and nutritional status, evaluated by the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score and the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in the first trimester, predict late-onset fetal growth restriction? [^115Fmg9P]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Descriptive and comparative analysis of demographic and laboratory data

FGR: Fetal growth restriction, BMI: Body mass index, WBC: White blood cell, HALP score: Hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet score, PNI: Prognostic nutritional index

The comparison of birth and newborn characteristics are shown in Table 2. There was no significant differences in gestational age at delivery or the incidence of preterm birth (< 37 week) between the two groups (p > 0.05 for both). Similarly, mode of delivery and neonatal gender distribution did not differ significantly between the groups (p > 0.05, for both). The FGR group had a significantly lower mean birth weight compared to the control group (2366.6 ± 347.3 g vs. 3236.5 ± 433.9 g, p < 0.001). APGAR scores at both the 1st and 5th minutes were significantly lower in the FGR group (p < 0.05, for both). Specifically, 3% of neonates in the FGR group had an APGAR score below 7 at the 5th minute, while none in the control group had a score below 7 (p < 0.001). Although rates of RDS were similar between the groups, NICU admission was markedly more frequent in the FGR group (23.2%) compared to the control group (0.9%) (p < 0.001). The composite adverse neonatal outcome, defined as the presence of at least one adverse event such as preterm birth, APGAR score at 5th minute < 7, RDS, and NICU admission, was significantly higher in the FGR group (33%) compared to the control group (7%) (p < 0.001). There was one reported case of perinatal mortality in the FGR group, with no cases in the control group. (Table 2).

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^111drvmc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Front-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia [^112LSkeL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 40-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension and occasional premature ventricular contractions was found on routine blood work in June 2011 to have mild thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 405,000. In November 2011, repeat analysis revealed a platelet count of 433,000, and by February 2012 her platelet count was 509,000. She had no evidence of leukocytosis or anemia and no symptoms of early satiety, night sweats, pruritus, or erythromelalgia. She was referred to a hematologist for evaluation of persistent isolated thrombocytosis in March 2012. Her spleen was not palpable, and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for JAK2/V617F was negative. A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration revealed a mildly hypercellular marrow (70% to 80% cellularity), with an elevated myeloid:erythroid ratio of 5:1, increased megakaryocytes including micromegakaryocytes in the absence of increased blasts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in 17 out of 20 metaphases. The remaining three metaphases were normal karyotype. Quantitative PCR for BCR-ABL1 yielded a value of 29.6% on the International Scale.

### Eptifibatide [^115mA6tk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunogenicity/Thrombocytopenia

The potential for development of antibodies to eptifibatide has been studied in 433 subjects. eptifibatide was nonantigenic in 412 patients receiving a single administration of eptifibatide (135-mcg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.5 mcg/kg/min or 0.75 mcg/kg/min), and in 21 subjects to whom eptifibatide (135-mcg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.75 mcg/kg/min) was administered twice, 28 days apart. In both cases, plasma for antibody detection was collected approximately 30 days after each dose. The development of antibodies to eptifibatide at higher doses has not been evaluated.

In patients with suspected eptifibatide-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, IgG antibodies that react with the GP IIb/IIIa complex were identified in the presence of eptifibatide and in eptifibatide-naïve patients. These findings suggest acute thrombocytopenia after the administration of eptifibatide can develop as a result of naturally occurring drug-dependent antibodies or those induced by prior exposure to eptifibatide. Similar antibodies were identified with other GP IIb/IIIa ligand-mimetic agents. Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia with eptifibatide may be associated with hypotension and/or other signs of hypersensitivity.

In the PURSUIT and IMPACT II studies, the incidence of thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm3or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline) and the incidence of platelet transfusions were similar between patients treated with eptifibatide and placebo. In the ESPRIT study, the incidence was 0.6% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the eptifibatide group.

### Clinical significance of postoperative thrombocytosis after vats lobectomy for NSCLC [^1117Hsvw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, our results highlighted that postoperative transient thrombocytosis is a phenomenon related to an inflammatory reactive condition, that can be easily managed by the physician without influencing the patient recovery after thoracic surgery. Treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid is generally used to prevent thrombotic events in essential thrombocytosis, but we considered its use in reactive thrombocytosis with prophylactic intent. Mohamud et al. did not treat postoperative thrombocytosis but observed a higher rate of complications in the thrombocytosis group. In our study, the platelet count returned to normal within 30-day postoperative, along with inflammatory biomarkers descent. The relationship between thrombocytosis and atelectasis/residual pleural effusion should be better investigated, as it could offer some perspective about platelet role in the mechanisms of postoperative recovery and of injury-induced inflammatory response.

Thrombocytosis should be differentiated according to its onset and duration: a transient postoperative thrombocytosis is more likely to be an inflammatory phenomenon without significant influence on the patient's prognosis, while persistent preoperative or pre-treatment thrombocytosis is commonly related to a worse oncological prognosis, as it relates with advanced stages of NSCLC. In the postoperative period, a finding of thrombocytosis should not scare the surgeon with a certainty of a worse prognosis, but it should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical evolution.

The main limitations of our study were the retrospective nature, the absence of randomization, the small cohort of patients and the relatively short follow-up (median 15 months). For these reasons our findings must be investigated with further larger and prospective studies.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^116yS7mA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer often have an abnormally high platelet count at the time of diagnosis (thrombocytosis), defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10 9 /L (to convert to ×10 3 per microliter, divide by 1.0). A normal platelet count falls between 150 and 450 × 10 9 /L and varies with the age and sex of the individual. Several conditions that commonly cause an elevated platelet count include acute blood loss, infection, and inflammation. Solid tumor cancers can sometimes lead to an elevated platelet count to the extent that an undiagnosed cancer is often considered in the diagnostic workup of a patient with thrombocytosis. Cancer is believed to induce platelet formation through the release of interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of thrombopoietin hormone. Elevated levels of thrombopoietin have a direct effect on increased platelet production. Excess levels of thrombopoietin in the blood stimulate megakaryocyte cell division in the bone marrow, which in turn leads to platelet formation.

An elevated platelet count has been shown to be associated with short-term risk of cancer in the general population. Prospective studies evaluating platelet count and survival among patients with newly diagnosed cancer have also noted a high proportion of patients who presented with thrombocytosis. The excess risk associated with an elevated platelet count varies by cancer site but has been most studied for lung, colon, and gastric cancers. The full range of cancers associated with a high platelet count and whether risks associated with platelet counts within the high-normal range exist remain unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between a high platelet count and cancer is transient or prolonged. Based on results of previous studies, a high platelet count may be a risk factor for developing cancer or, alternatively, a marker indicative of an undetected cancer. It is also not clear whether an increasing platelet count is a better indicator of a new cancer than is a high but steady platelet count.

We identified a cohort of adult residents in Ontario, Canada, who had 1 or more routine blood tests performed for a complete blood count (CBC) including platelet counts and subsequently received a diagnosis of cancer to assess the range of cancers associated with a high platelet count. We also examined whether an increasing platelet count is associated with an increased cancer risk.

### Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies at term [^113KPAAY]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate platelet counts at delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

Platelet counts in women 16 to 45 years of age from August 1, 2011, through May 15, 2018, with a singleton pregnancy that delivered from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation. Women with pregnancy-related complications, preexisting disorders, or on medications that could affect platelet counts were excluded.

Results

A total of 18,526 women had uncomplicated pregnancies with mean platelet count from 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation of 220×10 9 /L. The lower limit 95th percentile (2.5% quantile) was 120×10 9 /L. Platelet counts decreased weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation, becoming significant at 39 weeks of gestation and beyond, compared with 37 weeks (p < 0.01). Mean platelet counts: 225×10 9 /L at 37 weeks, 223×10 9 /L at 38 weeks, 219×10 9 /L at 39 weeks, 218×10 9 /L at 40 weeks, and 216×10 9 /L at 41 weeks of gestation. Platelet counts of less than 150×10 9 /L occurred in 9.7%.

Conclusion

Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies decrease weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. This will be important to consider when serial platelet values are monitored for other indications.

Screening asymptomatic patients for HIT — platelet count monitoring: In patients receiving heparin in whom the risk of HIT is considered low (< 0.1%), the ASH guideline panel suggests against platelet count monitoring to screen for HIT. In patients receiving heparin in whom the risk of HIT is considered intermediate (0.1%-1.0%) or high (> 1.0%), the ASH guideline panel suggests platelet count monitoring to screen for HIT, beginning on day 0 if the patient has received heparin in the 30 days before the current course of heparin, or from day 4 until day 14 or until heparin is stopped, whichever occurs first, if practicable; in higher-risk patients monitoring is suggested at least every other day, and in intermediate-risk patients every 2 or 3 days. Remarks specify risk examples: low-risk patients include medical and obstetrical patients receiving LMWH, patients receiving LMWH after minor surgery or trauma, and many patients receiving fondaparinux; intermediate-risk patients include medical and obstetrical patients receiving UFH and patients receiving LMWH after major surgery or major trauma; high-risk populations include surgical and trauma patients receiving postoperative UFH; some patients may receive a combination of UFH and LMWH or UFH and fondaparinux and should be considered to belong to the UFH group; and some clinicians may choose to begin monitoring before day 4 to aid interpretation of later values.

### Scientific and therapeutic advances in antiplatelet therapy [^1157pqFW]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, the platelet has emerged as a pivotal entity in cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, the 'preeminence of the platelet' has spawned a variety of drugs that have been shown in large-scale randomized trials to improve patient outcomes in acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous revascularization procedures. Although the platelet was initially viewed only as a bystander in haemostasis, it is now evident that the platelet is in fact a key mediator of thrombosis as well as of inflammation. New insights at the cellular and genomic levels will probably generate novel drugs to inhibit platelet function more effectively and safely than previously possible.

### Haemostatic monitoring during postpartum haemorrhage and implications for management [^111FYMQV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Platelet count in PPH

The clinical significance of gestational thrombocytopenia and whether decreases in platelet number are counterbalanced by increased platelet reactivityare not fully understood. One study has suggested low platelet count to be an independent risk factor for PPH. A retrospective analysis of 797 pregnancies found that a platelet count < 100×10 9 litre −1 on admission to the labour ward was associated with increased PPH incidence in some women. A large retrospective analysis also demonstrated an inverse association between lowest platelet count and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement. Subsequent prospective studies showed that at diagnosis of haemorrhage, platelet counts in PPH patients were significantly lower than those in healthy parturients, and that decreasing platelet count during obstetric bleeding may be associated with progression to severe PPH.

These findings suggest that platelet transfusion or desmopressin may be valid haemostatic therapies for PPH. However, they raise concerns about recommended transfusion triggers. Data suggest that platelet count should be maintained ≥ 100×10 9 litre −1 during ongoing PPH, but a prospective analysis of 30 patients with coagulopathy after abruptio placentae had platelet counts ∼90×10 9 litre −1 at 0 and 4 h postpartum. However, current PPH guidelines recommend platelet transfusion only when the platelet count decreases below 50×10 9 litre −1, although in other massive haemorrhage guidelines, a trigger of 75×10 9 litre −1 is recommended. Studies are required to confirm the validity of current approaches.

### 1.5 million platelet count limit at essential thrombocythemia diagnosis: correlations and relevance to vascular events [^114FFkVj]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

In patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) with extreme thrombocytosis (ExT ≥ 1500 × 10 9 /L), cytoreductive therapy is recommended in the current National Comprehensive Cancer network and European LeukemiaNet treatment guidelines. A recent international physician survey disclosed marked inconsistencies regarding the management of low-risk ET with ExT ≥ 1500 × 10 9 /L, arising from concerns related to an increased risk of thrombosis and/or bleeding. The prothrombotic or prohemorrhagic impact of thrombocytosis was studied in a prospective multicenter cohort of 776 patients with ET from the randomized PT-1 trial, and no association between blood counts at diagnosis and future complications was found. However, platelet count outside of the normal range (> 450 × 10 9 /L) during follow-up was associated with an immediate risk of major hemorrhage but not thrombosis. Conversely, some studies in ET with ExT have implicated aspirin use as the culprit for associations with major hemorrhage, whereas other studies have suggested a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis in patients with ExT. In addition, interpretation of findings from prior reports is confounded by the variability in platelet count thresholds used to define ExT.

### Platelet transfusion for patients with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111xTyNy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide evidence-based guidance on the use of platelet transfusion in people with cancer. This guideline updates and replaces the previous ASCO platelet transfusion guideline published initially in 2001. Methods ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the medical literature published from September 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016. This review builds on two 2015 systematic reviews that were conducted by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines. For clinical questions that were not addressed by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (the use of leukoreduction and platelet transfusion in solid tumors or chronic, stable severe thrombocytopenia) or that were addressed partially (invasive procedures), the ASCO search extended back to January 2000. Results The updated ASCO review included 24 more recent publications: three clinical practice guidelines, eight systematic reviews, and 13 observational studies. Recommendations The most substantial change to a previous recommendation involved platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on data from randomized controlled trials, adult patients who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation at experienced centers may receive a platelet transfusion at the first sign of bleeding, rather than prophylactically. Prophylactic platelet transfusion at defined platelet count thresholds is still recommended for pediatric patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation and for adult and pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Other recommendations address platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors or in those who undergo invasive procedures. Guidance is also provided regarding the production of platelet products, prevention of Rh alloimmunization, and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion (www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki).

### Reevaluating thrombocytosis as a risk factor in free flap surgery: does timing matter? [^114WErkU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 400,000, has been implicated as a risk factor in free flap failure. Despite proposed mechanisms of pedicle thrombosis, recent studies have suggested that thrombocytosis has no effect on free tissue transfer viability. Risk factors that may compromise successful free tissue transfer should be understood and elucidated, with particular attention to thrombocytosis and its conflicting evidence in the literature. We hypothesize that thrombocytosis has no bearing on free flap success or the rates of pedicle thrombosis.

Methods

Our institution performed a retrospective chart review on all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction over the past 6 years. Patient demographics, medical history, type and location of free tissue transfer, preoperative platelets, postoperative platelets, and flap outcomes and complications (wound dehiscence, infection, hematoma, seroma, and need for blood transfusion) were recorded. Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U tests, χ2 test, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine P values to compare flap outcomes in patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count > 400,000) and those with platelet counts less than 400,000.

Results

In our 502-patient cohort, 71 were found to have a platelet count > 400,000 (35 preoperatively and 36 postoperatively) and 431 patients had platelet counts < 400,000. There were 42 reconstructive failures (flap success rate of 91.6%) and 111 returns to the operating room (OR). For patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 24 flaps returned to the OR (44.4%), whereas in patients without thrombocytosis, 87 flaps returned to the OR (19.4%; P < 0.001). In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, 10 OR returns were due to pedicle venous thrombosis (18.5%), in comparison to 10 returns for venous thrombosis in those with normal platelets (2.2%; P < 0.001). There was a small difference in free flap success rates between those with postoperative thrombocytosis and normal platelets, 88.7% versus 92.11%; however, this was not statistically significant (P = 0.71). The thrombocytosis group had a higher incidence of overall postoperative complications (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Thrombocytosis has historically been cited as a risk factor for free flap reconstruction failure with recent conflicting evidence in the literature. In patients with postoperative thrombocytosis, we found an increased risk of venous thrombosis; however, this did not result in increased flap failure. There was an increase in postoperative complications, which corresponds with National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data reported in the literature. We suspect that thrombocytosis is not a harbinger of free flap failure but rather a marker for overall inflammation, which may confer a higher rate of venous thrombosis requiring reoperation and postoperative complications.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### Spurious rise in the automated platelet count because of bacteria [^116EFhoB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The era of automation in haematology, although improving the accuracy and precision of results, has also introduced the laboratory haematologist to a vast array of spurious parameters. The identification of these results is important so that inappropriate management decisions are avoided. The case presented here illustrates a spuriously raised automated platelet count resulting from bacterial overgrowth in the blood sample.

### The platelet count in cerebral malaria, is it useful to the clinician? [^111BPtMf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Relationship between the platelet count, coma score, and outcome.

There was no significant difference in the admission median platelet counts between those who were admitted with a Blantyre coma score of 0 and those admitted with a Blantyre coma score of either 1 or 2 (Table 1).

Among those admitted with a Blantyre coma score of 0, there was no significant difference in the median platelet count between those who had full recovery and those who either died or had neurological sequela (Table 1).

There was no significant difference in the outcome between patients who had an admission platelet count of less than 50,000/μL and those with a count of above 50,000/μL (Table 2). The outcomes were also similar when patients with an admission platelet count of less than 100,000/μL were compared with those having an admission platelet count of greater than 100,000/μL (Table 3). Similar analyses revealed no differences when restricted to patients with malarial retinopathy.

Relationship between platelet count, presence of retinopathy, and outcome.

There was a significant difference in the distribution of platelets between those children with clinical cerebral malaria who had retinopathy and those who did not (Figure 2). Children with cerebral malaria with retinopathy were twice as likely to be thrombocytopenic as were those without retinopathy.

Figure 2.
Distribution of admission platelet counts in two patient groups: (0) clinical cerebral malaria (CM) without retinopathy (N = 294) and (1) CM with retinopathy (N = 324) (z = 7.277, P = 0.0000).

Among patients who had cerebral malaria with retinopathy, there was no significant difference in the platelet counts between those who had full recovery and those who either died or had sequela (see Table 1).

The case fatality rate for patients who had cerebral malaria with retinopathy was 16.7%, whereas in the cerebral malaria group without retinopathy, it was 17.9%.

### The platelet count in cerebral malaria, is it useful to the clinician? [^116HXfhi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Thrombocytopenia has been shown to be present in all forms of malaria.–Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for thrombocytopenia. Immune mediated mechanisms appear to be important, including immune destruction of circulating platelets, splenic pooling, and reduced platelet lifespan.

In this study, we found a highly significant difference in the platelet counts between children who were admitted with a diagnosis of cerebral malaria and those with bacterial meningitis (P < 0.0001). The 18.7% of children in our study with bacterial meningitis had parasitemia, but the median platelet count in this group was not significantly lower than in children with meningitis who were not parasitemic. This suggests that in children admitted with acute bacterial meningitis, parasitemia may be an incidental finding not contributing to the child's disease.

It has been suggested that platelets may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Among children analyzed in this study, a subset of those who died were studied at autopsy and were found to have a significantly greater degree of platelet accumulation in brain microvasculature than children who died of severe malarial anemia or of non-malarial encephalopathies. It is not known whether this sequestration of platelets contributes to peripheral thrombocytopenia in malaria.

Few studies have been done to assess the clinical or prognostic significance of the circulating platelet count. In a study of 215 Senegalese childrenwith severe malaria, those with a platelet count of less than 100,000/μL were more likely to die than those with a platelet count of greater than 100,000/μL (odds ratio [OR] = 6.31, 95% CI = 2.0–26.0). Among the 75 children with cerebral malaria in that study, those with a platelet count of less than 100,000/μL were similarly at greater risk of a fatal outcome than children with higher platelet counts (OR = 9.43, 95% CI = 2.3–54.4).

In this study of 1,811 prospectively enrolled children with cerebral malaria, we have shown no consistent relationship between the platelet count and outcome. We confirm previous reports that children admitted with a Blantyre coma score of 0 have a higher case fatality rate than children with less profound coma. Yet, we find no significant difference in the platelet counts between patient groups whether analyzed by their admitting coma score or by the outcome of their illness.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^117LmGWA]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Non-malignant haematological disease

Gaucher disease is associated with well-defined patterns of cytopenia. In spleen-intact patients, platelets tend to decrease first. With increasing spleen size, haemoglobin levels also gradually fall, followed lastly by a decline in leucocyte numbers. In contrast, asplenic patients have normal or even high platelet counts. If there is severe bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, haemoglobin levels often decline first. Deviations from these patterns may indicate other co-morbidities. For example, a non-splenectomized patient presenting with a large or slightly enlarged spleen, severe anaemia, but normal platelet counts is inconsistent with the expected pattern in Gaucher disease (which would normally include thrombocytopenia). In this case, it is likely that the anaemia is not (only) related to Gaucher disease and other causes should be investigated.

Anaemia

Anaemia is associated with poorer outcomes and poorer quality of life in a wide variety of disorders including Gaucher disease. Adoption of recent proposals to increase the lower limits defining anaemia for adults would enable earlier treatment and elevated treatment goals for haemoglobin normalization in adult Gaucher patients. Importantly, the proposals recognize that different ethnicities may have different requirements – an observation that may also be extended to different medical conditions and environments. Many Gaucher patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum present as children. Should anaemia in children, therefore, also be re-evaluated? In the absence of revised guidelines, an individualized approach to Gaucher disease management encourages physicians to assess, treat and monitor every patient individually for optimal outcomes. This takes into account variables, such as ethnic origin, age, environment, diet, co-morbidities and Gaucher disease status in all possible affected organs and tissues including bone marrow and bone density, in making disease management decisions.

### Multiparameter phenotyping of platelet reactivity for stratification of human cohorts [^115rPTdW]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelet function testing has been an important aspect of cardiovascular research, diagnostics, and investigation of platelet biology since the invention of Born aggregometry in the 1960s. Platelets are central to the pathology of cardiovascular disease (CVD), forming thrombi that occlude blood vessels and, hence, cause major adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Platelet function tests measure the propensity of platelets to perform functions that are central to hemostasis and thrombosis, such as the formation of aggregates, activation of integrin αIIbβ3, or the secretion of dense and α granules. These responses can be triggered by multiple stimuli, such as collagen, adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), and thrombin to which platelets are exposed following vascular damage. There is a large degree of heterogeneity in the way in which platelets respond to these stimuli, but it is not fully understood why these differences exist and whether they should be taken into account clinically. To understand the importance of differences in platelet function, they must first be characterized and defined using comprehensive standardized tests. Only in this way can even basic questions regarding the relative degree of heterogeneity in responses to different platelet agonists, such as the extent to which an individual might be hyperresponsive to 1 agonist but hyporesponsive to another, be answered.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^1118RWMT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Individuals with cancer often have an elevated platelet count at the time of diagnosis. The extent to which an elevated platelet count is an indicator of cancer is unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association of an elevated platelet count with a cancer diagnosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nested case-control study included Ontario residents enrolled in the provincial health insurance plan who had 1 or more routine complete blood count (CBC) tests performed between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, with follow-up through December 31, 2018. Case patients were individuals with a new cancer diagnosis during the observation period. Eligible control individuals were cancer free before the date of diagnosis for a case patient to whom they were matched. One case patient was matched to 3 controls based on sex, age, and health care use patterns. Data were analyzed from September 24, 2020, to July 13, 2021.

Exposures

Case patients and controls were assigned to 1 of 5 exposure groups based on age- and sex-specific platelet count distributions in the control population: very low (≤ 10th percentile), low (> 10th to 25th percentile), medium (> 25th to < 75th percentile), high (75th to < 90th percentile), and very high (≥ 90th percentile).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for specific cancer sites for each category of platelet count at intervals up to 10 years after a blood test.

Results

Of the 8 917 187 eligible Ontario residents with a routine CBC record available, 4 971 578 (55.8%) were women; the median age at the first CBC was 46.4 years (IQR, 32.5–59.5 years). Among individuals with a routine CBC record available, 495 341 (5.6%) received a diagnosis of first primary cancer during the 10-year observation period. The OR for a solid tumor diagnosis associated with a very high platelet count vs a medium platelet count in the 6-month period before the diagnosis was 2.32 (95% CI, 2.28–2.35). A very high platelet count was associated with colon (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 4.22–4.54), lung (OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 4.22–4.53), ovarian (OR, 4.62; 95% CI, 4.19–5.09), and stomach (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 3.91–4.66) cancers. Odds ratios attenuated with increasing time from CBC test to cancer diagnosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this nested case-control study, an elevated platelet count was associated with increased risk of cancer at several sites. Our findings suggest that an elevated platelet count could potentially serve as a marker for the presence of some cancer types.

### Comparison of different platelet count thresholds to guide administration of prophylactic platelet transfusion for preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation [^11766Yma]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people who are thrombocytopenic due to bone marrow failure. Although considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40 years, some areas continue to provoke debate, especially concerning the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated in 2012 that addressed four separate questions: prophylactic versus therapeutic-only platelet transfusion policy; prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold; prophylactic platelet transfusion dose; and platelet transfusions compared to alternative treatments. This review has now been split into four smaller reviews looking at these questions individually; this review compares prophylactic platelet transfusion thresholds.

Objectives

To determine whether different platelet transfusion thresholds for administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions (platelet transfusions given to prevent bleeding) affect the efficacy and safety of prophylactic platelet transfusions in preventing bleeding in people with haematological disorders undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 6, 23 July 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950), and ongoing trial databases to 23 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in people with haematological disorders (receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or undergoing HSCT) that compared different thresholds for administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions (low trigger (5 x 10(9)/L); standard trigger (10 x 10(9)/L); higher trigger (20 x 10(9)/L, 30 x 10(9)/L, 50 x 10(9)/L); or alternative platelet trigger (for example platelet mass)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Three trials met our predefined inclusion criteria and were included for analysis in the review (499 participants). All three trials compared a standard trigger (10 x 10(9)/L) versus a higher trigger (20 x 10(9)/L or 30 x 10(9)/L). None of the trials compared a low trigger versus a standard trigger or an alternative platelet trigger. The trials were conducted between 1991 and 2001 and enrolled participants from fairly comparable patient populations. The original review contained four trials (658 participants); in the previous update of this review we excluded one trial (159 participants) because fewer than 80% of participants had a haematological disorder. We identified no new trials in this update of the review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. None of the included studies were at low risk of bias in every domain, and all the included studies had some threats to validity. Three studies reported the number of participants with at least one clinically significant bleeding episode within 30 days from the start of the study. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with a clinically significant bleeding episode between the standard and higher trigger groups (three studies; 499 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.90; low-quality evidence). One study reported the number of days with a clinically significant bleeding event (adjusted for repeated measures). There was no evidence of a difference in the number of days of bleeding per participant between the standard and higher trigger groups (one study; 255 participants; relative proportion of days with World Health Organization Grade 2 or worse bleeding (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.48, P = 0.162; authors' own results; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported the number of participants with severe or life-threatening bleeding. There was no evidence of any difference in the number of participants with severe or life-threatening bleeding between a standard trigger level and a higher trigger level (two studies; 421 participants; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.88; low-quality evidence). Only one study reported the time to first bleeding episode. There was no evidence of any difference in the time to the first bleeding episode between a standard trigger level and a higher trigger level (one study; 255 participants; hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.91; low-quality evidence). Only one study reported on all-cause mortality within 30 days from the start of the study. There was no evidence of any difference in all-cause mortality between standard and higher trigger groups (one study; 255 participants; RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.81; low-quality evidence). Three studies reported on the number of platelet transfusions per participant. Two studies reported on the mean number of platelet transfusions per participant. There was a significant reduction in the number of platelet transfusions per participant in the standard trigger group (two studies, mean difference -2.09, 95% CI -3.20 to -0.99; low-quality evidence). One study reported on the number of transfusion reactions. There was no evidence to demonstrate any difference in transfusion reactions between the standard and higher trigger groups (one study; 79 participants; RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.09). None of the studies reported on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with haematological disorders who are thrombocytopenic due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy or HSCT, we found low-quality evidence that a standard trigger level (10 x 10(9)/L) is associated with no increase in the risk of bleeding when compared to a higher trigger level (20 x 10(9)/L or 30 x 10(9)/L). There was low-quality evidence that a standard trigger level is associated with a decreased number of transfusion episodes when compared to a higher trigger level (20 x 10(9)/L or 30 x 10(9)/L). Findings from this review were based on three studies and 499 participants. Without further evidence, it is reasonable to continue with the current practice of administering prophylactic platelet transfusions using the standard trigger level (10 x 10(9)/L) in the absence of other risk factors for bleeding.

Grading of recommendations — interpretation of strong versus conditional: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has defined interpretations. For patients, strong means most individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional means the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful. For clinicians, strong means most individuals should follow the recommended course of action, while conditional indicates different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences.

### Platelet function and antiplatelet therapy [^111eaUwJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Platelets have roles other than haemostasis and many are relevant to surgical practice. This review examines both the pathophysiology of platelets in haemostasis and thrombosis, and other roles of clinical importance.

Methods

A literature review of the various functional roles of platelets was performed (Medline search, English language) including their action in inflammation (in particular in atherothrombosis), antimicrobial defence and tumour growth. Current clinical evidence for antiplatelet therapy is also reviewed.

Results and Conclusion

Platelet functions are multiple, complex and not limited to haemostasis. Understanding of platelet pathophysiology continues to grow and this is relevant to many aspects of surgical practice, particularly the clinical use of antiplatelet therapy.

### JAK2-tree: a simple CBC-based decision rule to guide appropriate JAK2 V617F mutation testing [^112EFuZM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Importantly, the JAK2-tree was not designed to be used in place of clinical acumen, and other specific clinical indications for testing that might be brought to bear in specific circumstances. Indeed, there may be specific and highly significant examples of non-CBC informed clinical indications that warrant JAK2 V617F testing. Such examples might include thrombotic events involving atypical sites; to provide molecular confirmation of a previous clinical diagnosis of an MPN; or for patients in which JAK2 V617F allele burden determination might influence therapy. In such instances, available CBC data might not support testing, clinical information notwithstanding. As such, laboratories are cautioned to defer to specific clinical history indicators and careful laboratory-to-clinic communication in this regard, as required. The JAK2-tree algorithm also does not distinguish between leukocytosis owing to lymphocytes or myeloid forms; in the context of isolated lymphocytosis, and without other clinical indications, JAK2 V617F testing would likely be unremarkable, despite algorithmic suggestion to the contrary.

Although we could not demonstrate significant changes in performance parameters with tandem application of the JAK2-tree algorithm, other algorithmic variations might be worth testing. For instance, assuming normal Hb and platelet count, the JAK2-tree approach suggests that a normal WBC would be sufficient for testing. Instead, and considering the minor WHO criteria for diagnosis of PMF, a laboratory might adjust the JAK2-tree algorithm to stipulate reflexive testing with an elevated WBC, and with a signal to discuss the request with the clinical team in instances of normal range (ie, 7–11×10 9 /L) WBC to confirm appropriateness.

Take home messages

Laboratory testing, especially testing employing molecular methods, should be appropriately optimised for the clinical scenario.
Clinical decision rules applied to laboratory testing can reduce costs and prevent waste.
Simple clinical decision rules like JAK2-tree can assist in appropriate test ordering.

### Platelet counts and patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YR8K2]. Neonatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several cohort studies have shown an association between low platelet counts in the first day(s) of life and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. However, these results have not been confirmed by other studies.

Objective

To perform a meta-analysis of all the studies addressing the relationship between platelet counts in the first day(s) of life and PDA in preterm infants.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from their inception until December 2014. Results from 11 cohort studies involving 3,479 preterm infants (gestational age < 32 weeks) were pooled using random-effects modeling.

Results

Meta-analysis showed a significant positive association between PDA and platelet counts < 150 × 10(9)/l [6 studies, risk ratio (RR) = 1.215, 95% CI: 1.027–1.436], between PDA and platelet counts < 100 × 10(9)/l (5 studies, RR = 1.255, 95% CI: 1.034–1.525), and between significant PDA (SPDA) and platelet counts < 100 × 10(9)/l (5 studies, RR = 1.254, 95% CI: 1.021–1.540). The association between SPDA and platelet counts < 150 × 10(9)/l was not statistically significant (6 studies, RR = 1.289, 95% CI: 0.925–1.795). Pooled standard differences in mean platelet counts between infants with and without PDA/SPDA were not statistically different.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis reveals a marginal but significant association between low platelet counts in the first day(s) of life and PDA/SPDA in very preterm infants. This association needs to be confirmed in prospective studies.

### Significance of thrombocytosis for determining prognosis in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma [^113pUoHb]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the significance of thrombocytosis for determining survival in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who underwent radical nephrectomy with curative intent.

Methods

The study population comprised 151 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy with a diagnosis of localized RCC. The inclusion criteria were at least one preoperative platelet count and a tissue diagnosis of RCC. Thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count greater than 400,000/mm3. The charts of these patients were retrospectively reviewed and the relationship between the preoperative platelet counts and survival was evaluated according to the histologic variants.

Results

The mean follow-up was 37.1 ± 24.1 months (median 34, range 3 to 91). Of these 151 patients, 21 had a preoperative platelet count greater than 400,000/mm3. The thrombocytosis rate was significantly greater in those with advanced T stage (P = 0.045). Lymph node positivity also correlated with thrombocytosis (P = 0.028). However, no statistically significant correlation was found between grade and histologic subtypes and thrombocytosis (P = 0.053 and P = 0.354, respectively). Ten (47.6%) of 21 patients with thrombocytosis and 21 (16.2%) of the remaining 130 patients died of disease progression (P = 0.002). The Kaplan-Meier cause-specific survival curves showed that patients who had thrombocytosis had a mean survival of 45.2 months compared with 76.6 months in patients without thrombocytosis (P = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Preoperative thrombocytosis is a significant predictor for determining prognosis in patients with localized RCC. Thrombocytosis was found more frequently in patients with advanced stage RCC, and patients with preoperative thrombocytosis had a worse survival compared with those with normal platelet counts.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112tM3yb]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Platelets and clotting factors

Limited evidence exists regarding the need, or threshold, for platelet transfusion in UGIB. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus bundle advises a threshold of transfusion at 50×10 9 platelets/L or less based on major haemorrhage protocols with the acknowledgment that this advice is based primarily on expert opinion. Within the context of variceal bleeding, no evidence suggests that platelet count correlates with inability to control bleeding or rebleeding. However, in the event of these outcomes, the Baveno VII consensus advises correction can be considered on an individual basis, whereas the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and British Society of Gastroenterology variceal guidelines advise transfusion at the threshold of 50×10 9 /L or less.

Clotting abnormalities and their management in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB is a complex area. Prothrombin time is often prolonged leading to the use of fresh frozen plasma; however, prothrombin is not an accurate indicator of the clotting risk in cirrhosis. Studies have not shown a clear benefit from fresh frozen plasma and the most recent iteration of US variceal guidelines did not advocate its use in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10^9/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10^9/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### Platelets as mediators of inflammation [^115prvQ7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

An expanding body of evidence continues to build on the central role of inflammation in the progression and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Platelets, long thought to play only a reactionary role at the time of endothelial disruption, are now recognized as important mediators of the inflammatory process. Platelet activation, which is modulated by both inflammatory and hemostatic factors, can lead to the release of hundreds of proteins — many with known proinflammatory functions. Although compelling evidence is lacking that antiplatelet therapies directly lower markers of inflammation, there are intriguing, although preliminary, data suggesting that markers of inflammation predict the clinical benefit of antiplatelet therapies.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114SnLx7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification

The effectiveness of transfusing platelets to critically ill medical patients with active bleeding remains unclear. Moreover, there is significant variability in what clinicians consider serious active bleeding. The panel considered WHO grades 3 and 4 as serious active bleeding.

The literature search excluded patients with trauma and those with intracranial hemorrhage, resulting in the identification of 1 relevant study. An observational examination of platelet transfusions in adults with cirrhosis and esophageal variceal bleeding showed no significant difference in mortality rates between transfused and non-transfused individuals (25.3% vs 17.4%; p = 0.074). Moreover, stratification by platelet counts did not affect the results. Rebleeding rates were higher in those who received platelets, especially with pre-transfusion platelet counts > 20 × 10 9 /L, but not below this threshold. The relevance of these findings to other critically ill groups remains uncertain due to varying transfusion thresholds and potential selection and confounding bias.

In patients with thrombocytopenia and clinically significant active bleeding, platelet transfusion is the standard treatment. Strong evidence of net harm would be required to deviate from this practice, but the current evidence was insufficient to justify change. While a framework is suggested (Table 4), clinical judgment should guide platelet transfusion decisions, considering the bleeding site, severity, and coexisting factors that influence the patient's ability to tolerate bleeding.

Table 4
Suggested Approach for Platelet Transfusions

What Others Are Saying

Our recommendation aligns with those from other organizations. The BSH advises that for patients with WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding, platelet counts should be maintained > 50 × 10 9 /L if the clinician considered the bleeding severe and > 30 × 10 9 /L if considered not severe. Moreover, they suggest considering empirical transfusion in initial management of major hemorrhage (causing heart rate > 110 beats/min and/or systolic BP < 90 mm Hg). The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis advocates for transfusions to achieve > 50 × 10 9 /L in patients with DIC and active bleeding. The ASCO suggests transfusing platelets above prophylactic levels for active localized bleeding associated with necrotic tumors.ESICM guidelines made no recommendation regarding platelet transfusions in patients with massive or non-massive bleeding. Meanwhile, recommendations to transfuse platelets above 50 × 10 9 /L for bleeding patients with cirrhosis are controversial.

### Clinical aspects of platelet inhibitors and thrombus formation [^111XhtQd]. Circulation Research (2007). Low credibility.

The platelet, once thought to be solely involved in clot formation, is now known to be a key mediator in various others processes such as inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Supported by the wealth of evidence from clinical trials demonstrating their benefits in patient outcomes, antiplatelet agents have become paramount in the prevention and management of various diseases involving the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial systems. Despite being among the most widely used and studied classes of medical therapies, new discoveries regarding important clinical aspects and properties of these agents continue to be made. As our understanding of platelet biology expands, more effective and safer novel therapies continue to be developed. The use of more refined agents in conjunction with a better understanding of their effects will further the ability to provide more optimized care on an individual basis.

### Platelet reference ranges for neonates, defined using data from over 47, 000 patients in a multihospital healthcare system [^117GMG2N]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Identifying a platelet count as abnormal (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) can facilitate recognizing various disease states. However, the published reference ranges for platelet counts in neonates may be imprecise, as they were generated from relatively small sample sizes and compiled before modern platelet enumeration methods.

Study Design

We derived new neonatal reference ranges for platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) measurements using electronic data accumulated during a recent 6-year period from a multihospital healthcare system.

Result

Platelet counts were obtained between the first and the 90th day after birth, from 47,291 neonates delivered at 22 to 42 weeks gestation. The first platelet counts obtained in the first 3 days of life, increased over the range of 22 to 42 weeks gestation. In those born ≤ 32 weeks gestation, the lower reference range (5th percentile) was 104,200 microl(-1), but it was 123,100 microl(-1) in late-preterm and -term neonates. Advancing postnatal age had a significant effect on platelet counts; during the first 9 weeks, the counts fit a sinusoidal pattern with two peaks; one at 2 to 3 weeks and a second at 6 to 7 weeks. The upper limit of expected counts (95th percentile) during these peaks were as high as 750,000 microl(-1).

Conclusion

The figures herein describe reference ranges for platelet counts and MPV determinations of neonates at various gestational ages during their first 90 days. Expected values differ substantially from the 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1) range previously used to define neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis. The new definitions will render the diagnoses of neonatal thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis less commonly than when the old definitions were used, because the new ranges are wider than 150,000 microl(-1) to 450,000 microl(-1).

### Abnormal platelet count is an independent predictor of mortality in the elderly and is influenced by ethnicity [^112v2iyH]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Even though alterations in platelet counts are presumed to be detrimental, their impact on the survival of patients has not been studied in large cohorts. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis was examined in a large inner city outpatient population of 36,262 individuals aged ≥ 65 years old. A significant association with shorter overall survival was found for both thrombocytopenia (HR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.36–1.56) and thrombocytosis (HR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.56–1.97) when compared to the survival of patients with normal platelet counts. This effect persisted across all ethnic groups. However, African-Americans (non-Hispanic Blacks) with either thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis were at significantly lower risk compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians (HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69–0.96 and HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53–0.94, respectively). Furthermore, Hispanics with thrombocytosis were found to have a lower mortality risk compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians with thrombocytosis (HR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44–0.81). A value of < 125,000 platelets per microliter was a better prognostic marker for non-Hispanic Blacks and these subjects with this platelet count had similar overall survival to that of Caucasians with a value of < 150,000 per microliter. In conclusion, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia are independently associated with shorter overall survival in elderly subjects and this effect is modified by ethnicity. Using different thresholds to define the association of thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis with overall mortality risk among non-Hispanic Blacks may, therefore, be warranted.

### Platelet transfusion for patients with cancer: clinical practice guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology [^112qdDVb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the most effective, evidence-based approach to the use of platelet transfusions in patients with cancer.

Outcomes

Outcomes of interest included prevention of morbidity and mortality from hemorrhage, effects on survival, quality of life, toxicity reduction, and cost-effectiveness.

Evidence

A complete MedLine search was performed of the past 20 years of the medical literature. Keywords included platelet transfusion, alloimmunization, hemorrhage, threshold and thrombocytopenia. The search was broadened by articles from the bibliographies of selected articles.

Values

Levels of evidence and guideline grades were rated by a standard process. More weight was given to studies that tested a hypothesis directly related to one of the primary outcomes in a randomized design. BENEFITS/HARMS/COST: The possible consequences of different approaches to the use of platelet transfusion were considered in evaluating a preference for one or another technique producing similar outcomes. Cost alone was not a determining factor.

Recommendations

Appendix A summarizes the recommendations concerning the choice of particular platelet preparations, the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, indications for transfusion in selected clinical situations, and the diagnosis, prevention, and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion.

Validation

Five outside reviewers, the ASCO Health Services Research Committee, and the ASCO Board reviewed this document.

### The impact of intraoperative transfusion of platelets and red blood cells on survival after liver transplantation [^117Ku51X]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is associated with adverse outcome after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although experimental studies have shown that platelets contribute to reperfusion injury of the liver, the influence of allogeneic platelet transfusion on outcome has not been studied in detail. In this study, we evaluate the impact of various blood products on outcome after OLT.

Methods

Twenty-nine variables, including blood product transfusions, were studied in relation to outcome in 433 adult patients undergoing a first OLT between 1989 and 2004. Data were analyzed using uni- and multivariate stepwise Cox's proportional hazards analyses, as well as propensity score-adjusted analyses for platelet transfusion to control for selection bias in the use of blood products.

Results

The proportion of patients receiving transfusion of any blood component decreased from 100% in the period 1989–1996 to 74% in the period 1997–2004. In uni- and multivariate analyses, the indication for transplantation, transfusion of platelets and RBC were highly dominant in predicting 1-yr patient survival. These risk factors were independent from well-accepted indices of disease, such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score and Karnofsky score. The effect on 1-yr survival was dose-related with a hazard ratio of 1.377 per unit of platelets (P = 0.01) and 1.057 per unit of RBC (P = 0.001). The negative impact of platelet transfusion on survival was confirmed by propensity-adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

This retrospective study indicates that, in addition to RBC, platelet transfusions are an independent risk factor for survival after OLT. These findings have important implications for transfusion practice in liver transplant recipients.

### Genetically determined platelet count and risk of cardiovascular disease [^111KET67]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study used MR to investigate the association between genetically determined platelet count and cardiovascular risk. We report an increased risk of ischemic stroke with higher genetically determined platelet count. Stroke is the second largest cause of death worldwide, therefore, understanding its associated risk factors is a clinical and public health priority. These findings may thus guide further work toward identifying preventative strategies.

### Cancer incidence in patients with a high normal platelet count: a cohort study using primary care data [^112zndQt]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A platelet count > 400 × 109/l (i.e. thrombocytosis) is a recently discovered risk marker of cancer. The risk of undiagnosed cancer in patients with thrombocytosis is 11.6% for men and 6.2% for women, well above the 3% risk threshold set by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for cancer investigation. Patients with a platelet count at the upper end of the normal range (325–400 × 109/l) could be at increased risk of undiagnosed malignancy.

Objective

To quantify the risk of an undiagnosed cancer in patients with a platelet count at the upper end of the normal range.

Methods

A primary care-based cohort study using Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) data from 2000 to 2013. The study sample comprised 2704 individuals stratified by platelet count: 325–349 × 109/l; 350–374 × 109/l; 375–399 × 109/l. Incident cancer diagnoses in the year following that platelet count were obtained from patient records.

Results

Cancer incidence rose with increasing platelet count: 2.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9 to 3.6] in subjects with a count of 325–349 × 109/l, 3.7% (95% CI 2.5 to 5.3) in subjects with a count of 350–374 × 109/l and 5.1% (95% CI 3.4 to 7.5) in those with a count of 375–399 × 109/l. Colorectal cancer was most commonly diagnosed in all three groups. Cancer incidence was consistently higher in males than in females.

Conclusion

These results suggest that clinicians should consider cancer in patients with a platelet count > 375 × 109/l, review reasons for testing and any additional reported symptoms. Until these results are replicated on a larger scale, recommendations for clinical action cannot be made.

### A prediction model for the grade of liver fibrosis using magnetic resonance elastography [^112j6C8a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Prediction of liver fibrosis by LSM value

First, we determined a cut-off value for classifying the fibrosis grade using only the LSM value in 122 patients in the training group. The medians of LSM were 0.65 (range, −0.17 to 2.14), 1.25 (0.42 to 3.33), and 2.58 (0.64 to 3.90) in Grade I, Grade II, and Grade III, respectively, in the training group. The cut-off value was determined as the average of the median LSM score of each Grade: Grade I, ≤ 0.95; Grade II, 0.95–1.91; Grade III, ≥ 1.91. Using the cut-off value, 26 of 36 (72.2%) Grade I patients, 10 of 18 (55.5%) Grade II patients, and 7 of 8 (87.5%) Grade III patients were correctly diagnosed among the 62 patients in the independent test group, with an accuracy of 69.3% in total.

Prediction of liver fibrosis by fibrosis score

In the training group, liver fibrosis was significantly correlated with LSM value (r = 0.687, P < 0.001), ICGR15 (r = 0.527, P < 0.001), platelet count (r = –0.537, P < 0.001), hyaluronic acid (r = 0.433, P < 0.001), and IV core 7S (r = 0.464, P < 0.001) on Spearman's rank test (Fig. 2). On LASSO analysis, LSM, ICGR15, and platelet count were selected as variants for the liver fibrosis prediction model.

### Management of bleeding and of invasive procedures in patients with platelet disorders and / or thrombocytopenia: guidelines of the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) [^115xBXaC]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal management of bleeding or its prophylaxis in patients with disorders of platelet count or function is controversial. The bleeding diathesis of these patients is usually mild to moderate: therefore, transfusion of platelet concentrates may be inappropriate, as potential adverse effects might outweigh its benefit. The availability of several anti-hemorrhagic drugs further compounds this problem, mainly because the efficacy/suitability of the various treatment options in different clinical manifestations is not well defined. In these guidelines, promoted by the Italian Society for Studies on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (Società Italiana per lo Studio dell'Emostasi e della Trombosi [SISET]), we aim at offering the best available evidence to help the physicians involved in the management of patients with disorders of platelet count or function. Literature review and appraisal of available evidence are discussed for different clinical settings and for different available treatments, including platelet concentrates (PC), recombinant activated factor VII, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, aprotinin and local hemostatic agents.

1 Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 10 3 per μL often are asymptomatic. Patients with a count from 30 to 50 × 10 3 per μL rarely present with purpura, although they may have excessive bleeding with trauma. Spontaneous bleeding is more likely in patients with platelet counts less than 5 × 10 3 per μL, and is considered a hematologic emergency.
2. HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be suspected in patients recently treated with heparin. Platelet counts decline within five to 10 days in patients with no previous exposure to heparin and may decline precipitously in patients with recent heparin exposure.

This life-threatening disorder is characterized by the presence of platelet-activating antibodies recognizing multimolecular complexes bound to unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia present with mild thrombocytopenia or a 50 percent decrease in platelet count from baseline. Activity Participation and Invasive Procedures General recommendations for activity participation have been based on historical data from patients with chronic severe thrombocytopenia. 39, 40 A platelet count greater than 50 × 10 3 per μL is adequate for hemostasis and is unlikely to be clinically recognized. Patients with a platelet count greater than this level can engage in most activities, but should use caution if participating in contact sports. 16, 40 Patients with platelet counts less than 10 × 10 3 per μL should be restricted from contact sports and other potentially traumatic activities. 3 per μL.

Other procedures, such as bone marrow biopsy, bronchoscopy, and endoscopy, can be completed safely in patients with platelet counts greater than 20 × 10 3 per μL, provided that no other bleeding abnormalities are noted. 41, 42 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations state that epidural anesthesia in pregnancy is safe in patients with platelet counts between 50 and 100 × 10 3 per μL. 10.
