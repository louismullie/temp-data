## Question

Would you treat cystitis despite normal urinalysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cystitis should be treated even if the urinalysis is normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability based on classic symptoms and risk factors. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of urinalysis, especially its negative predictive value. Next, I will consider guideline-based pathways for uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent UTI, and special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics. After that, I need to check for alternative diagnoses that can mimic cystitis. Finally, I will weigh the risks and benefits of empiric antibiotics versus observation and outline a practical, stewardship-aligned plan with clear follow-up triggers.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. In a healthy, nonpregnant woman with acute dysuria, frequency, and urgency and no vaginal discharge, the likelihood of acute uncomplicated cystitis is high enough that many patients can be diagnosed clinically and treated empirically, whereas the presence of vaginal discharge lowers the likelihood of UTI and should prompt evaluation for vaginitis instead [^11697iDy] [^1115Xh8w] [^111rAs3W]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies when the urinalysis is normal; yes, guidelines still anchor diagnosis primarily in compatible symptoms and absence of competing diagnoses, with urinalysis used to support or refute the diagnosis rather than replace it [^11697iDy] [^111rAs3W].

> Next, I should review the performance of urinalysis. A negative urinalysis, defined as negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites with fewer than about 5 WBCs per high-power field, has a high negative predictive value for clinically relevant UTI, around 92% specificity and 97% PPV for absence of UTI in large datasets, which means a negative test substantially reduces the probability of infection but does not absolutely exclude it [^112yE1He]. Wait, let me verify the directionality; I initially said 97% PPV for absence, but that's not quite right — those figures reflect high specificity and strong rule-out performance, so I should correct myself: a negative urinalysis strongly argues against UTI, yet false negatives occur, especially with dilute urine, early infection, or low-count organisms, so clinical judgment remains essential [^112yE1He] [^111pL38E].

> I will now examine guideline-based management for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For women with classic symptoms and no complicating factors, guidelines support empiric treatment without mandatory urinalysis or culture, though many clinicians still obtain urinalysis to document inflammation and guide care. If urinalysis is negative, the probability of UTI drops, and observation with analgesia and close follow-up becomes reasonable, reserving antibiotics if symptoms persist or worsen [^113i5848] [^112yE1He] [^114jroXT]. Hold on, I should double-check the role of culture here. In uncomplicated first episodes, routine culture is not required, but it is indicated for atypical symptoms, treatment failure, or suspected complicated infection, which I will keep in mind for safety-netting [^117ARgks] [^116RajvE].

> For recurrent UTI, I need to ensure a stricter diagnostic approach. Guidelines recommend obtaining urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities for each symptomatic episode before treating, to confirm infection, identify resistance, and avoid overtreatment. This is especially important when prior urinalyses have been negative or when symptoms are atypical [^113gEoge] [^1123xW8W] [^112pQR79]. Wait, let me verify the rationale; culture-directed therapy reduces inappropriate antibiotics and improves selection, aligning with stewardship goals in rUTI care [^111opq5j].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm that thresholds change. Even asymptomatic bacteriuria warrants screening and treatment due to risks of pyelonephritis and adverse obstetric outcomes, so a normal urinalysis does not reliably exclude infection in this population. If symptoms are present, I should obtain a culture and treat based on results, ideally before antibiotics if the patient is stable [^114a81wN] [^1135Vqiz]. Hold on, I should verify timing; yes, culture confirmation is preferred when feasible in symptomatic pregnant patients to ensure appropriate therapy and stewardship [^114a81wN].

> For pediatrics, I need to check age-specific guidance. In febrile infants and young children, a negative urinalysis does not rule out UTI, so if clinical suspicion is moderate to high, catheterized urinalysis and culture should be obtained before antibiotics unless the child is ill-appearing and requires immediate therapy. In toilet-trained children, midstream specimens are acceptable, but catheterized samples are preferred in non–toilet-trained children [^116Ciijs] [^113KcgBB] [^113zxcXz]. Let me reconsider the implication; a normal dipstick in a symptomatic child should not reassure me enough to forgo culture when suspicion remains [^116Ciijs].

> But wait, what if the symptoms reflect an alternative diagnosis. I should actively consider vaginitis, urethritis or STIs, overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome, and urethral or pelvic floor disorders when urinalysis is negative, because these conditions frequently mimic cystitis and would not improve with antibiotics; urinalysis and culture are part of the initial workup to exclude infection before labeling IC or BPS, and shared decision-making is emphasized in IC/BPS care [^1115Xh8w] [^115AtvJ8] [^112Fq4ED]. Hold on, I should verify that IC/BPS requires exclusion of infection; yes, guidelines consistently require urinalysis and culture to rule out active infection before confirming IC/BPS [^115AtvJ8].

> I need to weigh risks and benefits of empiric antibiotics when urinalysis is normal. Treating in this scenario risks overtreatment, adverse effects, microbiome disruption, and resistance selection, with minimal benefit given the low post-test probability after a negative urinalysis. Stewardship guidance and data on asymptomatic bacteriuria reinforce avoiding antibiotics unless there is strong clinical evidence of infection or a compelling risk context like pregnancy [^1135Vqiz] [^111FEV9c] [^111opq5j]. Hmm, wait a minute, could a short course still help symptomatically? Even in confirmed cystitis, antibiotics offer only modestly faster symptom relief than placebo, underscoring the limited benefit of empiric therapy when the diagnosis is uncertain [^11619zp2].

> Let me outline a practical, stewardship-aligned approach. If the patient has classic symptoms and a negative urinalysis, I should provide analgesia, ensure adequate hydration, and arrange follow-up within 48 to 72 hours to reassess symptoms. If symptoms persist or worsen, I should obtain a urine culture and then treat based on results, whereas if symptoms resolve, no antibiotics are needed. In patients with rUTI, I should obtain urinalysis and culture before treating each episode. In pregnancy, I should culture and treat per obstetric guidance. In children, I should obtain catheterized testing if suspicion remains despite a negative dipstick [^114jroXT] [^117ARgks] [^113gEoge] [^114a81wN] [^116Ciijs]. I should double-check that this plan aligns with current guidance; yes, it reflects contemporary primary care and urology recommendations emphasizing selective testing and delayed or culture-directed therapy when uncertainty persists [^111rAs3W] [^113gEoge].

> Final answer: No, I would not routinely treat suspected cystitis when the urinalysis is normal in a nonpregnant adult with no complicating factors, because a negative urinalysis substantially lowers the probability of UTI and exposes the patient to unnecessary antibiotics. Instead, I would provide symptomatic care, reassess within 48 to 72 hours, and obtain a urine culture if symptoms persist or if the patient is in a higher-risk category such as pregnancy, pediatrics, or recurrent UTI, treating only if culture confirms infection or if clinical progression warrants empiric therapy despite negative testing [^112yE1He] [^114jroXT] [^117ARgks] [^113gEoge].

In select cases, **empiric treatment of cystitis may be appropriate despite a normal urinalysis** when classic symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency) are present and alternative causes are unlikely [^11697iDy] [^111rAs3W]. Urinalysis can miss low-count or early infections, and a negative result does not fully exclude cystitis [^112twY2m] [^111uFNwY]. If symptoms are typical and the patient is at low risk for complications, **empiric therapy is reasonable**; if symptoms are atypical, the patient is high risk, or symptoms persist, obtain a urine culture before treating [^117ARgks] [^116RajvE]. Avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria or when an alternative diagnosis is likely [^1135Vqiz] [^1115Xh8w].

## Limitations of urinalysis in diagnosing cystitis

Urinalysis is a rapid, noninvasive test, but it has important limitations:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Urinalysis can miss low-count or early infections, and false negatives occur, especially with dilute urine or intermittent bacteriuria [^1176mDr8] [^111uFNwY].

- **Contamination**: Improper collection can cause false negatives or positives, particularly in women [^111pL38E].

- **Detection thresholds**: Standard culture thresholds (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) may miss clinically significant infections, especially in symptomatic patients [^116Sp5Ub].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize clinical judgment and selective testing:

- **Empiric treatment**: In women with classic symptoms and no complicating factors, empiric treatment without urinalysis is acceptable [^115RQPT9] [^113i5848].

- **Culture indications**: Obtain urine culture in atypical presentations, treatment failure, recurrent UTIs, pregnancy, or immunocompromised patients [^117ARgks] [^116RajvE].

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures [^1135Vqiz].

---

## Clinical scenarios where treatment may be warranted despite normal urinalysis

Treatment may proceed despite a normal urinalysis in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for treatment** |
|-|-|
| Classic symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency) with no alternative diagnosis | High likelihood of cystitis despite negative urinalysis [^113i5848] |
| Early or low-count infection | Urinalysis may be falsely negative [^113i5848] [^111uFNwY] |
| Recurrent UTIs with consistent symptom pattern | Prior history supports diagnosis despite negative urinalysis [^112pQR79] [^113i5848] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Higher risk of complications, lower threshold for treatment [^114UNutx] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where treatment should be avoided

Avoid treatment when:

- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Common and benign; treatment increases harm without benefit [^1135Vqiz] [^111FEV9c].

- **Alternative diagnosis**: Vaginitis, urethritis, or STIs are more likely [^1157rr32].

- **No objective evidence**: Persistent symptoms without pyuria or bacteriuria warrant further evaluation, not antibiotics [^111XL5y9].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A structured approach balances accuracy and stewardship:

- **Clinical assessment**: Confirm classic symptoms and exclude alternative diagnoses [^11697iDy].

- **Urinalysis**: Perform, but interpret in clinical context; negative results do not exclude infection [^111pL38E].

- **Urine culture**: Obtain when presentation is atypical, symptoms persist, or the patient is high risk [^117ARgks] [^116RajvE].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess if symptoms persist or recur; consider alternative diagnoses or further testing [^111XL5y9].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Empiric treatment of cystitis despite a normal urinalysis is reasonable when classic symptoms are present and alternatives are unlikely, especially in low-risk patients. A negative urinalysis does not exclude infection, but **treatment should be individualized** based on risk, symptom severity, and clinical judgment. When uncertainty remains or the patient is high risk, obtain a urine culture before treating [^117ARgks] [^113gEoge].

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^111FEV9c]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

An under-appreciated aspect of ASB is that these bacteria that are not causing local infection are part of the normal urinary microbiome that is protective against ascending infection. Thus, antibiotics aimed at erring on the side of caution to prevent or avoid missing a UTI may do the exact opposite, by increasing UTI risk. An RCT of younger women with a known history of recurrent cystitis in Italy found up to threefold increased risk of symptomatic UTI among those systematically screened and treated for ASB compared with those treated based on symptoms. Antibiotics beget more antibiotics, and some patients will enter a cycle of recurrent episodes of ASB, UTI, or both, leading to additional antibiotic related harms.

A final harm of treatment of ASB is the premature closure bias that may occur in concluding the presence of UTI, without searching for the true cause of the non-urinary condition or change in a resident's clinical status.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^1135Vqiz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

People may not be completely healthy, but not terribly ill either, so you think: it might be a UTI. But whether [a POCT] would really rise that much in that kind of infection I wonder. B-IV

Despite the perceived advantage of POCT for 'ruling in' UTI, various respondents thought that positive test results might give rise to new diagnostic uncertainties. Due to the limited specificity of general inflammatory markers, positive results could also indicate the presence of other infections. Therefore, treatment decisions remained dependent on clinical reasoning.

You don't know where the infection is located. It doesn't have a specific… It could be anywhere. You get all kinds of infections with the same signs. You have to look at that carefully. So [POCT] is just an addition to the toolkit. B-I

As a result, some respondents feared that the limited specificity of a POCT could lead to inadequate treatment, such as prescribing antibiotics for UTI while the resident is actually suffering from another infection.

If you have someone with vague symptoms and a high [POCT], do you then know it's a urinary tract infection? The danger is that there's an infection elsewhere, and that you treat them with nitrofurantoin and that that has no effect. B-IV

Hence, in the case of non-specific symptoms, some respondents recommended either combining POCT with further examination of clinical symptoms to exclude infections other than UTI, or not to use POCT at all in residents suspected of having another infection besides UTI.

You preferably want to get it in context as much as possible. So not someone who also happens to have a cough and has just arrived on the rehabilitation ward, and might have a cystitis. Cos then you don't know what you're measuring. A-V

Introduction

There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI), undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a key step in every guideline concerned with the management of LUTS. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite negative tests. The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published literature points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbiological analysis, in which thresholds between 10³ cfu mL⁻¹ and 10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are employed to diagnose UTI. Dipstick urinalysis performs equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic variability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution due to high fluid intake before the test.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^11619zp2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Education and informed decision-making — supportive care and risk of progression note that the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is enhanced by the unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and that the diagnosis of UTI is highly imprecise. While no evidence exists to support the concept of withholding antimicrobials to patients with rUTIs, substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of UTI. For patients with episodes of acute cystitis without complicating factors, there is minimal risk of progression to tissue invasion or pyelonephritis, and additional characteristics of great concern do not reliably indicate risk or presence of bacteremic bacteriuria or pyelonephritis. In a representative study of older patients with bacteremia who had the same bacterial species cultured from the urine, only 1 of 37 participants aged 75 years and older had symptoms consistent with UTI, such as dysuria. Multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment for acute cystitis offers little but mildly faster symptomatic improvement compared to placebo in patients with acute dysuria and significant bacteriuria, and the incidence of pyelonephritis in these patients is low and is not substantially different in individuals receiving antibiotics versus those treated with supportive care of analgesics and hydration; expectant management with analgesics and hydration while awaiting culture results is likely underutilized.

Results

Patients

A total of 1996 women presented to the clinical service between 2004 and 2014: 433 attended just once for urodynamic studies or urinalysis, and these patients were neither treated in the centre nor followed up. A further 444 women were treated for OAB and did not demonstrate pyuria or presented with SUI as their only symptom. These women were not treated with antibiotics. After these exclusions, 624 women [mean age = 53.4 years; standard deviation (SD) = 18] who demonstrated pyuria ≥ 1 wbc μl⁻¹ at presentation were included in the analysis.

Patients described longstanding LUTS prior to their referral to this service (mean duration = 6.5 years; SD = 6.3). Many women had an established diagnosis of OAB or BPS/IC from elsewhere. Urinary urgency symptoms were described by 73% of women, whilst voiding symptoms and lower urinary tract pain affected 71% and 65%, respectively; 43% of women described SUI. Patient demographics and symptoms are summarised in Table 2.

Dipstick and urine culture

We performed 1988 dipstick analyses: 558 (28%) demonstrated trace or greater leucocyte esterase; 138 (7%) were nitrite positive. However, 1433 (72%) of these samples showed pyuria on direct microscopy. Of the 2209 MSU cultures performed during observation, only 362 (16%) were positive using the threshold of ≥ 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹, although microscopic pyuria was recorded in 1741 (79%) of these samples.

Antibiotic use

Our prescribing practice evolved over the course of the observation period as we scrutinised our treatment–response data. This led to treatment regimens being simplified and refined as data were collected. In 2014, when data collection ceased, 80% of patients were being treated with 12 antibacterial regimens. Six of these consisted of methenamine hippurate combined with one antibiotic, most commonly a first-generation antimicrobial such as cefalexin, nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim. Full-dose treatment was administered. We identified a cluster of patients with marked urethral pain and low-level pyuria whose symptoms preferentially responded to macrolide or tetracycline, perhaps suggestive of a fastidious microorganism.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^115DRiri]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Separate analyses demonstrating the change in individual symptom subscales associated with treatment are presented in Fig. 2. Antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant reduction in urinary urgency (F = 90; p = 0.0001), lower urinary tract pain (F = 108; p = 0.0001) and voiding symptoms (F = 10; p = 0.002). Symptoms of SUI were unchanged during treatment (F = 1.4; p = 0.24) (Table 3).

The PGI-I responses demonstrated a significant improvement over the treatment period (χ² = 2272; df = 5; p = 0.001); 84% of women rated their condition as much better (20%) or very much better (64%). These data demonstrate that long-term antibiotic treatment is associated with resolution of chronic LUTS and pyuria, which is an independent surrogate marker of infection. These findings were accompanied by PGI-I responses indicating that most patients perceived these symptomatic improvements to be clinically meaningful.

Plots of pyuria and symptoms in individual patients for each visit showed a typical response pattern in 73% of cases, termed a damped oscillation (Fig. 3). This features a series of oscillations of decreasing amplitude; 10% of patients demonstrated the converse, and this was associated with symptomatic deterioration. Ten per cent showed a rapid, uninterrupted fall to baseline (critically damped oscillation) and 7% were unclassifiable.

Baseline variables of age, duration of symptoms, urinary frequency/incontinence and pyuria did not predict treatment outcome. Higher pain scores at presentation were predictive of greater maximal symptom palliation associated with antibiotic therapy (b = 0.57, p = 0.029). Higher scores for urinary urgency (b = 1.1, p = 0.001) and voiding symptoms (b = 1.0, p = 0.005) predicted less favourable responses, although the magnitude of these effects was small.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112pQR79]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) evaluation — Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). To make a diagnosis of rUTI, clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and the presence of uropathogenic bacteria in association with symptomatic episodes (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain repeat urine studies when an initial urine specimen is suspect for contamination, with consideration for obtaining a catheterized specimen (Clinical Principle). Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may offer patient-initiated treatment (self-start treatment) to select rUTI patients with acute episodes while awaiting urine cultures (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^115RQPT9]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common cause of acute dysuria is infection, especially cystitis. Other infectious causes include urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis. Noninfectious inflammatory causes include a foreign body in the urinary tract and dermatologic conditions. Noninflammatory causes of dysuria include medication use, urethral anatomic abnormalities, local trauma, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An initial targeted history includes features of a local cause (e.g., vaginal or urethral irritation), risk factors for a complicated urinary tract infection (e.g., male sex, pregnancy, presence of urologic obstruction, recent procedure), and symptoms of pyelonephritis. Women with dysuria who have no complicating features can be treated for cystitis without further diagnostic evaluation. Women with vulvovaginal symptoms should be evaluated for vaginitis. Any complicating features or recurrent symptoms warrant a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture. Findings from the secondary evaluation, selected laboratory tests, and directed imaging studies enable physicians to progress through a logical evaluation and determine the cause of dysuria or make an appropriate referral.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^111pL38E]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is invaluable in the diagnosis of urologic conditions such as calculi, urinary tract infection, and malignancy. It also can alert the physician to the presence of systemic disease affecting the kidneys. Although urinalysis is not recommended as a routine screening tool except in women who may be pregnant, physicians should know how to interpret urinalysis results correctly. This article reviews the correct method for performing urinalysis and the differential diagnosis for several abnormal results. 23 Up to 20 percent of patients with gross hematuria have urinary tract malignancy; a full work-up with cystoscopy and upper-tract imaging is indicated in patients with this condition. 24 In patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, 5 to 22 percent have serious urologic disease, and 0. 5 to 5 percent have a genitourinary malignancy. 25–29.

Exercise-induced hematuria is a relatively common, benign condition that often is associated with long-distance running. Results of repeat urinalysis after 48 to 72 hours should be negative in patients with this condition.
30. Further evaluation of persistent proteinuria usually includes determination of 24-hour urinary protein excretion or spot urinary protein-creatinine ratio, microscopic examination of the urinary sediment, urinary protein electrophoresis, and assessment of renal function.
32. NITRITES Nitrites normally are not found in urine but result when bacteria reduce urinary nitrates to nitrites. Many gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms are capable of this conversion, and a positive dipstick nitrite test indicates that these organisms are present in significant numbers. This test is specific but not highly sensitive. Thus, a positive result is helpful, but a negative result does not rule out UTI.

Gram staining can help guide antibiotic therapy, but it is not indicated in routine outpatient practice. Clean-catch specimens from female patients frequently are contaminated by vaginal flora. In these patients, five bacteria per HPF represents roughly 100, 000 colony-forming units per mL, the classic diagnostic criterion for asymptomatic bacteriuria and certainly compatible with a UTI. In symptomatic patients, a colony count as low as 100 CFU per mL suggests UTI, and antibiotics should be considered. The presence of bacteria in a properly collected male urine specimen is suggestive of infection, and a culture should be obtained.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^113ymreh]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be associated with chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) undetected by routine diagnostic tests. Antimicrobial therapy might confer benefit for these patients.

Materials and methods

Over 10 years, we treated patients with chronic LUTS. Pyuria was adopted as the principal biomarker of infection. Urinary leucocyte counts were recorded from microscopy of fresh midstream urine (MSU) samples. Antibiotics were prescribed and the prescription adjusted to achieve a measurable clinical response and a reduction in pyuria.

Results

We treated 624 women [mean age = 53.4 years; standard deviation (SD) = 18] with chronic LUTS and pyuria. Mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6.5 years. Only 16% of MSU cultures submitted were positive (≥ 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹). Mean treatment length was 383 days [SD = 347; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 337–428]. Treatment was associated with a reduction in total LUTS (F = 98; p = 0.0001), 24-h frequency (F = 75; p = 0.0001), urinary urgency (F = 90; p = 0.0001), lower urinary tract pain (F = 108; p = 0.0001), voiding symptoms (F = 10; p = 0.002), and pyuria (F = 15.4; p = 0.0001). Full-dose first-generation antibiotics for UTI, such as cefalexin, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim, were combined with methenamine hippurate. We recorded 475 adverse events (AEs) during 273,762 treatment days. There was only one serious adverse event (SAE). We observed no increase in the proportion of resistant bacterial isolates.

Conclusion

This large case series demonstrates that patients with chronic LUTS and pyuria experience symptom regression and a reduction in urinary tract inflammation associated with antimicrobial therapy. Disease regression was achieved with a low frequency of AEs. These results provide preliminary data to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114XF3PN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^117EvPBG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Over testing for UTIs is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture in the absence of vaginal symptoms are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis, however, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER. In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740). While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed the ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that over‐testing of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture‐negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient‐based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture‐negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either poorly documented in the clinical record or based on point‐of‐care urine dipstick testing. While the absence of pyuria on urinalysis has a high negative predictive value and can help rule out the diagnosis, urinalysis when utilized independent of UTI symptoms should not be used to guide treatment decisions even if positive for pyuria as it has a poor positive predictive value for UTI. Given that pyuria is common among women of all ages, especially elderly women, performing an initial screening urinalysis in the absence of urinary symptoms often results in overtreatment as it may be uncomfortable for providers to withhold antibiotic treatment in the face of positive laboratory results. These principles underlie clinical guidance by the US Preventative Services Task Force and Infectious Disease Society of America both recommending against screening urinalysis in nonpregnant adults. This is why we encourage not only antibiotic stewardship but also diagnostic stewardship appropriately restricting laboratory testing to patients in whom there is significant clinical suspicion for UTI.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113C4q31]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms that predict microscopic pyuria [^1176mDr8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinalysis by dipstick and/or midstream urine culture (MSU) is the first investigation of the patient presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Negative results are usually assumed to exclude infection and diagnoses such as overactive bladder (OAB) depend on negative tests. The MSU is still considered the gold standard diagnostic test for UTI. It relies on isolating 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen, using aerobic culture with a Enterobacteriaceae -selective media. This was first described by Kass after studying patients with chills, fever, flank pain and dysuria. Kass never claimed to define a threshold for use with "cystitis", i.e. frequency/dysuria. However, 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ has been widely adopted. The dipstick has been validated against a standard of 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹ of a known urinary pathogen.

In fact, these urinalysis methods are not sensitive and are incapable of excluding UTI. Effort is being made to find improved urinalysis techniques to detect UTI, but currently the best performing method is microscopy of a fresh unspun, unstained, clean-catch specimen of urine in a counting chamber to enumerate the white cells.

Our past reliance on dipstick analysis and culture to diagnose UTI has now been rejected in the literature, we should therefore re-examine our understanding of the symptoms and signs involved in LUTS.

The analysis of symptoms presents different challenges to the measurement of change over time, when assessing treatment outcomes. Well-known validated scores of LUTS such as the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ), the Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (ICI-QOL) and Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (F-LUTS) are used to assess the impact of incontinence. They have performed well in measuring the effects of treatments in clinical trials. Their utility in single, cross-sectional analyses is less assured because they use adjectival scaling such as "bothersomeness". People differ greatly in their semantic interpretation of adjectives. In longitudinal studies, the potential error from this variance can be avoided by the normalisation of within subject changes. This option is available to neither cross-sectional studies, nor to data collected at the time of diagnostic assessment. Additionally, scores such as the ICIQ were validated in patients after UTI had been excluded on the evidence of urine culture. Our interest lies in the symptoms associated with reliable indicators of UTI.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^116g24D7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Finally, only two thirds of patients generated urinalysis data, with the potential to generate selection bias. During normal clinic service, patients on telephone review had lower symptom scores than those attending in person for urinalysis (t = −3.2, p = 0.002, 95% CI of difference = −4.8 to −1.1), indicating more stable disease permitting remote surveillance. This was also the case after the prescribing restrictions were lifted and normal service resumed (t = −4.9, p < 0.001, 95% CI of difference = −5.9 to −2.5). By contrast, during the suspension there was no difference between symptom scores comparing those who attended for face-to-face review and urinalysis with those who were reviewed by telephone (t = −0.84, p = 0.4, 95% CI of difference = −2.4 to +1.0). Thus, it is less likely that the data were confounded by a selection bias.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has generated guidelines for the management of acute UTI, which limits antibiotic prescriptions to 14 days. The majority of patients in this study had failed to respond to standard antibiotic treatment and other recommended interventions for painful LUTS, prior to referral to this service, and a significant proportion of those referred for treatment came from other tertiary units. NICE has acknowledged a guideline deficit for patients affected by complicated UTI by publishing a "placeholder" statement, employed to identify a knowledge gap. It is noteworthy that the treatment of acute UTI using recommended antibiotic prescribing guidelines is associated with a 25%–35% microbiological and symptomatic failure rate. These data, and the results of our work, demonstrate the need for further research into the management of UTI and for existing guidelines on UTI to be urgently reviewed. It is our hope that clinicians will recognise the challenges that these patients pose in their own practices and that this will galvanise efforts to advance our knowledge in this neglected area of medicine.

While widespread concern about antimicrobial resistance (AMR) makes stewardship policies imperative, a one-size-fits-all approach may be equally unhelpful. Long-term antimicrobials should not be withheld when they are necessary (as is the case, for example, in tuberculosis patients). This is particularly true when patients are treated in a consultant-led clinical setting, subject to additional governance processes, careful monitoring and individualised therapy.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection [^114LUrfp]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common in children. They may present with a range of severity from cystitis to febrile UTI or pyelonephritis. The presentation may be vague and have nonspecific symptoms. Therefore, a UTI should be considered in all children with a fever in whom other sources have been excluded. Treatment depends on the age, location of infection, and degree of illness in the child. Sick children and infants less than 3 months should be treated as inpatients, and healthy children and older infants may be treated as outpatients. Urinalysis provides presumptive evidence of infection, whereas urine culture is definitive. Close follow-up and outpatient evaluations are needed to prevent long-term consequences of infection.

The goal of work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms is to establish the severity and cause of lower urinary tract symptoms and to predict with certainty which patients will respond to which treatments. Clinical guidelines exist to guide urologists in decision-making. All patients need a medical history with a validated symptom score, a physical examination, and a urinalysis. Prostate-specific antigen, postvoid urine residual, and peak urine flow rate provide additional information at little cost. For more invasive testing high-level data are lacking and guidelines defer to the urologist. Even the most extensive work-up is imperfect, and thus the attempt to balance costs with benefits of invasive testing.

2.3.1 Clinical and microbiological considerations

Following the EAU guidelines on urological infections, the diagnosis of AC was made by the treating physician based on the clinical history and the typical clinical symptoms of patients referred to the clinic. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AC underwent urinalysis and urine culture, obtaining a urine sample collected in the middle of urination. UTI–AC is defined microbiologically, according to the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America, by the presence of ≥ 10⁵ CFU (colony‐forming units)/ml of a bacterial species isolated in a urine culture. In patients with the typical symptoms of UTI, a cut‐off point of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml was also accepted. Women clinically diagnosed with AC based on symptoms and with a positive urine leukocyte esterase test but without significant bacteriuria of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml in urine culture were not excluded from the study, as there is evidence that AC can occur with a low bacterial count. The results of urine analysis were usually evaluated in the midstream as the number of cells in a chamber's cell (high power field [HPF]). Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false‐positive and false‐negative results can occur. According to publications, the normal reference value for women is 0–5 white blood cells/HPF. However, it can vary depending on regulatory issues, equipment, local guidelines, clinical protocols.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — conditional treatment and acute self-treatment: Conditional treatment uses a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or follow-up without treatment, with antibiotics started only if symptoms progress or do not resolve, and has not been studied in women older than 65 years or with rUTI; in women younger than 65 years, resolution without antibiotics occurred in 20% to 47%, but one study reported pyelonephritis in the placebo group at 2% to 2.6%. In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^113i5848]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114UNutx]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial cystitis is defined as an infection of the urinary tract with acute-onset symptoms, such as dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence, evidence of urinary tract inflammation (pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field on microscopic urinalysis, and the presence of bacterial uropathogen. Localized urinary traction infection (previously uncomplicated urinary traction infection) is an infection of the urinary tract in a healthy patient with an anatomically and functionally normal urinary tract, no signs or symptoms of upper urinary involvement or bacteremia, and no known complicating factors that would make the patient susceptible to progression to a systemic infection. Systemic UTI is an infection of the urinary tract with signs and symptoms of systemic infection, with or without localized symptoms originating from any site in the urinary tract. Recurrent UTI is defined as two separate episodes of acute bacterial cystitis and associated symptoms over a 6-month period within the preceding year. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine that causes no illness or symptoms.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is mostly caused by bacteria, including E. coli (86%), S. saprophyticus (4%), Klebsiella species (3%), Proteus species (3%), Enterobacter species (1.4%), Citrobacter species (0.8%), and Enterococcus species (0.5%).
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acute uncomplicated cystitis include female gender, recent sexual activity, use of a diaphragm with spermicide, and a history of recurrent UTIs. Complicating factors for UTIs include patient factors that place an individual at higher risk for development of a UTI and potentially decrease efficacy of therapy. Such factors include anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract (stone disease, diverticulum, neurogenic bladder), immunocompromised host, and indwelling urinary tract foreign body (indwelling urethral catheters, ureteral stents).
- **Disease course**: Bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract results in acute uncomplicated cystitis, which causes classic symptoms of dysuria, frequent voiding of small volumes, and urinary urgency. Occasional hematuria and suprapubic discomfort may be present.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute uncomplicated cystitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults [^116shPap]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Dysuria, defined as pain, burning, or discomfort on urination, is more common in women than in men. Although urinary tract infection is the most frequent cause of dysuria, empiric treatment with antibiotics is not always appropriate. Dysuria occurs more often in younger women, probably because of their greater frequency of sexual activity. Older men are more likely to have dysuria because of an increased incidence of prostatic hyperplasia with accompanying inflammation and infection. A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of dysuria. Urinalysis may not be needed in healthier patients who have uncomplicated medical histories and symptoms. In most patients, however, urinalysis can help to determine the presence of infection and confirm a suspected diagnosis. Urine cultures and both urethral and vaginal smears and cultures can help to identify sites of infection and causative agents. Coliform organisms, notably Escherichia coli, are the most common pathogens in urinary tract infection. Dysuria can also be caused by noninfectious inflammation or trauma, neoplasm, calculi, hypoestrogenism, interstitial cystitis, or psychogenic disorders. Although radiography and other forms of imaging are rarely needed, these studies may identify abnormalities in the upper urinary tract when symptoms are more complex.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^112F9LFM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be associated with chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) undetected by routine diagnostic tests. Antimicrobial therapy might confer benefit for these patients.

Materials and Methods

Over 10 years, we treated patients with chronic LUTS. Pyuria was adopted as the principal biomarker of infection. Urinary leucocyte counts were recorded from microscopy of fresh midstream urine (MSU) samples. Antibiotics were prescribed and the prescription adjusted to achieve a measurable clinical response and a reduction in pyuria.

Results

We treated 624 women [mean age = 53.4 years; standard deviation (SD) = 18] with chronic LUTS and pyuria. Mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6.5 years. Only 16% of MSU cultures submitted were positive (≥ 10⁵ cfu mL⁻¹). Mean treatment length was 383 days [SD = 347; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 337–428]. Treatment was associated with a reduction in total LUTS (F = 98; p = 0.0001), 24-h frequency (F = 75; p = 0.0001), urinary urgency (F = 90; p = 0.0001), lower urinary tract pain (F = 108; p = 0.0001), voiding symptoms (F = 10; p = 0.002), and pyuria (F = 15.4; p = 0.0001). Full-dose first-generation antibiotics for UTI, such as cefalexin, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim, were combined with methenamine hippurate. We recorded 475 adverse events (AEs) during 273,762 treatment days. There was only one serious adverse event (SAE). We observed no increase in the proportion of resistant bacterial isolates.

Conclusion

This large case series demonstrates that patients with chronic LUTS and pyuria experience symptom regression and a reduction in urinary tract inflammation associated with antimicrobial therapy. Disease regression was achieved with a low frequency of AEs. These results provide preliminary data to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^112twY2m]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Pyuria, detected by microscopy of a fresh midstream urine (MSU) specimen, is the most sensitive surrogate marker of UTI. It circumvents the problems associated with quantitative bacterial culture, and its value in the diagnosis of UTI is recognised by international practice guidelines. Whilst ≥ 10 wbc μl⁻¹ is employed almost universally to diagnose UTI, contemporary data cast doubt on this threshold in patients with LUTS. In the symptomatic patient, controlled studies have demonstrated that lower pyuria counts of 1–9 wbc μl⁻¹ are associated with an increase in independent inflammatory and microbiological markers of UTI. Thus, lower levels of pyuria may also indicate infection and immune activation.

The diagnostic picture has become even more complex with the recent discovery that UTI can legitimately involve polymicrobial infection; mixed growth cultures do not necessarily reflect contamination. What's more, advances in enhanced culture and genomics technology have revealed that even the normal bladder is not sterile and that a bona fide, possibly protective, urinary microbiota can be described. Uncertain diagnosis is not the only area that complicates UTI management. The treatment of acute cystitis also has its limitations. A Cochrane review reported symptomatic and microbiological failure rates of 37 and 28% 4–10 weeks after treatment. Amongst healthy young women with their first UTI, the risk of recurrence within 6 months is 24%. If they have a history of one or more UTIs, the risk of recurrence rises to 70% in that same year. In a Canadian surveillance study, 14% of 30,851 residents with UTI experienced more than one episode during the 2-year study period, and 2% had six or more episodes.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^112cy9EG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^116vrr3E]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and symptoms of recurrent cystitis in patients with negative urinalysis present a worrying management problem. The treatment of painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a significant challenge, and there are few quality data to guide clinicians. The evidence for oral or intravesical therapies for painful bladder symptoms is poor. Cystodistension and urethral dilation are also deployed without evidence to support their utility. Patients with recurrent, acute symptoms of cystitis and negative urinalysis are often exposed to multiple, short courses of antibiotics in primary care without evidence of benefit.

While there are published guidelines for managing acute and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), there are none for patients who may be suffering a chronic form of the disease. Recently, we published data describing our experience treating women with chronic painful LUTS for a mean duration of 6 years prior to presentation to our clinic. These patients had been exposed to conventional therapies without a resolution of symptoms. Data were gathered from 624 patients over 10 years. Given microscopic pyuria and symptoms, we presumed an infectious cause even in the face of negative dipstick urinalysis and urine cultures, as these tests lack sensitivity and fail to detect infective organisms in bona fide disease. This previous report described the evolution of a simple management regimen using first-generation, narrow-spectrum, urinary antibiotics combined with methenamine hippurate, guided by symptom palliation and the resolution of pyuria. The study demonstrated that treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement and the resolution of biomarkers of infection. There were few treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and no significant increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates. These data are being employed to develop a randomised trial (RCT).

|-|-|
|Low risk|- Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only without testing|

### The emergency department diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection [^114XoE3y]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection seen in the emergency department. The spectrum of UTI includes simple versus complicated infection and lower versus upper UTI. No one history or examination finding is definitive for diagnosis. Testing often includes urinalysis and/or urine dipstick, and several pitfalls may occur in interpretation. Urine cultures should be obtained in complicated or upper UTIs but not simple and lower tract UTIs, unless a patient is pregnant. Imaging often is not required. Most patients with simple cystitis and pyelonephritis are treated as outpatients. A variety of potentially dangerous conditions may mimic UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111opq5j]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic stewardship and culture-directed management emphasizes that culture-directed, not empiric, therapies are associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic use, and that obtaining cultures for each symptomatic episode is associated with reduced rates of overtreatment and more appropriate antibiotic selection. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, risk of continued rUTIs as well as progression to later pyelonephritis is enhanced by unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria without any demonstrable benefit, and collateral damage from antimicrobial therapy includes alterations of the normal gut microbiome and promotion of multidrug resistant organisms. Escherichia coli isolates continue to demonstrate high in vitro susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and mecillinam, with these agents having minimal effects on the normal fecal microbiota, whereas TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones promote increased rates of antimicrobial resistance. Continued intermittent courses of antibiotics in rUTI patients are associated with significant adverse events, particularly in older adults, and thus substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of an acute cystitis episode. In asymptomatic women with a history of rUTIs, a placebo-controlled trial found those treated for ASB were more likely to have additional symptomatic cystitis episodes in a year of follow-up than those randomized to placebo, and over two years of follow up, treatment aimed at eradicating residual bacteriuria was associated with a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a higher incidence of pyelonephritis, and a poorer quality of life compared to non-treatment.

### Top ten myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urinary Tract infections [^112qavMU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common type of infection in the United States. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in March 2014 regarding antibiotic use in hospitals reported "UTI" treatment was avoidable at least 39% of the time. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of UTI plays an important role in cost-effective medical care and appropriate antimicrobial utilization.

Objective

We summarize the most common misperceptions of UTI that result in extraneous testing and excessive antimicrobial treatment. We present 10 myths associated with the diagnosis and treatment of UTI and succinctly review the literature pertaining to each myth. We explore the myths associated with pyuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, candiduria, and the elderly and catheterized patients. We attempt to give guidance for clinicians facing these clinical scenarios.

Discussion

From our ambulatory, emergency department, and hospital experiences, patients often have urine cultures ordered without an appropriate indication, or receive unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to over-interpretation of the urinalysis.

Conclusions

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in all age groups and is frequently over-treated. A UTI diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory information. This review will assist providers in navigating common pitfalls in the diagnosis of UTI.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^111pXPiY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Outcome data were not generated within a study, and no formal control group is available for comparison. Nonetheless, SUI symptoms amongst patients exposed to treatment targeting other LUTS did not change. Given our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUI, we would not expect antibiotic treatment to influence these symptoms. These data provide a positive control group. In addition, our centre has collected urinary biomarker data from control individuals in prospective research studies with 12-month follow-up. Thirty-six women (mean age = 45.5 years; SD = 11.4) were included as controls in these studies, providing monthly MSU samples for analysis. Median pyuria expression during follow-up was zero. Statistical comparison of these control data with patient data presented here demonstrates higher levels of pyuria expression amongst patients than controls across all time points (F = 39; p = 0.0001).

Demographic variables and disease chronicity did not predict outcome in association with antibiotic therapy, and many of the baseline symptom scores did not demonstrate any predictive properties. Greater urinary urgency and frequency were predictors of less favourable outcomes, although parameter estimates suggest that their utility in clinical practice would be questionable. Higher pain scores at baseline did predict a greater reduction in overall symptoms associated with treatment. If this is a genuine finding, it may hint that pain, a central feature of the inflammatory response, is a marker of infective, treatable pathology in these patients.

We tried to minimise treatment duration, but symptom relapse associated with a return of pyuria often necessitated further treatment cycles. As our treatment strategy evolved, we focused on first-generation, narrow-spectrum antibiotics at maximum dose, combined with methenamine hippurate, guided by changes in symptoms and urine microscopy. Methenamine has a general bactericidal effect in the urinary tract, suppressing bacterial growth without selecting for resistant microbes. These choices are likely to generate less bacterial resistance than using conventional antibiotics alone. Our resistance data would seem to support this approach.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, evaluation, AAP 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain a urine specimen for both culture and urinalysis through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration before administering antimicrobial therapy in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever, if antimicrobial therapy is deemed necessary due to ill appearance or another pressing reason.

Treatment duration and efficacy

We tested the need for ongoing treatment empirically by stopping antimicrobial therapy. Treatment cessation was permitted once any reduction in LUTS had reached a steady state and pyuria had cleared. If symptoms recurred, the occurrence was documented and treatment reinstated. Thus, we stopped treatment 858 times and restarted 633 (74%) times on recurrence. Amongst patients with pain symptoms, relapses were associated with significantly higher pain scores (mean = 4.2; 95% CI = 3.6–4.9) compared with their symptoms at the beginning of treatment (mean = 2.7; 95% CI = 2.2–3.2) (p = 0.001).

Two hundred and twenty-five women completed treatment and were discharged. The median number of patient visits was five (mean = 6.6; SD = 5), with 40% of women discharged after four visits and 80% within ten. Mean treatment length was 383 days, with a significant variation in duration (SD = 347; 95% CI = 337–428). Some patients required long-term therapy, as attempts to withdraw treatment were associated with relapse. Others were treated successfully but requested long-term monitoring due to anxieties about disease recurrence.

Figure 1 shows a plot of 24-h urinary frequency, total LUTS and pyuria at time points (A) baseline, (B) three subsequent review visits, (C) optimum state on treatment and (D) discharge. There was a significant reduction in 24-h urinary frequency (F = 75; p = 0.0001), total LUTS (F = 98; p = 0.0001) and log₁₀ pyuria (F = 15.4; p = 0.0001). Incontinence episodes did not change significantly (F = 1.8; p = .18). Optimum treatment-associated effects amongst patients who were not discharged are represented by data at time point (C).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112mptCM]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) definition — The bladder disease complex "includes a large group of patients with bladder and/or urethral and/or pelvic pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sterile urine cultures", and "IC/BPS comprises a part of this complex". The Panel used the Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology (SUFU) definition: "An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes". This definition "was selected because it allows treatment to begin after a relatively short symptomatic period", avoiding withholding associated with longer durations "(i.e., six months)", and "Definitions used in research or clinical trials should be avoided in clinical practice; many patients may be misdiagnosed or have delays in diagnosis and treatment if these criteria are employed".

### Diagnosing uncomplicated cystitis in women… [^1157rr32]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

the accompanying table on page 1944. Most of the time, a thorough history is sufficient to diagnose acute uncomplicated cystitis, because acute and multiple symptoms are usually caused by cystitis, whereas urethritis symptoms are often mild with a gradual onset. Vaginitis, on the other hand, is associated with fairly copious vaginal discharge, odor, dyspareunia, or pruritus. In one study, only 9 percent of women who had cystitis reported vaginal discharge compared with 93 percent of those with vaginitis. The risk of cystitis increases in women with certain symptoms, a history of cystitis, recent intercourse, recent diaphragm or sper-micide use, failure to urinate after intercourse, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or single status. In addition, combinations of symptoms are more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of cystitis.

The laboratory examination in women with suspected cystitis has often included a midstream clean-catch urine specimen. One study published in 2000 compared three groups of women: the first group collected midstream clean-catch urine samples, the second collected a urine specimen in a clean container, and the third group collected a midstream clean-catch urine specimen with a vaginal tampon inserted. Urine culture should be obtained in patients with suspected upper urinary tract infection. Pyuria can easily be detected; similarly, leukocyte esterase and nitrites can be detected on a "dipstick" test. A combination of the latter two tests can provide high specificity and sensitivity.

Quantitative urine culture results are considered positive in asymptomatic women if there are at least 100, 000 colony-forming units per mL, whereas they are considered positive in women with symptoms of acute cystitis if there are at least 100 CFU per mL. However, it is unusual that a woman with acute uncomplicated cystitis would need a urine culture. Decision to treat is based on the probability that the patient has cystitis. Because the prevalence of cystitis is approximately 50 percent, any additional symptoms to support this diagnosis will be more likely to make treatment beneficial.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^117LnxXk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^114MEdFJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.
