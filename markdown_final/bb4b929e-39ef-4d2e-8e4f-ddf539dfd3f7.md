## Question

What to do with TSH of 0.08? next step

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a TSH of 0.08 mIU/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what this degree of TSH suppression signifies and whether it fits subclinical versus overt hyperthyroidism. Then, I should verify the result with repeat testing and full thyroid hormone profiling. Next, I will risk-stratify by age, comorbidities, and pregnancy status, determine likely etiology, apply guideline thresholds for treatment versus observation, outline initial therapy if indicated, and finish with key caveats and a succinct action plan.

> Let me first confirm what a TSH of 0.08 mIU/L means clinically; wait, I should verify the cut points before labeling it definitively. This value is below 0.1 mU/L and therefore falls into the "more suppressed" or grade II range used in guidelines, which carries higher risk of progression and adverse outcomes, but classification into subclinical versus overt hyperthyroidism still requires free T4 and free T3 to be normal or elevated, respectively [^1128JKhP] [^112J8kY7] [^116z1K3j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on a single data point; I should double-check with repeat labs to exclude transient suppression or assay issues. I need to order a repeat TSH together with free T4 and free T3 to determine if this is subclinical hyperthyroidism (low TSH, normal fT4/fT3) or overt hyperthyroidism (low TSH, high fT4 and/or fT3), while considering potential interferences such as biotin, heterophile antibodies, and inter-method variability that can confound interpretation, especially if the clinical picture does not match the numbers [^114Mf3dw] [^111qDnSc].

> Next, I should review risk determinants that push toward treatment, but wait, I need to ensure I apply the right thresholds for the right populations. In patients 65 years or older, or in anyone with cardiac disease (e.g., atrial fibrillation or heart failure), osteoporosis, or clear hyperthyroid symptoms, guidelines recommend treatment when TSH is persistently below 0.1 mU/L; in younger, asymptomatic patients without these risks, careful observation can be reasonable, and pregnancy requires distinct trimester-specific considerations and urgency of evaluation if TSH is suppressed [^1128JKhP] [^115hDrrB] [^113bqae9].

> I will now examine etiology because management hinges on cause; but wait, I should first confirm whether this could be exogenous from thyroid hormone therapy before pursuing endogenous sources. If exogenous, I need to review levothyroxine or liothyronine dosing, adherence, and timing of blood draw; if endogenous, I should check TSH receptor antibodies for Graves' disease, evaluate for toxic nodular disease with ultrasound and consider radioiodine uptake when appropriate, and keep thyroiditis on the differential when uptake is low and the course is transient; discordant patterns should prompt me to consider central or assay-related issues before proceeding [^1128JKhP] [^116z1K3j] [^112f3zup].

> Let me think about how to apply the ATA 2016 management algorithm; I should confirm persistence on at least two tests over 3–6 months before labeling subclinical hyperthyroidism if the patient is not overtly thyrotoxic. For TSH below 0.1 mU/L, treatment is recommended if age is 65 years or older, or if there is cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or significant symptoms; for patients under 65 without risk factors and minimal symptoms, observation with periodic reassessment is acceptable, recognizing that progression is more likely when TSH is below 0.1 than when it is low but detectable [^1128JKhP] [^112J8kY7].

> Now, regarding treatment options if indicated, I should confirm the therapeutic sequence. Symptom control with a beta-blocker can be started immediately if needed, while antithyroid therapy such as methimazole is preferred for Graves' disease, with propylthiouracil favored in the first trimester of pregnancy; definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery is appropriate for persistent disease, significant nodularity, or large goiter, and exogenous overtreatment is addressed by reducing thyroid hormone dose and rechecking levels after steady state [^1128JKhP] [^117FLV8s].

> But wait, what if clinical scenarios differ; I need to tailor next steps. In an asymptomatic 45-year-old without cardiac or bone risks, I would repeat TSH, free T4, and free T3 now, and if subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH under 0.1 persists, close observation with reassessment in 3–6 months is reasonable unless symptoms or risk factors emerge; in a 70-year-old with atrial fibrillation, once confirmed, I would initiate antithyroid therapy and manage the underlying cause; in a patient on levothyroxine with suppressed TSH, I would first reduce the dose and re-evaluate after appropriate pharmacokinetic steady state to avoid iatrogenic harm [^1128JKhP] [^112J8kY7].

> I should confirm key caveats before finalizing the plan. Persistently suppressed TSH requires at least two measurements over time, and age-specific reference ranges can reduce overdiagnosis in older adults; analytical pitfalls including biotin interference and inter-assay bias warrant attention when results and phenotype diverge; screening asymptomatic adults is not generally endorsed by USPSTF, but case-finding in high-risk groups is supported by endocrine societies, which helps align testing with clinical yield [^1128JKhP] [^113M5vsW] [^113SKFsA] [^111qDnSc].

> Final check before concluding: I need to ensure my immediate recommendation is actionable and evidence-aligned. The next immediate step for a TSH of 0.08 mIU/L is to repeat TSH with free T4 and free T3 to confirm persistence and classify subclinical versus overt hyperthyroidism, while concurrently assessing age, symptoms, cardiovascular and bone risks, pregnancy status, and medication history to guide treatment versus observation per ATA 2016 guidance [^1128JKhP] [^1128JKhP].

---

A TSH of 0.08 mIU/L is suppressed [^116uLLpr]; the next step is to **confirm with repeat TSH, free T4, and free T3** [^1128JKhP] to distinguish subclinical from overt hyperthyroidism. If free T4 and T3 are normal, this indicates subclinical hyperthyroidism [^111trvZ4]; if elevated, it is overt hyperthyroidism. Then **evaluate the etiology with TRAb and thyroid ultrasound** [^1128JKhP]; if TRAb is negative or the etiology remains unclear, consider a radioactive iodine uptake scan [^116z1K3j]. Management is risk-based [^1128JKhP]: treat if age ≥ 65, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms; otherwise, monitor TSH every 3–6 months [^1128JKhP].

---

## Confirmatory testing

Confirmatory testing should include a **repeat TSH measurement** [^111trvZ4] to confirm suppression and exclude transient causes or assay error [^114yH4KX], along with **free T4 and free T3** [^114Xo7vx] to distinguish subclinical (normal free T4/T3) from overt hyperthyroidism (elevated free T4 and/or T3).

---

## Clinical evaluation

Clinical evaluation should include a **history and physical examination** to assess for hyperthyroid symptoms (palpitations, weight loss, anxiety, tremor, heat intolerance) and signs (goiter, ophthalmopathy, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) [^116z1K3j], plus a **medication review** to identify exogenous thyroid hormone use or other drugs that may suppress TSH (e.g. glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists) [^114Ub1fK].

---

## Etiological evaluation

- **Thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb)**: Test for TRAb to evaluate Graves' disease [^1128JKhP].

- **Thyroid ultrasound**: Perform ultrasound to assess for nodules or multinodular goiter [^116cF3op].

- **Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan**: If TRAb is negative or etiology is unclear, consider RAIU to differentiate Graves' disease (diffuse uptake), toxic nodular disease (focal uptake), or thyroiditis (low uptake) [^1128JKhP] [^116z1K3j].

---

## Management strategy

Management depends on the **hyperthyroidism subtype (subclinical vs overt)** and the patient's **risk profile** [^1128JKhP].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| Subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal free T4/T3) | - Observe and monitor TSH [^1119USpW] every 3–6 months if age < 65, no cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^115o1zdT]. <br/> - Treat [^1128JKhP] if age ≥ 65, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^1119USpW] |
| Overt hyperthyroidism (elevated free T4/T3) | - Initiate antithyroid drugs (methimazole) or consider radioactive iodine therapy or surgery based on etiology and patient preference [^1128JKhP] |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular monitoring** of thyroid function every 3–6 months [^1119USpW] and ongoing **clinical reassessment** for progression to overt hyperthyroidism, especially in high-risk patients (elderly, cardiac disease, osteoporosis) [^116z1K3j].

---

A TSH of 0.08 mIU/L indicates suppression; **confirm with repeat TSH, free T4, and free T3**, then evaluate the etiology with TRAb and ultrasound (± RAIU) [^1128JKhP]. For **management**, a risk-based approach is recommended: treat high-risk or overt cases and monitor low-risk subclinical cases with periodic TSH [^1119USpW].

The clinical utility of TH measurements complementing interpretation of the primary parameter TSH

Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and quantify the magnitude of primary thyroid disease due to the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for diagnosing primary disease, T4 (and in specific cases, T3) measurements are often included when TSH values fall outside the reference interval. This helps classify thyroid disease into overt or subclinical categories and can direct therapeutic options accordingly (see "TSH and Thyroid Hormone Measurement: Clinical Algorithm" in Technical Supplementary Fig. S1).

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in various clinical situations such as pregnancy and inter-illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome) and during the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed following a change in thyroid status.

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, it is only relevant to untreated patients. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though the determinations of these parameters are often used to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone, as in Graves' disease or toxic nodular goiter; administration of thyroid hormone for the treatment of malignant thyroid disease; or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in individuals with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared to those with low but detectable levels.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults and decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate, left ventricular mass, and bone turnover markers. Potential associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates remain controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities, which would help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: A summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was conducted, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

- **Study selection**: Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

- **Data extraction**: The quality of each trial was assessed using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

- **Data synthesis**: The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have…

### Initial and delayed thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation in extremely low-birth-weight infants [^112USd3t]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Thyroid function tests of infants with initial and delayed TSH elevation are described in the study. The initial mean TSH level, measured at an average corrected age (CA) of 27.0 weeks, increased to a mean of 61.0 μIU/ml among infants with initial TSH elevation. In contrast, among infants with delayed TSH elevation, the initial TSH measured at an average CA of 26.0 weeks was normal, followed by a delayed increase to 78.3 μIU/ml at an average CA of 30.1 weeks.

- **Thyroxine levels**: 80% (4/5) of infants with initial TSH elevation exhibited simultaneous reductions in T4 and/or fT4 levels. In comparison, 93% (39/42) of infants with delayed TSH elevation exhibited decreased T4 and/or fT4 levels along with non-elevated TSH levels on the initial TFT. The incidence of decreased T4 and/or fT4 levels was reduced to 57% (24/42) at the time of delayed TSH elevation detection.

- **Correlation analysis**: A Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between the extent of TSH elevation and the fT4 level (r = −0.4, P = 0.012).

- **Technicalities of thyroid tests**: Analytical challenges inherent to the glycoprotein nature of TSH are significant. Two types of TSH assays have been traditionally employed: bioassays and immunoassays. Each of these methods has its unique benefits and limitations.

	- Bioassays assess the biological activity of TSH, which is influenced by protein glycosylation. For instance, changes in TSH glycosylation, such as those occurring in primary hypothyroidism, will be detected by bioassays. However, bioassays are often time-consuming, subject to various external variables, and can be expensive.

	- In contrast, immunoassays are known for being sensitive, specific, cost-effective, and widely accessible. These assays are generally less affected by glycosylation changes in TSH, which can arise in pituitary disease. Immunoassays necessitate appropriate assay calibrators and quality control samples, typically prepared by spiking a reference material into a blank matrix. This process significantly impacts the reference material used for spiking.

	- Currently available TSH assays rely on international reference standards, such as WHO IRP 80/558 or 81/565, both derived from cadaver pituitaries. These standards may cause post-translational modifications that differ from those found in TSH circulating in human serum. Consequently, there can be varied recognition by different mAbs used in various immunoassays, leading to discrepancies in results. This variability is a key reason why harmonization of commercially available TSH methods has not yet been achieved (see Comparability of result: The need for standardization/harmonization section).

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize the careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

- **Methods**: Literature review.

- **Results**: Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical judgment is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

- **Criteria for diagnosis**:

- **Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration**:

	- **Recommendations**:

		- We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal.

		- When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis. If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment.

- **Evidence**:

	- L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine whether a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the rationale for thyroid function testing and the consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported. However, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

The 2024 ETA guidelines, particularly in relation to thyroid hormone resistance and patients with MCT8 deficiency, recommend obtaining additional investigations. These include serum (f)T3, (f)T4, reverse T3, and TSH concentrations. It is crucial to interpret these results within the context of age-specific reference intervals for patients suspected of having MCT8 deficiency.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^117FLV8s]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

The 2016 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend specific diagnostic investigations for thyroid disease during pregnancy. For the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, serum TSH values should be considered along with either total thyroxine and T3. The total thyroxine and T3 reference range increases to 1.5 times above the nonpregnant range by the second and third trimester. Alternatively, free T4 (fT4) and total T3 estimations can be used, with trimester-specific normal reference ranges.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114Mf3dw]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Over the past five decades, testing for TSH and the TH (T4 and T3) has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays performed in individual assay tubes to nonisotopic IMA tests made on highly automated immunoassay systems that provide substantial clinical utility. Analytes of interest can be quantified if appropriate reference measurement systems and certified standard materials are used. Within- and between-laboratory proficiency testing methods can provide insight into the performance of a particular method, provided commutable samples are used. Unfortunately, these basic prerequisites are not yet implemented or regularly used.

Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement to properly order and interpret thyroid tests. There is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. In most geographic areas, the laboratory receives a test request containing information relating to patient identification that is missing clinical and pharmacological information and the circumstances prompting the test request. It can be critical for the laboratory to have this missing information given the various idiosyncratic analytical interferences that affect thyroid test reliability, as discussed in this review. For their part, the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interferences.

Furthermore, given the persistence of between-method differences, the laboratory should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges.

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment [^11394NzY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

There continues to be much discussion around the optimization of thyroid hormone status in hypothyroid individuals. We examined how free T4 (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) relate to each other in a large laboratory sample of people who underwent a thyroid function test (TFT). This sample was split between those on levothyroxine replacement (monitoring test) and those who underwent a test to check for thyroid hormone imbalance (diagnostic test; not on levothyroxine).

- **Methods**: TFT test (FT4/TSH) results were extracted from the Salford Royal Hospital Laboratory Information Management System during 2009–2012. This was a single-site study. Requests included a tick box for 'on levothyroxine' (yes or no). To minimize comorbidity effects, only samples taken in General Practices were used. For untreated patients, only single test results were used; for treated patients, the median value across all their results was used. Cluster analysis considered an ellipse with the center on median values for log (TSH) and FT4 and the vertex based on the 5% and 95% percentile values of both. The percentage of patients falling outside the ellipse boundary was considered for both treated and untreated populations.

- **Results**: The total data set included 290,000 tests on 130,000 individuals. After filtering, FT4/TSH results were used from 12,006 (F 9231/M 2775; age < 60 5850/age ≥ 60 6567) treated patients with 43,846 test results. These were compared to the single results for 43,394 untreated patients (F 24,386/M 19,008; age < 60 32,537/age ≥ 60 10,857). Cluster analysis showed for untreated patients…

### Prediction of congenital hypothyroidism based on initial screening thyroid-stimulating-hormone [^113gLYfN]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that infants with modestly elevated screening-TSH values between 17–19.9 mIU/L have a significant risk (24%) of having congenital hypothyroidism (CH). The high frequency of true positives in those with screening-TSH levels over 30 mIU/L suggests that this group should be directly referred for specialist evaluation. Samples collected after 28 hours of age have a significantly higher likelihood of being true positives with modest screening TSH elevations in the 17–30 mIU/L range — a finding that has possible implications in improving sensitivity and accuracy of identifying CH cases. Those who screen positive with TSH values between 17–20 mIU/L require further analysis and long-term follow-up to determine if they have transient versus permanent CH.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^115updwd]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment response, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting insufficient thyroid replacement in patients with CeH when serum free T4 concentrations are below or close to the LLN, particularly when associated with serum TSH > 1.0 mU/L and multiple and persistent hypothyroid manifestations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^113oU9wq]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, specifically concerning thyroid hormone tests, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring serum free T4. This can be done using either the free T4 index, a free T4 estimate, or a direct immunoassay of free T4 without physical separation using anti-T4 antibodies. It is preferred over measuring total T4 in the evaluation of hypothyroidism.

### Serum thyrotrophin at baseline predicts the natural course of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^112J8kY7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Optimal therapeutic strategies for subclinical hyperthyroidism are undecided. Overt disease develops in a minority of cases, but the risk factors for progression remain unclear. We examined whether baseline thyrotrophin (TSH) predicted progression to overt hyperthyroidism in asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

- **Design, patients and measurements**: This was a retrospective study of 323 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism seen in our institution from 2003 to 2010 (mean age 71 years, males 26.9%, females 73.1%, mean follow-up duration 32 months, range 6–93 months). Serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) were documented at baseline and during follow-up. After excluding individuals with nonthyroid causes of low TSH, patients were grouped according to initial TSH as: TSH 0.10–0.39 mU/l (grade I) and TSH < 0.10 mU/l (grade II).

- **Results**: Only 38 patients (11.8%) developed overt hyperthyroidism with annual progression rates of 0.6–3.7%. Most patients reverted to normal thyroid status (31.6%) or remained subclinically hyperthyroid (56.7%). Progression to frank hyperthyroidism was higher in grade II than in grade I patients (20.3% vs 6.8%, P < 0.001, Chi-square test). Kaplan-Meier curves showed faster progression rates in grade II than grade I (P < 0.001, log-rank test). In stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis, TSH < 0.1 mU/l was associated with overt hyperthyroidism (hazard ratio 3.4, confidence interval 1.6–7.0), whereas age, gender, FT4, and etiological diagnosis were not associated with hyperthyroidism.

### Monitoring and management of autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis patients treated with alemtuzumab: Practical recommendations [^116m4Kw3]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism:

If the TSH levels are below the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within four weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed. Tests of free T4 and/or free T3 should be repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated.

- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient exhibits symptoms such as palpitations, tremor, or tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately, while awaiting results. Larger doses, such as propranolol 80 mg daily, are often required for the treatment of hyperthyroidism compared to those used for heart disease or hypertension.

- **Overt hyperthyroidism**: This condition is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 levels. If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed. A negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. Distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis can alternatively be done with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, though the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist.

### Pitfalls in the use of thyrotropin concentration as a first-line thyroid-function test [^112f3zup]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Measurement of thyrotropin concentration alone as a first-line thyroid-function test fails to indicate hypopituitarism in a number of patients. Using a combination of thyrotropin and thyroxine assays, we analyzed 56,000 tests for a population of 471,000 over 12 months. Fifteen patients with clinically unsuspected hypopituitarism were detected, indicating that the occurrence of hypopituitarism might be underestimated.

### Changes in thyroid function and evolution of subclinical thyroid disease in older men [^111dAvSD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

The prevalence of subclinical thyroid disease increases with age, but optimal detection and surveillance strategies remain unclear, particularly for older men. We aimed to assess thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations and their longitudinal changes to determine the prevalence and incidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction in older men.

- **Design, participants, and measurements**: Longitudinal study of 994 community-dwelling men aged ≥ 70 years without known thyroid disease, with TSH and FT4 concentrations assessed at baseline and follow-up (after 8.7 ± 0.9 years). Factors associated with incident subclinical thyroid dysfunction were examined by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses.

- **Results**: At baseline, 85 men (8.6%) had subclinical hypothyroidism and 10 (1.0%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism. Among 899 men euthyroid at baseline (mean age 75.0 ± 3.0 years), 713 (79.3%) remained euthyroid, 180 (20.0%) developed subclinical/overt hypothyroidism, and 6 (0.7%) developed subclinical/overt hyperthyroidism. Change in TSH correlated with baseline TSH (r = .16, p < 0.05). Change in FT4 correlated inversely with baseline FT4 (r = -0.35, p < 0.05). Only higher age and baseline TSH predicted progression from euthyroid to subclinical/overt hypothyroidism (fully-adjusted odds ratio [OR] per year = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.17, p = .006; per 2.7-fold increase in TSH OR = 65.4, CI = 31.9–134, p < 0.001). Baseline TSH concentration ≥ 2.34 mIU/L had 76% sensitivity and 77% specificity for predicting the development of subclinical/overt hypothyroidism.

Regarding the medical management of subclinical hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to indications for treatment, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine in patients with serum TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L, as these patients are at increased risk for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients undergoing treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical issue in endocrinology practice. The most frequent cause of this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. However, in patients who are compliant, multiple etiologies can be considered. A methodical and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will generally identify a cause or at least offer a resolution.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: Clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few, if any, clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established.

Most individuals with subclinical thyroid disease have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established. However, treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through five case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine.

Due to substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on the management of subclinical disease.

### Optimal thyrotropin level: Normal ranges and reference intervals are not equivalent [^111fnSEQ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal, or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations with persistently suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma, leading to exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in the overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland, characterized by normal or high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake, or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in the release of excess thyroid hormones with low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake.

Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, leads to symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, and increased mortality. Researchers have also examined whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism progresses to overt thyrotoxicosis and whether it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based on the literature and the authors' experience.

### Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are not associated with exercise capacity and lung function parameters in two population-based studies [^112UMpKL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction has been described as being linked to a variety of cardiovascular morbidities, and through this pathway, thyroid function might also be associated with cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity. So far, only a few patient studies with small study populations have investigated the association between thyroid dysfunction and exercise capacity. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the association of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in the general population.

- **Methods**: Data from the two independent cross-sectional population-based studies (Study of Health in Pomerania [SHIP] and SHIP-Trend-0) were pooled. SHIP was conducted between 2002 and 2006, and SHIP-Trend-0 between 2008 and 2012. Participants were randomly selected from population registries. In total, 4206 individuals with complete data were available for the present analysis. Thyroid function was defined based on serum TSH levels. Lung function was evaluated by forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity. CPET was based on symptom-limited exercise tests on a bicycle in a sitting position according to a modified Jones protocol. Associations of serum TSH levels with lung function and CPET parameters were analyzed by multivariable quantile regression adjusted for age, sex, height, weight, use of beta blockers, smoking status, and physical activity.

- **Results**: Serum TSH levels, used as a continuously distributed variable and categorized according to the clinical cut-offs 0.3 and 3.0 mIU/L or according to quantitative intervals, showed no significant association with lung function or exercise capacity.

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment [^116MtbCY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through the measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 being the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3), are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognized. For the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalize TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114G3g7R]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Over the past 70 years, improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of thyroid tests have led to advances in detecting and treating thyroid disorders. Basal metabolic rate and bioassays were used to measure thyroid function for decades before the 1950s. Clinical laboratory-based thyroid hormone (TH) measurement began in the 1950s with the measurement of protein-bound iodine, a method that indirectly estimated the total (free + protein-bound) T4 (TT4) concentration.

There was early recognition that abnormal TH binding proteins (primarily T4 binding globulin, TBG), which distribute TH to their target tissues including the brain, could distort the relationship between the total and the biologically active free TH, complicating the use of TT4 to assess thyroid function, for example, during pregnancy.

As a result, indirect TBG assessments (uptake tests) were developed and used to adjust TT4 to provide an indirect estimate of free T4 (free T4 index (fT4I = TT4 + T3 resin uptake [T3RU] test). Current "uptake" tests, renamed TH binding ratios, called "T-uptakes", mainly use automated immunological formulations and nonisotopic signals to assess available TBG binding sites relative to a "normal" reference that may be assigned a value of 1.00 or 40%, depending on the method.

Direct fT4 assays employing equilibrium dialysis or ultrafiltration to isolate the small (0.03%) biologically active fT4 fraction became available in the 1960s, but were technically complex and unsuitable to meet the increasing demand.

### Optimal free thyroxine levels for thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroidism [^116VJdoJ]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether a difference exists in the free thyroxine level required to achieve a normal thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) level between patients with primary hypothyroidism and euthyroid control subjects, and to compare the free thyroxine levels in patients with primary and secondary hypothyroidism receiving thyroid hormone replacement, we conducted a study.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively assessed TSH and free thyroxine values in 58 patients with primary hypothyroidism and 78 euthyroid control subjects with available thyroid function tests. Additionally, we obtained free thyroxine values for 23 patients with central hypothyroidism receiving stable levothyroxine replacement therapy from medical records.

- **Results**: The mean free thyroxine level was significantly higher in patients with primary hypothyroidism compared to euthyroid control subjects (1.36 ± 0.201 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001), while the mean TSH concentrations did not differ significantly (1.60 ± 1.183 mIU/L versus 1.73 ± 0.792 mIU/L; p = 0.46). The mean free thyroxine value in patients with central hypothyroidism was also significantly higher compared to euthyroid control subjects (1.31 ± 0.278 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001), with no significant difference between patients with primary and central hypothyroidism (1.36 ng/dL versus 1.31 ng/dL; p = 0.60).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with hypothyroidism require a higher level of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH value.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed. Consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimize these outcomes are generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). These have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects.

Guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving the "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^111eCwsJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations**:
	- The monitoring of L-T4 treatment should be based on periodic measurements of serum or plasma FT4 (or TT4) and TSH concentrations. Blood samples for laboratory evaluation should be collected at least 4 hours after the last L-T4 administration. We recommend maintaining TSH in the age-specific reference range, avoiding undetectable TSH levels below 0.05 mU/L, and ensuring serum concentrations of TT4 or FT4 are in the upper half of the age-specific reference range. If necessary, treatment should be adjusted according to the hormone concentrations measured, but decreases in LT4 dose should not be based on a single high FT4 concentration during treatment. Clinicians should be familiar with the reference ranges for the methods used by the laboratory carrying out the tests.

	- We recommend performing the first follow-up examination 1 to 2 weeks after the start of L-T4 treatment, with intense follow-up over the first year of life. This involves follow-ups every 2 weeks until TSH levels are completely normalized and every 1 to 3 months thereafter until the child reaches 12 months of age. Between the ages of 1 and 3 years, children should undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations every 2 to 4 months, with regular evaluations every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. Measurements should be performed at more frequent intervals if compliance is questioned or abnormal values are obtained, and 4 to 6 weeks after any change in L-T4 dose or L-T4 formulation, such as a switch from brand to generic L-T4.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^113gSBLf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of population- and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) reference intervals (RIs) in pregnancy. Since these are often unavailable, clinicians frequently rely on alternative diagnostic strategies. We sought to quantify the diagnostic consequences of these recommendations.

- **Methods**: We included cohorts participating in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Different approaches were used to define RIs: a TSH fixed upper limit of 4.0 mU/L (fixed limit approach), a fixed subtraction from the upper limit for TSH of 0.5 mU/L (subtraction approach), and using nonpregnancy RIs. Outcome measures were sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) for women for whom levothyroxine treatment was indicated and those for whom treatment would be considered according to international guidelines.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 52,496 participants from 18 cohorts. Compared with the use of trimester-specific RIs, alternative approaches had low sensitivity (0.63–0.82) and high FDR (0.11–0.35) to detect women with a treatment indication or consideration. Sensitivity and FDR to detect a treatment indication in the first trimester were similar between the fixed limit, subtraction, and nonpregnancy approaches (0.77–0.11 vs. 0.74–0.16 vs. 0.60–0.11). The diagnostic performance to detect overt hypothyroidism, isolated hypothyroxinemia, and (sub)clinical hyperthyroidism mainly varied between FT4 RI approaches, while the diagnostic performance to detect subclinical hypothyroidism varied between the applied TSH RI approaches.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on how and when to utilize thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction, citing a lack of proven benefit and the potential harm of treating individuals with thyroid dysfunction, which is often subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this stance may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when it is clinically appropriate.

Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to underscore the significant difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical practice. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential cause of many nonspecific complaints that physicians encounter daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach based on identifying those individuals most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Thyroid laboratory testing and management in women on thyroid replacement before pregnancy and associated pregnancy outcomes [^116AGpAE]. Thyroid (2021). Low credibility.

An additional sensitivity analysis was restricted to women who had filled at least two prescriptions for thyroid hormone replacement before conception. Compared with the original cohort, results remained unchanged in the adjusted analyses, except that the association between overtreatment and neonatal intensive care unit admission reached statistical significance (adjusted OR 1.49 [CI 1.03–2.16]).

A post hoc analysis was performed to identify characteristics associated with TSH < 0.10 mIU/L during pregnancy. The likelihood of having a TSH < 0.10 mIU/L during pregnancy was increased when the closest TSH measurement to conception was < 1.50 mIU/L or the levothyroxine dosage was at least 100 mcg/day in the 12 months before conception (p < 0.001). Furthermore, pregnancies with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer or treated Graves' disease had a greater likelihood of TSH suppression, while those with a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism were less likely to be overtreated.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111WRZXa]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

- **Analytical performance specifications and biological variation**: Thyroid function tests, like most laboratory results, are susceptible to inaccurate measurement. Laboratory measurements can be affected by two different types of analytical error: (1) systematic error (also known as analytical bias) and (2) random error (also known as analytical imprecision). The so-called total error of measurement is a combination of these two parameters. Analytical errors can contribute to erroneous laboratory results, which, in turn, can lead to inappropriate disease classification and clinical decision-making. To prevent inaccurate measurements affecting clinical decision-making, analytical performance specifications (APSs) have been established to safeguard assay performance.

APS can be used to optimize clinical utility in multiple aspects of laboratory testing, including the regulatory process for the approval of laboratory tests, proficiency testing of the individual laboratory, evaluation of laboratory methods, and monitoring the variability of lot-to-lot reagent changes. APS can be based on (1) clinical outcome studies and the impact on clinical decision-making (Models 1a and 1b, respectively), (2) biological variation (Model 2), or (3) state-of-the-art laboratory performance (Model 3). Of these, biological variation and state-of-the-art models are the mainstay of defining APS, as there are only limited studies that have examined the effects of APS on clinical outcomes or medical decisions.

Using biological variation data, the APS can be defined as minimum, desirable, and optimum.

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L in patients planning pregnancy**: This includes those undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Serum TSH > 2.5 mIU/L during the first trimester of pregnancy**.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114yH4KX]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests — thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) measurement — is open to question, and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. The ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing recent literature to revise or update criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care.

- **Summary**: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be developed further to minimize these issues in clinical practice.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115W4GCJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical cases:

- **Case 1**: A 19-year-old woman, with a constellation of symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (anxiety, palpitations, insomnia), was found to have abnormal thyroid function tests (TSH 1.8 mU/L [RR 0.35–5.5], FT4 24 pmol/L [RR 6.3–14] or 1.86 ng/dL [RR 0.48–1.08]), with similar results when her thyroid function was retested on two further occasions. Her mother, investigated for fatigue, showed similarly abnormal thyroid function (TSH 3.5 mU/L [RR 0.35–5.5], FT4 24 pmol/L [RR 6.3–14] or 1.86 ng/dL [RR 0.48–1.08]). Her maternal grandfather (deceased) was known to have had a thyroid problem of undefined nature.

- **Case 2**: A diagnosis of hypothyroidism (TSH 9.7 mU/L [RR 0.35–5.5]) in a 67-year-old man with known type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy prompted treatment with 100 µg of T4 daily. On this dose, discordant TFTs (TSH 13.7 mU/L [RR 0.35–5.5], FT4 69 pmol/L [RR 10.5–21] or 5.36 ng/dL [RR 0.81–1.63]) led to discontinuation of therapy. Subsequently, a rise in circulating TSH (45.6 mU/L), together with a strongly positive antithyroid peroxidase antibody measurement (> 1300 IU/mL [RR 0–60]), prompted recommencement of T4 (100 µg daily). Puzzlingly, TFTs after T4 was restarted remained discordant (TSH 22.1 mU/L [RR 0.35–5.5]; FT4 61 pmol/L [RR 10.5–21] or 4.74 ng/dL [RR 0.81–1.63]).

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

After excluding confounding causes, such as measurement interference and the effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies, genuinely raised circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic condition (RTHβ) or an acquired condition (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma). Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by approximately 230 known heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, as well as the magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations, do not distinguish between these disorders. In principle, a combination of genetic testing for RTHβ and pituitary imaging for TSHoma should readily differentiate these entities. However, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties.

Possibly due to earlier ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging. These are often associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ cases, and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically proven RTHβ cases.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypothyroidism, particularly concerning thyroid hormone tests, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring serum free T4 (free T4 index or free T4 estimate and direct immunoassay of free T4 without physical separation using anti-T4 antibodies) instead of total T4 in the evaluation of hypothyroidism.

Alternately, the state-of-the-art APS can be derived from the evaluation and comparison of laboratory methods or using peer comparison data from proficiency testing programs. In general, the TSH assays in clinical practice meet the desirable APS (based on biological variation) for imprecision. This may not be true for fT4 assays. Importantly, large intermethod biases are observed for both TSH and fT4, which prevents the adoption of universal reference intervals and medical decision limits for thyroid tests. Moreover, the relationship between TSH and fT4 varies depending on the specific assay method used.

- **Biological variability of TSH and TH concentrations**: The log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship illustrates both within- and between-subject biological variability in healthy individuals; this variability increases with both thyroid and non-thyroidal illnesses. Results from systematic studies in healthy mono- and dizygotic twins, repetitive sampling studies, and the testing of individuals or (sub-)populations in different regions have shown markedly narrower within-subject variability (e.g. during monthly sampling) than between-subject variations. Such studies reveal that heritability accounts for 30% to 65% of the variance in TSH, fT4, fT3, and the fT4 × TSH product. Population-based reference intervals for thyroid test variables are, therefore, much broader than the rather narrow within-subject variance and consequently are less useful for monitoring an individual patient.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^115gHfqf]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for congenital hypothyroidism, particularly in evaluating the permanence of hypothyroidism, the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining repeat serum TSH and fT4 levels within another 4–8 weeks. This helps determine the following if the TSH is mildly elevated (greater than the age-specific reference range but ≤ 10 mIU/L) and fT4 is normal:

- **Normal thyroid function**: Indicates transient congenital hypothyroidism (CH).

- **Permanent CH**: Suggested by TSH > 10 mIU/L or low fT4.

- **Persistent hyperthyrotropinemia**: Defined by TSH persistently elevated but ≤ 10 mIU/L, with normal fT4.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, particularly concerning thyroid function tests, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend supporting the diagnosis of mild central hypothyroidism (borderline low free T4 with inappropriately low TSH) through a combination of several findings:

- **Evidence of CeH in first-degree relatives**: This may contribute to an early diagnosis.

- **Delayed growth, macroorchidism, hearing loss, and other signs of hypothyroidism**: These symptoms are suggestive of underlying hormonal deficiencies.

- **Causative mutations in CeH candidate genes**: Genetic testing may reveal mutations contributing to the condition.

- **Insufficiency of other pituitary hormone secretion**: Assess and monitor the secretion of other pituitary hormones for abnormalities.

- **Blunted (< 4 mU/L) or delayed (peak after 60 minutes) TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (200 mcg IV)**: This can be a critical diagnostic measure.

- **Blunted nocturnal TSH surge**: A reduced TSH surge at night can also be indicative.

- **Low TSH index**: This may provide further evidence of central hypothyroidism.

- **Otherwise unexplained alterations in variables of thyroid hormone action**: Examples include high cholesterol, bradycardia, low body temperature, and specific echocardiographic findings.

- **Recommendations**:

- **Diagnosis modification**: If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose), and a full re-evaluation should be carried out at the end of this period with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed [2|⊕○○].

- **Dose reduction**: If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than obtain an exact diagnosis, the L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. In contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting [2|⊕⊕○].

- **Evidence by age**: By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

- **Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH**:

- **Maternal hormone optimization**: For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% is recommended following a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test [1|⊕○○].

- **Hormone level evaluation**: TSH and FT4 (or TT4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose [1|⊕⊕⊕].

- **Treatment goal**: The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester.

With regard to specific circumstances for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring total T4 or a free T4 index, alongside TSH, to assess thyroid status during pregnancy. A direct immunoassay measurement of free T4 should be obtained only when method-specific and trimester-specific reference ranges for serum free T4 are available due to the wide variation in the results of different free T4 assays.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating treatment based on individual factors in patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L. This is particularly recommended if patients exhibit symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, possess positive anti-TPO antibodies, or have evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

A newborn with an abnormal neonatal screening result should be referred to an expert center. An abnormal screening result should be followed by confirmatory testing consisting of the measurement of serum fT4 and TSH. If the serum fT4 concentration is below and TSH clearly above the age-specific reference interval, then levothyroxine (LT4) treatment should be started immediately.

If the serum TSH concentration is greater than 20 mU/L at confirmatory testing (approximately in the second week of life), treatment should be started even if fT4 is normal. This threshold is arbitrary but based on expert opinion. If the serum TSH concentration is 6–20 mU/L beyond the age of 21 days in a healthy neonate with an fT4 concentration within the age-specific reference interval, it is suggested to either start LT4 treatment immediately and retest, off-treatment, at a later stage, or to withhold treatment but retest 1 to 2 weeks later and re-evaluate the need for treatment. There is a lack of evidence in favor or against treatment, and this is an area of further investigation.

In countries or regions where thyroid function tests are not readily available, LT4 treatment should be started if filter paper TSH concentration is greater than 40 mU/L at the time of neonatal screening. This threshold is also arbitrary but based on expert opinion.

If the serum fT4 is low and TSH is low, normal, or slightly elevated, the diagnosis of central congenital hypothyroidism (CH) should be considered. In neonates with central CH, it is recommended to start LT4 treatment only after evidence of inta emerges.

### Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are not associated with exercise capacity and lung function parameters in two population-based studies [^1115y3DF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction has been linked to a variety of cardiovascular morbidities, suggesting that thyroid function might also be associated with cardiorespiratory function and exercise capacity. So far, only a few patient-studies with small study populations have investigated the association between thyroid dysfunction and exercise capacity. Thus, the aim of our study was to investigate the association of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in the general population.

- **Methods**: Data from two independent cross-sectional population-based studies, the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and SHIP-Trend-0, were pooled. SHIP was conducted between 2002 and 2006, and SHIP-Trend-0 between 2008 and 2012. Participants were randomly selected from population registries. In total, 4,206 individuals with complete data were available for the analysis. Thyroid function was defined based on serum TSH levels. Lung function was evaluated by forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. CPET was based on symptom-limited exercise tests on a bicycle in a sitting position according to a modified Jones protocol. Associations of serum TSH levels with lung function and CPET parameters were analysed by multivariable quantile regression, adjusted for age, sex, height, weight, use of beta blockers, smoking status, and physical activity.

- **Results**: Serum TSH levels, used as continuously distributed variables and categorized according to the clinical cut-offs of 0.3 and 3.0 mIU/L or according to qu…

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: Significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarized. Although subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies.

- **Causes, effects, and outcomes**: The causes, effects, and outcomes of treatment for both subclinical diseases are described.
- **Future research directions**: The direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

The 2018 ETA guidelines on central hypothyroidism address diagnostic investigations with a focus on thyroid function tests. These guidelines recommend suspecting central hypothyroidism in patients who have low serum concentrations of free T4 and slightly elevated TSH levels (< 10 mU/L). An inappropriately lower TSH than expected, based on the hypothyroid state, should also prompt suspicion.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) with free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is approximately 4 to 8.5 percent and can be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in about 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations.

There is good evidence indicating that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. Insufficient evidence exists to support the notion that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

Quality assessment of analytical methods for TSH and TH

While the studies from the C-STFT date from 2017, information about the accuracy and quality of fT4 and TSH assays is very limited. Some information can be obtained from accuracy-based external quality assessment/proficiency testing programs. Additional information can be derived from outpatient data (e.g. the Noklus Percentiler) or from anonymized electronic patient records. More research using different data sources is needed to monitor the accuracy of thyroid function tests.

A prerequisite for valid quality assessment is the commutability of the materials used. This means that the materials used for quality assessment should behave exactly as any patient sample in any given assay. Commercially available proficiency testing materials and quality control samples rarely replicate clinically relevant matrices and their variability. This has been demonstrated in a study for TSH reference materials, comparing TSH extracted from human pituitary tissue with recombinantly expressed (glycoengineered) TSH, both of which do not precisely match the sialylated TSH of hypothyroid patients.

Similarly, fT4 reference material matrices are distinct from those of the serum or plasma of patients with nonthyroidal illness, disturbed lipid metabolism, or renal disease. Differences in matrix composition may require normalization procedures, which will limit within- or between-comparability of test results.

The continuing use of non-SI units (e.g. ng/dL) in clinical practice, instead of correct SI terminology (mol/L), frequently creates challenges in standardizing test results and may hinder accurate interpretation.

### TSH and FT4 reference interval recommendations and prevalence of gestational thyroid dysfunction: Quantification of current diagnostic approaches [^113uqF2d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The role of pregnancy and trimester-specific FT4 reference intervals is significant. Alternative approaches specify an upper limit cut-off for TSH but do not set limits for FT4. However, diagnoses in clinical practice need to incorporate FT4 concentrations. As a result, nonpregnancy FT4 reference intervals are commonly applied in clinical settings.

In the first and second trimesters, combining nonpregnancy FT4 reference intervals with trimester-specific reference intervals for TSH, compared to using all trimester-specific reference intervals, yielded sensitivities ranging from 0.97 to 1.00 for detecting treatment indications or considerations, with false discovery rates (FDRs) spanning from 0.03 to 0.14. In contrast, using nonpregnancy reference intervals for TSH resulted in lower sensitivities (0.65–0.72) for detecting both treatment indications and considerations and was associated with higher FDRs for treatment considerations (0.08–0.32).

For thyroid function test abnormalities in the first trimester, the combination of nonpregnancy FT4 reference intervals with trimester-specific reference intervals for TSH showed a sensitivity of 0.62 for overt hypothyroidism, 0.59 for isolated hypothyroxinemia, and 0.73 for overt hyperthyroidism. Sensitivity for subclinical hypothyroidism was 0.99. In comparison, using a trimester-specific FT4 reference interval with a nonpregnancy TSH reference interval resulted in a sensitivity of 0.58 and an FDR of 0.07 for diagnosing subclinical hypothyroidism, while sensitivity was 0.83 for overt hypo.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: Controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity defined by normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The TSH value is typically measured using a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter.

Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, accompanied by a physical examination and thyroid function tests. These are essential to assess patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and evaluate the potential deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs, such as the heart and bone.

A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.
