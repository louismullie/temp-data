## Question

How to manage headache in this patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage headache in this patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags that mandate urgent or emergent evaluation. Then, I should verify the core elements of history and examination that distinguish primary from secondary headaches. Next, I will consider when to image and when not to image, including the special case of thunderclap headache and subarachnoid hemorrhage. After that, I will classify the headache phenotype and outline acute and preventive treatment strategies, including medication-overuse management. Finally, I will integrate special populations, follow-up, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities and red flags, because missing a secondary headache is the highest-risk error. I need to check for sudden-onset severe headache, age over 50 with new headache, immunocompromise, cancer, pregnancy or postpartum, focal deficits, papilledema, altered mental status, or systemic illness, and if any are present, I should escalate to urgent or emergent evaluation rather than proceed with routine outpatient care [^fd59ac7d] [^2ca11cf4] [^32dd82c3].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to thunderclap headache specifically, since that is a classic pitfall. Thunderclap headache peaking within 1 minute warrants emergent noncontrast head CT within 6 hours of onset in patients with a normal neurologic exam, and if CT is negative or outside the 6-hour window, I should add lumbar puncture or CT angiography to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage or other vascular causes, given the 6–7% prevalence of SAH in this presentation and its high mortality when missed [^fae75bb4] [^c149552d] [^bb4bf38d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging for every headache. I should confirm indications using SNNOOP10 or a similar red-flag framework and reserve neuroimaging for patients with abnormal neurologic findings, atypical features, or concerning histories, recognizing that most primary headaches do not require imaging and that unnecessary CT exposes patients to radiation without benefit [^65ccabab] [^501a7877] [^49b9e334].

> Next, I should review the core history elements that separate primary from secondary headaches. I need to ask about tempo and onset, location and quality, severity and disability, associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and autonomic features, triggers and precipitants, medication use including over-the-counter and caffeine, and family history, while also screening for depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and substance use that can worsen headache burden and treatment response [^65ccabab] [^822c6692].

> I will now examine the patient with a focused neurologic and head-and-neck assessment, looking for focal deficits, papilledema, meningismus, or other signs of secondary disease, and I should double-check that a normal exam supports a primary headache diagnosis while an abnormal exam pushes me toward imaging and specialist referral rather than empiric outpatient therapy [^65ccabab] [^32dd82c3].

> Let me think about classification next, because treatment hinges on getting the phenotype right. Migraine typically presents with unilateral, pulsating, moderate-to-severe pain with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia and may be preceded by aura, tension-type headache is bilateral, pressing, mild-to-moderate without nausea, and cluster headache is severe, unilateral with ipsilateral autonomic features and restlessness, often in bouts of multiple daily attacks, and I should remember that patients can have more than one headache type and that medication overuse is common and must be actively screened [^2ca11cf4] [^822c6692] [^65ccabab].

> For acute treatment of migraine, I should confirm a stratified approach rather than stepwise care in more disabled patients, using NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild attacks and triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks or when NSAIDs are inadequate, ideally early in the attack, and I should add an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine when nausea is prominent, while avoiding opioids given poor efficacy and harm, and I need to ensure I counsel on limits to avoid medication-overuse headache [^822c6692] [^43ca56e7] [^a607ba02].

> But wait, what if the first triptan fails. I should double-check that switching to a different triptan is reasonable because lack of response to one does not predict failure of others, and I should also consider gepants or ditans in patients with cardiovascular contraindications to triptans or in those who prefer non-triptan options, aligning choices with comorbidities and patient preferences [^9df4bf9d] [^822c6692].

> For tension-type headache, I should confirm that simple analgesics or NSAIDs are first-line for acute episodes and that I avoid opioids, and if headaches are frequent or disabling, I should offer prophylaxis such as amitriptyline or consider gabapentin in chronic daily headache, while reinforcing behavioral strategies and trigger management [^39cb5ee3] [^ed80c71d] [^294d0407].

> For cluster headache, I need to ensure rapid abortive therapy with 100% oxygen at 12–15 L/min via non-rebreather for about 15 minutes and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg, and I should initiate transitional or preventive therapy such as verapamil during the bout, with consideration of greater occipital nerve blocks or specialist referral for refractory cases, and I should remember to evaluate for atypical features with MRI brain and pituitary if the phenotype is unusual or treatment response is poor [^c8b09238] [^3e46f735].

> I should confirm medication-overuse headache management because it is a common cause of chronic daily headache. The cornerstone is withdrawal of the overused medication, with abrupt withdrawal preferred except for opioids, and I should start preventive therapy during or just after withdrawal, provide education about the expected temporary worsening, and consider inpatient detoxification when opioids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines are involved or when outpatient withdrawal fails [^575df0a7] [^da9a23a6] [^65ccabab].

> Let me reconsider preventive therapy thresholds and options. Preventives are indicated when headaches are frequent, disabling, or poorly controlled with acute therapy, with first-line choices including topiramate, beta-blockers, or amitriptyline, and I should titrate slowly to a therapeutic dose and maintain for at least 3 months before declaring failure, while also addressing lifestyle factors and comorbidities that can blunt response [^822c6692] [^e9029251] [^65ccabab].

> For special populations, I need to ensure pregnancy-safe strategies, favoring acetaminophen as first-line acute therapy and avoiding triptans, NSAIDs after 20 weeks, and valproate entirely, and if imaging is necessary, MRI without gadolinium is preferred over CT to avoid radiation, with obstetric collaboration for red flags or secondary headaches [^222b215c].

> In pediatrics, I should double-check that migraine is the most common primary headache and that ibuprofen or acetaminophen are first-line acute therapies, with antiemetics as needed, and I should screen for medication overuse and consider preventive therapy if headaches are frequent or disabling, using amitriptyline, topiramate, or cyproheptadine depending on age and comorbidities, and I must maintain vigilance for secondary causes with a low threshold to image if red flags are present [^d951db95] [^8a1b80f3] [^3988d954].

> For older adults, I should confirm a lower threshold to image given higher prevalence of secondary causes, start low and go slow with medications due to polypharmacy and comorbidities, and consider that indomethacin-responsive hemicrania continua or giant cell arteritis may present with headache and require targeted therapy and urgent temporal artery biopsy when suspected [^ee14136e].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. A headache diary improves diagnostic accuracy and treatment response tracking, I should reassess at 4–6 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, and I should plan periodic reviews to adjust acute and preventive strategies, reinforce behavioral measures, and screen for emerging medication overuse or new red flags [^65ccabab] [^822c6692].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway to ensure nothing is missed. If red flags are present, I should emergently evaluate and image as indicated, if no red flags are present, I should classify the headache phenotype and initiate evidence-based acute therapy with clear limits, consider preventive therapy if indicated, screen for and treat medication overuse, and arrange timely follow-up, and if the diagnosis is uncertain or the patient fails appropriate therapy, I should refer to neurology or headache specialty for further evaluation and advanced options [^fd59ac7d] [^2ca11cf4] [^65ccabab].

To manage this patient's headache, I need to **identify red flags** and rule out secondary causes first [^fd59ac7d], then **classify the headache** as primary or secondary using ICHD-3 criteria [^42ee9b99]. For primary headaches, use **acute therapy** (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, triptans, antiemetics) [^43ca56e7] and consider preventive therapy if attacks are frequent or disabling [^822c6692]. For secondary headaches, treat the underlying cause and monitor closely [^67277535]. Educate the patient, address triggers, and arrange follow-up to assess response and adjust therapy [^65ccabab].

---

## Step 1: initial evaluation and triage

- **Red flags**: Identify features requiring urgent evaluation — sudden-onset "thunderclap" headache, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, immunocompromise, age > 50 with new headache, or progressive worsening [^fd59ac7d] [^bb4bf38d].

- **History**: Characterize onset, duration, location, quality, severity, associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, visual aura), triggers, medication use (including OTC and caffeine), and family history [^65ccabab].

- **Examination**: Perform a focused neurologic and head/neck exam to detect focal deficits, papilledema, or other secondary signs [^65ccabab].

---

## Step 2: diagnostic classification

Use **ICHD-3** to classify the headache as primary (migraine, tension-type, cluster) or secondary (structural, infectious, vascular, medication-overuse) [^42ee9b99]. Consider **secondary causes** if red flags are present or if the headache is new, atypical, or refractory to treatment [^67277535].

---

## Step 3: evaluation for secondary headache disorders

- **Imaging**: MRI or CT is indicated for red flags, abnormal neurologic exam, or atypical features; MRI is preferred for posterior fossa, subtle lesions, or when radiation avoidance is desired [^501a7877] [^49b9e334].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, thyroid function, and others as indicated by suspected etiology (e.g. infection, inflammation, metabolic causes) [^notfound].

- **Lumbar puncture**: Indicated for suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage with negative CT, infection, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^fae75bb4] [^32dd82c3].

---

## Step 4: management of primary headache disorders

### Acute treatment

- **Migraine**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for mild attacks; triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks or when NSAIDs are inadequate; add antiemetics (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) for nausea [^43ca56e7] [^6a9e0d9f].

- **Tension-type headache**: Simple analgesics or NSAIDs; avoid opioids [^39cb5ee3].

- **Cluster headache**: High-flow oxygen (100% at 12–15 L/min) and subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg are first-line abortives [^c8b09238].

---

### Preventive treatment

Indications include **frequent attacks (≥ 2–3/month), significant disability, or inadequate response to acute therapy** [^749815dc]. Options include **beta-blockers, topiramate, amitriptyline, CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine** [^e9029251] [^822c6692]. Continue for at least 3 months before assessing efficacy and titrate to effect [^e9029251].

---

## Step 5: management of secondary headache disorders

Treat the **underlying cause** — for example, antibiotics for infection, surgery for mass lesions, or anticoagulation for venous sinus thrombosis. Monitor closely for **response and complications**, and adjust therapy as needed [^67277535].

---

## Step 6: patient education and lifestyle modifications

Educate on **headache types, triggers, and treatment goals** to improve adherence and outcomes [^822c6692]. Address **sleep hygiene, stress management, hydration, diet, and avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco** [^b3a6c3f3]. Encourage a **headache diary** to track frequency, severity, triggers, and medication use [^65ccabab].

---

## Step 7: follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **regular follow-up** to assess control, medication use, and side effects, and adjust therapy accordingly [^65ccabab]. Reassess periodically for **secondary causes** or evolving features that may change management [^2ca11cf4].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer acetaminophen; avoid triptans, NSAIDs after 20 weeks, and valproate; use magnesium sulfate for eclampsia-related headache [^notfound].

- **Pediatrics**: Use weight-based dosing; avoid aspirin due to Reye syndrome risk; consider amitriptyline or topiramate for prevention if frequent [^notfound].

- **Elderly**: Use caution with polypharmacy; start low and go slow; monitor for cognitive and renal effects [^ee14136e].

---

Effective headache management requires a **structured approach**: rule out secondary causes, classify the headache, tailor acute and preventive therapy, educate the patient, and monitor response with follow-up to optimize outcomes [^fd59ac7d].

This clinical policy focuses on critical issues in the evaluation and management of patients with acute headache. A MEDLINE search was performed, abstracts were reviewed, and appropriate full-text articles were read; references from reviewed articles were searched for additional material. This policy focuses on 4 areas of current interest and/or controversy in acute headache management: (1) response to headache therapy as an indicator of underlying pathology, (2) clinical findings predictive of increased intracranial pressure, (3) indications for emergent neuroimaging in patients with a complaint of headache, and (4) indications to pursue emergent diagnostic studies in patients with thunderclap headache but with normal findings on a head computed tomography (CT) scan and negative findings on a lumbar puncture. Recommendations for patient management are provided for each of these 4 topics based on strength of evidence. Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty, Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty, and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on panel consensus. This guideline is intended for physicians working in hospital-based emergency departments.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^9af062cc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addressed key issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient presenting with acute headache, are there risk-stratification strategies that reliably identify the need for emergent neuroimaging? (2) In the adult emergency department patient treated for acute primary headache, are nonopioids preferred to opioid medications? (3) In the adult emergency department patient presenting with acute headache, does a normal noncontrast head computed tomography scan performed within 6 hours of headache onset preclude the need for further diagnostic workup for subarachnoid hemorrhage? (4) In the adult emergency department patient who is still considered to be at risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage after a negative noncontrast head computed tomography, is computed tomography angiography of the head as effective as lumbar puncture to safely rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^822c6692]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Pitfalls in the management of headache in the emergency department [^44feff25]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is the fifth most common primary complaint of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in the United States. The emergency physician (EP) plays a unique role in the management of these patients, one that differs from that of the primary care physician, the neurologist, and other specialists. Diagnostic nomenclature used in the ED is necessarily less specific, as care is more appropriately focused on the relief of symptoms and the identification of life-threatening causes. By seeking a limited number of specific critical features on history and physical examination, the EP can minimize the risk of overlooking one of these dangerous causes of headache. When certain features are present, empirical therapies and diagnostic testing should be initiated in the ED. The most frequently encountered pitfalls in the management of patients with headache in emergency medicine practice, and those with the greatest likelihood to adversely affect patient outcomes, are discussed.

Conclusions

Migraine is a ubiquitous neurological disorder that adds substantially to the global burden of disease. Despite the existence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria and a multitude of therapeutic options, diagnosis and clinical management of migraine remain suboptimal worldwide. This Consensus Statement was developed by experts from Europe to provide generally applicable recommendations for the diagnosis and management of migraine and to promote best clinical practices. The recommendations are based on published evidence and expert opinion, and will be updated when new information and treatments emerge.

### Medical management of adult headache [^a24679ff]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

We review the therapies for primary headache disorders: migraine, chronic migraine, tension-type headache, and cluster headache. Recommendations follow the evidence-based treatments so far as is possible with expert opinion to give clinical guidance. Headache has 2 levels of care: acute treatments designed to stop a headache from progressing and alleviate all symptoms associated with the headache and preventive therapies for patients whose headache frequency is such that by itself produces significant disability and impact on quality of life, or where the frequency of use of acute medications, regardless of efficacy, poses risks in terms of overuse or adverse events.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^92756761]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Headache is listed among the WHO's major causes of disability with a global prevalence of 47% (symptoms occurring at least once in the past year). It is the commonest neurological syndrome presenting to primary care with 3% of adults consulting a general practitioner for headache each year.Women are disproportionately affected (3:1) and its higher prevalence among those of working age adds to the socioeconomic burden with loss of productivity, estimated at £2.25 billion per year in the UK.

In neurological practice, headache accounts for 25% of new referrals and yet a large proportion of these patients feel dissatisfied even if they make it to the neurology clinic, partly due to a reported lack of interest in the disorder by the reviewing neurologist.Most patients with headache have migraine, and when this diagnosis is made it is usually correct (98%).However, a quarter of patients with migraine have as their diagnosis missed. Furthermore, of those identified as a non-migrainous primary headache, 82% actually have migraine or probable migraine.

Neurologists consequently see a lot of patients with headache and the condition is very disabling for individuals. A diagnosis, empathy and effective treatment make a huge difference to the patient and can be very rewarding for the clinician. The purpose of this article, the first of two linked articles, is to provide an up-to-date overview of the pharmacological management of common headache disorders (as well as a limited number of non-pharmaceutical strategies).

### Headache care [^d951db95]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary headache disorders are common within the pediatric population and often lead to disruption in multiple areas of life. It is important to systematically approach patients presenting for the evaluation of headaches to determine if the symptoms originate from a primary or secondary headache disorder. Once a diagnosis is established, patients should be offered treatment to adequately address the headache disorder. Over the last 6 years, multiple new treatment options have emerged, with growing selections available for children and adolescents. In this review, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment approach to primary headache disorders.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^e9029251]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The effective management of headache disorders remains a moving field and a potential challenge to the neurologist. The frequency of headache and its burden of disability make it essential for neurologists to manage headache in an informed way. Therapeutic decisions are hampered by minimal evidence to support the use of many therapies and hence we a need large, robust clinical trials. However, emerging therapies specifically targeting headache pain pathways are likely to improve significantly the management options and advance the field.

A practical approach is important—using existing evidence and guidelines—to enable effective headache management. It is an area where the clinician can have a huge and very rewarding impact upon patient care.

Key points

Headache is a common cause of disability; an accurate diagnosis is essential, though is often delayed or missed.
Medication-overuse headache frequently coexists and should be actively sought and discussed with patients with headache.
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acute migraine abortive treatment with a triptan together with paracetamol (or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus an antiemetic; lack of efficacy with one triptan does not mean that others will not work.
NICE guidelines for migraine prophylaxis suggest using topiramate or a beta blocker; comorbidities or lack of efficacy often means that other agents are also prescribed.
Start migraine prophylactic agents at low dose, build the dose up progressively and maintain a therapeutic dose for 3 months before judging its efficacy.

Module A—evaluation and treatment of headache—begins at “Adults with headache” (Box 1), proceeds to “General history and physical exam (see Sidebar 1)” (Box 2), then asks “Does this patient need urgent/emergent evaluation/treatment or have red flags? (see Sidebar 1)” (Box 3); if “Yes,” “Consider evaluation in urgent care or ED” (Box 4); if “No,” ask “Is there a secondary headache (see Sidebar 2), complicated headache presentation, or multiple headache types requiring specialist referral?” (Box 5); if “Yes,” “Refer to specialist for further diagnosis and evaluation” (Box 6); if “No,” ask “Is there clinical concern for TTH? Including: Bilateral headache; Non-pulsatile pain; Mild to moderate pain; Not worsened by activity (see Sidebar 3)” (Box 7).

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^66db958e]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Individualized therapy

Multiple effective acute and preventive therapies are available for migraine. When selecting from these therapies, the objective is that each patient receives the therapy that provides the best personal outcome. Unfortunately, no a priori basis for selection currently exists, at least for acute therapy. Optimal individualized therapy is therefore currently best achieved with a stepped care approach, set out in detail in Step 4.

Recommendations

Provide every patient with a full explanation of migraine as a disease and of the principles of its management.
Consider predisposing and trigger factors, but keep in mind that true trigger factors are often self-evident.
Adhere to the principles of stepped care to achieve optimal individualized therapy (see Step 4).

### "Code headache": development of a protocol for optimizing headache management in the emergency room [^e5f86830]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patients presenting at the emergency room (ER) with headache often encounter a hostile atmosphere and experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this study was to design a protocol for the ER with the goal of optimizing the care of patients with urgent headache to facilitate diagnosis and expedite treatment.

Methods

A narrative literature review was conducted via a MEDLINE search in October 2021. The "Code Headache" protocol was then developed considering the available characteristics and resources of the ER at a tertiary care center within the Spanish National Public Health system.

Results

The Code Headache protocol comprises three assessments: two scales and one checklist. The assessments identify known red flags and stratify patients based on suspected primary/secondary headaches and the need for pain treatment. Initial assessments, performed by the triage nurse, aim to first exclude potentially high morbidity and mortality etiologies (HEAD1 scale) and then expedite appropriate pain management (HEAD2 scale) based on scoring criteria. HEAD1 evaluates vital signs and symptoms of secondary serious headache disorders that can most benefit from earlier identification and treatment, while HEAD2 assesses symptoms indicative of status migrainosus, pain intensity, and vital signs. Subsequently, ER physicians employ a third assessment that reviews red flags for secondary headaches (grouped under the acronym 'PEACE') to guide the selection of complementary tests and aid diagnosis.

Conclusions

The Code Headache protocol is a much needed tool to facilitate quick clinical assessment and improve patient care in the ER. Further validation through comparison with standard clinical practice is warranted.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® headache: 2022 update [^501a7877]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Headache is an ancient problem plaguing a large proportion of the population. At present, headache disorders rank third among the global causes of disability, accounting for over $78 billion per year in direct and indirect costs in the United States. Given the prevalence of headache and the wide range of possible etiologies, the goal of this document is to help clarify the most appropriate initial imaging guidelines for headache for eight clinical scenarios/variants, which range from acute onset, life-threatening etiologies to chronic benign scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^fae75bb4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult emergency department acute headache—patient management recommendations for suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) state: Level B recommendations: Use a normal noncontrast head CT performed within 6 hours of symptom onset in an ED headache patient with a normal neurologic examination, to rule out nontraumatic SAH. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: None specified. Potential benefit is that selected patients will no longer need to be subjected to LP or CTA as part of ruling out SAH, while potential harms include that LP after a normal head CT is a long-standing diagnostic regimen that will occasionally reveal alternative diagnoses and, if not performed, these diagnoses may be missed, and that use of the recommendation could result in a rare missed SAH.

Classes of evidence—grading and adjudication for this policy are defined as follows: Two methodologists independently graded and assigned a preliminary Class of Evidence, with an article with design 1 representing the strongest study design and design 2 and design 3 representing respectively weaker designs; articles were graded on methodological features including randomization, blinding, allocation concealment, data collection, outcome assessment, biases, sample size, generalizability, data management, analyses, congruence of results and conclusions, and conflicts of interest. An adjudication process with the original methodologist graders and at least one additional methodologist addressed discordance and yielded a final Class of Evidence assignment of Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X; articles with fatal flaws or not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade X and were not used in formulating recommendations, although such content may inform background and expert consensus. Grading was question specific, so a single article could receive a different Class of Evidence rating for different critical questions, with question-specific grading located in the Evidentiary Table.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood headache [^66e51300]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Headache is one of the most common chief complaints seen in the pediatrician's office. Oftentimes, identifying the etiology of headache and differentiating primary and secondary causes can present a diagnostic conundrum. Understanding the most common causes of primary and secondary headache is vital to making a correct diagnosis. Here we review the typical presentations of the most common primary headache disorders and the approach to evaluation of the pediatric patient presenting with headache. Diagnostic workup, including the key features to elicit on physical examination, when to order head imaging, and the use of other ancillary tests, is discussed. Current treatment modalities and their indications are reviewed. We will also describe some of the new, emerging therapies that may alter the way we manage headache in the pediatric population. Headache can, at times, be a frustrating symptom seen in the pediatrician's office, but here we hope to better elucidate the approach to evaluation, management, and treatment as well as provide some hope in regards to more effective upcoming therapies.

Acute headache—epidemiology and evidence base for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): Although most patients with sudden-onset severe headache have benign causes, data suggest that between 10% and 15% have serious pathology, most commonly SAH from an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Patients with sudden-onset (peaking within 1 hour) headaches have been demonstrated to have a 6% to 7% incidence of SAH, and SAH remains a devastating condition, with case fatality rates of up to 50%. Early diagnosis can be critical because delayed diagnosis has been associated with rebleeding and worsening of outcomes. For this clinical question, study selection identified one hundred twenty-seven articles; thirty-six were selected for further review, with zero Class I studies, 2 Class II studies, and 2 Class III studies included.

### The role of headache-related disability in migraine management: implications for headache treatment guidelines [^c8bbf9ed]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recently published US Headache Consortium Guidelines recommend a process of diagnosis, patient education, and individualized treatment for the management of migraine. Clinicians are advised to base their treatment choice on attack frequency and duration, degree of disability, non-headache symptoms, patient preference, and prior history of treatment response, using a stratified approach to care. In stratified care, initial treatment is individualized based on an assessment of the patients' medical needs. One approach to stratification uses the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire to stratify patients into groups with different treatment needs based on the degree of headache-related disability. Stratified care was developed as an alternative to step-care approaches, which begin patients on nonspecific medication with gradual escalation until they obtain effective relief. Results from the Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) study indicate that stratified care provides superior outcomes compared to step-care and that the approach is cost-effective, supporting the US Headache Consortium

Guidelines

Stratified care may become the approach of choice for managing migraine in clinical practice. This approach increases the chances of providing appropriate therapy at the patient's initial consultation, sparing the patient a series of failed therapeutic efforts. The MIDAS Questionnaire provides a practical tool for helping to implement the recommendations of the US Headache Consortium

### The thunderclap headache: approach and management in the emergency department [^bb4bf38d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A thunderclap headache (TCH) is a severe headache reaching at least 7 (out of 10) in intensity within 1 min of onset, and can be the presenting symptom of several conditions with potential for significant morbidity and mortality.

Objective Of The Review

This narrative review evaluates the various conditions that may present with TCH and proposes a diagnostic algorithm for patients with TCH.

Discussion

TCH is a symptom associated with several significant diseases. The most common diagnosed condition is subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Other diagnoses include reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral venous thrombosis, cervical artery dissection, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and several others. Patients with TCH require history and physical examination, with a focus on the neurologic system, evaluating for these conditions, including SAH. Further testing often includes head computed tomography (CT) without contrast, CT angiography of the head and neck, and lumbar puncture. Evaluation must take into account history, examination, and the presence of any red flags or signs suggestive of a specific etiology. An algorithm is provided for guidance within this review incorporating these modalities. Management focuses on the specific diagnosis. If testing is negative for a serious condition and the patient improves, discharge home may be appropriate with follow-up.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with TCH require diagnostic evaluation. History and examination are vital in assessing for risk factors for various conditions. Focused testing can assist with diagnosis, with management tailored to the specific diagnosis.

Recommendation strength and direction—general corresponding text and GRADE linkage are defined as follows: Strong for corresponds to “We recommend”, Weak for to “We suggest”, Neither for nor against to “There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against”, Weak against to “We suggest against”, and Strong against to “We recommend against”. The guideline states that the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly linked to the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision making, and notes that if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^2ca11cf4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation and treatment of headache—triage begins by asking if the patient needs urgent/emergent evaluation/treatment or has red flags; if so, consider evaluation in urgent care or ED. If not, assess for a secondary headache, a complicated headache presentation, or multiple headache types requiring specialist referral, and if present refer to specialist for further diagnosis and evaluation. If these are absent, evaluate for TTH by features including bilateral headache, non-pulsatile pain, mild to moderate pain, and not worsened by activity; if present, proceed to TTH treatment and also assess for MOH. If TTH features are absent, evaluate for migraine by features including nausea, throbbing, and headache-related interference in activities; if present, proceed to migraine treatment and also assess for MOH. If migraine features are absent, evaluate for cluster headache by features including bouts of severe and brief headaches lasting <3 hours, unilateral (always same side), autonomic signs ipsilateral to headache, and restlessness during attacks; if present, proceed to cluster headache treatment and also assess for MOH. If none of these pathways apply, revisit general history and physical exam and consider alternate diagnoses or referral for specialty evaluation.

### Vancouver declaration on global headache patient advocacy 2018 [^44545ae5]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Headache disorders comprise the three most prevalent medical disorders globally and contribute almost 20% to the total burden of neurologic illness. Although the experience of a recurrent headache disorder tends to be highly individualized, patient preferences tend to be a low priority in guidelines for the management of patients with headache.

Methods

In September 2017, the first Global Patient Advocacy Summit was convened, bringing together patients, patient advocates, patient advocacy organizations, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, scientists, and regulatory agencies to advance issues of importance to patients affected by headache worldwide.

Results

Presentations and discussion covered multiple issues, such as improving access to appropriate medical care; incorporating the insights of independent patient advocates and advocacy organizations; leveraging the insights, experience and influence of leading health and neurological organizations; and raising awareness of the role of regulatory agencies in disease advocacy. Attendees agreed that it is important to understand and promote the global, regional, and local interests of people with headache disorders, as well as challenge the pervasive stigma associated with headache. They also agreed that those with severe, recurrent, or disabling headache disorders should have reliable access to competent medical care; healthcare professionals should have access to adequate training in Headache Medicine; global benchmarks should be established for accurate diagnosis and the use of evidence-based treatments in patients with headache; and that information is needed about consultation, diagnosis, and treatment of headache, particularly in regard to patient preferences.

Conclusion

Based on the group's consensus around these issues, a series of statements was developed, and they are collectively presented herein as the Vancouver Declaration on Global Headache Patient Advocacy 2018.

### Evaluation and management of headache symptoms (...) [^749815dc]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Headache evaluation is complicated by patients with overlapping symptoms and more than one type of headache. The major types of headache include migraine, tension-type headaches and drug-rebound headaches. Maizels reviewed the steps involved in evaluating and managing the patient with headache. Drug-rebound headaches presenting as chronic daily headaches are common. The use of analgesic medications, even as little as 1, 000 mg per day of aspirin or acetaminophen, can cause this type of headache. Any symptomatic headache remedy may cause drug rebound headache, but it is most likely with the use of ergotamines, narcotics and products that combine caffeine or butalbital with aspirin or acetaminophen. Many clinicians limit the use of all symptomatic medication to two days a week. Patients need much encouragement when attempting withdrawal from the causative medication and should be told they will feel worse for about two weeks.

The addition of amitriptyline or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as naproxen may provide relief. Treatment of acute headache should be based on the past experience of the patient, the headache severity, associated symptoms and the medication side-effect profile. Some choices are described in the accompanying table. Headaches accompanied by severe nausea may be treated by adding a dopamine antagonist anti-emetic such as metoclopramide. More severe headaches may require parenteral therapy with dihydroergotamine or a specific serotonin 1 receptor agonist such as sumatriptan or one of the newer triptans. Headache prophylaxis includes resolution of trigger factors. Medication withdrawal should be considered. Prophylactic medication can be offered if severe attacks occur more than two or three times monthly or if attacks cannot be easily controlled with abortive medications. Prophylaxis may reduce migraine frequency by 50 to 60 percent.

First-line agents are tricyclic antidepressants and beta blockers. Calcium-channel blockers and NSAIDS are less effective but may be tried before giving drugs that have greater side effects. Third-line agents include methysergide and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be considered for use in patients in whom depression is a significant factor of the headache symptoms. Divalproex sodium may be useful in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks.

### Management of headaches in children and adolescents [^8a1b80f3]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric headache impacts up to 80% of children, many recurrently, by the time they are 15 years old. Preventing the progression of episodic to chronic headache results in less truancy, staying current with schoolwork and improves children's quality of life. Lifestyle choices can play an important role in headache treatment. Early effective treatment of episodic headache can prevent transformation into a chronic form. While details of a child's headache are critical for making a proper diagnosis; patient education is critical and effective rescue and preventive treatment strategies enable patients to focus on enjoying activities of daily living. Recognizing "red flags" that may suggest a serious underlying etiology is critical in the early stages of diagnosing and preparing to treat children with headaches. Finally directing patients to manage their headaches at home and when to proceed to an emergency department, urgent care or infusion unit can lower the economic burden of acute headache management.

Family medicine physicians often see headache as the chief complaint when meeting patients within their practice. The goal is to try different treatment modalities without having to send the patient to a specialist. Headaches affect different individuals during their lifetime. Before any treatment begins, it is best that one rules out possible causes of the headache, for example, drug interactions or structural cerebrum conditions. Nonpharmacological treatment is recommended first before attempting a stepwise approach to cost-effective pharmacological treatment options. Pharmacological treatment options should include preventive and on-demand options. A family physician has all the resources to assist patients with different types of headaches.

### Practice advisory for intravenous management of headache disorders in hospitalized patients: a review of the evidence and consensus recommendations [^df25f38a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients hospitalized for headache treatment pose unique challenges to the healthcare system. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on management. This practice advisory aims to fill this critical gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature and providing comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for managing headache patients during hospitalization.

Methods

In February 2023, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine approved this practice advisory proposal. The steering committee selected committee members based on clinical and research expertise in the field of headache medicine. Nine questions were formulated by the committee, and each question was assigned to a group composed of 3-4 members. A systematic literature search for each question was performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science on June 21, 2023. The results from each search were imported into separate Covidence projects for screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Additionally, relevant systematic reviews (SR) were screened. Each group submitted a structured narrative review along with statements and recommendations based on the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) format for grading of evidence. While the USPSTF framework was used, including the language in the recommendations, the formal USPSTF methodology, including the SR with meta-analysis and summary tables with forest plots, was not followed because of low overall evidence quality. The interim draft was shared electronically with each collaborator, who was requested to vote anonymously using two rounds of the modified Delphi approach. A consensus recommendation required >75% agreement.

Results

The panel generated 12 statements and 17 recommendations, along with their strength and certainty of evidence. Following two rounds of Delphi voting, a high consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations. Most statements received a low-to-moderate level of certainty, and all but one recommendation received grade B or C, which was consistent with the lack of randomized controlled trials supporting most of the drugs in this document.

Conclusions

This evidence-based practice advisory provides a foundational step toward standardizing inpatient headache care and highlights existing gaps in the literature that should be addressed through rigorous prospective randomized studies.

### Management of patients presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset severe headache: systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^d9507a78]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-traumatic acute headache accounts for around 2% of adult Emergency Department (ED) attendances.Sudden onset severe headaches may be caused by a primary headache disorder or may be secondary to a more serious underlying pathology, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Diagnosis of SAH is particularly challenging in alert, neurologically intact patients presenting with acute severe headache. Clinical features separating these patients from higher volume complaints with a similar presentation (eg, migraine) are often unreliable indicators of who requires further investigation.

Advances in imaging technologies have precipitated uncertainty and inconsistency in the optimal management of neurologically intact patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic sudden onset severe headache.Given increasing evidence on the potentially low therapeutic value of lumbar puncture (LP) following CT of the head, and its associated adverse effects,updated evidence-based guidance is needed. We therefore undertook a systematic review of evidence on diagnostic strategies for neurologically intact adult patients presenting to hospital with non-traumatic sudden onset severe headache, reaching maximum intensity within 1 hour.

Secondary headache disorders—evaluation and scope—should prioritize identifying a secondary cause versus a primary headache, consider emergent evaluation for red flags, and apply dual diagnoses when a preexisting headache is worsened by a causative disorder; this guideline addresses three secondary types. “The initial evaluation of patients with headache should focus on determining whether a secondary cause for the headache exists or whether a primary headache diagnosis is appropriate.” “Emergent evaluation should be considered based on the presence of red flag features.” “In general, a secondary headache can be diagnosed if the headache is new and occurs in close temporal relation to another disorder known to cause headache or when a preexisting headache disorder significantly worsens in close temporal relation to a causative disorder.” “In instances where a preexisting headache disorder is worsened by a causative disorder, both the primary and secondary headache diagnoses should be given (e.g., migraine and medication overuse headache [MOH]).” The CPG addresses “cervicogenic headache, posttraumatic headache (PTH) (described in the ICHD-3 as a headache attributed to traumatic injury to the head, neck, or both), and MOH,” and notes these types “are the most encountered.”

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^62628b0b]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a highly disabling primary headache disorder with a 1-year prevalence of ~15% in the general population,. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, migraine is the second most prevalent neurological disorder worldwide and is responsible for more disability than all other neurological disorders combined,.

Migraine manifests clinically as recurrent attacks of headache with a range of accompanying symptoms. In approximately one third of individuals with migraine, headache is sometimes or always preceded or accompanied by transient neurological disturbances, referred to as migraine aura,. Furthermore, a minority of those affected develop chronic migraine, in which attacks become highly frequent. The pathogenesis of migraine is widely believed to involve peripheral and central activation of the trigeminovascular system, and cortical spreading depression is thought to be the underlying neurophysiological substrate of migraine aura. However, much remains unknown about specific pathogenic processes and few mechanism-based treatment options currently exist.

Treatments for migraine include acute and preventive medications and a range of non-pharmacological therapies. Despite these treatment options and the comprehensive diagnostic criteria, clinical care remains suboptimal — misdiagnosis and under-treatment of migraine are substantial public health challenges,. Population-based data from Europe indicate that preventive medication for migraine is used by only 2–14% of eligible individuals, an alarming finding that calls for global action. A comprehensive approach is needed to facilitate accurate diagnosis and evidence-based management.

In this Consensus Statement, we provide a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine (Fig. 1). Development of this approach was initiated by the Danish Headache Society, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation (EHF) and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN). The aim of the approach is to support care and clinical decision-making by primary care practitioners, neurologists and headache specialists alike.

### International headache society global practice recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine [^43ca56e7]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In an effort to improve migraine management around the world, the International Headache Society (IHS) has here developed a list of practical recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine. The recommendations are categorized into optimal and essential, in order to provide treatment options for all possible settings, including those with limited access to migraine medications.

Methods

An IHS steering committee developed a list of clinical questions based on practical issues in the management of migraine. A selected group of international senior and junior headache experts developed the recommendations, following expert consensus and the review of available national and international headache guidelines and guidance documents. Following the initial search, a bibliography of twenty-one national and international guidelines was created and reviewed by the working group.

Results

A total of seventeen questions addressing different aspects of acute migraine treatment have been outlined. For each of them we provide an optimal recommendation, to be used whenever possible, and an essential recommendation to be used when the optimal level cannot be attained.

Conclusion

Adoption of these international recommendations will improve the quality of acute migraine treatment around the world, even where pharmacological options remain limited.

### Why headache treatment fails [^2b6481d4]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Management of headache disorders, a leading reason for neurologic outpatient visits, is often difficult. In this article, the authors summarize and categorize the common reasons for treatment failure leading to referral to subspecialty headache centers. They have grouped these treatment failures into five broad categories: 1) the diagnosis is incomplete or incorrect; 2) important exacerbating factors have been missed; 3) pharmacotherapy has been inadequate; 4) nonpharmacologic treatment has been inadequate; 5) other factors, including unrealistic expectations and comorbidity, exist. The authors present an orderly approach to treatment failure to assist neurologists in managing difficult patients. Most refractory headache patients have a biologically determined problem and can be helped by accurate diagnosis or effective treatment. Persistence in treating these patients can be very rewarding. The authors provide a checklist intended to facilitate the management of refractory patients.

### Headache management for the pain specialist [^a901c2c5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Headache is a common symptom caused by a wide variety of diseases. Primary headaches include migraine, cluster headache, tension-type headache, and other less common diseases. It is important to differentiate these headaches from secondary headaches caused by vascular, neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, or toxic disorders. Most primary headaches have a genetic basis, with environmental factors acting as triggers. Recent advances in basic research resulted in the development of more specific and effective therapies. Medication-overuse headache is a very common cause of chronic daily headache. Detoxification from the offending drug is essential for headache improvement. Cervicogenic headache is common and needs to be diagnosed correctly since it may require specific therapy. Nerve blocks are useful for some patients with primary, as well as secondary, headaches.

### Chronic daily headache: diagnosis and management-AAFP (...) [^b3a6c3f3]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Management NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES Several behavioral modifications are recommended for patients with chronic daily headache. These include cessation of caffeine and tobacco use, improved sleep hygiene, diet changes, and regular mealtimes. However, evidence supporting these modifications is lacking. 3 One study examining regimens of low-load cervical exercises and osteopathic manipulation suggested some effectiveness for the treatment of “cervicogenic headache, ”. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that various psychotherapeutic regimens can be effective in decreasing disability for those with chronic daily headache, including Internet-based biofeedback and relaxation techniques that have been shown to decrease headache frequency and severity, and medication use. 13 There is somewhat stronger evidence for the use of cognitive behavior therapy for chronic daily headache, both in group and individualized settings.

14, 15 Cognitive behavior therapy has been shown to reduce headache frequency and severity, and improve overall quality of life. 14, 15. 3, 9 Evidence suggests that educational interventions, whether face-to-face or in written form, can prevent medication overuse in patients with migraine. 24 Although many experts recommend a complete withdrawal of acute medications in patients with headache from medication overuse, one randomized controlled trial suggests that patients can benefit from prophylactic treatment without complete withdrawal of abortive therapy.
25. The indications for referral to a neurologist or headache specialist may include diagnostic uncertainty, unsuccessful outpatient therapy, or the desire to administer more specialized treatment, such as onabotulinumtoxinA. Patients with severe psychiatric illness should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. It may be necessary to hospitalize some patients to discontinue abortive medications in a monitored setting, and to treat the headache with intravenous medications, such as dihydroergotamine.
3. Case Conclusion After a thorough discussion of her options, your patient elects to try cognitive behavior therapy and topiramate for her chronic daily headache. She also agrees to reduce the amount of sumatriptan she is using, although she is reluctant to give up abortive therapy altogether. During a follow-up appointment two months later, she reports that her headaches have improved and now occur only about two to three times per week. Her current headaches are less intense than her previous chronic daily headaches. She feels her performance at work has improved because of better concentration and fewer missed days of work.

INTRODUCTION

Headache is the main reason for patient consultation in tertiary hospital emergency room (ER) settings, accounting for 1%–3% of all visits. Data from a multinational registry showed that 59.5% of headache patients presenting to the ER are diagnosed with primary headache, migraine in most cases, while 40.5% have secondary headaches, which may cause high morbidity and mortality in 7.1% of patients. This becomes a problem when there is under‐triage of headache patients in ERs, with a reported 85.1% of patients who should be classified as “emergency” level and 23.3% as “urgent” level being misclassified. Incorrect classification of these patients results in diagnostic and therapeutic delay, with increased length of stay in the ER, increased likelihood of new consultation after discharge, and increased resource consumption, both in patients with primary and patients with secondary headaches. Headache patients who are under‐triaged as non‐urgent can wait up to 4 hours. After a correctly targeted anamnesis and clinical and neurological examination by ER physicians, most urgent headache cases can be identified by reviewing the red flags of secondary etiology. Red flags of secondary headache have been well researched and described but they were not conceived to include other urgent cases, such as primary headaches with a severe attack that require prompt treatment in the ER. Furthermore, there is a lack of specific tools for risk classification and triage of headache patients arriving at the ER.

The objective of this study, therefore, was to develop a protocol that could help establish a “Code Headache” (mimicking the vocabulary used, for example, in “Code Stroke”), with diagnostic and therapeutic intention. We intended that the protocol should: (1) include the known “secondary headache red flags”, to exclude potential severe morbi‐mortality etiologies; (2) be based on a quick scoring system, in order to facilitate and expedite care in the ER; (3) be easily implemented by non‐headache experts and non‐neurologists; and (4) improve access to pain treatment in both primary and secondary headache cases, avoiding unnecessary delays and prioritizing pain care.

Chronic classification across primary headaches is defined differently: for migraine and tension-type headache (TTH), chronic refers to frequent headaches occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months; for cluster headache, chronic refers to headaches occurring for 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting fewer than 3 months; because primary headaches are recurrent, a single or first-time headache should prompt appropriate evaluation for secondary causes, and these criteria apply only if the diagnosis is not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

Classifying headaches as primary (migraine, tension-type or cluster) or secondary can facilitate evaluation and management A detailed headache history helps to distinguish among the primary headache disorders. "Red flags" for secondary disorders include sudden onset of headache, onset of headache after 50 years of age, increased frequency or severity of headache, new onset of headache with an underlying medical condition, headache with concomitant systemic illness, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema and headache subsequent to head trauma. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed, with abnormal findings warranting neuroimaging to rule out intracranial pathology. The preferred imaging modality to rule out hemorrhage is noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) scanning followed by lumbar puncture if the CT scan is normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive than CT scanning and less widely available; however, MRI reveals more detail and is necessary for imaging the posterior fossa. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can help to confirm or rule out hemorrhage, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension. Referral is appropriate for patients with headaches that are difficult to diagnose, or that worsen or fail to respond to management

Determining recommendation strength and direction (GRADE) in the VA/DoD headache guideline is based on specified domains, including confidence in the quality of evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and patient values and preferences. Per GRADE, each recommendation’s strength and direction is determined by “the following four domains,” and for confidence in evidence the options are “High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low,” with the rule that “the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation.” Recommendation strength “generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence,” such that “Strong recommendations are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence,” although “GRADE permits Low or Very Low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation).” The balance of outcomes considers benefits and harms, with options ranging from “benefits outweigh harms/burdens” through “harms/burdens outweigh benefits,” and “assumes most providers will offer patients an intervention if its advantages exceed the harms.” Patient values and preferences include “patients’ perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life” as they apply to potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience.

Migraines are common, incapacitating, and often stress inducing for pediatric patients and parents alike. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, more than 1 million Americans seek emergency care every year due to migraines, with increasing frequency among adolescents. The disease can vary in severity and character, often mimicking life-threatening conditions, requiring prompt nuanced recognition by emergency personnel and implementation of an effective treatment strategy. Development of emergency department guidelines for the management of pediatric migraines should be based on up-to-date evidence supporting safe, appropriate therapies for children.

Step 8: Managing complications

Medication overuse headache

MOH is a chronic headache disorder characterized by headache on ≥15 days per month. It develops over a variable period of time in patients with a pre-existing headache disorder as a result of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication. Patients with migraine account for approximately two thirds of all cases of MOH, although this estimate is based on limited evidence and might be too low.

Withdrawal of the overused medication is the necessary and only remedy for MOH. Expert consensus is that abrupt withdrawal is preferable to slow withdrawal, except for opioids. This process can be managed in primary care unless addictive drugs, such as opioids, are involved,. Patient education is a key component of the clinical management of MOH, as withdrawal is usually followed by worsening before recovery,. Preventive therapy (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) appropriate to the antecedent headache can be started in parallel with acute medication withdrawal or upon re-emergence of the headache disorder, although this topic remains a subject of debate,.

Secondary headache—International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria are outlined as follows: Initial evaluation of headache should aim to determine whether a secondary cause exists, and emergent evaluation should be considered based on red flag features; in general, a secondary headache can be diagnosed if the headache is new and occurs in close temporal relation to another disorder known to cause headache, or when a preexisting headache disorder significantly worsens in close temporal relation to a causative disorder, in which case both the primary and secondary headache diagnoses should be given. General diagnostic criteria for secondary headaches require: A. any headache fulfilling C; B. another disorder scientifically documented to be able to cause headache has been diagnosed with evidence of causation demonstrated by at least two of the following—headache has developed in temporal relation to the onset of the presumed causative disorder; either or both of the following: headache has significantly worsened in parallel with worsening of the presumed causative disorder or headache has significantly improved in parallel with improvement of the presumed causative disorder; headache has characteristics typical for the causative disorder; or other evidence of causation exists; and C. not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

As many as 30 million Americans have migraine headaches. The impact on patients and their families can be tremendous, and treatment of migraines can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for family physicians. Abortive treatment options include nonspecific and migraine-specific therapy. Nonspecific therapies include analgesics (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates), adjunctive therapies (antiemetics and sedatives), and other nonspecific medications (intranasal lidocaine or steroids). Migraine-specific abortive therapies include ergotamine and its derivatives, and triptans. Complementary and alternative therapies can also be used to abort the headache or enhance the efficacy of another therapeutic modality. Treatment choices for acute migraine should be based on headache severity, migraine frequency, associated symptoms, and comorbidities.

Migraine is a common and disabling primary headache disorder with a significant socioeconomic burden. The management of migraine is multifaceted and is generally dichotomized into acute and preventive strategies, with several treatment modalities. The aims of acute pharmacological treatment are to rapidly restore function with minimal recurrence, with the avoidance of side effects. The choice of pharmacological treatment is individualized, and is based on the consideration of the characteristics of the migraine attack, the patient's concomitant medical problems, and treatment preferences. Notwithstanding, a good understanding of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the various drug options is essential to guide therapy. The current approach and concepts relevant to the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine will be explored in this review.

Headaches are a global health problem and are encountered by a variety of specialties, including otolaryngologists. These patients can present as a challenge, but an understanding of primary and secondary headache disorders and the accompanying broad differential diagnosis is critical. For secondary headache disorders, a differential diagnosis categorized by anatomic location can help organize the evaluation of these patients, which can then be narrowed by the history and examination findings. Additional ancillary tests such as laboratories and imaging can further aid in diagnosis but are not always necessary.

### Diagnosis and management of the primary headache disorders in the emergency department setting [^6bec3378]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Headache continues to be a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) use, accounting for 2% of all visits. Most of these headaches prove to be benign but painful exacerbations of chronic headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, and cluster. The goal of ED management is to provide rapid and quick relief of benign headache, without causing undue side effects, and to recognize headaches with malignant course. Although these headaches have distinct epidemiologies and clinical phenotypes, there is overlapping response to therapy; nonsteroidals, triptans, dihydroergotamine, and the antiemetic dopamine antagonists may play a therapeutic role for each of these acute headaches. This article reviews the diagnostic criteria and management strategies for the primary headache disorders.

### Initiating and optimizing acute therapy for migraine: the role of patient-centered stratified care [^fc5205b1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Migraine is a chronic, intermittently disabling condition that affects physical, mental, and social aspects of health-related quality of life. Because patients seeking assistance with migraine most often present to primary care providers, these healthcare professionals play critical roles in the diagnosis and treatment process. A comprehensive migraine management plan involves a partnership between the patient and healthcare professional where treatment goals and strategies are established. Elements of such a plan should include preventive strategies to reduce the frequency and effects of future attacks as well as the use of acute treatments to address the immediate need for relief during an attack. Approaches to prevention include education, lifestyle modification, and, often, appropriate medication. Many medications have been used for acute treatment. Nonspecific agents include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), single or combination analgesics (sometimes including antiemetics or caffeine), and narcotics. Migraine-specific medications include ergot alkaloids and triptans (5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D) agonists). Various professional organizations have created guidelines to help providers in choosing appropriate management interventions. Clinical approaches to the patient with migraine include step care, whereby all patients begin on a simple or nonspecific treatment, stepping up to the next level of therapy if treatment is unsuccessful; or stratified care, whereby first-line therapy is tailored to the severity of the patient's pattern of headache. Studies have demonstrated that for more disabled headache patients, the stratified-care approach results in more robust headache response with less disability and greater cost-effectiveness than step care. Patient satisfaction studies demonstrate that the use of migraine-specific abortive medications (triptans) is associated with a higher satisfaction rate than over-the-counter preparations, NSAIDs, and analgesic combinations. Patients who initially reported satisfaction with the latter medications also reported a preference for triptan therapy. Healthcare professionals can assist patients, not only by choosing the most appropriate medication but also by assessing whether the level of benefit the patient is currently receiving could be improved.

### Benign headache management in the emergency department [^bd934582]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Headache is a common complaint managed in the emergency department (ED), with emergency physicians focusing on evaluation for life-threatening conditions while treating pain and nausea.

Objective

This review evaluates the treatment of benign, primary headaches in the ED, with recommendations provided based on the literature.

Discussion

Headaches are a major cause of disability in the United States and a common condition managed in the ED. The primary objectives of emergency evaluation of these patients include evaluation for a life-threatening, secondary cause of headache, with treatment of primary headaches. Close evaluation for a secondary cause of headache include consideration of red flags and focused neurologic examination. The diagnosis of primary headaches is clinical. Literature has evaluated medication efficacy in headache treatment, with antidopaminergic medications demonstrating high rates of efficacy when used in combination with nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen. Dexamethasone can be used for the reduction of headache recurrence. If dehydration is present, intravenous fluids should be provided. Diphenhydramine is not recommended for analgesia but may reduce akathisia associated with prochlorperazine. Ketamine, propofol, and nerve blocks demonstrate promise. Triptan agents are also efficacious, provided absence of contraindications. Most patients are appropriate for discharge with pain improvement.

Conclusions

A variety of medications is available for the treatment of primary headaches in the ED. Antidopaminergic agents demonstrate the highest efficacy and should be provided with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs. Dexamethasone may reduce headache recurrence. Other treatments include ketamine, propofol, and nerve blocks.

### Management of patients presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset severe headache: systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^895da0a0]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Where sufficient information was reported, diagnostic accuracy data were extracted into 2×2 tables to calculate sensitivity, specificity, false positive and false negative rates. Where equivalent diagnostic strategies or tools were used in three or more studies, the hierarchical bivariate model described by Reitsma et al was fitted, along with an extension described by Simmonds and Higginsto meta-analyse sensitivity and specificity while accounting for correlation between the two, and within-person correlation between test results. Meta-analyses used standard random-effects DerSimonian-Laird methods. Subgroups were analysed separately to account for underlying differences in diagnostic strategies. The diagnostic accuracy of CT conducted <6 hours from headache onset was analysed separately, as CT accuracy is known to drop rapidly outside of this time frame.The accuracy of different methods of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was also assessed. Where results could not be pooled, they were synthesised narratively along with reported adverse event data.

Public and patient involvement

A patient collaborator with experience of presenting to an ED with a sudden onset severe headache was involved throughout the project. Three additional patients were recruited to an advisory group. The patients provided input during protocol development and interpretation of review findings.

Epidemiology of headache and its importance in the general population is summarized as follows: The lifetime prevalence of any headache disorder is 66%; one-half of the people with a history of headache actively experience headache. Headache is the second leading cause of years lived with disability across all age groups, trailing only low back pain, and more disability-adjusted life years are attributable to headache than all other neurological disorders combined. Among persons ages 25 to 49, headache was the seventh leading condition associated with DALYs in 1990 and the fifth leading condition in 2019. Ten percent of people living with headache report having multiple different types of headaches each week, and 3% report having some type of headache daily. Worldwide, TTH, migraine, and MOH are the most common headache disorders.

### Frequent headaches: evaluation and management [^65ccabab]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most frequent headaches are typically migraine or tension-type headaches and are often exacerbated by medication overuse. Repeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable, are difficult to treat, and cause significant morbidity and costs. A complete history is essential to identify the most likely headache type, indications of serious secondary headaches, and significant comorbidities. A headache diary can document headache frequency, symptoms, initiating and exacerbating conditions, and treatment response over time. Neurologic assessment and physical examination focused on the head and neck are indicated in all patients. Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be excluded by the patient history, screening tools such as SNNOOP10, neurologic and physical examinations, and targeted imaging and other assessments. Medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients with frequent headaches. Medication history should include nonprescription analgesics and substances, including opiates, that may be obtained from others. Patients who overuse opiates, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines require slow tapering and possibly inpatient treatment to prevent acute withdrawal. Patients who overuse other agents can usually withdraw more quickly. Evidence is mixed on the role of medications such as topiramate for patients with medication overuse headache. For the underlying headache, an individualized evidence-based management plan incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is necessary. Patients with frequent migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches should be offered prophylactic therapy. A complete management plan includes addressing risk factors, headache triggers, and common comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes that can impair treatment effectiveness. Regular scheduled follow-up is important to monitor progress.

A detailed history and neurological examination can be used to identify children at higher risk of serious underlying pathology. Neuroimaging decisions should be taken carefully, weighing risk versus benefit in each case. This article will discuss five patient scenarios highlighting red flags and differential diagnoses in children presenting with headache in the emergency department.

Migraine and tension headaches are among the most common diagnoses in women's health. Secondary causes of headache such as brain tumor, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and meningitis are uncommon but must not be missed. A careful history and physical examination, use of diagnostic criteria, and certain facts about the serious causes of headache are the keys to diagnosis and treatment. Neuroimaging should be limited to patients displaying signs or symptoms of a secondary headache cause. Menstrual migraine can be managed similarly to nonmenstrual migraine.

Chronic migraine—diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from <24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension-type headache or its types.
