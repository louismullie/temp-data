## Question

mild moderate severe neutropenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the classification of neutropenia by severity, including definitions, clinical implications, and special considerations such as benign ethnic neutropenia and drug-specific thresholds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal definition of neutropenia and how severity is stratified. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of each severity tier, especially infection risk. Next, I will examine special populations and contexts, including benign ethnic neutropenia, pediatric considerations, and drug-specific thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary and ensure internal consistency with authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the universal definition of neutropenia. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500 cells/μL, and severity is typically stratified as mild (ANC 1000–1499/μL), moderate (ANC 500–999/μL), and severe (ANC less than 500/μL), with agranulocytosis often used for ANC less than 200/μL in some schemas, although some contemporary guidance uses less than 100/μL or less than 200/μL to define agranulocytosis depending on context [^0e507514] [^8a572cd0] [^f144df22].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance tied to each tier. Mild neutropenia generally confers low infection risk and often warrants observation with repeat counts, moderate neutropenia increases susceptibility to infection and may require closer follow-up or intervention if symptomatic, and severe neutropenia carries a high risk of serious bacterial and fungal infections and typically mandates urgent evaluation and, if febrile, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and often hematology input. Profound neutropenia, sometimes defined as ANC less than 100/μL, is associated with extremely high infection risk and is a medical emergency in febrile patients [^0e507514] [^f144df22] [^825df6d4].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and contexts that modify interpretation. Benign ethnic neutropenia, linked to the Duffy-null (ACKR1/DARC) genotype, is common in people of African ancestry and is characterized by lower baseline ANCs without increased infection risk; this affects thresholds for concern and drug monitoring, notably with clozapine, where modified ANC cutoffs and monitoring algorithms are recommended for patients with documented benign ethnic neutropenia [^4ad8291b] [^60ac3c96] [^47e25c24].

> I need to check pediatric nuances. In children, isolated neutropenia is frequently benign and self-limited, with viral suppression, autoimmune neutropenia, and drug effects common; severe congenital neutropenia is rare but high risk and often requires G-CSF. Importantly, many children with isolated neutropenia improve without subspecialty intervention, though persistent or severe cases warrant evaluation [^e797090f] [^6aa3f21f].

> Let me consider drug-specific thresholds and monitoring. For clozapine, severe neutropenia is defined as ANC less than 500/μL and is associated with significant infection risk; initiation is not recommended if baseline ANC is below 1500/μL in the general population, and modified thresholds apply in benign ethnic neutropenia, with structured ANC monitoring and dose interruption rules. For deferiprone, severe idiosyncratic neutropenia (agranulocytosis) is most concerning at very low ANCs, with data supporting heightened infection risk when ANC is less than 200/μL or less than 100/μL, prompting aggressive monitoring and cessation at first infection signs. For asenapine and aripiprazole, severe neutropenia is often operationalized as ANC less than 1000/μL in labeling, reflecting class effects and the need for prompt discontinuation and monitoring if severe neutropenia occurs [^b9772091] [^95d0702d] [^f144df22] [^41e31253] [^0568f356] [^ae49cac1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought agranulocytosis universally meant ANC less than 500/μL, but I should correct that. While some older or general sources equate severe neutropenia with agranulocytosis, many contemporary oncology and hematology sources reserve agranulocytosis for ANC less than 200/μL or even less than 100/μL, reflecting the extreme infection risk at those ultra-low levels; thus, I should align the definition to context, using less than 200/μL or less than 100/μL when discussing agranulocytosis in drug safety or guideline frameworks [^8a572cd0] [^825df6d4] [^1bb61e56].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications for management. In febrile patients with severe neutropenia, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated within 60 minutes, with risk stratification guiding setting of care. In non-febrile patients with severe neutropenia, close surveillance and hematology evaluation are warranted. For mild to moderate neutropenia, outpatient observation with repeat CBC in 1–2 weeks is reasonable if the patient is stable and afebrile, with escalation if counts fall or symptoms develop [^0e507514] [^0e507514].

> Let me synthesize the final classification to ensure internal consistency. Neutropenia is defined as ANC less than 1500/μL, with mild 1000–1499/μL, moderate 500–999/μL, and severe less than 500/μL; profound or agranulocytosis is often defined as less than 100–200/μL depending on context. Infection risk rises progressively with lower ANC and longer duration, and clinical decisions should integrate severity, duration, symptoms, etiology, and patient-specific modifiers such as age, comorbidities, and benign ethnic neutropenia status [^0e507514] [^8a572cd0] [^0e507514].

Neutropenia is defined by the **absolute neutrophil count (ANC)** and classified as mild (ANC 1,000–1,499/μL), moderate (ANC 500–999/μL), or severe (ANC < 500/μL) [^0e507514]. Severe neutropenia carries the **highest risk of infection** [^41e7d6ef] and often requires urgent evaluation and prophylactic antibiotics if febrile [^0e507514]; moderate neutropenia increases infection risk and warrants close monitoring; mild neutropenia is usually low risk and often observed with repeat counts [^0e507514]. Management depends on severity, duration, and cause, with G-CSF for severe or chronic cases and tailored therapy for underlying etiologies [^233bb3a6] [^0f86821a].

## Classification of neutropenia by severity

| **Severity** | **Anc (cells/μl)** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 1,000–1,499 | - Low infection risk <br/> - Often transient or chronic benign <br/> - Usually observed with repeat counts [^0e507514] [^4ad8291b] |
| Moderate | 500–999 | - Increased infection risk <br/> - Monitor closely <br/> - Evaluate for causes if persistent [^0e507514] [^29916fd9] |
| Severe | < 500 | - High infection risk <br/> - Often requires urgent evaluation <br/> - Prophylactic antibiotics if febrile <br/> - Consider G-CSF [^2d5c607a] [^233bb3a6] |

## Clinical significance and management

### Mild neutropenia

- **Infection risk**: Low; most patients are asymptomatic [^0e507514].
- **Management**: Observation with repeat CBC in 1–2 weeks; investigate if persistent or symptomatic [^0e507514].
- **Common causes**: Viral infections, autoimmune disorders, benign ethnic neutropenia [^4ad8291b] [^e797090f].

---

### Moderate neutropenia

- **Infection risk**: Moderate; higher susceptibility to bacterial infections [^notfound].
- **Management**: Identify and treat underlying causes; monitor closely; consider G-CSF if chronic or recurrent [^0f86821a] [^233bb3a6].
- **Common causes**: Drug-induced, autoimmune, nutritional deficiencies [^98be29ff].

---

### Severe neutropenia

- **Infection risk**: High; risk of severe bacterial and fungal infections, including sepsis [^41e7d6ef].
- **Management**: Immediate evaluation; broad-spectrum antibiotics if febrile; G-CSF; hematology referral; avoid invasive procedures when possible [^2d5c607a] [^233bb3a6].
- **Common causes**: Chemotherapy, severe congenital neutropenia, aplastic anemia, acute leukemia [^8a572cd0] [^511fdded].

---

## Special considerations

- **Benign ethnic neutropenia**: Common in individuals of African descent; ANC 1,000–1,500/μL without increased infection risk; adjust thresholds for certain drugs (e.g. clozapine) [^4ad8291b] [^60ac3c96].
- **Pediatric neutropenia**: Often benign and self-limited; evaluate for autoimmune or congenital causes if severe or persistent [^e797090f] [^6aa3f21f].
- **Drug-induced neutropenia**: Common; monitor ANC with myelosuppressive agents; stop offending drug if severe [^98be29ff] [^b9772091].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Classification**: Mild (1,000–1,499), moderate (500–999), severe (< 500) [^0e507514].
- **Risk**: Increases with lower ANC and longer duration [^8f36d26b].
- **Management**: Tailored to severity, duration, and cause; G-CSF for severe or chronic cases [^233bb3a6].
- **Special populations**: Benign ethnic neutropenia and pediatrics require adjusted thresholds and cautious evaluation [^4ad8291b] [^6aa3f21f].

---

Neutropenia is classified by ANC into mild, moderate, and severe categories, with infection risk rising as ANC falls. Management is **severity- and cause-specific**, ranging from observation to urgent therapy and G-CSF support [^0e507514] [^233bb3a6].

### Clozapine [^b9772091]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

Background

Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil "segs" plus neutrophil "bands"). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, "severe neutropenia" replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.

Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^0e507514]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Paediatric autoimmune neutropaenia [^a809632c]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Neutropaenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 1500cells/µL and is often divided into mild (ANC: 1000 to 1500cells/µL), moderate (ANC: 500 to 1000cells/µL) and severe (ANC: > 500cells/µL) neutropaenia. Autoimmune neutropaenia is arguably one of the most clinically relevant forms of neutropaenia and is defined by an ANC of < 500cells/µL alongside the confirmed presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies. It is a rare subset of neutropaenia boasting an incidence of just 1 in 100000 infants and is thought to be caused as a result of a 'surveillance escape event' of the immune system. This case report identifies key issues in the diagnosis and monitoring of paediatric patients with recurrent neutropaenia and reviews current literature relating to its management in hospital and community settings.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ASCO/IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to define neutropenia based on the absolute neutrophil count:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Neutropenia|- < 1, 000/mcL|
|Severe neutropenia|- < 500/mcL|
|Profound neutropenia|- < 100/mcL.|

### Prevalence and clinical significance of neutropenia discovered in routine complete blood cell counts: a longitudinal study [^3468596d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Neutropenia, defined as an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) < 1.5 G L(-1), may accompany a variety of diseases. However, the clinical significance of neutropenia detected in a routine complete blood cell count is poorly understood.

Methods

Using a primary care resource, comprising more than 370 000 individuals, we assessed the association with a number of previously recognized conditions as well as all-cause mortality in the 4 years following the identification of neutropenia. By matching laboratory data with Danish nationwide health registers, risk estimates were assessed.

Results

Neutropenia was observed in approximately 1% of all individuals and was associated dose dependently with viral infections, haematological malignancies (but not autoimmune disorders or solid cancers) and mortality. Neutropenia was particularly associated with HIV, acute leukaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. Odds ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for viral infections were 2.32 (1.84–2.91), 2.80 (2.20–3.57) and 4.77 (3.22–7.07) for subnormal (≥ 1.5–1.8 G L(-1)), mild (≥ 1.0–1.5 G L(-1)) and moderate-severe (≥ 0.0–1.0 G L(-1)) neutropenic individuals, respectively (all P < 0.001). Likewise, odds ratios (95% CI) for haematological malignancies were 3.23 (2.35–4.45), 8.69 (6.58–11.47) and 46.03 (33.98–62.35), for the same neutropenia levels, respectively (all P < 0.001). Thus, the lower the ANC, the greater the likelihood of these diseases. The relative risk estimates observed for severe neutropenia corresponded to absolute risks of haematological malignancies and mortality from any cause of 40% and > 50%, respectively.

Conclusions

Neutropenia is an ominous sign necessitating careful follow-up. The risk estimates presented here support focusing attention to viral diseases and haematological malignancies when neutropenia is observed.

### Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in the US: a beast of burden that needs to be tamed? [^8a572cd0]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (FN) are common and potentially life-threatening complications of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. While there is no standard classification for neutropenia, a patient is generally considered neutropenic when their absolute neutrophil count (ANC) falls below 1.5 × 10 9 /L (1500/mm 3). The severity of neutropenia can be categorized as mild (ANC, 1.0–1.5 × 10 9 /L), moderate (0.5–1.0 × 10 9 /L), severe (0.2–0.5 × 10 9 /L), or very severe (< 0.2 × 10 9 /L, termed "agranulocytosis"). FN, considered an oncologic emergency, is defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) as an oral temperature ≥ 38.3°C (101.0°F), or a sustained temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for 1 hour, and an ANC < 0.5 × 10 9 /L or an ANC that is expected to decrease to < 0.5 × 10 9 /L within 48 hours. The European Society for Medical Oncology's (ESMO) definition of FN states that a sustained temperature > 38.0°C (100.4°F) must be present for 2 hours.

### Absolute neutrophil count nadir in healthy pediatric patients with the duffy-null phenotype [^7e654dac]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
All healthy Fy(a-b-) ANC values and control ANC values. ANC values of healthy children with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype (red triangles; n = 251) compared with healthy controls (blue circles; n = 134) based on age. The shaded area represents the ANC institutional reference range based on age.

Figure 2.
ANC nadir values of healthy children with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype. Dotted lines indicate the degree of neutropenia: mild- ANC, from 1000 to 1500 cells per μL; moderate- ANC, from 500 to 999 cells per μL; and severe- ANC, < 500 per μL. Children younger than 5 years had an ANC as low as 100 cells per μL. Children older than 5 years had an ANC as low as 400 cells per μL but rarely had values < 500 cells per μL.

Although there is a growing understanding that individuals with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype have lower ANCs, much uncertainty remains regarding the healthy lower ANC limit for children. Previously, ANC with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype was described as > 1200 cells per μL, with only occasional occurrences of patients having an ANC < 1000 cells per μL. However, more than half of the healthy Fy(a-b-) children in this cohort had an ANC < 1200 cells per μL. In fact, these children had ANCs as low as 100 cells per μL, with a median nadir of 800 cells per μL. Notably, children younger than 5 years had the most profound neutropenia at 100 cells per μL, whereas those aged ≥ 5-years-old rarely had an ANC < 500 cells per μL. We are unaware of the physiological explanation for this discrepancy, and prospective studies are required to validate this finding. Despite these very low ANC levels and many children also completing additional tests for inborn errors of immunity or malignancy, none of these children had a history of infection or alternative pathology identified.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^41e7d6ef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^96d44ba0]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute, unforeseeable, and transient declines in absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) can occur with the use of some medications, a condition referred to here as idiosyncratic drug–induced neutropenias (IDINs). Although rare, IDIN may put patients at a high risk of serious and sometimes fatal infections, in particular if IDIN is profound and long lasting. For example, it is estimated that as many as 60% of patients with severe IDIN develop septicemia if their infections are not treated aggresively. Because patients experiencing IDINs can progress rapidly from having no symptoms or fever to developing sepsis, early detection of IDINs and timely measures to increase ANCs are critical to prevent serious infections.

Although the clinical characterization of neutropenias into strata of mild (ANC, 1 × 10 9 /L to 1.5 × 10 9 /L), moderate (ANC, 0.5 × 10 9 /L to 1 × 10 9 /L), and severe (ANC, < 0.5 × 10 9 /L) helps in predicting the risk of infections in patients with any type of neutropenia, there is a need to further characterize the risk of infections in patients with severe neutropenia with very low ANCs (ie, < 0.5×10 9 /L) to establish algorithms for rapid interventions adjusted to ANC levels and specific drugs.

### Characterization of the phenotypic consequences of the duffy-null genotype [^b8f407cd]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Mild neutropenia in Duffy-null individuals

Duffy-null individuals have lower neutrophil counts on average, with 9.22% of Duffy-null individuals having at least 2 low ANCs compared with only 2.51% of non–Duffy-null individuals (Figure 3 A). A recent report suggests that Duffy-null status may lead to more severe neutropenia than previously indicated; however, this study only included 66 Duffy-null individuals. Here, we examine the distribution of neutropenia severity by Duffy-null status in a much larger cohort. To this end, we compared histograms of low ANC (ANC < 1.5 × 10 3 /μL) between non–Duffy-null individuals (n = 1783) and Duffy-null individuals (n = 1002; Figure 3 B). Of the 2785 individuals with at least 2 low neutrophil counts, Duffy-null individuals had a significantly higher mean count (1.20 ± 0.26) than non–Duffy-null individuals (1.09 ± 0.38; P < .0001). Among these participants with low neutrophil counts, 10.3% of non–Duffy-null individuals had severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10 3 /μL), whereas only 1.8% of Duffy-null individuals had severe neutropenia (Figure 3 C). The same trends are observed when restricting laboratory measurements to outpatient visits to control for acute changes due to illness and surgery (supplemental Figure 2). Although neutropenia was widely underdiagnosed (supplemental Figure 3), it is even more underdiagnosed in Duffy-null individuals (supplemental Table 1 M).

### Assessment and predictive ability of the absolute neutrophil count in peripheral blood for in vivo CAR T cells expansion and CRS [^32a24d5f]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the widespread application of live-cell-based CAR T cell therapy in hematologic malignancies, effective responses and manageable toxicity have received increasing interest among researchers in recent years. To improve clinical success, we sought to provide a novel biomarker to evaluate and predict CAR T cells expansion as well as CRS during treatment, thereby improving patient benefit.

Rejeski et al reported that patients with B-cell lymphoma experienced neutropenia after CAR T cell therapy, and they emphasized that neutropenia was strongly association with the preconditioning regimen. In our study, ANC showed a dramatic decline (days 0–2) before the CAR T cell exponential expansion (days 2–8). All patients were divided into an ANC-absence group and an ANC-presence group. Then, we observed that patients with ANC absence had higher expansion of CAR T cells. The results showed that a sustained decrease in ANC indicated a rapid expansion rate. The AUC of the ROC curve indicated good performance for ANC in predicting the expansion rate of CAR T cells. In summary, a brief low level of ANC or moderate neutropenia detected in the peripheral blood may indicate poor expansion, which will help doctors make a quick diagnosis within a transient treatment window. Chong et al have reported that the patients with B-cell lymphoma had re-expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood and achieved clinical responses after receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Perhaps anti-PD-1 therapy could be an appropriate intervention regimen for patients with moderate neutropenia.

### The diagnostic value of absolute neutrophil count, band count and morphologic changes of neutrophils in predicting bacterial infections [^5dba37ea]. Medical Principles and Practice (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)" for febrile neutropenia.

The Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a clinical calculator used primarily in the field of hematology and oncology. It is applicable to patients who have undergone chemotherapy, those with suspected neutropenia, or those at risk for severe infection due to immunosuppression. The ANC is calculated from the total white blood cell count and the percentage of neutrophils, providing a measure of the body's primary defense against bacterial infections.

The clinical utility of the ANC lies in its ability to assess the severity of neutropenia and the risk of infection in patients. It is particularly useful in monitoring patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these individuals are at a high risk for neutropenia and subsequent infection.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ANC. However, it should be noted that the ANC may not accurately reflect the risk of infection in patients with conditions that cause functional neutrophil defects, such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, the ANC may be less useful in patients with conditions that cause neutrophilia, such as corticosteroid use or acute stress, as these conditions can artificially elevate the neutrophil count.

### Neutropenia in patients with hyperthyroidism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a6b37e78]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Neutropenia, a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), may be a sign of new-onset hyperthyroidism. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide the most reliable estimates of prevalence, degree and response to treatments of neutropenia in the pure hyperthyroidism setting.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus databases for retrieving articles in English and non-English languages reporting ANC values/neutropenic cases at presentation and after therapy in patients with hyperthyroidism. A proportion meta-analysis was performed with DerSimonian and Laird method (random-effects model). Pooled data were presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and displayed in a forest plot. I 2 statistic index was used to quantify the heterogeneity among the studies. Sensitivity analyses for the prevalence of neutropenia and the mean of ANC in hyperthyroid patients were performed by excluding the studies without full details. Trim and fill analysis and Egger's linear regression test were carried out to evaluate the publication bias. A two-sided P-value of < .05 was regarded as significant for all analyses. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the quality of studies included.

Results

The literature search yielded 1880 studies of which 13 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of neutropenia in newly diagnosed and untreated patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism was 10% (CI 5%-19%, I 2 88.6%) and summary mean ANC value in neutropenic was 1.4 ± 0.3 × 10 9 /L. In all neutropenic patients under ATD therapy neutropenia resolved, thus without the worsening of the baseline ANC values or the development of agranulocytosis. The sensitivity analyses showed similar results as those of the main analyses. For all outcomes, the publication bias was not statistically significant or not calculable.

Conclusions

Graves' disease per se is associated with neutropenia in about 10% of cases. Neutropenia usually appears as a mild to moderate laboratory abnormality with no detectable consequences. Subnormal/mild neutropenia should not be regarded as a contraindication to use ATDs, and clinicians should know that treating hyperthyroidism they have a significant chance to normalize ANC too.

Gershel, MD, FAAP, Daniel A. Rauch, MD, FAAP, FHM. Download citation file: Neutropenia may be transient, chronic, isolated, or part of a systemic disorder. It is defined by an absolute neutrophil count below the normal reference range for a patient's age and is stratified by clinical significance.

In general, an ANC between 1, 000 and 1, 500 cells/μL is considered mild neutropenia, 500 to 1, 000 cells/μL is moderate, and less than 500 cells/μL is severe. Mild and moderate neutropenia are usually managed in the outpatient setting. Severe neutropenia carries a significant risk of infection, although the ANC is only used to measure peripherally circulating neutrophils and does not always reflect the marginated pools.

### How to approach neutropenia [^de67e2d9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is defined as the reduction in the absolute number of neutrophils in the blood circulation. Acute neutropenia is a relatively frequent finding, whereas disorders of production of neutrophils are quite rare. Acute neutropenia is often well tolerated and normalizes rapidly. Neutropenia arising as a result of underlying hematologic disorders is far more significant. Such a patient may be at risk for infectious complications and will likely require a thorough investigation. Acute neutropenia evolves over a few days and occurs when neutrophil use is rapid and production is impaired. Chronic neutropenia may last for 3 months or longer and is a result of reduced production, increased destruction, or excessive splenic sequestration of neutrophils. Neutropenia may be classified by whether it arises secondarily to causes extrinsic to BM myeloid cells, which is common; as an acquired disorder of myeloid progenitor cells, which is less frequent; or as an intrinsic defect arising from impaired proliferation and maturation of myeloid progenitor cells in the BM, which is rare. Severe neutropenia with absolute neutrophil counts below 500/μL increases susceptibility to bacterial or fungal infections. Multiple disorders of severe congenital neutropenia have been found by the discovery of genetic defects affecting differentiation, adhesion, and apoptosis of neutrophil precursors. Elucidation of the multiple genetic defects have provided insight into the biology of the cell involving membrane structures, secretory vesicles, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as the risk for myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.

### Outcomes for patients with severe chronic neutropenia treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [^233bb3a6]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

G-CSF treatment, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts

Because the patients had ANCs < 0.5 × 10 9 /L and many had recurrent fevers and infections, most were treated with G-CSF for very long periods. Interruptions in G-CSF treatment predictably led to reversion of the ANC to its baseline for most patients and recurrence of the same symptoms and problems that led to treatment. The median ANCs with ranges at the time of enrollment in the SCNIR for each group, pediatric and adult, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The high counts that extend the ranges probably reflected severe infections. G-CSF median treatment doses and responses are also presented in Tables 2 and 3. For patients on alternate-day or other than daily treatment, the doses were the calculated median daily dose.

Table 3.
ANC * and ALC † before and on G-CSF treatment

Many patients came to the SCNIR with histories of treatment with diverse therapies, particularly in the early years of SCNIR, including prophylactic antibiotics and glucocorticosteroids. It is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies and their combinations, but it appears that they offered little benefit and possible risks to these patients.

Table 3 shows ANC and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) values for each patient category. Notably, the congenital group had the lowest pre-G-CSF neutrophil counts, and this difference was statistically significant compared with all groups (ANOVA, P = 0.006). The mean G-CSF dose was highest in the congenital group, though this was only statistically significant compared with the cyclic and autoimmune/idiopathic groups (ANOVA; P < .0001). On G-CSF, the mean and median ANC increased in all groups.

Lymphocyte counts were generally within normal limits, but adult patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia had lower ALCs than the other patient groups (t test; P < .0001). For patients with autoimmune/idiopathic neutropenia in SCNIR, none of the patients who developed a lymphoproliferative disorder had lymphocytosis or a diagnosis of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia at enrollment.

As previously reported, patients with congenital neutropenia often have moderate thrombocytosis, which reverts to normal on G-CSF. In many cases, the mild anemia associated with severe chronic neutropenia reverted toward normal if infections and chronic inflammation resolve.

### Afebrile chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: an international survey spots oncologists' routine clinical practice versus the standard of care and the impact of COVID-19 [^a45a3c59]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a common chemotherapy-related side effect; it is evident at the lab level with no specific symptoms in majority of cases, while the red flag is fever. Neutropenia increases the risk of morbidity and mortality, and it affects treatment efficacy by delays and dose reduction of subsequent chemotherapy cycles. The grades of neutropenia include mild with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) that is less than 1500 cells/mm 3, moderate with ANC less than 1000 cells/mm 3, and severe neutropenia with ANC less than 500 cells/mm 3. Febrile neutropenia, when the patient has neutropenia with an oral temperature of ≥ 38.0 °C, results in high morbidity and mortality rates. Factors that raise the risk of febrile neutropenia include chemotherapy protocols, patient comorbidities, and disease stage. The EORTC, ASCO, and the NCCN guidelines have identified the neutropenia risk for different protocols of conventional and dose dense regimens. The chemotherapy regimens triage cancer patients to either the high-risk group (> 20% risk of FN), intermediate-risk group (10–20% risk), or the low-risk group (< 10% risk). Advanced age (> 65) years old and comorbidities like liver dysfunction and cardiac problems are the most common patients' related risk factors, while the advanced stage of cancer and hematological malignancies are the disease risk factors of concern. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) is the cornerstone of the primary and secondary prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia as it reduces the risk of mortality and infection. The prophylactic use of GCSF has a cost-effective value by reducing the frequency of hospitalization due to repeated infection. Studies showed deviations from guidelines in the management of febrile and afebrile neutropenia. The current situation of COVID-19 pandemic tops up the uncertainties about the indication of the GCSF in patients receiving chemotherapy.

This questionnaire represents an international collaboration of oncologists practicing in Egypt, Morocco, Azerbaijan, and Russia to evaluate the current practice of the use of G-CSF at the international level and the impact of the current pandemic on it.

### Differences in neutrophil counts between African and non-African countries in 2 international clinical trials [^b6e97202]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Differences in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between African and non-African populations have been reported. Neutropenia has also been reported during rifamycin use. ANC values in current tables that assign severity grades to clinical or laboratory events (The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS [DAIDS]) might not consistently be applicable among different populations.

Methods

During two international tuberculosis treatment trials, 337 participants received rifampin, and three groups of 361, 81, and 81 participants received 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg of rifapentine, respectively, for two months of daily treatment. ANC was measured at baseline, and after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. CTCAE versions 2.0–4.0 and DAIDS version 2.0 define neutropenia grade 3 as ANC 500–999/mm3 and ANC 400–599/mm3, respectively. We analyzed factors associated with neutropenia.

Results

Baseline median ANC was lower in Black African participants than in Black non-African participants (p = 0.004). CTCAE-defined ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 32 (28 in Africa) participants. Proportions did not differ between rifapentine doses. Only 4 events would have been reported by DAIDS criteria. All neutropenia events resolved spontaneously without interrupting treatment. Enrollment in an African country was an independent factor associated with the development of neutropenia.

Discussion

Differences in baseline median ANC can result in misclassification of adverse events or inappropriate clinical management. Development and use of population-specific normal values of ANC could improve guidance for research and clinical management.

### Outcomes of isolated neutropenia referred to pediatric hematology-oncology clinic [^e797090f]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with isolated neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 1500/μL) are frequently referred to pediatric hematology and oncology clinics for further diagnostic evaluation. Scant literature exists on interventions and outcomes for isolated neutropenia. We hypothesized that children will have resolution of their neutropenia without the need for intervention(s) by a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.

Methods

We performed a 5.5-year institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of children referred to our pediatric hematology and oncology clinics for isolated neutropenia. Neutropenia was categorized as mild (ANC of 1001–1500/μL), moderate (ANC of 500–1000 μL), severe (ANC of 201–500/μL), or very severe (ANC of ≤ 200/μL).

Results

Among 155 children referred with isolated neutropenia, 45 (29%) had mild neutropenia, 65 (42%) had moderate neutropenia, 30 (19%) had severe neutropenia, and 15 (10%) had very severe neutropenia. Only 29 (19%) children changed to an ANC category lower than their initial referral category. At a median follow-up of 12 months, 101 children had resolution of neutropenia, 40 children had mild neutropenia, 10 children had moderate neutropenia, 3 children had severe neutropenia, and 1 patient had very severe neutropenia. A specific diagnosis was not identified in most (54%) children. The most common etiologies were viral suppression (16%), autoimmune neutropenia (14%), and drug-induced neutropenia (8%). Black children had a 3.5 higher odds of having persistent mild neutropenia. Six (4%) children received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy.

Conclusions

Most children referred for isolated neutropenia do not progress in severity and do not require subspecialty interventions or hospitalizations.

### Deferiprone and idiosyncrasic neutropenia: light and shadow [^0422b00d]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Badawy et aladdress the issue of neutropenia and its associated long-term infection risks in a large cohort of patients treated with deferiprone (DFP) for iron overload.

Iron chelation, for the management of red blood cell disorders, is of global importance, affecting a significant proportion of transfusion-dependent diseases recently impacted by migration fluxes and now constituting major public health problems, for example, thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Historically, injectable deferoxamine (DFO) has been the standard drug of choice for iron chelation, with proven efficacy and a minimal side effect profile, but limited by compliance. Introduction of the oral iron chelators DFP, taken 3 times daily, and deferasirox (DFX), taken once daily, in dispersible tablet or film-coated tablet forms, has improved compliance while providing iron chelation efficacy comparable to DFO for mild-to-moderate iron overload.

In high iron overload, DFP alone or in combination with DFO or DFX, shows greater improvement in cardiac iron, reduced iron-related cardiac morbidity, and reduced mortality, but its use is limited by "black spot", neutropenia.

In a study of patients receiving DFP for nearly 30 years, Badawy et al evaluated the incidence of idiosyncratic neutropenia (IDIN) and severity of infections, according to the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) thresholds.

Using the recent Neutropenia Guidelines, defined as mild (ANC, 1.0 × 10 9 /L to 1.5 × 10 9 /L), moderate (ANC, 0.5 × 10 9 /L to 1.0 × 10 9 /L), severe (ANC, 0.2 × 10 9 /L to 0.5 × 10 9 /L), or very severe/agranulocytosis (ANC, < 0.2 × 10 9 /L), they found the infectious risk was inversely correlated with neutrophil count. Those with the most serious or lethal events occurred at ANC thresholds of < 0.2 × 10 9 /L or < 0.1 × 10 9 /L, respectively.

### The timing and severity of clozapine-associated neutropenia in the US: is the risk overstated? [^17fd27d8]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Concern about clozapine-associated neutropenia contributes to clozapine's underutilization and racial disparities in access. People with African ancestry are more likely to have lower normative absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), associated with the Duffy null genetic polymorphism. Recent data on clozapine-associated neutropenia in the US are lacking.

Methods

Patients prescribed clozapine in the Johns Hopkins Medicine electronic medical record (EMR) between 2013 and 2023 were identified. Duffy null Associated Neutrophil Count (DANC) was assigned if there were two ANC's < 2000 cells/μL, > 30 days apart, before starting clozapine. Rates of neutropenia, timing of first neutropenia, and demographic differences were explored.

Results

974 received clozapine and had ANC's available, with 63.9% male, 51.1% White, and 39% Black. 287 were presumed to start clozapine during the study period, and were 62.4% male, 46% White, and 44.9% Black. No patients developed severe neutropenia. 59 (6.1%) developed mild or moderate neutropenia. 19 (6.6%) new starts had presumed DANC, and none developed neutropenia. 11 of 16 presumed new starts who developed neutropenia did so within eight months. No demographic differences were found between groups for presumed new starts. For non-new starts, where DANC assignment was not possible, Black patients were more likely than White patients to develop neutropenia (OR 3.48, 95% CI [1.65, 7.73]).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first observational study of clozapine-associated neutropenia in the US in the past decade, and it includes a substantial proportion of Black patients. ANC monitoring requirements may be too strict, contributing to clozapine underutilization.

### When non-whiteness becomes a condition [^4ad8291b]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

The term "benign ethnic neutropenia" describes the phenotype of having an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/μL with no increased risk of infection. It is most commonly seen in those of African ancestry. In addition, ANC reference ranges from countries in Africa emphasize that ANC levels < 1500 cells/μL are common and harmless. The lower ANC levels are driven by the Duffy null [Fy(a-b-)] phenotype, which is protective against malaria and seen in 80% to 100% of those of sub-Saharan African ancestry and < 1% of those of European descent. Benign ethnic neutropenia is clinically insignificant, but the average ANC values differ from what are typically seen in those of European descent. Thus, the predominantly White American medical system has described this as a condition. This labeling implicitly indicates that common phenotypes in non-White populations are abnormal or wrong. We believe that it is important to examine and rectify practices in hematology that contribute to systemic racism.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^fbcd0760]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Risks and toxicities

Because the intention of hydroxyurea therapy is to achieve mild myelosuppression, the main potential risks of treatment are cytopenias. Indeed, leukocyte and platelet counts will be lower than pre-treatment values. These cells can form multicellular aggregates with adhesive sickle erythrocytes to promote vaso-occlusion, so their reduction is likely a therapeutic mechanism beyond HbF induction. There is no evidence that hydroxyurea increases the risk of infection because of the intended modest reduction in ANC. Indeed, there is evidence that the risk of infections may actually be decreased with hydroxyurea therapy at optimal dosing in low-resource settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of under-treating this serious and morbid disease should be balanced against prescribers' fears, often unnecessarily grave, about mild-moderate neutropenia. Certainly, if there is severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5x10 9 /L), then hydroxyurea should be stopped temporarily, and the usual precautions and considerations about neutropenia apply. The most common and recurring scenario is that ANC falls to 0.75–1.0x10 9 /L, usually because of intercurrent infections. Rather than stopping effective treatment, it is reasonable to continue the hydroxyurea without a dose reduction with repeat blood counts in 1–2 weeks. If there is persistent moderate neutropenia, then a dose reduction may be needed (Table 2).

Initiation of hydroxyurea early in life delays splenic involution. While the preservation of splenic tissue is immunologically beneficial, it can result in chronic splenomegaly and may extend the risk period for splenic sequestration. Some children have chronically lower blood counts with splenomegaly. This is due to hypersplenism and not drug toxicity. For these children, dose optimization can be challenging, and patient-specific toxicity criteria may be considered (e.g. continue hydroxyurea unless ANC < 0.8x10 9 /L or platelets < 80x10 9 /L).

Many individuals with SCA will also have the common, normal Duffy-null associated neutrophil count (DANC). DANC does not increase the risk of bacterial infection but often lowers the ANC below neutropenia thresholds derived from individuals of European ancestry. The impact of DANC on hydroxyurea therapy in SCA has not been studied prospectively, but published data for African-American children do not suggest a substantial effect.

### Supportive therapies in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and appropriate use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors: a Delphi consensus statement [^7b3d554a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is the most frequent side effect and a significant clinical problem for patients undergoing chemotherapy with anticancer/myelosuppressive drugs. The Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute defines four grades of neutropenia based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC): grade 1, ANC ≥ 1.5 to < 2 × 10 9 /L; grade 2, ≥ 1.0 to < 1.5 × 10 9 /L; grade 3, ≥ 0.5 to < 1.0 × 10 9 /L; grade 4, < 0.5 × 10 9 /L.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most significant complication of neutropenia constituting an oncological emergency and is defined as the appearance of fever (oral temperature > 38.3 °C or two consecutive readings of > 38.0 °C for 2 h) or clinical signs of sepsis in a patient with a neutrophil count of < 0.5 × 10 9 /L (< 500/mm 3) or < 1.0 × 10 9 /L (< 1000/mm 3) prenadir. Since obtaining oral temperature measurements at the peak or every 2 h can be challenging in severely ill patients, a lower oral temperature (38 °C) sustained for 1 h can be considered FN. The incidence of FN varies between 2 and 50% depending on patient-related risk factors (e.g. age, neutropenia, major comorbidities, liver or kidney dysfunction, poor performance status, other concurrent immunosuppression or other reasons for compromised bone marrow function), cancer type, chemotherapy regimen (e.g. planned full dose intensity > 85%), and genetic susceptibility, which also influences its clinical outcome. While most patients experience mild episodes, the rate of serious complications (25–30%) and mortality (9–12%) remains elevated in high-risk groups. Furthermore, FN-related mortality is higher in patients requiring intensive care unit-level therapy and in those who develop pneumonia. Owing to the heterogeneity of FN, various decision-making models have been established for the management of patients at the onset of FN. Management options include the prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) and the selective use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents.

### Dental extraction in the neutropenic patient [^9c65e1c7]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify risks of dental extraction in patients with mild, moderate, and severe neutropenia.

Materials and Methods

The authors undertook an observational study of 116 patients diagnosed with neutropenia and undergoing dental extractions in the Mayo Clinic Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was no higher than 1,500/μL. Predictors were ANC, age, diagnosis, number of teeth removed, type and location of extraction, length of antibiotic use, presence and type of bacteremia at the time of consultation or extraction, reason for consultation, indication for extraction, and use of any granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Primary outcomes were total complications, surgical site infections, delayed healing, and prolonged postoperative pain. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were undertaken, with statistical significance set at a P value less than or equal to .05.

Results

One hundred sixteen patients underwent extraction while neutropenic. The overall complication rate was 8.6% (n = 10). All were minor complications requiring simple interventions, if any. Complications were delayed healing, surgical site infection, and prolonged postoperative pain. Delayed healing was not associated with ANC. GCSF and related medications did not appear to affect outcomes in these patients.

Conclusion

The results of this preliminary study suggest that extraction of teeth in patients at all stages of neutropenia can be conducted safely. Complications of extraction were few and should be easily controlled. Further studies are required to clarify and stratify risk for future patients.

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^f144df22]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The newly published consensus-based guidelines by the EHA/EuNet-INNOCHRON COST suggest that severe chronic neutropenias with ANCs < 0.2 × 10 9 /L might be termed "agranulocytosis" and are associated with a high risk of severe, life-threatening infections. In addition, some clinicians use an ANC threshold of < 0.1 × 10 9 /L to denote agranulocytosis with the highest risk for infection. Here, we have provided clinical evidence for supporting a lower ANC threshold than the previously used < 0.5 × 10 9 /L to define agranulocytosis. However, due to the diurnal variations in ANCs and other causes of ANC variability together with lack of precision in measuring very low ANC levels, it is less relevant to differentiate between sharp ANC cutoffs of 0.1 × 10 9 /L or 0.2 × 10 9 /L. Therefore, we suggest that the term agranulocytosis may be used for severe IDIN with ANCs < 0.2 × 10 9 /L, as suggested by the EHA/EuNet-INNOCHRON COST.

### Clinical and immunological features in ACKR1 / DARC-associated neutropenia [^8a847535]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ACKR1 /DARC -associated neutropenia (NP), ADAN, previously called ethnic benign NP (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), is an inherited NP considered to be mild to moderate and not associated with an increased disposition for bacterial infections. This is in contrast to severe congenital NPs (SCNPs) caused by ELANE or HAX1 mutations, in which such infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality.SCNPs also show a propensity to transform into myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute leukemia, but data on MDS/leukemia in ADAN are lacking.

ADAN, prevalent in Africa and the Near/Middle East and in the descendants of these populations worldwide, is due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of the ACKR1/DARC gene (rs2814778). This SNP is also linked to the Duffy null trait and is associated with protection against Plasmodium vivax and P knowlesi infections.,

In 2017, Duchene et alsuggested that the ACKR1/DARC SNP is associated with enhanced neutrophil transendothelial migration and subsequent accumulation in tissues, for example, the spleen. Moreover, ADAN neutrophils showed increased surface expression of CD16 and some serum molecules involved in neutrophil migration, for example, matrix metallopeptidase 9. Hence, it was hypothesized that ADAN may not be a true NP but rather an altered neutrophil compartmentalization and that neutrophils were activated, suggesting an autoimmune/inflammatory propensity.

Here, we sought answers to the questions raised by these findings. The issues concerned the clinical presentations and associated immune reactions in ADAN.

First, we assessed whether blood absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were in mild or moderate NP ranges (1.0–1.6 and 0.5 × 10 9–0.99 × 10 9 /L, respectively), as previously suggested, or whether lower ANCs (< 0.5 × 10 9 /L) could occur, as proposed in serologically diagnosed subjects with ADAN. This is important to know to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures, for example, bone marrow examination (BMEs). Conversely, if ADAN ANCs were within the reference values used in Sweden, for example, due to transient inflammatory reactions, it is also of significance because it may obscure the ADAN diagnosis. Consequently, the range and variability of ANCs need re-evaluation in genetically defined individuals with ADAN.

### How I manage children with neutropenia [^6aa3f21f]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, usually defined as a blood neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10 9 /l, is a common medical problem for children and adults. There are many causes for neutropenia, and at each stage in life the clinical pattern of causes and consequences differs significantly. I recommend utilizing the age of the child and clinical observations for the preliminary diagnosis and primary management. In premature infants, neutropenia is quite common and contributes to the risk of sepsis with necrotizing enterocolitis. At birth and for the first few months of life, neutropenia is often attributable to isoimmune or alloimmune mechanisms and predisposes to the risk of severe bacterial infections. Thereafter when a child is discovered to have neutropenia, often associated with relatively minor symptoms, it is usually attributed to autoimmune disorder or viral infection. The congenital neutropenia syndromes are usually recognized when there are recurrent infections, the neutropenia is severe and there are congenital anomalies suggesting a genetic disorder.

### Diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for the neutropenic patient [^0f86821a]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Determining the cause of a low neutrophil count in a pediatric or adult patient is essential for the hematologist's clinical decision-making. Fundamental to this diagnostic process is establishing the presence or lack of a mature neutrophil storage pool, as absence places the patient at higher risk for infection and the need for supportive care measures. Many diagnostic tests, eg, a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy, remain important tools, but greater understanding of the diversity of neutropenic disorders has added new emphasis on evaluating for immune disorders and genetic testing. In this article, a structure is provided to assess patients based on the mechanism of neutropenia and to prioritize testing based on patient age and hypothesized pathophysiology. Common medical quandaries including fever management, need for growth factor support, risk of malignant transformation, and curative options in congenital neutropenia are reviewed to guide medical decision-making in neutropenic patients.

### How we evaluate and treat neutropenia in adults [^29916fd9]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Isolated neutropenia is a common clinical problem seen by primary care physicians and hematologists. The evaluation of neutropenia is dictated by the acuity of the clinical presentation and the duration, age, and clinical status of the patient. In this review, we provide a practical approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with neutropenia, with the major focus on the evaluation of neutropenia in the outpatient setting.

Skin and soft tissue infections in cancer patients with neutropenia — assessment recommendations emphasize episode classification, tissue diagnosis, risk stratification, and extent-of-infection workup. Determine whether the current presentation of fever and neutropenia is the patient's initial episode, persistent unexplained fever after 4–7 days, or a subsequent recurrent episode (strong, low). Aggressively determine the etiology by aspiration and/or biopsy of lesions and submit material for thorough cytological/histological assessments. Risk-stratify patients: high-risk are those with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 100 cells/μL) or a Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score of < 21; low-risk are those with anticipated brief (< 7 days) neutropenia and few comorbidities (strong, low) or a MASCC score of ≥ 21 (strong, moderate). Determine the extent of infection via thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging (including chest CT) as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (strong, low).

### A study indicates an essential link between a mild deterioration in excretory kidney function and the risk of neutropenia during cancer chemotherapy [^c770d22f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia refers to a decreased number of circulating neutrophils in peripheral blood. Under such a condition, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) lowers below 1500 cells/μm 3. There are several causes of neutropenia, including genetics and autoimmune diseases. However, the most common form of this complication is drug-induced. The estimated incidence of drug-induced neutropenia in the general population in Europe is between 1.6 and 9.2 cases per million/per year. In the USA, it is between 2.4 and 15.4 cases per million/per year. Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) appears to be of great clinical significance, particularly in oncological patients. This complication commonly leads to febrile neutropenia (FN) in this group of patients. The latter condition impacts the dosage of chemotherapeutics or the choice of treatment schedule. In Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), FN comprises a disorder characterized by an ANC lower than 1000/μm 3 and a single rise in temperature above 38.3 °C (101 °F) or a sustained temperature ≥ 38 °C (100.4 °F) for more than 1 h. In the USA, FN occurs in 7.83 cases per 1000 subjects treated for cancer. The mortality rate in patients with solid tumors that developed FN ranges from 2.6 to 7.0%.

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^95d0702d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of CLOZARIL-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of CLOZARIL treatment. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL treatment or during treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout CLOZARIL treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during CLOZARIL treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia.

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^29c90fdc]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our analysis has demonstrated that lower ANC thresholds of < 0.2 × 10 9 /L or < 0.1 × 10 9 /L are clinically relevant to define deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis associated with a higher risk of serious infections. By using these lower thresholds, clinicians may be able to better assess the risk associated with deferiprone use. Although the idiosyncratic nature of deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis is not a reliable predictor of the ANC trend or the duration of the event, a proactive approach to detecting early signs of infection is recommended for all patients regardless of the severity of neutropenia. Furthermore, this potential change in risk stratification and definition of agranulocytosis may help to improve patients' access to adequate chelation regimens, leading to lower iron overload and better clinical outcomes.

### Mutations are enriched in myelodysplastic syndrome patients with severe neutropenia and can be a potential for targeted therapy [^319eb9ff]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of neoplastic bone marrow failure diseases. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) is the most widely used prognostic scoring system to tailor therapy for MDS patients. The IPSS-R incorporated severe neutropenia (SN) defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.8x10 9 /L as a prognostic variable. Among MDS patients (pts), 18% had ANC < 0.8x10 9 /L. Current treatment guidelines recommend considering hypomethylating agents or immunosuppressive therapy for treating MDS pts with neutropenia with low neutrophil response reported in clinical studies (< 10–20%). Recurrent infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MDS pts. Identification of the genomic landscape of MDS pts with SN is crucial given the large unmet clinical need in this patient population which may assist identifying potential targeted therapy.

IDH somatic mutations (MT) are described in 8–12% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and MDS. These recurrent MT in key metabolic enzymes lead to the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which promotes leukemogenesis through a block in normal myeloid differentiation. Selective oral inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 have subsequently been developed and are now approved for AMLand are under investigation for MDS.

We analyzed all MDS pts treated at Moffitt Cancer Center with known ANC values around time of diagnosis and who had next-generation sequencing (NGS) as part of routine clinical care using standard Illumina platform as previously described. We defined SN around time of diagnosis for the purpose of this study according to the IPSS-R cut-off (ANC 0.8x10 9 /L) and stratified pts into two groups based on this definition.

### Etiology and natural history of neutropenia in human immunodeficiency virus disease: a prospective study [^9f014620]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this prospective, observational study was to define the natural history of neutropenia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Eighty-seven consecutive patients developing neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], < 1000 cells/mm(3)) were recruited and closely followed for the duration of the episode. Episodes lasted a median of 13 days, with a mean ANC nadir of 660 cells/mm(3). Presumed or proven infection occurred in 12 (17%) of 71 evaluable subjects, and culture-proven infection occurred only in 6 (8%) of 71. Most of the episodes of neutropenia were brief, mild to moderate in nadir, and self-limiting without complications. Myelosuppressive therapies were implicated in almost all episodes. Serious infections occurred infrequently and were associated with low ANC nadirs but not with duration of the neutropenic episode. Low CD4(+) cell counts also increased the risk of infection complicating an episode of neutropenia.

### Severe neutropenia in dengue patients: prevalence and significance [^2fa7e8cc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Studies on severe neutropenia in dengue are scarce, and its clinical significance is uncertain. We analyzed a cohort of 1,921 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to the Communicable Disease Center in Singapore between 2005 and 2008. Time trend analyses for daily absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were done using Bayesian hierarchical and Markov models. We found that severe neutropenia, defined as ANC ≤ 0.5 × 10(9)/L, was found in 11.8% with a median duration of 1 day. ANC nadir occurred on illness day 5. Severe neutropenia was not predictive of more severe disease and not associated with secondary bacterial infections, prolonged hospital stay, prolonged fever, or fatal outcome. We concluded that prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated in patients with severe neutropenia without indication for bacterial infection.

### Asenapine [^0568f356]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including asenapine. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of asenapine at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue asenapine in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Evaluation of the safety of clozapine use in patients with benign neutropenia [^f4ea99bf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if clozapine can be safely utilized in psychiatric patients with benign neutropenia.

Methods

A single-center, retrospective chart review study of records from 2001 to 2014 was conducted in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Patients included had benign neutropenia prior to receiving clozapine and received clozapine using modified monitoring guidelines. All available laboratory values for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before initiation and during treatment were evaluated. The primary endpoint was difference in ANC after initiation of clozapine from before clozapine.

Results

A total of 26 patients were reviewed. The mean age at clozapine initiation was 34 years. The majority were African-American (73% [n = 19]), with more men than women (73% [n = 19] vs 27% [n = 7]). The mean lowest ANC value was not significantly different after clozapine initiation compared to before (1.5× 10³ cells/mm³ and 1.4 × 10³ cells/mm³, respectively; P = 0.22). The overall mean ANC was significantly higher after initiation than before (2.63 × 10³ cells/mm³ and 2.13 × 10³ cells/mm³, respectively; P < .001). There were no cases of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10³ cells/mm³), and no patient was discontinued for falling below modified guideline limits. There were fewer occurrences of mild neutropenia (ANC < 2.0 × 10³ cells/mm³) after clozapine initiation than before (16.0% and 31.4%, respectively; P < .001). There were also fewer occurrences of moderate neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 × 10³ cells/mm³), with 2.1% after clozapine and 13.3% before (P < .001).

Conclusions

Twenty-six patients with benign neutropenia were safely treated with clozapine. Pre-clozapine neutropenia did not predict increased risk for severe neutropenia with clozapine. Patients had significantly fewer episodes of mild and moderate neutropenia after receiving clozapine compared to before.

Efficacy and safety assessments

The primary efficacy endpoint was the duration of moderate and severe neutropenia during Cycle 1, defined as the number of days in which the patient had an ANC < 1.0 × 10 9 /L during Cycle 1.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the duration of moderate and severe neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 × 10 9 /L) in Cycles 2–4, the duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10 9 /L) in each cycle, the incidence rates of febrile neutropenia in each cycle, the time in days to ANC recovery post nadir (recovery defined as an ANC ≥ 2.0 × 10 9 /L after the expected ANC nadir) in each cycle, and the depth of the ANC nadir in each cycle.

Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations. AEs of special interest included febrile neutropenia, injection site reactions, and infections.

AEs and SAEs were collected from the date of informed consent until 30 days after the completion of the study. AEs were classified by system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 17.1. The severity of AEs was graded based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. Relationships between AEs and the study treatments were determined by the site Investigators.

All laboratory tests used for statistical analyses were performed by a designated central laboratory to ensure consistent measurements throughout the study duration.

### Clozapine [^60ac3c96]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Two separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general population, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.

Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)

Obtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with clozapine to ensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/μL) and to permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater than (≥)1500/μL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate treatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of treatment. If a patient's ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the first 6 months of treatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/μL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy, ANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.

Clozapine Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table 3)

Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average ANC values are lower than "standard" laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly observed in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25 to 50%), some Middle Eastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more common in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid maturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at increased risk for developing clozapine-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be needed to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation before initiating or during clozapine treatment as necessary.

### Predicting microbiologically defined infection in febrile neutropenic episodes in children: global individual participant data multivariable meta-analysis [^ce077eb5]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The final multivariable predictive model had six simple components: tumour type, temperature, clinical description of being 'severely unwell' and the results of measurements of haemoglobin concentration, total white cell count and AMC. It showed moderate discrimination (AUROC 0.723, 95% CI 0.711–0.759) and good calibration between predicted and actual estimates of the risk of MDI when assessed across the range of predictive values. The model was robust to bootstrap and cross-validation sensitivity analyses, and built by adding specialist investigations only after considering the simpler pieces of information, ensuring that if extra tests with additional costs are required, they are shown to add predictive power to existing variables.

The prediction model developed contained five items which showed consistent relationships across the different study groups (type of malignancy, temperature, unwellness, AMC and total white cell count) and one item (haemoglobin) that was less consistent. The heterogeneity in this item makes it difficult to tell if the inclusion of haemoglobin would be applicable in alternative data sets and subsequently in clinical practice.

The inclusion of clinical impression of the child being significantly unwell as a predictive variable is controversial. The clinical impression of a trained physician is held by some to be of great importance, and by others as unhelpfully subjective and poorly reproducible. Previous investigators have demonstrated objective replicability in paediatric oncology practice, and shown its value in predicting infectious risk in children without an oncological diagnosis(;) and it is a key element of the widely used (adult) low-risk scoring system of the Multinational Supportive Care in Cancer organisation. We believe that our analysis supports the use of this variable as providing additional useful information above the objective elements of 'vital signs' and full blood count in routine practice.

The value of using both total white count and AMC, rather than one of these items or absolute neutrophil count (ANC), was assessed during the model building. The use of AMC improved AIC (model fit), discrimination and calibration compared with ANC, as did the additional use of total white count. While this appears to contradict the common understanding of how neutrophil counts most importantly indicate the risk of infection — the clinical situation is defined as 'neutropenic sepsis', not 'monocytopenic sepsis' — this analysis confirms data from multiple prior investigations. The finding may be explained physiologically by both the neutrophil response to infection and the observed pattern of marrow recovery after chemotherapy, with monocytes preceding neutrophils.

### Ethnic benign neutropenia: a phenomenon finds an explanation [^32cba285]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Ethnic benign neutropenia (ENP) is the most common form of neutropenia (NP) worldwide, if an absolute blood neutrophil count (ANC) of < 1.5 G/L is used as definition. In 2009, ENP was associated with a gene variation in the ACKR1/DARC gene, the same variation that also confers the Duffy-null trait. In 2017, a novel mechanism for ENP was introduced, questioning if ENP is a true neutropenic state, when the body's total neutrophil count (TBNC) is concerned. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of ENP, asking (1) How well does the peripheral blood ANC predict the TBNC? (2) Can we improve methods for assessing TBNC? (3) Will estimates of TBNC predict infection propensity and reduce the need for further, costly workup?

### White blood cell ranges and frequency of neutropenia by duffy genotype status [^c9cceb55]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Observed ranges for WBC counts (A) and ANC (B) by age group and genotype. Ranges are based on the first or minimum measurement for each participant. The median, 2.5th, and 97.5th percentile thresholds correspond to the overall distribution of values within the indicated population subset.

Lower average WBC counts among individuals of African vs European ancestries is well established. The lower WBC counts among individuals of African ancestry has sometimes led to a generalization that individuals of Black race have "low" WBC counts, colloquially described as "benign ethnic neutropenia". Delineation of the molecular basis of this phenomenon has demonstrated that only the subset of individuals who carry the Duffy-null (CC) RBC genotype are expected to have lower counts. However, despite awareness of the Duffy phenotype, a lack of well-defined genotype-specific reference ranges contributes to uncertainty in the interpretation of laboratory measurements and consequent health inequities that disproportionately impact individuals of Black race.

### Understanding the treatment options for neutropenia… [^98be29ff]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are essential for fighting infection. Neutropenia, or low levels of neutrophils, is a common disorder usually caused by chemotherapy, adverse drug reactions or autoimmune disorders. Severe neutropenia, or agranulocytosis, is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per μL. Munshi and Montgomery used information obtained through a MEDLINE search for their review. Management and evaluation of neutropenia should depend on the severity of the neutropenia and on the presence of symptoms suggesting infection. Patients with severe neutropenia with fever or signs of infection and those with evidence of malignant disease should be hospitalized. The cause of neutropenia should be determined, potential sources of infection evaluated and antibiotic therapy started. The diagnostic evaluation includes history of prior infection, a review of prior blood counts and exploration for evidence of infection or rheumatologic conditions.

Patients with mild neutropenia and no evidence of infection may be monitored with blood cell counts for six to eight weeks. Neutropenia in children is likely to be benign and often resolves without intervention. Laboratory tests include microscopic examination of a peripheral blood smear, appropriate cultures and specific chemical, bacteriologic and viral studies, and serologic testing for collagen vascular disease. Bone marrow aspiration is needed when the cause of neutropenia is not clear, when the neutropenia does not resolve or if there is evidence of multiple cytopenias. The types of neutropenia are listed in the accompanying table. Neutropenia is more likely to be acquired than congenital, with the most common cause being a drug reaction that causes direct marrow suppression or immune destruction of the neutrophil or myeloid precursors. Viral infection is another common cause of neutropenia, related to bone marrow suppression or peripheral destruction.

Acute bacterial infections, notably salmonellosis, brucellosis, pertussis, tuberculosis and rickettsial infections, can cause neutropenia. Collagen vascular disease can feature neutropenia. Benign hematopoietic disease, including vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies, can cause neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Malignant hematopoietic diseases such as leukemia and multiple myeloma may cause neutropenia by suppressing normal myelopoiesis.

### Pegfilgrastim for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia in multiple myeloma [^8b0e4c8e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia and FN in multiple myeloma

Neutropenia is defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) as any decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1500/mm 3, where moderate and severe neutropenia (grade 3–4) are defined as an ANC < 1000–500/mm 3 and < 500/mm 3, respectively (CTCAE version 5.0). Moderate and severe neutropenia, especially if prolonged, can lead to FN, with ANC < 1000/mm 3 and a single temperature of > 38.3 °C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38 °C (100.4°F) for more than 1 h (CTCAE version 5.0). A direct correlation between a reduced number of neutrophil cells and an increased risk of infection (mainly bacterial and fungal) in MM patients is a fundamental problem in clinical practice. Although neutropenia-related infections can, in themselves, be a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, they may also lead to a delay in the administration of chemotherapy, thus affecting the treatment efficacy and the final clinical outcome. Neutropenia in MM, as in other malignancies, is mainly due to the immunosuppressive and immunomodulating effect of treatment (also novel non-conventional chemotherapeutic compounds) and to the damage caused to mucosal barriers. In addition, MM patients are often immunocompromised by the malfunctioning of immunocompetent cells (B, T, and dendritic cells) caused by clonal plasma cell expansion, constitutional immunosuppression (elderly and frail patients), and intensive and prolonged corticosteroid treatment. In the era of immunomodulating agents, the incidence of infections, especially of bacterial and viral etiology, seems to follow a pattern with two major peaks: at diagnosis/induction and at relapse of disease. A 2015 retrospective evaluation also reported a tenfold higher risk of specific infections, such as pneumonia or septicemia, in the first year after diagnosis of MM, with no major improvements in these rates following the introduction of novel agents. The incidence of neutropenia and FN obviously varies according to the type of treatment regimen adopted. The oldest and/or more aggressive chemotherapeutic agents (or combinations) show the highest rates of severe neutropenia and infections. High-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the treatment recommended for young and fit patients, has severe neutropenia and infection rates up to 77% and 30%, respectively. Other chemotherapeutic combinations used only in highly aggressive disease or in multiple refractory patients, such as VTD-PACE (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone and cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide) or PACE (cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide) show neutropenia rates of 79% and 83%, respectively, and FN rates of 26% and 33%, respectively. Novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and, more recently, pomalidomide (IMiD) are now the backbone of treatment for newly diagnosed and relapsed MM. Neutropenia is one of the most common and predictable adverse events occurring during the use of lenalidomide (along with dexamethasone) and is often managed by treatment discontinuation, dose modulation, and/or G-CSF. The rates of neutropenia and infections from lenalidomide vary according to the dose of dexamethasone and combination compound used, ranging from 32 to 41% and 8 to 22%, respectively. Pomalidomide is a new generation IMiD indicated for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM (rrMM). Like thalidomide, the most evident adverse event associated with pomalidomide is neutropenia (up to 50% of patients), whereas the rate of associated infections (pneumonia) is lower in proportion (about 13%). Pomalidomide is often used in heavily pretreated patients who have highly compromised bone marrow function, thus explaining the higher incidence of neutropenia with respect to lenalidomide. It is manageable with dosage modification or treatment withdrawal, and G-CSF support, especially in the first cycles. The first-in-class PI bortezomib, used in association with dexamethasone or other associated molecules (melphalan, lenalidomide), now plays a key role in both newly diagnosed MM (elegible/not eligible) and refractory/relapsed disease. The rates of severe neutropenia and FN are notably lower than those of IMiD, i.e. up to 11% and < 1%, respectively, with very low rates of treatment discontinuation. Carfilzomib, a second-generation PI approved for use in a rrMM setting, induces grade > 3 neutropenia in around 30% of cases, but this rate is probably related to the lenalidomide (and dexamethasone) associated with the regimen. Ixazomib, a newer, orally available PI combined with lenalidomide-dexamethasone, leads to neutropenia rates of about 22%, with a very low incidence of discontinuation for infections. Daratumumab, a newly available anti-CD38 approved for use in rrMM combined with lenalidomide or bortezomib, shows neutropenia rates of about 52% and 12.8%, respectively. Of note, lenalidomide is the leading cause of neutropenia when comparing two regimens containing or not this IMiD. Finally, elotuzumab, a new generation monoclonal antibody directed against SLAMF7 protein, when administered together with lenalidomide for refractory/relapsed MM, has been shown to induce grade > 3 neutropenia rates of 35.5%. Among the drugs approved for use in MM, all IMID, bortezomib and daratumumab, come with "special warnings" about the development of neutropenia and FN. It can be concluded that the introduction of these so-called novel agents did not reduce the incidence of neutropenia because of the strong intrinsic neutropenic effect of IMiD (lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and also because other novel agents without a significant innate neutropenic innate effect (such as monoclonal antibodies or PI) are often used in combination with IMiD.

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^1bb61e56]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- In patients treated with deferiprone, ANC levels < 0.2 × 10 9 /L conferred the highest risk of serious infections.
- An ANC of < 0.2 × 10 9 /L may be a clinically relevant threshold to define agranulocytosis with a high risk of infection.

### Supportive therapies in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and appropriate use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors: a Delphi consensus statement [^f3c57725]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical impact of FN on patient management (when it affects treatment choices)

The consensus was achieved for five of the eight statements on the clinical impact of FN on patient management (Table 1). It was agreed that the severity of neutropenia was dependent on the intensity of chemotherapy (item 1) and that the chemotherapy regimen should be based on the patient's clinical characteristics and treatment goals after the evaluation of the risk of FN to ensure appropriate treatment (items 2 and 5).

Neutropenia is a dose-limiting side effect of chemotherapy and there is adequate evidence that the severity of neutropenia is dependent on the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen (defined by the type, dose, and number of myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents in a chemotherapy regimen). A highly intensive chemotherapy regimen is expected to cause more severe myelosuppression, resulting in a higher incidence of FN.

Chemotherapy dose and schedule are important clinical variables that can impact patient outcomes, but myelosuppression (mostly FN) drives chemotherapy dose reduction and dose delays. For example, grade 4 neutropenia can result in a 5- to 7-day delay in the next chemotherapy cycle. The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia, or FN, in patients with endometrial cancer was found to be significantly higher with six cycles of chemotherapy compared with four cycles, indicating that patients are likely to benefit from lower haematological toxicity with a shorter duration of chemotherapy. Moreover, patients who develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia during chemotherapy are at increased risk for developing infections and sepsis, which may lead to dose interruptions or dose reductions and may compromise treatment efficacy.

Quantification of the risk associated with patient-related factors and neutropenic events is essential for clinical decision-making as it leads to better clinical outcomes, fewer complications, and closer adherence to treatment protocols. It also prevents patients from being inadequately or unnecessarily treated. Current guidelines suggest assessing FN risk at the start of each chemotherapy cycle in order to prevent or better manage the condition if it arises. A physiological model of granulopoiesis and its regulation has been used to predict ANC time profiles and incidences of neutropenia for chemotherapeutic agents like paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin by incorporating their mechanisms of action. This model can successfully predict individual patient ANC time profiles, which in most patient is a nadir between days 7–14 after the first dose and recovery to grade 2 neutropenia level at the end of cycle one, and could be useful for selecting appropriate therapeutic as well as support strategies for each patient.

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^41e31253]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who experience deferiprone‐induced agranulocytosis are at increased risk of its recurrence on rechallenge, and the second episode is generally more severe 15, 29, 35. Nonetheless, rechallenge might be considered for those patients at risk of death due to iron toxicity and for whom therapy with other chelators has been shown to be ineffective, inadequate, or too toxic.

Fifteen episodes of agranulocytosis with fatal outcome have been reported since 1999, the majority of which show evidence of deficiencies in patient management. The implementation in 2006 of an educational program for health care professionals and patients in Europe was followed by a decline in fatal cases of deferiprone‐related agranulocytosis, suggesting that education may be an important contributor to minimizing risk.

Weekly ANC monitoring in patients treated with deferiprone is a demanding expectation, and may deter some from initiating therapy. While weekly monitoring may seem prudent, this analysis and another study 10 do not support its value in intervening in the occurrence of agranulocytosis or the severity of its consequences. The data evaluated here suggest that most cases of neutropenia do not progress to agranulocytosis, and that the development of agranulocytosis is frequently precipitous and not the outcome of a slow decline in neutrophil count. A normal routine ANC count thus may provide false security, as it does not preclude agranulocytosis occurring shortly afterwards 4. These observations underline the desirability of identifying a better approach to the minimization of the risks associated with agranulocytosis.

In that regard, the panel recommends that patient education should focus on stopping deferiprone therapy at first symptoms of a fever, and that measurement of ANC be conducted within 24 hr. In addition, we support that until novel predictive tools are available, weekly ANC monitoring, despite its shortcomings in terms of detecting an emerging episode of agranulocytosis, be maintained during the first year, but that ANC monitoring thereafter occurs at the time of blood transfusions (typically, every 2–4 weeks).

Our evaluation confirms that patients who experience agranulocytosis must cease taking deferiprone. The need to discontinue therapy at manifestation of mild to moderate neutropenia is less clear. Continuation of therapy may be reasonable in patients at high risk of iron toxicity if there are no signs of infection and the ANC can be monitored as frequently as needed. In other patients, deferiprone therapy might be temporarily suspended, and recommenced if considered appropriate on resolution of the neutropenia.

### Relationship between severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and risk of infection among patients with nonmyeloid malignancies [^8f36d26b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) may increase infection risk for cancer patients; however, there is limited understanding on the quantitative relationships between severity and duration of CIN and infection risk.

Methods

This study combined individual data from adult cancer patients receiving no granulocyte colony-stimulating factor during the first chemotherapy cycle in six trials. We used area over the curve (AOC) of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) time-response curve (below different thresholds) to measure the combined effect of severity and duration of CIN. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models quantified the hazard of first infection associated with duration of grade 4 or grade 3/4 CIN and the hazard associated with AOC.

Results

We analyzed data from 271 patients who had small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, or breast cancer; 63.8% of the patients had advanced cancer, and 77.5% received chemotherapy regimens with high risk of febrile neutropenia. In the first cycle, 18.8% of the patients had infection-related hospitalizations. Each additional day patients had grade 3/4 or grade 4 CIN was associated with 28% (95% CI 7, 51%) and 30% (95% CI 10, 54%) increased risk of infection-related hospitalization, respectively. Each unit increase in AOC (day×10(9)/L ANC), with threshold of ANC < 0.5×10(9)/L, was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.98; 95% CI 1.35, 2.90).

Conclusions

Infection risk increases dramatically with each additional day of grade 3 or 4 CIN. Interventions limiting CIN severity and duration are of critical importance to reduce infection risk in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

### Inborn errors of immunity-related immunological mechanisms and pharmacological therapy alternatives in periodontitis [^14c0b9f2]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune neutropenia

Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is caused by granulocyte-specific autoantibodies. AIN may develop during underlying disease courses, including viral infections, primary abnormalities of B or T lymphocytes or natural killer cells, immune thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, AIN is not associated with other diseases and is called chronic benign neutropenia of infancy and childhood. Benign neutropenia of infancy and childhood typically occurs in infants 5–15 months old, but the range extends from 1 month to adulthood. Most patients recover spontaneously within 24 months. Until recovery, children with this disorder suffer from mild recurrent infections. Although the neutropenia is severe (ANC < 500/μl), the ANC may rise transiently in response to acute infections. This temporary increase in neutrophil count may help alleviate the severity of acute infections but has little effect on chronic periodontal disease.

### Belinostat (Beleodaq) [^3c04c3f7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m2administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on Days 1 through 5 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles can be repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

2.2 Dosage Modification for Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities

Table 1 displays the recommended Beleodaq dosage modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Base dosage adjustments for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia on platelet and absolute neutrophil nadir (lowest value) counts in the preceding cycle of therapy.

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be greater than or equal to 1 x 109/L and the platelet count should be greater than or equal to 50 x 109/L prior to the start of each cycle and prior to resuming treatment following toxicity. Resume subsequent treatment with Beleodaq according to the guidelines described in Table 1 below. Discontinue Beleodaq in patients who have recurrent ANC nadirs less than 0.5 x 109/L and/or recurrent platelet count nadirs less than 25 x 109/L after two dosage reductions.
Other toxicities must be NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or less prior to re-treatment.

Monitor complete blood counts at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic functions prior to the start of the first dose of each cycle.

ªFor nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, dose modification may not be necessary if the duration is less than 7 days with supportive management

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Beleodaq dosage in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN, any aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) is 500 mg/m2administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on Days 1 through 5 of a 21-day cycle. Avoid use of Beleodaq in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, any AST). No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN, any AST). Hepatic impairment is defined per the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group.

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^09a9c367]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deferiprone (Ferriprox®, ApoPharma Inc. Canada) is an oral iron chelator indicated for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia 1 Its use is associated with severe neutropenia, also called agranulocytosis, in 1–2% of patients 1, 2 and with less severe episodes of neutropenia in approximately 5% of patients 2, 3. The pathogenesis of and risk factors for deferiprone‐induced neutropenia are presently unidentified 1, 4, 5. To minimize the risk of developing agranulocytosis and its potential complications, all patients taking deferiprone are expected to have their blood absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitored weekly; to discontinue therapy at the first sign of infection or of neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 × 10 9 /L); and to avoid rechallenge 3, 6. However, the rationale for imposing weekly testing on both patients and health resources has been questioned 4, 5.

Thalassemia patients frequently experience transient episodes of mild or moderate neutropenia, independent of deferiprone 5, 7, 8, 9, and neutropenia during deferiprone therapy often does not progress to agranulocytosis, even with continued treatment 5, 10, 11. Indiscriminately stopping or interrupting deferiprone at onset of neutropenia may appear to be a prudent safety measure, but may fail to balance benefits and risks for individuals.

There is a need to identify risk factors for agranulocytosis during deferiprone therapy, the effectiveness of weekly ANC monitoring in avoiding its consequences, and the rate of its recurrence upon rechallenge. This article summarizes the data reviewed and the conclusions and recommendations offered by a panel of experts in thalassemia and drug‐induced agranulocytosis convened to evaluate fulfillment of those needs.

### Management of important adverse events associated with inotuzumab ozogamicin: expert panel review [^41d21253]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Complete blood counts should be performed before each InO dose, and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (Table 4). Interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of InO doses may be necessary in patients with severe infection or severe neutropenia. Dose interruptions may also be required if a patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) decreases with InO (Table 3). In patients with ANC < 1000/mm 3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be administered. Prophylactic myeloid colony-stimulating factors may be considered for patients with an expected neutropenia or fever risk of ≥ 20%.

Table 4
Recommendations for monitoring and managing important adverse events associated with InO

ANC absolute neutrophil count, CBC complete blood count, ECG electrocardiogram, InO inotuzumab ozogamicin

Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia is a common adverse effect of cancer treatments. Signs and symptoms of thrombocytopenia include easy bruising, melena, and rash. On the basis of findings from the INO-VATE study, thrombocytopenia of any grade was reported in 45% of patients in the InO group compared with 61% of patients in the standard-therapy group. Fewer patients in the InO group required platelet transfusions (64%) compared with the standard-therapy group (95%). In the InO group, hemorrhagic events were reported in 33% of patients.

Recommendations

In patients receiving InO, monitoring of thrombocytopenia should be based on the aforementioned signs and symptoms and complete blood counts (Table 4). Moreover, InO dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuations are recommended to manage low platelet counts and bleeding (Table 3).

Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions can potentially occur in nearly all systemic cancer treatments and range in severity from mild flushing or rash to death. On the basis of findings from the INO-VATE study, infusion-related reactions of any grade occurred in 1% of patients in the InO group and 2% of patients in the standard-therapy group. Although the incidence of infusion-related reactions associated with InO is low, patients should be closely monitored during and immediately after an infusion to ensure prompt management if needed to reduce the risk of severe symptoms.

Recommendations

Premedication with a corticosteroid, antipyretic, and antihistamine is recommended before InO administration (Table 4). Depending on the severity of the infusion-related reaction, interruption or discontinuation of the infusion should be considered. Treatment with InO should be discontinued in severe or life-threatening infusion reactions (Table 3).

### Neutropenia in pediatric practice… [^306cd5a0]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: The significance of neutropenia is a common query to hematology specialists from primary care physicians. Severe neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count of fewer than 500/mcL and is a common and expected complication of chemotherapy for childhood neoplasms. This article considers those patients who have neutropenia unrelated to chemotherapy toxicity. This type of neutropenia may be noted when a complete blood count is performed in a sick newborn, a febrile child, a child taking chronic medication, or as part of a routine evaluation. Severe hereditary conditions such as Kostmann syndrome and certain immunodeficiency syndromes associated with neutropenia are rare, perhaps 1 per 100, 000, and are more likely to present in neonates and infants, although acquired conditions such as immune neutropenia and neutropenia related to infection also occur in this age group.

### Chronic mild neutropenia in adults: relation to IgG3 deficiency and infection susceptibility [^f4325e9b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chronic mild neutropenias (NP, i.e. absolute neutrophil blood counts/ANC/0.5–1.5 x 10(9) L(-1)) are accompanied by a variable infection susceptibility, which may or may not be as a result of concomitant conditions. Here, we assessed whether such patients also displayed an immunoglobulin deficiency and if this condition contributed to infection proneness.

Design, Setting and Subjects

Thirty consecutive adult Caucasian patients with chronic mild NP were followed at one university hospital for up to 28 years. Comparisons were made with 49 IgG3 deficiency patients at an immunodeficiency clinic.

Main Outcome Measures

Recorded infections, ANC and serum immunoglobulin levels; flow cytometry assessments of blood lymphocyte subsets and tests for autoimmunity were run to determine neutropenia subtypes.

Results

Forty per cent of the NP patients were treated for severe or recurrent infections. The mean IgG3 value for the NP patients was significantly lower than for healthy controls (P < 0.005) and 33% of the patients displayed IgG3 values below the reference values (i.e. below 0.21 g L(-1)), and an additional 13% had IgG3 values within the range others consider low (0.21–0.41 g L(-1)). Unexpectedly, neutropenic IgG3 deficiency patients exhibited less infection proneness than those with normal IgG3 values (P = 0.03). Patients with autoimmune, large granular lymphocyte-associated or idiopathic NP had IgG3 deficiency in 63, 44 and 38%, respectively. In addition, none of IgG3 deficiency patients followed at the immunodeficiency clinic displayed neutropenia.

Conclusion

IgG3 deficiency is common amongst chronic mild neutropenia patients, particularly in those with autoimmune background, but contributes not significantly to infection susceptibility.

PARP inhibitors — neutropenia management states that growth factor support for prophylaxis is not indicated at typical myelosuppression levels and provides hold/restart criteria: "The degree of myelosuppression has not been shown to reach the levels defined in the ASCO 2015 Guideline Update for prophylactic use of a growth factor support recommended for use with a > 20% risk of neutropenia with fever". Accordingly, "growth factor support is not recommended for prophylactic use during PARPi therapy", and "growth factors should be administered 24–72 hours after completion of the chemotherapy". For toxicity management, "Grade 4 neutropenia of ≥ 5–7 days or grade 3 with fever are indications for holding PARPi", severe cases may use "3 days of neupogen", and therapy "should not be restarted until resolution of fever, a granulocyte count of ≥ 1,000/μL, and adequate time (ie, 48–72 hours) have elapsed since the last dose of growth factor".

### Clozapine [^47e25c24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy

Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/μL for the general population, and at least 1000/μL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Dosing Information

The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

2.3 Maintenance Treatment

Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode.

2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment

Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient's last ANC:

See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.
Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.
For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is ≥ 1500/μL and for BEN patients until their ANC is ≥ 1000/μL or above their baseline.
Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5°C or 101.3°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

2.5 Discontinuation of CLOZARIL Treatment

If discontinuing CLOZARIL in patients with:

Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is ≥ 1500/μL.

If discontinuing CLOZARIL in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with:

Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks.

When discontinuing CLOZARIL, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

2.6 Restarting CLOZARIL Treatment After Interrupting CLOZARIL

When restarting CLOZARIL in patients who have interrupted CLOZARIL treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

If one day's dosage is missed, resume CLOZARIL treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage.
If two days of dosing is missed, resume CLOZARIL treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage.
For longer interruptions, restart CLOZARIL treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial CLOZARIL treatment.

2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of CLOZARIL-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7)].

2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers

It may be necessary to reduce the CLOZARIL dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Aripiprazole [^ae49cac1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.

5.11 Seizures/Convulsions

In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2,467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years).

As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^58e7672a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for febrile neutropenia" for febrile neutropenia.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Febrile Neutropenia is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with a high risk of infection due to a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in conjunction with fever. This tool is particularly useful in the management of patients undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments that suppress the immune system, as these individuals are at an increased risk of developing febrile neutropenia.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include both fever and neutropenia. Fever is defined either as a single oral temperature measurement of ≥ 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a temperature of ≥ 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) sustained over a 1-hour period. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or an absolute neutrophil count expected to decrease to < 500/mcL during the next 48 hours.

The diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is established if the patient meets either of the fever criteria (A or B) and either of the neutropenia criteria (C or D). If the patient does not meet these criteria, the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is not established. This tool aids clinicians in making a prompt diagnosis, which is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.

The febrile neutropenia diagnostic tool assesses whether a patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia based on their fever and neutrophil count levels. This requires two specific determinations from the user:

1. **Fever**:
- A single oral temperature reading of 38.3°C (101°F) or higher.
- A temperature of at least 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained over a period of one hour.

2. **Neutropenia**:
- An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 500/microliter (mcL) or less.
- An ANC expected to drop below 500/mcL within the subsequent 48 hours.

The diagnostic process evaluates these criteria as follows:

- For fever, if either criterion is satisfied (a single high measurement or sustained elevated temperature), the fever condition is considered met.
- For neutropenia, if either criterion is met (ANC already low or anticipated to become low), the neutropenia condition is satisfied.

Febrile neutropenia is diagnosed when both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present. The diagnostic tool then provides the outcome:

- If both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present simultaneously, the patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia.
- If one or neither condition is met, the diagnostic criteria are not satisfied.

The diagnostic assessment outlined through user inputs ensures a straightforward determination of whether the criteria for febrile neutropenia are fulfilled. Here's a simplified overview of the possible outcomes:

| **Fever condition** | **Neutropenia condition** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| Fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or sustained ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for 1 hour | Neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or expected to decrease to < 500/mcL | Meets criteria for febrile neutropenia |
| Any other situation | Any other situation | Diagnostic criteria not met |

This tool systematically assesses input parameters to help healthcare providers determine the presence of a potential febrile neutropenia case based on standard diagnostic measures.

### Survey of practices for the clinical management of febrile neutropenia in children in hematology-oncology units in Latin America [^68314a0b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Respondents varied in their perceptions of neutropenia definitions used for clinical decisions in FN, departing from those definitions in published guidelines, which establish an ANC of 500/μL as a decision point value. Our finding confirmed previous studies' results, where the definitions varied, even in similar geographic areas. Neutropenia-level values usually align with the frequency and severity of infections, and risks for bacterial and fungal infections are higher when the duration of neutropenia is longer than 1 week, and the ANC is less than 100/μL. The risk imposed by neutropenia is known to be influenced by the disease, the treatment, and the FN event. The fact that more than one-third of our respondents used a higher than accepted ANC level to trigger a clinical decision means that they treat more patients by admitting them more often, performing work-up more often, and providing more antibiotics that require a longer hospital stay. Therefore, using standard definitions of ANC in institutional FN guidelines makes sense. Deviations from key recommendations can occur, despite guidelines being locally constructed. The adoption and implementation of practices with accepted definitions is a multistep process that requires the active and coordinated use of personnel and resources at the healthcare facilities. Additionally, for sustained adoption and implementation of practices of a recommended guideline, a reasonable degree of ideal circumstances, such as competent providers and optimal infrastructure, supplies, and organizational processes, might be required.

The respondents also identified various usages of antibiotics in FN. Management of about half of the low-risk cases involved IV antibiotics. Current guidelines recommend the use of oral treatment for those at low risk of FN, which can decrease complications and costs of inpatient care. However, therapy might have to be given as inpatient, especially if patients cannot be monitored frequently. In low-income settings represented in our study, out-of-town families often do not have access to lodging near the healthcare facilities and have minimal financial resources. In the absence of shelters, hospitals become mandatory places for lodging patients and their families. There is a growing interest and initiatives in Latin America to provide housing for patients and their families who must travel for cancer treatment (Liliana Vazquez, 2021–2023 SLAOP president, personal communication). Identification of patients at low risk of FN with potential for less intensive antibiotic management could decrease the burden of crowded hospitals in low-income settings.

### A predictive model for bone marrow disease in cytopenia based on noninvasive procedures [^46ded2a5]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Prediction model

In the discovery cohort (n = 340), we investigated the association between abnormal bone marrow morphology and mutations in certain genes, as well as age, sex, Hgb level, and platelet and neutrophil counts. Mutations in TET2, SF3B1, U2AF1, TP53, and RUNX1 and in the genes in the high-risk and other group were all significantly associated with a higher risk of abnormal bone marrow morphology (Figure 4). Mutations in DNMT3A, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and ASXL1 did not show a statistically significant effect, although ASXL1 showed a positive association just below the significance threshold (odds ratio [OR]: 2.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99–7.18; P = 0.052). Aside from mutational status, we found an association between abnormal bone marrow morphology and anemia, as well as severe neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count < 0.8 × 10 9). Severe anemia (defined as Hgb < 10 g/dL [Hgb < 6.2 mmol/L]) showed a strong association (OR: 6.45; 95% CI: 2.98–14.82; P < .001).

Figure 4.
Odds ratios for the association between abnormal bone marrow morphology and the depicted variables derived from multivariable logistic regression. P value and OR with corresponding 95% CI for the association with abnormal bone marrow morphology is shown for each variable. Severe anemia: Hgb < 10 g/dL. Mild anemia: Hgb ≥ 10 - < 11.8 g/dL for females and Hgb ≥ 10 - < 13.4 g/dL for males. Severe thrombocytopenia: Platelets (plts) < 30 × 10 9 /L. Moderate thrombocytopenia: plts ≥ 30 × 10 9 /L - < 90 × 10 9 /L. Mild thrombocytopenia: plts ≥ 90 × 10 9 /L - < 150 × 10 9 /L. Severe neutropenia: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.8 × 10 9 /L. Mild neutropenia: ANC ≥ 0.8 × 10 9 /L - < 1.8 × 10 9 /L.

### Clinical and immunological features in ACKR1 / DARC-associated neutropenia [^d47e972f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient cohort

A total of 94 subjects included in the Stockholm Neutropenia Study cohort tested positive for the rs2814778 SNP in the DARC/ACKR1 gene up to 31 July 2018 (Figure 1). Of these, 93 were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous for the rs2814778 SNP. Four patients were excluded from further clinical evaluations because they were followed up or treated for systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or disorders that can affect both ANC and outcomes. Clinical details were available for 66 subjects (67% females; Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was 41 years (range, 18–93 years). The original nationalities (n = 20 countries) are given in supplementary Table 1, representing the influx of migrants to Sweden over the past decades, often from areas with armed conflicts.

Table 1.
Characteristics of all individuals with genetically defined ADAN

None of the 50 patients with records of abdominal palpation or imaging showed any evidence of splenomegaly.

ANC in ADAN may occasionally be lower than previously recognized

To assess the range of ANCs in our cohort of genetically defined individuals with ADAN, we used ANCs retrieved from medical records for a median time of 4 years (range, 1–20 years). We found a total of 417 measurements, with a median of 6.5 analyses per subject (range, 1–33 ANC examinations per person). All 66 clinically evaluable individuals with ADAN were neutropenic, that is, ANC < 1.6 × 10 9 /L on at least 1 occasion. The median and mean ANCs for all 66 individuals with ADAN were 1.0 × 10 9 and 0.95 × 10 9 /L, respectively. The 66 median individual ANCs were then distributed into NP severity strata (Figure 2 A). Two subjects displayed median values below 0.5 × 10 9 /L but had separate ANCs in the moderate/mild NP strata. However, when the lowest-recorded and available individual ANC at any time was classified, 6 of the 66 individuals (9.1%) fulfilled the criteria for severe NP, and 46 individuals (70%) had moderate NP, emphasizing that persons with ADAN occasionally displayed very low ANCs (Figure 2 A). Thus, even those with an occasional ANC < 0.5 often had near-normal ANCs at other times.

2.3 Monitoring and Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Obtain complete blood cell counts prior to initiating INQOVI and before each cycle. Delay the next cycle if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 1,000/μL and platelets are less than 50,000/μL in the absence of active disease. Monitor complete blood cell counts until ANC is 1,000/μL or greater and platelets are 50,000/μL or greater [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If hematologic recovery occurs (ANC at least 1,000/μL and platelets at least 50,000/μL) within 2 weeks of achieving remission, continue INQOVI at the same dose.
If hematologic recovery does not occur (ANC at least 1,000/μL and platelets at least 50,000/μL) within 2 weeks of achieving remission,
Delay INQOVI for up to 2 additional weeks AND
Resume at a reduced dose by administering INQOVI on Days 1 through 4. Consider further dose reductions in the order listed in Table 1 if myelosuppression persists after a dose reduction. Maintain or increase dose in subsequent cycles as clinically indicated.

Manage persistent severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia with supportive treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Delay the next cycle for the following non-hematologic adverse reactions and resume at the same or reduced dose upon resolution:

Serum creatinine 2 mg/dL or greater
Serum bilirubin 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2 times ULN or greater
Active or uncontrolled infection

### White blood cell ranges and frequency of neutropenia by duffy genotype status [^ddd7cea7]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

These results highlight that an ANC value lower than the common clinical threshold for neutropenia (< 1500 cells per μL) is common among participants with the Duffy-null RBC genotype, especially among younger individuals. Furthermore, > 5% of these individuals have an ANC < 1000 cells per μL. When we examined first measured ANC values, 4.8% of adults with the Duffy-null RBC genotype had an ANC < 1500 cells per μL, compared with 0.5% of adults with the other genotypes. These values are comparable to findings reported from African-ancestry populations from the UK Biobank, in which the respective percentages were 5.1% vs 0.3%.

The current clinical guidelines for evaluating neutropenia include collecting a careful clinical history and physical examination, investigating for signs of infection, and serial monitoring of ANC (≥ 2 values usually 3–6 months apart) and markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein. If ANC values remain stable, and in the absence of concerning symptoms, a diagnosis of stable neutropenia may be inferred. However, a race-based inference that the etiology of the neutropenia is the Duffy-null RBC genotype will often be inaccurate. We believe that this decision model would be improved if a neutropenia evaluation included measurement of the Duffy-null RBC phenotype/genotype and values were interpreted in the context of genotype-specific reference ranges. This could reduce repeated laboratory testing among those with the Duffy-null RBC genotype and would more promptly and accurately identify those individuals without the Duffy-null RBC genotype for whom a low ANC would not be anticipated based on their genotype.

There are limitations to this study. Even though measurements were collected in conjunction with billing activity related to a routine health maintenance examination, participants could have had symptoms or other findings that prompted an examination of blood counts. In particular, routine laboratory testing is less commonly pursued among younger individuals in the absence of clinical concerns. Although we excluded individuals with a history of malignancy and other diseases that could impact leukocyte counts, disease reporting can be incomplete in biobank data resources. There were insufficient data to examine relevant secondary findings such as immature granulocyte fractions.

In summary, for adults with the CC genotype, the lower limit (2.5th percentile) of the ANC distribution is likely between 711 and 1239 cells per μL, compared with 1250 and 2110 cells per μL for the CT/TT genotypes. These reference points may assist providers in determining whether further clinical evaluations are warranted among individuals with low neutrophil count measurements.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^ea0b96b1]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 5: Avoid routine administration of G-CSF for prophylaxis in children with asymptomatic autoimmune neutropenia and no history of recurrent or severe infections.

The fifth ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against the routine administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as empiric treatment for children with asymptomatic autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) and no history of recurrent or severe bacterial and/or fungal infections. AIN is rare, affecting 1 in 100 000 children in the United States annually, with a median age at diagnosis of 8 to 11 months (range, 3–38 months). Typically, AIN is characterized by severe neutropenia with median absolute neutrophil counts of 200 × 10 3 /μL (range, 0 to 500 × 10 3 /μL), which often increase to normal during times of physical stress, such as with viral or bacterial infections. Children with AIN experience minor upper respiratory infections at only a slightly higher frequency than the general population, and occasionally have gingivitis. Rare serious or invasive bacterial infections have been reported in young infants. Anti-neutrophil antibodies are sometimes detectable, but the results of this testing have low sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing AIN. Moreover, in a large Italian cohort study of AIN in children, the presence or absence of anti-neutrophil antibodies was not associated with risk or frequency of infections, age at recovery, or overall prognosis. Almost all children with AIN normalize their absolute neutrophil counts within a median of 20 months (range, 6–54 months), with no risk of recurrence.

There are limited data regarding the use of subcutaneous G-CSF in children with AIN. Two recent studies report administering G-CSF in 7.5% to 16% of children with AIN, mainly as on-demand regimens in the event of recurrent infections or before planned invasive procedures. However, neither study demonstrated clear benefits in reducing infection rates, including pathogenic bloodstream infections. Therefore, in children with asymptomatic AIN, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of G-CSF as a prophylaxis strategy for improving health outcomes. The unnecessary routine use of G-CSF could lead to intolerable adverse effects, such as bone pain from excess neutrophil pool expansion in the marrow, injection site pain or infection, and avoidable health care costs. The use of G-CSF in this population should be guided by assessment of infection risks using the minimal effective dose to avoid unnecessary adverse effects.

### Clinical prediction models for febrile neutropenia and its outcomes: a systematic review [^0b177a74]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common and often life-threatening condition in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. FN affects up to 20% of patients and has a mortality rate of 9.5%. This mortality increases to 50% in those with comorbidities or septic shock. FN is defined as fever ≥ 38.3 °C or ≥ 38.0 °C for 1 h or more, and neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of < 0.5 × 10 9 /L, or an ANC that is < 1.0 × 10 9 /L and expected to decrease to < 0.5 × 10 9 in the next 48 h.

Given the significant complications that can occur with FN, high-risk patients are given granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and in some cases, prophylactic antibiotics. At the onset of FN, standard of care tends to be inpatient management with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, but this treatment paradigm is not without risk, notably the development of nosocomial colonization and resistant bacterial organisms. There is a significant economic impact on the healthcare system with this approach to management, which prompts the question of whether there is a cohort of FN patients that can be safely managed in the outpatient setting.

Multiple risk stratification tools have been developed to both determine prognosis and to tailor therapy in patients with FN. The most internationally utilized prediction tools to predict poor outcomes in FN are the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score and the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE). Although these scoring systems performed well in initial validation, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that these tools may not meet the appropriate safety standards for clinical decision making. International guidelines recommend incorporating clinical criteria when making decisions, in conjunction with these tools, further implying the need for more comprehensive predictive tools to aid clinical decision making in this setting. With the increasing use of electronic medical records (EMR) globally and subsequent availability of large datasets, there is growing opportunity for the development of novel models. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) algorithms present a rapidly expanding area of development and may represent an opportunity for more discriminate models to be developed with these large datasets.

Given the importance of early intervention in FN, and the lack of validated, fit-for-purpose prediction models clinically available, novel prediction models are needed. Our aim was to systematically review and critically appraise the existing and emerging literature with the following question: what evidence-based clinical prediction models can be used to predict FN or its outcomes?

### Rates of severe neutropenia and infection risk in patients treated with deferiprone: 28 years of data [^28543021]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Events of severe IDIN as well as the associated serious infections were analyzed by 3 discrete ANC groups based on the nadir ANC: group 1, ANC 0.2 × 10 9 /L to 0.5 × 10 9 /L; group 2, ANC 0.1 × 10 9 /L to 0.199 × 10 9 /L; or group 3, ANC < 0.1 × 10 9 /L. To examine any clinically significant trends, events of severe IDIN were additionally analyzed by 3 all-encompassing ANC thresholds: < 0.5 × 10 9 /L, < 0.2 × 10 9 /L, and < 0.1 × 10 9 /L.

The incidence of severe IDIN was analyzed in clinical trials but not in the postmarketing setting owing to the uncertainty in the actual number of patients who received deferiprone and missing patient information. This analysis focused primarily on the rates of severe IDIN normalized to exposure per 100 patient-years to achieve consistency in data reporting between clinical trials and the postmarketing setting.

### Understanding chronic neutropenia: life is short [^267b23fc]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic neutropenia are extensive, varying from haematopoietic stem cell disorders resulting in defective neutrophil production, to accelerated apoptosis of neutrophil progenitors or circulating mature neutrophils. While the knowledge concerning genetic defects associated with congenital neutropenia or bone marrow failure is increasing rapidly, the functional role and consequences of these genetic alterations is often not well understood. In addition, there is a large group of diseases, including primary immunodeficiencies and metabolic diseases, in which chronic neutropenia is one of the symptoms, while there is no clear bone marrow pathology or haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction. Altogether, these disease entities illustrate the complexity of normal neutrophil development, the functional role of the (bone marrow) microenvironment and the increased propensity to undergo apoptosis, which is typical for neutrophils. The large variety of disorders associated with chronic neutropenia makes classification almost impossible and possibly not desirable, based on the clinical phenotypes. However, a better understanding of the regulation of normal myeloid differentiation and neutrophil development is of great importance in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained chronic neutropenia. In this review we propose insights in the pathophysiology of chronic neutropenia in the context of the functional role of key players during normal neutrophil development, neutrophil release and neutrophil survival.

### Hairy cell leukemia, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^ce6223c3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Medium credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 — Hairy Cell Leukemia infection prophylaxis and neutropenia management — Anti-infective prophylaxis for a minimum of 3 months and until CD4+ T-cell count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 is recommended for all patients requiring treatment, and broad-spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis should be considered for patients with neutropenia. Available evidence suggests that the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically significant impact on infection-related outcomes, and the use of G-CSFs either as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count have been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia. The use of G-CSF might be considered in patients with severe neutropenic fever following chemotherapy.

### Severe chronic neutropenia: treatment and follow-up of patients in the severe chronic neutropenia international registry [^511fdded]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) is defined as an absolute neutrophil (ANC) of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L, lasting for months or years. Congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia are principal categories of SCN. Since 1994, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) has collected data to monitor the clinical course, treatments, and disease outcomes for SCN patients. This report summarizes data for 853 patients, almost all treated with daily or alternate-day recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or Filgrastim). G-CSF treatment increased the ANC overall from 0.34 x 10(9)/L ± 0.018 pre-treatment to 3.70 x 10(9)/L ± 0.18 during the first year of treatment. For most patients, the responses were durable with patients remaining on the same dose of G-CSF for many years. Long-term hematological observations showed stable mean leukocyte and neutrophil counts and gradually increasing hemoglobin levels. Thrombocytopenia developed in 4% of patients. As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment. This event occurred without a predictable relationship to the duration or dose of G-CSF treatment. No patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia developed MDS or AML. Other important adverse events included hepatomegaly, osteoporosis, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and deaths in 4 of 14 cases requiring splenectomy. Growth and development and the outcome of pregnancy appeared to be unaffected by G-CSF treatment. These data indicate that congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia can be effectively treated with long-term G-CSF. The risk of leukemia, osteoporosis, other potentially adverse events, and pregnancy outcome need to be further evaluated with continuing long-term observations.

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^1c00371f]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

These findings pose the question of whether mild or moderate neutropenia would progress to agranulocytosis with continued use of deferiprone. Accordingly, 294 patients with transfusion‐dependent anemias were enrolled into a noninterventional surveillance program designed to assess compliance in clinical practice with the recommended weekly ANC monitoring and interruption of deferiprone use at onset of neutropenia 10. If therapy was continued, the program assessed its impact on the occurrence of agranulocytosis. ANC monitoring was conducted at an average interval of 5 ± 4 weeks. Deferiprone was not always interrupted upon detection of neutropenia, but there was no greater incidence of agranulocytosis. Overall, one patient (0.3%) experienced agranulocytosis and 9 others (3%) experienced a total of 11 episodes of neutropenia. All neutropenia episodes resolved, and time to resolution was similar whether or not treatment had been interrupted. No case of neutropenia progressed to agranulocytosis. Data from the CT also suggest that deferiprone use was not associated with progression of pre‐existing mild‐to‐moderate neutropenia 10, 11. This is of particular relevance in geographic areas where ethnic neutropenia co‐exists with a high prevalence of patients requiring iron chelation therapy because of hemoglobinopathies 27, 28. A low neutrophil count should not be considered a contraindication to the use of deferiprone.

The characteristics of deferiprone‐induced agranulocytosis are typical of idiosyncratic drug reactions 1, 4, 15, 29 in that:
It is unpredictable and a rare event
Onset is delayed, occurrence peaks after 1–3 months, and time of first onset extends beyond one year
Incidence is not dose‐related within the therapeutic range. This is consistent with the lack of dependence of clozapine‐associated agranulocytosis and neutropenia on dose 30, but in contrast with the dose dependency of beta‐lactam antibiotic‐mediated agranulocytosis 31.

Idiosyncratic drug reactions are generally inconsistent with direct cytotoxicity, and there is growing evidence that most are mediated by the adaptive immune system 32. The manifestations of an "allergic" reaction, such as rash, that occur in some cases have not been recorded in deferiprone‐induced agranulocytosis 32.

### Eflapegrastim, a long-acting granulocyte-colony stimulating factor for the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: results of a phase III trial [^b1f2d86f]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Blood samples for complete blood counts (CBCs) with differential were collected pretreatment and on day 1 and daily on days 4–15 of cycle 1 and on days 1, 4, 7, and 15 in subsequent cycles. However, if an ANC ≤ 1.0 × 10 9 /L was reported at any time in cycles 2–4, daily CBCs were performed until the ANC recovered to ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 per L. All blood analyses were performed by an independent central laboratory.

Patients were monitored for adverse events (AEs) for the duration of the study, and serum chemistry was collected in every cycle. AEs and laboratory values were graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 4.03. Safety assessments began with the first dose of TC and lasted until 35 (± 5) days after the last dose of study drug. Laboratory work was also performed at the long‐term follow‐up visits, 6 and 12 months after completion of therapy. To assess immunogenicity, blood samples were collected on day 1 of each cycle, at the end‐of‐treatment visit, and at the long‐term follow‐up visits. All immunogenicity tests were performed by independent laboratories.

Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the DSN in cycle 1, defined as the number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10 9 per L; grade 4 per NCI CTCAE, v. 4.03) from the day of first occurrence of an ANC below that threshold. In addition to DSN in cycles 2–4, other secondary endpoints that were assessed in each cycle included time‐to‐ANC recovery (time‐from‐chemotherapy administration to ANC ≥ 1.5 × 10 9 per L after the expected nadir), depth of ANC nadir (lowest ANC value), incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN; ANC < 1.0 × 10 9 per L and either temperature > 38.3°C or two consecutive readings ≥ 38.0°C over 2 hours), incidence of neutropenic complications (anti‐infective use and/or hospitalizations), relative dose intensity (RDI), and safety (overall AE rates; AEs of special interest: musculoskeletal‐related, splenic rupture, leukocytosis, and anaphylaxis).

Management of cytopenias — growth factor use and recovery timelines: The tisagenlecleucel package insert recommends against myeloid growth factors, particularly GM-CSF, during the first 3 weeks after infusion or until CRS has resolved due to theoretical CRS aggravation; some centers use filgrastim for low ANC, and in a retrospective series of 32 RR DLBCL patients median times to neutrophil, platelet, and hemoglobin recovery were 11 days (range 5–218 days), 59.5 days (range 4–241 days), and 76 days (range 0–218 days), respectively, with 15 patients receiving filgrastim; for persistent neutropenia with ANC < 500 cells/μL after day 28 following CAR T cell infusion, growth factors should be considered.

5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of aripiprazole at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue aripiprazole in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) and follow their WBC counts until recovery.

5.11 Seizures/Convulsions

In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, patients with a history of seizures excluded seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (3/2467) of undiagnosed adult patients treated with oral aripiprazole, in 0.1% (1/732) of pediatric patients (6 to 18 years).

As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

### Hairy cell leukemia, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^123e026b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Medium credibility.

NCCN Hairy cell leukemia — anti-infective prophylaxis and G-CSF use — anti-infective prophylaxis for a minimum of 3 months and until CD4+ T-cell count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3 is recommended for all patients requiring treatment, and broad-spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis should be considered for patients with neutropenia. Available evidence suggests that the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically significant impact on infection-related outcomes; the use of G-CSFs either as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count have been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia, and the use of G-CSF might be considered in patients with severe neutropenic fever following chemotherapy.

### Can we predict the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in febrile neutropenic patients, focusing on regimen-specific risk factors? A retrospective analysis [^dd9f2ffb]. Annals of Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to elaborate a predictive model for the duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) allowing the identification of patients with a higher risk of complications, especially complicated febrile neutropenia, who might benefit from preventive measures.

Patients and Methods

A score ranging from 0 to 4 on the basis of expected CIN was attributed to each cytotoxic agent given as part of chemotherapy treatment in solid tumours for patients with febrile neutropenia (FN). The individual scores were combined into several overall scores.

Results

A total of 203 patients with FN were eligible for this retrospective analysis. We were able to identify two groups of patients with statistically different neutropenia durations with median durations until hematological recovery of ANC ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1.0 x 10(9)/l, being respectively 6 versus 4 days (P = 0.03) and 8 versus 6 days (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

The duration of neutropenia is directly influenced by the aggressiveness of the chemotherapy regimen. In this retrospective study, we were able to identify a group of patients who needed two more additional days to recover from grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia, based on the degree of aggressiveness of the cytotoxic agents used.

### Disorders of neutrophil number and function [^94b6d4f0]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

This review of disorders of neutrophil number and function will discuss important research advances in the field and then provide a clinical diagnostic approach. The focus will be on two recent clinical developments in the field of phagocyte disorders. First, an important natural history study from the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry has recently quantitated the incidence and risk factors for death from sepsis and for progression to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in a large cohort of severe chronic neutropenia patients, many of whom were followed 10 or more years on treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Second, in the past year, a multinational group has announced successful gene therapy of two adults with chronic granulomatous disease, the most common disorder of neutrophil function. However, monitoring of retroviral insertion sites revealed expansion of the multiclonal population of gene-modified cells, raising concerns about eventual leukemogenesis. The review also provides a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of a patient with a suspected disorder of neutrophil number or function.
