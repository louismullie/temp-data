## Question

Use of warfarin to treat vitamin K deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether warfarin can be used to treat vitamin K deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology of warfarin and the vitamin K cycle. Then, I should define vitamin K deficiency and its established treatment. Next, I will consider commonly confused clinical scenarios, like warfarin reversal and adjunctive vitamin K during warfarin therapy. After that, I should verify pharmacodynamic timelines and safety warnings. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically sound answer and recommended management approach.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because if I get the mechanism wrong, the rest of the reasoning will be off. Warfarin inhibits the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex (VKORC1), reducing regeneration of vitamin K and thereby decreasing γ-carboxylation of the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, X and the anticoagulants proteins C and S, which is the intended anticoagulant mechanism, not a replacement strategy for deficiency, and its peak effect lags 72–96 hours due to factor half-lives [^116795fd] [^111nwPXz].

> Next, I should review what vitamin K deficiency is and how it is treated, to avoid a mechanistic mismatch. Vitamin K deficiency is a state of insufficient activity of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors and, by definition, the coagulopathy is promptly corrected by vitamin K supplementation, not by antagonism of the vitamin K cycle, and in fact the FDA labeling for warfarin advises caution in patients with vitamin K deficiency given the enhanced bleeding risk baseline in such patients [^111UNPPr].

> Hold on, let me verify the logical implication here before concluding. If I were to give a vitamin K antagonist to a patient with vitamin K deficiency, I would further impair vitamin K recycling and depress hepatic production of γ-carboxylated clotting factors, thereby worsening the coagulopathy; the pharmacodynamic lag also means bleeding risk can increase over several days as the longer half-life factors decline, particularly factors II and X, which reinforces that this would be countertherapeutic in deficiency states [^116795fd] [^111nwPXz].

> I will now examine potentially confusing but distinct clinical scenarios to ensure I'm not missing an edge case. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis occurs in protein C deficiency due to abrupt drops in protein C and is a complication of warfarin, not an indication for it in vitamin K deficiency; conversely, low-dose vitamin K supplementation during warfarin therapy can stabilize INR in patients with unstable control, which modulates warfarin therapy rather than treating a primary vitamin K deficiency; and when reversing warfarin overanticoagulation or preparing for urgent procedures, guidelines recommend vitamin K, with or without 4-factor PCC, to restore clotting factor activity, which is the opposite of using warfarin to treat deficiency [^111tyfxh] [^115PV8T3] [^116V2ZvH] [^115syHSH] [^116uUnaS].

> Wait, I should also double-check safety statements because labeling language matters in clinical decision-making. The FDA SPL for warfarin explicitly lists caution in patients with vitamin K deficiency among bleeding risk situations, underscoring that baseline undercarboxylation is a hazard state for warfarin; beyond hemostasis, antagonizing vitamin K can promote functional vitamin K deficiency in extrahepatic tissues and has been associated with vascular calcification biology, which further argues against using warfarin in a patient already deficient in vitamin K [^111UNPPr] [^116bX7C2] [^114LHD6A].

> Let me consider the dose–response nuance next, because one might confuse adjunctive vitamin K with deficiency treatment. Controlled studies show that daily vitamin K1 on the order of 100–150 micrograms can reduce INR variability in warfarin-treated patients with unstable control, with a demonstrable threshold effect around 150 micrograms in some cohorts; however, this strategy presumes ongoing VKA therapy and aims at INR stability, not correction of a true vitamin K deficiency state, which still requires direct vitamin K repletion [^115sodWX] [^115PV8T3] [^111CPwot].

> But wait, what if someone argues that high-dose vitamin K can bypass warfarin via warfarin-resistant reductase pathways, so perhaps warfarin could paradoxically be used alongside vitamin K in deficiency. Let me clarify: mechanistic work identifying a warfarin-resistant vitamin K reductase, such as FSP1, helps explain why high-dose vitamin K can reverse warfarin effect, and clinical trials confirm that oral or intravenous vitamin K rapidly lowers INR during warfarin-associated coagulopathy; none of this supports initiating warfarin to treat vitamin K deficiency, it only supports vitamin K as an antidote to warfarin when needed [^113LnQvj] [^111rpkVU] [^116a9jAH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is there any documented indication, even rare, for using warfarin in hereditary combined deficiency of vitamin K–dependent factors or other deficiency states. I should double-check, but the epidemiology indicates such hereditary deficiencies are rare and the therapeutic logic remains replacement of vitamin K or the deficient factors, not further antagonism; I find no evidence supporting warfarin as a therapy for vitamin K deficiency, and the available guidance uniformly uses vitamin K to reverse excess antagonism rather than to induce it [^114xUYVX] [^115syHSH] [^116uUnaS].

> Final clinical reasoning and answer: I should confirm my conclusion clearly. Using warfarin to treat vitamin K deficiency is contraindicated and mechanistically illogical; warfarin creates or exacerbates functional vitamin K deficiency by inhibiting VKORC1, worsening undercarboxylation of clotting factors and bleeding risk, whereas true vitamin K deficiency is managed with vitamin K supplementation, orally or intravenously depending on severity and urgency, and guidelines employ vitamin K, with or without factor repletion, to reverse warfarin rather than to treat deficiency with it [^116795fd] [^1173JdSX] [^115syHSH] [^116uUnaS] [^111UNPPr].

---

Warfarin should never be used to treat vitamin K deficiency; as a vitamin K antagonist [^116795fd], it **worsens deficiency** and increases bleeding risk. The appropriate treatment is **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy [^1173JdSX]. Warfarin is indicated only for thromboembolic prevention and is **contraindicated in vitamin K deficiency** due to the risk of severe bleeding and complications, such as warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of warfarin

Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), blocking regeneration of reduced vitamin K and thereby **reducing synthesis** of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S [^116795fd]. This impairs γ-carboxylation, producing inactive clotting factors and resulting in anticoagulation [^111nwPXz].

---

## Clinical indications for warfarin

Warfarin is **indicated** for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, including [^1129QZ9T]:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Stroke prevention.
- **Venous thromboembolism**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- **Mechanical heart valves**: Prevention of thromboembolism.

Warfarin is **not indicated** for vitamin K deficiency or related coagulopathies.

---

## Vitamin K deficiency: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations

Vitamin K deficiency impairs γ-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, resulting in **coagulopathy** and bleeding [^1155Vy2p]. Clinical manifestations include:

- **Easy bruising** and bleeding.
- **Mucosal bleeding** and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
- **Prolonged PT/INR** and bleeding tendency.

Treatment requires **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy [^1173JdSX] [^117XsE7u].

---

## Risks and complications of warfarin in vitamin K deficiency

Warfarin use in vitamin K deficiency is contraindicated because it **exacerbates deficiency** and increases bleeding risk. Potential complications include:

- **Severe bleeding** and hemorrhage [^115syHSH].
- **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis**: particularly in protein C or S deficiency [^111tyfxh].
- **Increased fracture risk**: due to impaired bone mineralization [^115yprsH] [^115AaiME].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines explicitly advise against using warfarin to treat vitamin K deficiency; instead, **vitamin K supplementation is recommended** to correct coagulopathy and restore normal clotting factor synthesis.

---

## Alternative treatments for vitamin K deficiency

The primary treatment for vitamin K deficiency is **vitamin K supplementation**, administered orally or intravenously depending on severity and urgency [^116a9jAH] [^111rpkVU]. This approach effectively restores clotting factor synthesis and corrects coagulopathy [^114qmvf4].

---

## Monitoring and management of warfarin therapy

Warfarin therapy requires **careful INR monitoring** to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation and minimize bleeding risk [^115i1QmN]. Regular INR checks and dose adjustments are essential to ensure safe and effective anticoagulation therapy [^1129QZ9T].

---

## Conclusion

Warfarin should **not be used** to treat vitamin K deficiency because it **worsens deficiency** and increases bleeding risk [^116795fd]. The appropriate treatment is **vitamin K supplementation** to restore clotting factor synthesis and correct coagulopathy [^1173JdSX]. Warfarin is indicated only for thromboembolic prevention and is contraindicated in vitamin K deficiency due to the risk of severe bleeding and complications, such as warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

### Anticoagulation therapy for thromboembolism prevention: A case of warfarin-induced skin necrosis in the setting of protein C deficiency [^111tyfxh]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with protein C deficiency are at increased risk for thromboembolic diseases. Non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant options should be considered in patients with warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN) in the setting of protein C deficiency. We report a 41-year-old African American male patient with WISN and protein C deficiency who was treated with rivaroxaban followed by dabigatran.

After one month on rivaroxaban, he began experiencing blood in his stools, unrelenting pain in his lower extremities, and found it difficult to obtain medication despite having insurance, leading to non-compliance. He was then assessed at the hospital, symptomatically treated, and discharged on dabigatran. After six weeks, he reported symptomatic relief and fewer side effects. This case involved a head-to-head clinical comparison of rivaroxaban and dabigatran as alternatives to warfarin anticoagulation therapy.

### Jantoven [^116795fd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post-ribosomal synthesis of these clotting factors. It facilitates the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in proteins essential for biological activity. Warfarin likely interferes with clotting factor synthesis by inhibiting the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex. This reduces the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration, though the peak effect might be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is between 2 to 5 days. The effects of Jantoven can become more pronounced as the effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II – 60 hours, VII – 4 to 6 hours, IX – 24 hours, X – 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Jantoven is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.

- **Absorption**: Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed.

### Poor correlation of supratherapeutic international normalised ratio and vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factor levels during warfarin therapy [^113B7smd]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio (ST-INR) are at risk for bleeding. Correction of ST-INR is achieved by withholding warfarin therapy and often by supplementing vitamin K or providing vitamin K-dependent factors; the exact therapeutic decision is based on the extent of the prolonged INR. Currently, ST-INRs are frequently observed in clinical practice due to the use of sensitive recombinant tissue thromboplastin reagents and automation. However, there is limited data correlating an ST-INR with various vitamin K-dependent factors.

This prospective cohort study, set in a large tertiary care teaching hospital at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, defined the relationship between ST-INR (> 5.0) and measured vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors. Prothrombin time, INR, and vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X were measured in 78 patients with an INR > 5.0 (ST-INR) who were on warfarin therapy for more than 2 months. There was no significant relationship between the ST-INR and levels of important vitamin K-dependent factors II and X. These data support the recent guidelines that the management of an INR > 5.0 should be driven by clinical determinants rather than specific INR values per se.

### Thromboembolic events after vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate: Exploratory analyses of two randomized, plasma-controlled studies [^116D7o8K]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Health care providers prescribe warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to more than 3.4 million patients annually in the United States for various prothrombotic conditions. The Food and Drug Administration describes warfarin as among the top 10 drugs with the largest number of serious adverse drug reactions submitted during the 1990s and 2000s.

Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with prothrombotic conditions by inhibiting the synthesis of functional vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (factors [F] II, VII, IX, and X) and proteins C and S. Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists who are actively bleeding or in need of an urgent surgical procedure require rapid reversal of anticoagulation by prompt replenishment of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. In the literature and guidelines, a combination therapy of vitamin K and either plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate is recommended for acute reversal of oral anticoagulation.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant; however, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin doses. This variation, along with the necessity of maintaining a narrow therapeutic range, means that selecting the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range, and the effect on serious adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, DARE, and the NHS Health Economics Database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

- **Main results**: We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomization. However, only two studies reported adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses, with all four reporting INR in-range by day five. Despite notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I² = 83%).

### Observations on possible effects of daily vitamin k replacement, especially upon warfarin therapy [^111P3vBH]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Daily parenteral vitamin K supplement is now recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients receiving IV hyperalimentation. This approach is considered preferable to the previous recommendations of weekly parenteral or oral supplements or, in some cases, no supplement at all. Supplemental vitamin K1 ensures adequate supplies for hepatic saturation and the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulants protein C, protein S, and protein Z. However, this is not the entire story. The recommended supplement affects other physiological systems that also utilize vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation.

Vitamin K comprises two natural substances, vitamin K1 and K2, alongside synthetic K3 derivatives. It is not understood what, if any, effect might occur due to saturation or competition from vitamin K1 on the functioning of vitamin K2 and K3 derivatives concerning bone mineralization, cell growth, and blood vessel health — all known to be influenced by vitamin K. There are likely other physiological systems yet to be studied in relation to vitamin K and gamma-carboxylation.

This review also examines available research on warfarin when administered to patients receiving hyperalimentation and the effects that vitamin K supplements may have. Because studies at the time of writing have not controlled for vitamin K intake, consideration is given to whether changes in previously reported outcomes should be expected when using low-dose warfarin for prophylaxis against central vein thrombosis. Also considered are possible implications and future research directions regarding these findings.

### A comparison of the efficacy and rate of response to oral and intravenous vitamin K in reversal of over-anticoagulation with warfarin [^116a9jAH]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

The role of oral vitamin K administration in the reversal of anticoagulation is not yet clear due to a lack of data on the early effects of treatment, apparent differences in efficacy between preparations, and insufficient data comparing oral with intravenous administration. We have compared the effects on the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and activities of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration of three oral vitamin K preparations and intravenous vitamin K in 64 anticoagulated patients who required non-urgent partial correction of anticoagulation.

Our data confirm that correction of anticoagulation is more rapid after intravenous administration of vitamin K than after oral administration of similar or larger doses. At 24 hours, satisfactory correction of INR can be achieved using low-dose vitamin K given by either the intravenous or oral route. Our data, and that from previous studies, suggest that there may be differences in efficacy between orally administered products. Administration of vitamin K by either route was accompanied by changes in the activities of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors that reflected their respective biological half-lives. In the 24 hours after treatment, the relationship between the INR and the individual vitamin K-dependent clotting factors was similar to that described previously in stable anticoagulated patients.

We conclude that the reversal of anticoagulation with warfarin is achieved more rapidly by intravenous administration of vitamin K. Satisfactory, but slower, reversal can also be achieved through the oral route.

### New oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin treatment: no need for pharmacogenomics [^1111SqC1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant challenges. In addition to potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.

### Dietary vitamin K and therapeutic warfarin alter the susceptibility to vascular calcification in experimental chronic kidney disease [^116bX7C2]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is cardiovascular disease, with vascular calcification being a key modifier of disease progression. Vitamin K, a local regulator of vascular calcification, is a γ-glutamyl carboxylase substrate and an essential cofactor in the activation of several extracellular matrix proteins that inhibit calcification. Warfarin, a common therapy in dialysis patients, inhibits the recycling of vitamin K and thereby decreases the inhibitory activity of these proteins.

In this study, we sought to determine whether modifying vitamin K status, either by increasing dietary vitamin K intake or by antagonism with therapeutic doses of warfarin, could alter the development of vascular calcification in male Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD.

Treatment of CKD rats with warfarin markedly increased pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity, as well as significantly increased calcium concentrations in the thoracic aorta (3-fold), abdominal aorta (8-fold), renal artery (4-fold), and carotid artery (20-fold). In contrast, treatment with high dietary vitamin K1 increased vitamin K tissue concentrations (10–300-fold) and blunted the development of vascular calcification. Thus, vitamin K plays an important role in modifying mechanisms linked to the susceptibility of arteries to calcify in an experimental model of CKD.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^1173JdSX]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is defined as a bleeding disorder caused by insufficient activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, in which coagulation is promptly corrected by vitamin K supplementation. The process of hemostasis involves complex mechanisms including local reactions of blood vessels (vascular phase), platelet activity (platelet phase), and the interaction of several specific coagulation factors circulating in the blood (plasma phase). A disturbance in any of these factors can lead to a hemostasis process disturbance, clinically manifested as bleeding. Acquired clotting disorders may result from a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, liver disease, accelerated breakdown of coagulation factors, or coagulation inhibitors. Vitamin K is crucial for the activity of several carboxylase enzymes in liver cells. It is also required for the synthesis and activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S. Given their short half-lives, vitamin K deficiency may lead to neonatal VKDB.

The incidence of early-onset VKDB in at-risk neonates who did not receive vitamin K supplementation is between 6–12%. Among those cases that did not receive vitamin K administration before delivery, the occurrence of early-onset VKDB is 50%. Common bleeding sites include the head (cephalohematoma, intracranial), intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, or gastrointestinal tract. The severity of the clinical presentation may relate to the type of maternal treatment involved.

### Early vascular ageing in chronic kidney disease: Impact of inflammation, vitamin K, senescence and genomic damage [^116R7kvo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin K, warfarin, and VC

Evidence from preclinical studies has established a role for vitamin K in VC, mainly through the carboxylation of VKDP MGP. Initial work on the biology of MGP was conducted in a knockout mouse model, where MGP-deficient mice developed extensive calcification in both arteries and cartilage within two months. With the knowledge that MGP is vitamin K dependent, further studies evaluating the effect of vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, were conducted. Warfarin-treated mice developed coronary artery disease in vivo with a vulnerable plaque phenotype, and vitamin K administration prevented and reversed VC progression. This further suggests that vitamin K–dependent MGP was inhibited by warfarin. Such a relationship between vitamin K, warfarin, and VC has also been noted in clinical observations. Clinical and epidemiological studies have indicated that long-term warfarin treatment increases the risk of VC in certain individuals, possibly as a result of poor vitamin K status. Moreover, a recent cross-sectional observational study revealed that while the use of vitamin K antagonists contributes to the presence of VC, such an effect was not observed in non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant users, implying the exclusive role of vitamin K metabolism in VC development.

In CKD, vitamin K deficiency is highly prevalent and associated with VC and cardiovascular mortality. A prospective randomized clinical trial performed among 200 prevalent hemodialysis patients showed a dose-dependent decrease of dp-ucMGP by MK7 supplementation. Nevertheless, the recent Valkyrie study further elucidated the…

### Risk of thromboembolic events after protocolized warfarin reversal with 3-factor PCC and factor VIIa [^112Lxygi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Bleeding events and life-threatening hemorrhages are the most feared complications of warfarin therapy. Prompt anticoagulant reversal aimed at the replacement of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors is essential to promote hemostasis. A retrospective cohort study of warfarin-treated patients experiencing a life-threatening hemorrhage was performed. This included patients treated with an institution-specific warfarin reversal protocol (post-implementation group) and those who received the prior standard of care (pre-implementation group).

The reversal protocol incorporated vitamin K, 3-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VIIa. Researchers recorded demographic and clinical information, anticoagulant reversal details, and all adverse events attributed to warfarin reversal. A total of 227 patients were included in the final analysis — 109 in the pre-implementation group and 118 in the post-implementation group. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between both groups, except for higher average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores in the post-implementation group (P = 0.0005).

The most common indication for anticoagulation reversal was intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Prereversal international normalized ratios (INRs) were similar in both groups. The attainment of INR normalization to less than 1.4 was higher, and rebound INR was lower in the post-implementation group (P < .0001; p = 0.0013). However, thromboembolic complications were significantly higher in the post-implementation group (P = 0.003). Elevated baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and the presence of a mechanical valve as an indication were contributing factors.

### Role of dietary vitamin K intake in chronic oral anticoagulation: prospective evidence from observational and randomized protocols [^117PmMLZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The potential association between vitamin K intake and coagulation instability has been explored primarily in case reports and small, retrospective, uncontrolled studies. We prospectively evaluated the effects of dietary vitamin K intake on anticoagulation parameters.

In an observational protocol, clinical characteristics and vitamin K intake, assessed semiquantitatively, were evaluated in 39 outpatients who made 230 visits to our anticoagulation clinic. In a randomized crossover protocol, 12 patients with stable anticoagulation underwent 4-day in-hospital dietary interventions, 1 to 2 weeks apart, providing a 500% increase and an 80% decrease in vitamin K intake relative to the baseline level.

Univariate analysis of the observational data demonstrated a progressive, statistically significant inverse association between the vitamin K intake score and different levels of anticoagulation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that vitamin K intake was independently associated with both overcoagulation and undercoagulation. In the randomized protocol, the international normalized ratio increased from 2.6 ± 0.5 at baseline to 3.3 ± 0.9 at day 7 (P = 0.005) in subjects on the vitamin K-depleted diet and decreased from 3.1 ± 0.8 at baseline to 2.8 ± 0.6 at day 4 (P = 0.04) in those on the vitamin K-enriched diet.

Our prospective data strengthen the concept that the interaction between vitamin K and coumarin is a clinically relevant, major independent factor that interferes with anticoagulation stability.

### Vitamin K deficiency from long-term warfarin anticoagulation does not alter skeletal status in male rhesus monkeys [^117UWVLw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin K inadequacy may cause bone loss; hence, vitamin K deficiency induced by anticoagulants such as warfarin may be an osteoporosis risk factor. The skeletal impact of long-term warfarin anticoagulation was evaluated in male monkeys. No effect on bone mineral density (BMD) or bone markers of skeletal turnover was observed. This study suggests that warfarin-induced vitamin K deficiency does not have skeletal effects.

The skeletal role of vitamin K remains unclear. It is reasonable that a potential role of vitamin K in bone health could be elucidated by studying patients receiving oral anticoagulants that act to produce vitamin K deficiency. However, some, but not all, reports find vitamin K deficiency induced by warfarin anticoagulation to be associated with low bone mass. Additionally, epidemiologic studies have found warfarin use to be associated with either increased or no change in fracture risk. Such divergent results may imply that human studies are compromised by the physical illnesses for which warfarin was prescribed.

To remove this potential confounder, we prospectively assessed skeletal status during long-term warfarin anticoagulation of healthy nonhuman primates. Twenty adult (age, 7.4–17.9 years, mean, 11.7 years) male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were randomized to daily warfarin treatment or control groups. Bone mass of the total body, lumbar spine, and distal and central radius was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of warfarin treatment. Serum chemistries, urinary calcium excretion, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and total and percent u

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112zc5WW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Very limited data exist on the role of NOACs in other hypercoagulable states such as inherited coagulopathies, including homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency, and elevated levels of factors VII–XII, or in the nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with these conditions were significantly underrepresented in the trials.

Dabigatran was prescribed to a 21-year-old woman with recurrent venous thromboembolisms (reVTEs) caused by protein C deficiency, complicated by warfarin-induced skin necrosis and inability to maintain anticoagulation on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). The patient did not experience any VTE recurrence in 6 months of follow-up. Rivaroxaban was prescribed to a 30-year-old woman with homozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation, who sustained an ovarian vein thrombosis with proximal extension to the renal vein. The patient remained free of symptoms, without recurrence of thrombi or bleeding complications. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have also been used for secondary prophylaxis in a few patients with nephrotic syndrome. Anticoagulation in these patients has traditionally been achieved with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or heparins.

### Coumadin [^111nwPXz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post-ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration; however, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of Coumadin may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Coumadin is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans but generally has a more rapid clearance.

- **Absorption**: Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed.

### Supplemental vitamin K improves the stability of anticoagulation in a patient with low tissue stores of vitamin K secondary to coeliac disease [^116V2ZvH]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Maintenance of a patient's international normalised ratio (INR) within the appropriate target range remains a challenge in clinical practice. The effects of medication, alcohol, and compliance on stable control are well documented. Recent evidence also shows that supplemental vitamin K in patients with low body stores improves the stability of INR in these patients.

Here, the case of a 57-year-old with coeliac disease requiring warfarin for a metallic mitral valve, who had poor INR stability resulting in thrombotic and bleeding complications, is described. Her vitamin K body stores were extremely low. Supplementation of vitamin K (100 μg daily) resulted in improvement in anticoagulation stability (mean (SD) 3.41 (1.68) vs 4.68 (3.34)). The percentage time spent within target INR range doubled following vitamin K supplementation. This case illustrates a relatively new approach to managing patients with highly unstable INR levels and provides extra understanding of factors influencing INR stability.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^113F3oUj]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents, particularly with respect to supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, the 2013 guidelines from the British Society for Haematology recommend withholding 1–2 doses of warfarin and reducing the maintenance dose for patients with an INR > 5.0 who are not bleeding.

### Welchol [^111tVWvs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies**: WELCHOL may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients susceptible to deficiencies in vitamin K, such as those on warfarin or with malabsorption syndromes, may be at an increased risk when taking WELCHOL. It is recommended that patients on oral vitamin supplementation take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to WELCHOL [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Drug interactions**: WELCHOL reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Therefore, drugs known to interact with WELCHOL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to taking WELCHOL [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Due to the potential decreased absorption of other drugs not yet tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, it is advisable to administer them at least 4 hours before WELCHOL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU)**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with PKU. WELCHOL for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 3.75 gram packet contains 27 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing WELCHOL for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including WELCHOL for oral suspension.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - Is there a general consensus [^11382rdD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. With an aging population, the number of people requiring chronic oral anticoagulation to manage conditions such as atrial fibrillation is increasing. Options for anticoagulation have been increasing; currently available options include vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, primarily warfarin) and the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). However, several studies describe the risk of hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants. VKA use has been associated with more than double the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared to non-use, while patients receiving DOAC therapy have a lower or comparable risk of ICH or major bleeding compared with VKA therapy. While DOACs have significantly changed the anticoagulation therapy landscape, DOAC-treated patients remain at some risk of major bleeding, affecting up to 5% of patients based on clinical trial data.

Prompt anticoagulation reversal during severe or life-threatening bleeding events is a key component of multimodal therapy in these complex and fortunately rare clinical scenarios. However, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit–risk ratio of supporting hemostasis and potentially promoting post-reversal thrombosis. The advisability of administering reversal agents depends upon several clinical factors, including patient stability, timing of the last anticoagulant dose, and baseline coagulation assays, particularly the international normalized ratio (INR).

### Xeloda [^113ozRkt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists**: Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking Xeloda concomitantly with oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) have been reported in patients who were on stable doses of a vitamin K antagonist at the time Xeloda was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating Xeloda and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping Xeloda. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases.

Monitor INR more frequently and adjust the dose of the vitamin K antagonist as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Calciphylaxis arising following bariatric surgery: A case series [^1163AfjV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Recently, the role of vitamin K deficiency in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis has gathered growing evidence. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has been shown to promote vascular calcification in animal models by inhibiting the carboxylation of endothelial matrix Gla protein. Functional vitamin K deficiency, resulting from warfarin use and other causes, is associated with an increased risk of calciphylaxis among patients undergoing dialysis. Although vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, its deficiency has not been frequently reported, except after biliopancreatic diversion. Of the three patients in this case series with available data, all had low serum vitamin K levels.

Although uncommon, a subset of patients may develop protein-calorie malnutrition. This complication occurs frequently in RYGB and is associated with the length of the common channel, as it determines the length of the small intestine available for the mixture of pancreatic secretions with dietary protein. Low levels of albumin in 3 patients in our series could suggest malnutrition; however, this is confounded by the underlying inflammation as a result of calciphylaxis itself, as well as other comorbidities.

This case series suggests that clinicians should consider calciphylaxis in the differential diagnosis for painful skin lesions arising after weight loss surgery. This is particularly true if the patients show signs of micronutrient deficiencies or malnutrition. Overall, bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for obesity that can improve the health-related quality of life for these patients, but careful monitoring is necessary.

### Unique secretion mode of human protein Z: its Gla domain is responsible for inefficient, vitamin K-dependent and warfarin-sensitive secretion [^115p8GFs]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Protein Z is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that is involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. Plasma concentrations of protein Z vary widely between subjects and are greatly reduced during warfarin therapy. We developed a sensitive and quantitative assay for protein secretion using a secretory luciferase to explore the mode of secretion of protein Z compared with that of factor X.

Protein Z secretion was much less efficient than factor X and was totally dependent upon added vitamin K, while factor X secretion was not. Protein Z secretion was highly sensitive to warfarin treatment of the synthesizing cells. In contrast, although factor X secretion was not precluded by warfarin, its gamma-carboxylation was completely blocked.

An exchange of the propeptide and/or gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain between protein Z and factor X reproduced the inefficient and warfarin-sensitive secretion pattern of protein Z, and vice versa. Joining of the propeptide and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain to luciferase also demonstrated that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of protein Z was responsible for its warfarin-sensitive secretion. Thus, it was concluded that the difference observed in secretion patterns of protein Z and factor X was mainly based on the structure of their gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domains.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin.

### The association of vitamin K status with warfarin sensitivity at the onset of treatment [^114c4bMp]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

We investigated the association of vitamin K status with warfarin sensitivity among 40 orthopaedic patients beginning perioperative algorithm-dosed warfarin. Baseline vitamin K status was assessed using plasma vitamin K-1 and vitamin K-1 2,3 epoxide concentrations, along with a questionnaire-based estimation of usual vitamin K intake. Warfarin sensitivity was assessed through the increase in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) after two doses of 5 mg of warfarin and the 4-day accumulation of under-gamma-carboxylated prothrombin (PIVKA-II), adjusted for warfarin dose requirement.

Multivariate models were used to assess vitamin K variables as predictors of warfarin sensitivity. The mean INR increase was 0.53 U, and the mean PIVKA-II increase was 771 ng/ml/mg warfarin. Demographic factors were not associated with warfarin response. For each 1 standard deviation (SD) lower value of plasma vitamin K-1 — but not the other vitamin K variables — the INR rose 0.24 U (P ≤ 0.01). A higher usual vitamin K intake and plasma vitamin K-1, along with lower plasma vitamin K-1 2,3 epoxide, were all associated with a lower PIVKA-II increase over 4 days. Respective differences in PIVKA-II accumulation per SD increase of each variable were -165, -218, and 236 ng/ml/mg warfarin (all P ≤ 0.05). We concluded that dietary and biochemical measures of vitamin K status were associated with early warfarin sensitivity.

### Vitamin K supplementation can improve stability of anticoagulation for patients with unexplained variability in response to warfarin [^115PV8T3]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Patients receiving warfarin who have unstable control of anticoagulation have a significantly lower intake of dietary vitamin K compared with their stable counterparts. We hypothesized that supplementation with oral vitamin K would improve stability in patients with previously unstable control of anticoagulation. Seventy warfarin-treated patients with unstable anticoagulation control were randomly assigned in a double-blinded fashion to receive a daily amount of 150 μg oral vitamin K or placebo orally for 6 months.

Measures of stability of anticoagulation control in the 6-month study period were compared with those in the 6 months immediately prior. Vitamin K supplementation resulted in a significantly greater decrease in the standard deviation of international normalized ratio (INR) compared with placebo (-0.24 ± 0.14 vs. -0.11 ± 0.18; P < .001) and a significantly greater increase in percentage time within target INR range (28% ± 20% vs. 15% ± 20%; P < .01).

Anticoagulation control improved in 33 of 35 patients receiving vitamin K supplementation; of these, 19 fulfilled our criteria for having stable control of anticoagulation. However, only 24 of 33 patients receiving placebo demonstrated some degree of improvement, with only 7 patients fulfilling the criteria for having stable control. Concomitant supplementation of vitamin K, perhaps through reducing the relative day-to-day variability in dietary vitamin K intake, can significantly improve anticoagulation control in patients with unexplained instability of response to warfarin.

### Concerns about clinical efficacy and safety of warfarin in diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation [^115AaiME]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin exerts anticoagulant effects by inhibiting the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. However, this type of posttranslational modification is also essential for the proper functioning of other gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) proteins, such as osteocalcin (bone Gla protein) and matrix Gla protein (MGP). Osteocalcin-deficient mice have been shown to develop hyperostosis, whereas gamma-carboxylation confers a greater calcium-binding capacity to osteocalcin, playing a crucial role in normal bone mineralization. Therefore, warfarin may have deleterious effects on bone health.

Circulating vitamin K levels were decreased in women with osteoporotic hip fractures and inversely correlated with the incidence of vertebral fractures. High levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of low vitamin K status, were associated with reduced lumbar bone mineral density and predicted an increased risk of hip fracture in healthy women. Moreover, the intake of vitamin K-rich food is restricted in AF patients receiving warfarin. Consistent with these findings, the risk of osteoporotic bone fracture was reported to be significantly increased in elderly patients with AF receiving long-term warfarin therapy compared with untreated subjects. A meta-analysis revealed that the risk of bone fracture was significantly lower in AF patients receiving NOACs compared with warfarin. As is the case with AF, osteoporotic bone fracture is increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, especially in those with a long-term disease history. Given these patterns, the potential impact of warfarin on bone health warrants cautious consideration for diabetic patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^1175Tffp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Adverse events of interest when reversing VKAs are a significant concern. Although the association of PCCs with thromboembolic events has historically been a concern, small prospective studies investigating the use of PCCs have reported a low incidence of these events (0%–4.6%). Two comprehensive reviews evaluating the safety and thrombogenicity of PCCs concluded that patients treated with PCCs for VKA reversal have a low risk of thromboembolic events. The meta-analysis conducted by Dentali et al. estimated the incidence of these events as 1.8% (95% CI = 1.0 to 3.0) in patients treated with 4F-PCCs. A pharmacovigilance study of safety data on the 4F-PCC used in this study, collected from February 1996 to March 2012, also reported a low incidence of thromboembolic complications (approximately one event per 31,000 infusions). In the present study, thromboembolic events occurred with similar frequencies in the 4F-PCC and plasma treatment groups. Thromboembolism may occur in this patient population due to underlying predisposing risk factors, the acute medical condition for which they are being treated, their acute care hospitalization or, finally, either a delay in reinitiating or the complete withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy, rather than the treatment option used for VKA reversal.

Observational data, including the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) hemovigilance reporting scheme, have shown that plasma use is associated with fluid overload events. A lower incidence of fluid overload and related cardiac events would be expected in patients treated with 4F-PCC.

### Vitamin K2 for the reversal of warfarin-related coagulopathy [^114qgYrG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation recommends vitamin K1 for warfarin-related coagulopathy. In Japan, vitamin K2 is used more commonly for this purpose. The difference between vitamins K1 and K2 in reversing warfarin-related coagulopathy has not been discussed. Herein, we report a case that was reversed with vitamin K2; alterations in vitamins K1 and K2 levels and coagulation markers are also presented.

### Warfarin poisoning with delayed rebound toxicity [^111rh7J8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intentional poisoning with warfarin is not the same as over-anticoagulation, for which guidelines exist. The coagulopathy resulting from a warfarin overdose is reversed with vitamin K1, the dose and timing of which is often guided by experience with the management of over-anticoagulation with warfarin therapy rather than acute overdose.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a 50-year-old man who ingested an unknown amount of his warfarin, venlafaxine, and paracetamol. He presented with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5, which steadily increased over 24 hours to 7, despite receiving an initial 1 mg of vitamin K1. He was then treated with 5 mg vitamin K1, and once the INR returned to 4.5, 40 hours post-ingestion, he was discharged home. He was also treated with a full course of acetylcysteine for the paracetamol overdose. The following day his INR rebounded to 8.5, and he suffered a spontaneous epistaxis requiring readmission; he was treated with low titrated doses of vitamin K1. The warfarin concentration was 74.6 μg/mL 26 hours post-ingestion and decreased to 3.7 μg/mL over 72 hours.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Our case highlights the risk of a rebound elevated INR even 3 days after acute warfarin overdose despite treatment with vitamin K1. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of vitamin K1 in comparison with warfarin, repeat INR testing, and continued treatment with oral vitamin K1 may help avoid complications of rebound coagulopathy in warfarin overdose.

### New oral anticoagulants: A view from the laboratory [^1174MV8J]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacological, biochemical, and clinical features distinct from those of warfarin. Focusing on laboratory perspectives, this article compares and contrasts the pharmacological and biochemical properties of the new oral anticoagulants with those of warfarin and uses this information to speculate on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the clinical features that differentiate the new agents from warfarin.

### A genome-wide crispr-cas9 knockout screen identifies FSP1 as the warfarin-resistant vitamin K reductase [^113LnQvj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: VKD carboxylation relies on the redox cycling of vitamin K. In vitro studies suggest that vitamin K is reduced to KH₂, the active form of the vitamin for VKD carboxylation, via two pathways: a warfarin-sensitive DTT-dependent pathway and a warfarin-resistant NAD(P)H-dependent pathway. VKOR was proposed to be responsible for the warfarin-sensitive pathway, and the enzyme for the warfarin-resistant (or the antidotal) pathway was proposed to be NQO1. However, we have previously shown that high doses of vitamin K sufficiently rescued warfarin poisoning in both wild-type and NQO1-deficient mice. The warfarin-resistant VKR activity, distinct from VKOR and NQO1, was detected in both wild-type and NQO1-knockout mice, suggesting that NQO1 was not the warfarin-resistant VKR.

	- Whether VKOR is sufficient for the two-step reduction of K epoxide to KH₂, and whether the antidotal effect of vitamin K is due to the competition between vitamin K and warfarin for binding to VKOR, or due to the existence of a warfarin-resistant VKR (antidotal enzyme) that bypasses dysfunctional VKOR, have all remained elusive.

### Vitamin K antagonists — current concepts and challenges [^1139KZCD]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have, for decades, been the cornerstone of anticoagulation in the outpatient setting. While the long half-life makes once-daily administration practical, close monitoring of VKA effect is necessary because these medicines have a narrow therapeutic index. Despite inter-individual variations in response to VKA doses, the increasing availability of specialized anticoagulation monitoring systems, along with a better understanding of potential drug and dietary interactions, has made the use of VKAs safer and less burdensome. In the future, newer classes of oral anticoagulants and genomic-based dosing strategies may further expand or improve the management options for many patients at risk for thromboembolism.

### Rapid reversal of warfarin-associated hemorrhage in the emergency department by prothrombin complex concentrates [^111584R4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Life-threatening warfarin-associated hemorrhage is common and has a high mortality rate. In the United States, the most commonly used therapies — fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K — are slow and unpredictable, often resulting in volume overload. Outside the United States, prothrombin complex concentrates, which are pooled plasma products, are frequently used; they reverse warfarin anticoagulation in minutes rather than hours. This article reviews the literature related to warfarin reversal using fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant factor VIIa. It provides elements for a management protocol based on this literature.

### Role of prothrombin complex concentrates in reversing warfarin anticoagulation: A review of the literature [^1114be4B]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Over-anticoagulation is a common problem with warfarin therapy and can lead to major or life-threatening bleeding. The goal of urgent warfarin reversal is to elevate or replace vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

In the United States, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is considered the standard of care for warfarin reversal. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) offer an alternative to FFP for rapidly replacing deficient clotting factors and correcting the international normalized ratio (INR). However, few prospective clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these concentrates relative to other treatment modalities.

A review of the published literature over the last 30 years found that PCCs offer a rapid and specific method for replacing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and restoring normal hemostasis in the context of over-coagulation. In those studies in which PCCs were compared with FFP, PCCs were found more effective in shortening the time to INR correction and were associated with a low risk of thrombotic adverse events. Evidence-based treatment guidelines are needed to optimize the use of PCCs for warfarin reversal.

### Fracture risks in patients treated with different oral anticoagulants: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yprsH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly prescribed to prevent or treat thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is a traditional OAC and has been a primary long-term treatment option for these conditions for decades. Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been approved as alternatives and have demonstrated similar or superior efficacy and safety compared to warfarin. Because aging is one of the strongest risk factors for both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, the prescription of OACs has gradually increased in the aging population worldwide.

Some studies have suggested that warfarin may increase fracture risks via its vitamin K antagonizing effect, which impairs bone mineralization. In contrast, NOACs are independent of mechanisms associated with vitamin K antagonists. However, there is conflicting evidence on the association between warfarin and fracture risks. A cohort study published in 2017 first compared the fracture risk associated with an NOAC (dabigatran) and warfarin, reporting a significantly lower fracture risk in dabigatran users. Another cohort study in 2017 observed no significant difference in fracture risks among patients taking NOACs (both dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors) and warfarin. In 2018, a meta-analysis based on 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that patients treated with these medications did not demonstrate a consistent pattern in terms of fracture risks.

### Influence of dietary vitamin K intake on subtherapeutic oral anticoagulant therapy [^112A6w7i]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear what advice should be given to patients using vitamin K antagonists with respect to dietary vitamin K intake. We performed a nested case-control study in patients attending a Dutch anticoagulation clinic to determine the association between vitamin K intake and subtherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, and the interaction between usual and recent vitamin K intake. Compared to patients with a normal usual vitamin K intake, those with a high vitamin K intake had a decreased risk of a subtherapeutic INR [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56–1.16], and patients with a low vitamin K intake had an increased risk (HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.79–2.25). In patients with a low usual vitamin K intake, recent vitamin K intake was twice as high in cases as in controls (164 vs. 85 microg/d). Such a difference was not observed in patients with a normal or high usual vitamin K intake.

Our results suggest that a high vitamin K intake reduces the risk of a low INR by lessening the influence of incidental consumption of vitamin K-rich food on the INR. These findings support the recommendation for patients on vitamin K antagonists to eat a sufficient amount of vitamin K-containing foods.

### Effect of vitamin K intake on the stability of oral anticoagulant treatment: Dose-response relationships in healthy subjects [^115sodWX]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants exert their effect by blocking the utilization of vitamin K, yet little is known about the competitive aspects of their interaction with dietary vitamin K. We carried out systematic dose-response studies in healthy volunteers who had been stably anticoagulated and maintained on their individualized doses for 13 weeks. First, we studied the response to weekly incremental doses (50 microg-500 microg) of vitamin K(1) supplements (K(1)) taken daily for 7 days. The threshold K(1) dose causing a statistically significant lowering of the INR was 150 microg/day. In 25% of the participants, the INR change was regarded as clinically relevant at a vitamin K intake of 150 microg/day. Circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin did not decrease until 300 microg K(1)/day compared with 100 microg K(1)/day for undercarboxylated FII, suggesting differential antidotal effects on bone and hepatic gamma-carboxylation. Next, we tested the response to vitamin K-rich food items. The short-lived response after meals of spinach and broccoli suggested an inefficient bioavailability from these two sources. We conclude that short-term variability in intake of K(1) is less important to fluctuations in the international normalized ratio (INR) than has been commonly assumed and that food supplements providing 100 microg/day of vitamin K(1) do not significantly interfere with oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Oral vitamin K versus placebo to correct excessive anticoagulation in patients receiving warfarin: A randomized trial [^117XsE7u]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Low-dose oral vitamin K decreases the international normalized ratio (INR) in overanticoagulated patients who receive warfarin therapy; however, its effects on bleeding events are uncertain.

- **Objective**: To determine whether low-dose oral vitamin K reduces bleeding events over 90 days in patients with warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

- **Design**: This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial used computer-generated randomization. Participants were assigned to trial groups via sequentially numbered study drug containers. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment assignment.

- **Setting**: The trial was conducted across 14 anticoagulant therapy clinics located in Canada, the United States, and Italy.

- **Patients**: The study included nonbleeding patients with INR values ranging from 4.5 to 10.0.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral vitamin K, 1.25 mg (355 patients, with 347 analyzed), or a matching placebo (369 patients, with 365 analyzed).

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome measured was bleeding events, while secondary outcomes included thromboembolism and death.

- **Results**: Bleeding complications occurred in 56 patients (15.8%) in the vitamin K group and 60 patients (16.3%) in the placebo group, with an absolute difference of -0.5 percentage point (95% CI, -6.1 to 5.1 percentage points). Major bleeding events were observed in 9 patients (2.5%) in the vitamin K group and 4 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group, with an absolute difference of 1.5 percentage points (CI, -0.8 to 3.7 percentage points). Thromboembolism occurred in 4 patients (1.1%) in the vitamin K group and 3 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group, resulting in an absolute difference of 0.3 percentage points.

### New strategies for effective treatment of vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding [^117F8XaC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been used as oral anticoagulants in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events for over half a century. Although these antagonists are effective in managing thromboembolic events, the need for routine monitoring and the associated risk of bleeding has led to the development and approval of direct oral anticoagulants for specific clinical indications. Despite these advancements, vitamin K antagonists remain the oral anticoagulants of choice in many clinical conditions. Severe bleeding associated with oral anticoagulation necessitates urgent reversal. Several options for reversing the effects of vitamin K antagonists exist, including vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates, and plasma. In this manuscript, we review evidence and provide physicians with treatment strategies for more effective management of vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^116URsgW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, clinicians prescribe the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin to 3.4 million patients each year for the treatment and prophylaxis of various prothrombotic conditions. Although effective for this indication, its use is often associated with adverse drug-related events; data collected between 2007 and 2009 implicate warfarin as the medication associated with the largest number of adverse drug events requiring emergency treatment in patients over 65 years of age. These events most commonly manifest as acute bleeding and result in an estimated 33,000 hospitalizations per year.

Patients receiving VKAs often require rapid anticoagulation reversal when they present with major bleeding or require urgent surgical or invasive procedures. Treatment options include vitamin K (oral or intravenous [IV]) concomitant with plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). PCCs are lyophilized concentrates of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, either activated or nonactivated. Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of nonactivated PCCs rather than plasma for rapid VKA reversal in case of major bleeding or prior to urgent surgery or other invasive procedures. Currently, plasma is the most commonly used agent for VKA reversal in many countries, particularly in those where PCCs are not licensed for use.

Recently, two phase IIIb clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nonactivated four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) versus plasma for urgent VKA reversal.

### Bleeding of unknown cause and unclassified bleeding disorders; diagnosis, pathophysiology and management [^1155Vy2p]. Haemophilia (2020). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, bleeding tendency can be caused by vitamin K deficiency, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, acute kidney injury, platelet dysfunction/hypofunction, clotting factor dysfunction or deficiency, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficiency, hyperviscosity, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, bleeding tendency can be caused by medications such as tazemetostat, ramucirumab, propylthiouracil, epoprostenol, cobimetinib, caplacizumab, avapritinib, cefdinir, and binimetinib.

### Perioperative hemostatic management of patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^113SRUW5]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians, including anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists, are frequently called on to correct coagulopathy in patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy. Before elective surgery, anticoagulation reversal may be undertaken over several days by discontinuing warfarin or vitamin K treatment, but rapid correction is required in an emergency.

European and American guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) for anticoagulation reversal in patients with life-threatening bleeding and an increased international normalized ratio. Compared with human fresh frozen plasma, PCCs provide quicker correction of the international normalized ratio and improved bleeding control. Although there are historic concerns regarding potential infectious and thrombotic risks with PCCs, PCC formulations are much improved.

Recombinant activated factor VII is a potential alternative to PCCs, but preclinical comparisons suggest that PCCs are more effective in correcting coagulopathy. Although many patients who require rapid reversal of warfarin are currently treated with fresh frozen plasma, PCCs should be considered as an alternative therapy.

### Novel anticoagulants and the future of anticoagulation [^114w4iNK]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Since its discovery during the first half of the 20th century by biochemists at the University of Wisconsin, warfarin (along with other vitamin K antagonists) has remained the only oral anticoagulant available to patients at risk for thromboembolism. After nearly six decades in clinical practice, much has been learned about warfarin. Although it is highly effective for most patients, warfarin has a number of undesirable attributes: significant inter- and intra-patient variability in dose-response, a narrow therapeutic index, a slow pharmacodynamic response, and numerous interactions with both diet and other medications.

The negative characteristics associated with warfarin have inspired many clinicians, patients, and researchers to wonder if a better alternative can be discovered. To that end, at least three novel anticoagulant compounds are in the late stages of development, and several others are progressing through earlier phases of investigation.

This review will summarize the latest clinical trial data pertinent to several newer antithrombotic agents and discuss recent developments that impact the safety and challenges associated with warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA).

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^115syHSH]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients taking antithrombotic agents, specifically those on warfarin, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering a 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (25–50 units/kg) and vitamin K (5 mg IV, for one dose) in patients experiencing major bleeding while on warfarin.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: An integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^116Ucp6f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Our study has a number of strengths and limitations. The analyses presented here use data from the two largest, prospective, randomized controlled trials of VKA reversal. However, neither of the trials was powered to demonstrate significant differences between the treatment groups for safety outcomes. Although there may be pathophysiologic differences between preoperative patients and bleeding patients, pooling the data from the two studies allows further investigation of rare events such as thromboembolic events, fluid overload events, and deaths, providing an overall assessment of 4F‐PCC safety in patients requiring VKA reversal in two settings.

Another limitation was that the clinicians and study investigators could not be blinded to study treatment allocation due to differences in the administration of 4F‐PCC and plasma. However, a blinded SAB assessed deaths and serious thromboembolic events for relatedness to treatment.

### Xeloda [^117TStZe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of vitamin K antagonists**: Advise patients on vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, that they are at an increased risk of severe bleeding while taking Xeloda. These patients should have their INR monitored more frequently, and dosage modifications of the vitamin K antagonist may be required while taking and after discontinuation of Xeloda. Patients should be advised to immediately contact their healthcare provider if signs or symptoms of bleeding occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Serious adverse reactions from dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency**: Inform patients of the potential for serious and life-threatening adverse reactions due to DPD deficiency and discuss with them whether they should be tested for genetic variants of DPYD that are associated with an increased risk of serious adverse reactions from the use of Xeloda. Patients should contact their healthcare provider immediately if symptoms of severe mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

- **Cardiotoxicity**: Advise patients of the risk of cardiotoxicity and to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Diarrhea**: Inform patients experiencing grade 2 diarrhea (an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools) to notify their healthcare provider.

These patient counseling points are crucial to ensure safe and effective use of Xeloda.

### Oral vitamin K lowers the international normalized ratio more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy. A randomized, controlled trial [^111rpkVU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002).

Excessive anticoagulation due to warfarin use is associated with hemorrhage. Subcutaneously administered vitamin K has not been evaluated for the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy, yet it is widely used.

- **Objective**: To show that oral vitamin K is more effective than subcutaneous vitamin K in the treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

- **Design**: Randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Two teaching hospitals.

- **Patients**: Patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0.

- **Intervention**: Warfarin therapy was withheld, and 1 mg of vitamin K was given orally or subcutaneously.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome measure was the INR on the day after administration of vitamin K. Secondary outcome measures were hemorrhage and thrombosis during a 1-month follow-up period.

- **Results**: Fifteen of 26 patients receiving oral vitamin K and six of 25 patients receiving subcutaneous vitamin K had therapeutic INRs on the day after study drug administration (P = 0.015; odds ratio, 4.32 [95% CI, 1.13 to 17.44]).

- **Conclusion**: Oral vitamin K lowers INR more rapidly than subcutaneous vitamin K in asymptomatic patients who have supratherapeutic INR values while receiving warfarin.

### Vitamin K for improved anticoagulation control in patients receiving warfarin [^111CPwot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Effective use of warfarin involves keeping the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range. However, patients respond widely to their dose of warfarin. Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation can lead to increased clot formation. There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of concomitant supplementation of low-dose oral vitamin K for anticoagulation control in patients being initiated on or taking a maintenance dose of warfarin.

- **Search methods**: To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011). To identify primary studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014), Ovid MEDLINE (R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations database and Ovid MEDLINE (R) (OvidSP) (1946 to 25 February 2014), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to week 8 of 2014), Science Citation Index Expanded™ & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science™) (1945 to 27 February 2014), and the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014). We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of vitamin K versus placebo.

### Vitamin K-dependent matrix gla protein as multifaceted protector of vascular and tissue integrity [^114LHD6A]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist widely prescribed to reduce coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors. Patients on warfarin treatment are prone to develop vascular calcification. Specimens of aortic valves were obtained from 45 patients (57.8% women; mean age, 71 years) undergoing heart transplantation with clinically manifest aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency, among whom 10 patients received preoperative treatment with vitamin K antagonists. The grade of aortic valve calcification in patients with preoperative fenprocoumon treatment was twofold greater than in matched controls without such treatment. A post hoc patient-level meta-analysis of eight prospective randomized trials compared the changes in coronary percent atheroma volume and the calcium index in matched arterial segments of patients with coronary artery disease who were treated (n = 171) or not (n = 4129) with warfarin during an 18- to 24-month period. A significantly greater annualized increase in calcium index was observed in warfarin-treated compared with nonwarfarin-treated patients (median 0.03 versus 0.02; P < 0.001). A patient-matched cohort (n = 164 per group) produced confirmatory results; the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of having a greater calcium index in relation to warfarin treatment was 1.16 (CI, 1.05–1.28; P = 0.003).

### Optimizing warfarin reversal — an ex vivo study [^114qgKdn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Warfarin reversal is a common clinical situation. This is commonly performed using vitamin K and, depending on the urgency, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), or activated factor VII. Even though PCCs are widely used, the ideal dosing regimen is far from established.

- **Objectives**: To verify differences in warfarin reversal patterns using FFP, recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa), and PCC; and to test the hypothesis that supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratios (INRs) might not correlate with thrombin generation (TG) and identify the ideal concentrations of PCC required to reverse various INR thresholds.

- **Methods**: We studied the effects of FFP, rFVIIa, and Beriplex P/N on the INR and TG, using the calibrated automated thrombography assay in ex vivo warfarinized plasma. Plasmas with different INRs were spiked with different concentrations of Beriplex P/N.

- **Results**: Beriplex P/N was the only agent that completely normalized TG and the INR. The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and the peak thrombin showed a significant negative correlation with all INRs. The ETP and velocity of TG reached a plateau at an INR of approximately 4.0. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 30 IU kg(-1) Beriplex P/N normalized the ETP, the INR, FII, FVII, FIX, and FX of samples with INRs ≥ 4.0. Higher doses resulted in hypercoagulable TG patterns. A concentration equivalent to a dose of 20 IU kg(-1) was sufficient to reverse warfarin at an INR range of 2.0–3.9, as judged by the same tests.

- **Conclusions**: Warfarin reversal algorithms could be simplified.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^1156yJMb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were first introduced in the 1920s from studies on the "hemorrhagic" effect of spoiled sweet clover consumption by cattle and have evolved ever since to the cornerstone of oral anticoagulation therapy. The most commonly used VKA in the United States is warfarin, while in some European countries, acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon are commonly used. VKAs exhibit their anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the post‐translational modification of vitamin K–dependent proteins. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 results in impaired synthesis of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as of anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z. The primary indications for VKA use are prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or mechanical cardiac valves.

Although VKAs are efficacious in the prevention and treatment of VTE and AF‐related thromboembolic complications, their use has some hindrances. First, the dose required to provide therapeutic anticoagulation is highly variable between individuals. It is influenced by various pharmacogenetic parameters, such as polymorphisms affecting VKA pharmacokinetics (cytochrome CYP2C9 gene that regulates VKAs hepatic metabolism) and pharmacodynamics (VKORC1 gene). Second, co‐administration of other medications…

### Implementation of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin with point-of-care genetic testing in three UK clinics: a matched cohort study [^116V2Rqs]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is widely used as an anticoagulant in the UK and internationally. It is an effective treatment for venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of embolic strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin can be challenging to use because of its narrow therapeutic index and the difficulty in predicting individual dose requirements, with maintenance doses varying from 0.5 to 20 mg/day.

The response to warfarin is monitored using the international normalized ratio (INR), with a target range between 2 and 3 in patients with AF; doses are subsequently increased, decreased, or maintained depending on the INR value. It is important to establish the maintenance dose early as it reduces both the risk of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and the number of clinic visits required for INR monitoring, increasing convenience for both patients and clinics.

Many factors influence warfarin dose requirements, including demographic, clinical, and genetic factors.

- **Genetic factors**: These have the greatest influence. Two key genetic variants are found in the CYP2C9 gene, which is involved in the metabolism of warfarin. Individuals carrying these variants have reduced metabolic capacity with an increased warfarin half-life, therefore requiring a lower dose to achieve a therapeutic INR. Another significant variant is located in the vitamin K epoxide reductase gene, VKORC1, an activator of the extrinsic clotting pathway, which warfarin antagonizes. Variation in VKORC1 also influences warfarin dose.

### Management and dosing of warfarin therapy [^112abAKR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

When initiating warfarin therapy, clinicians should avoid loading doses that can excessively raise the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Instead, warfarin should be started with a 5-mg dose (or 2 to 4 mg in the very elderly). With a 5-mg initial dose, the INR will not rise appreciably in the first 24 hours, except in rare patients who ultimately require a very small daily dose (0.5 to 2.0 mg).

Adjusting a steady-state warfarin dose depends on measured INR values and clinical factors; the dose does not need to be adjusted for a single INR slightly out of range. Most changes should alter the total weekly dose by 5% to 20%. The INR should be monitored frequently (e.g. 2 to 4 times per week) immediately after initiation of warfarin; subsequently, the interval between INR tests can be lengthened gradually (up to a maximum of 4 to 6 weeks) in patients with stable INR values.

Patients with an elevated INR will need more frequent testing and may also require vitamin K1. For example, a nonbleeding patient with an INR of 9 can be given low-dose vitamin K1 (e.g. 2.5 mg phytonadione, by mouth). Patients with an excessive INR and clinically significant bleeding require clotting factors (e.g. fresh-frozen plasma) as well as vitamin K1.

### Optimizing quality care for the oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) [^1129QZ9T]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2018). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the only oral anticoagulants for decades. The management of anticoagulant therapy with VKA is challenging due to the intricate pharmacological properties of these agents. The success of VKA therapy relies on quality treatment, ensured through continuous, comprehensive communication and education.

The educational program should address important issues of VKA therapy, such as the initiation of treatment, pharmacological dynamics, dietary considerations, drug-drug interactions, and temporary suspension of treatment during surgical interventions or invasive procedures. In addition, initial and ongoing patient education is imperative. Patient associations may play a significant role in this educational process, enhancing treatment quality if patients are monitored in anticoagulation clinics.

Furthermore, a federation of anticoagulation clinics could improve patient care through regular meetings to update knowledge on VKA treatment. The learning objectives of this paper are to enable readers to correctly approach patients starting VKA treatment, recognize possible treatment pitfalls, and provide adequate solutions.

### Dietary vitamin K influences intra-individual variability in anticoagulant response to warfarin [^113ZoLR5]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between dietary intake of vitamin K, fat, plasma vitamin K concentrations, and anticoagulation response to warfarin within individuals, as well as the contribution of dietary vitamin K to differences in warfarin dose requirements between individuals, was investigated in 53 patients on warfarin therapy who had stably controlled anticoagulation. Each patient completed a dietary record of all foods consumed on a daily basis for four weeks. Each week, a blood sample was taken for measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR), plasma vitamin K, triglycerides, and warfarin enantiomer concentrations. The patients' genotype for CYP2C9 was also determined.

Regression analysis of the data showed that for each increase of 100 micrograms in daily dietary intake of vitamin K, averaged over four days, the INR was reduced by 0.2. There was no correlation between warfarin daily dose and average daily dietary vitamin K intake when calculated over 28 days. The regression model for warfarin dose showed that, while dietary vitamin K had no effect, CYP2C9 genotype (P = 2%) and age (P < 1%) significantly contributed to inter-patient variability in warfarin dose requirements. A consistent intake of vitamin K could reduce intra-patient variability in anticoagulation response and thus improve the safety of warfarin therapy.

### Association of warfarin use with valvular and vascular calcification: A review [^1112FHw8]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K is required for the activity of various biologically active proteins in our body. Apart from clotting factors, vitamin K-dependent proteins include regulatory proteins like protein C, protein S, protein Z, osteocalcin, growth arrest-specific gene 6 protein, and matrix Gla protein. Glutamic acid residues in matrix Gla protein are γ-carboxylated by vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase, which enables it to inhibit calcification. Warfarin, being a vitamin K antagonist, inhibits this process and has been associated with calcification in various animal and human studies.

Though no specific guidelines are currently available to prevent or treat this less-recognized side effect, discontinuing warfarin and using an alternative anticoagulant seems to be a reasonable option. Newer anticoagulants such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban offer promise as future therapeutic options in such cases. Drugs including statins, alendronate, osteoprotegerin, and vitamin K are currently under study as therapies to prevent or treat warfarin-associated calcification.

### Jantoven [^115i1QmN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to achieve optimal anticoagulation**: Jantoven has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during Jantoven therapy. Determine the INR daily after administering the initial dose until INR results stabilize within the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of INR determinations should be based on the clinical situation, but generally acceptable intervals are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with Jantoven and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring Jantoven therapy.

- **Renal impairment**: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Missed dose**: The anticoagulant effect of Jantoven persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of Jantoven at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day.
