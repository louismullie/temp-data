## Question

8mm TR4 nodule in the right lobe unchanged since 2022 - what to do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do for an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule that has remained unchanged since 2022, specifically whether fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is indicated now or if surveillance is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "TR4" implies across common ultrasound risk systems and the corresponding baseline malignancy risk. Then, I should verify the size-based thresholds for FNA recommended by major guidelines. Next, I will assess how documented stability over time influences risk and follow-up cadence. After that, I should outline guideline-concordant surveillance intervals and concrete triggers for escalation. Finally, I will cross-check special scenarios, ensure consistency across societies, and synthesize a clear recommendation.

> Let me first clarify the risk category behind "TR4". Wait, I should verify whether "TR4" refers to ACR TI-RADS 4 or is being used as shorthand for EU-TIRADS 4; either way, both typically represent an intermediate-suspicion class with an estimated malignancy risk in the single digits to low teens, consistent as well with AACE/ACE/AME intermediate-risk descriptors, so conceptually we are in the intermediate-risk band rather than high risk, which is important for biopsy thresholds and follow-up strategy [^112qawJm] [^113qpHyd].

> Next, I should review size thresholds for FNA by major guidelines. For EU-TIRADS, FNA is recommended for EU-TIRADS 4 nodules only when they are larger than 15 mm, and for EU-TIRADS 5 when larger than 10 mm; at 8 mm, this nodule is below those cutoffs, so no FNA now under ETA 2023 guidance [^111GhvYz]. Hold on, I should also confirm ATA thresholds; ATA 2015/2016 generally does not recommend FNA for subcentimeter nodules unless there are high-suspicion features or high-risk clinical contexts, with FNA typically considered at 1 cm or larger for intermediate-suspicion patterns, which again places an 8 mm nodule below the diagnostic FNA range in the absence of worrisome features or nodes [^112NbJkF]. Let me also cross-check AACE/ACE/AME size triggers; for intermediate ultrasound risk, AACE suggests FNA above 2 cm, which further supports no FNA at 8 mm in an intermediate-risk pattern as described [^111xZHob].

> I will now examine the impact of stability. The nodule has been unchanged since 2022, and I need to ensure we apply the accepted growth definition: ATA defines significant growth as a 20% increase in at least two dimensions with a minimal absolute increase of 2 mm, or a greater than 50% change in volume; if none of these criteria are met, stability over years lowers the likelihood of clinically significant malignancy and supports continued observation rather than invasive testing [^112NbJkF]. Let me double-check supportive data on benign nodule trajectories; prospective data show that many benign nodules remain stable or grow only modestly over five years, reinforcing a conservative follow-up approach when no suspicious evolution occurs [^11281n7i].

> Next, I should review follow-up intervals. For EU-TIRADS 4 nodules under 15 mm, ETA 2023 recommends re-evaluation by ultrasound in one year, which aligns well with this case; for ATA 2015/2016, repeating ultrasound in 12 to 24 months is reasonable for low-to-intermediate suspicion nodules without high-risk features, which also supports annual surveillance here [^112f2ged] [^112NbJkF]. Hmm, wait a minute, I earlier referenced ETA 2023 follow-up as "^40c5c92a"; I should double-check the exact reference ID and correct it to "^40c5e92a" to maintain accuracy in the citation mapping [^112f2ged].

> Now, I need to ensure we specify clear triggers to escalate care. I should confirm that escalation would be indicated if ATA growth criteria are met, if new suspicious ultrasound features emerge such as microcalcifications, irregular or infiltrative margins, taller-than-wide shape, extrathyroidal extension, or suspicious cervical nodes, or if high-risk clinical factors present, including prior neck irradiation, a strong family history, or compressive symptoms; any of these should prompt reconsideration of FNA or additional workup at that time [^112NbJkF] [^111BgxJk].

> Let me consider special contexts to avoid missing anything. If this nodule is one among multiple nodules, ATA advises prioritizing FNA based on ultrasound suspicion and size thresholds rather than simply the largest nodule, and if none meet thresholds, surveillance is acceptable; that applies here since 8 mm is below thresholds and there is no mention of higher-suspicion features elsewhere, so continued sonographic follow-up is consistent with best practice [^113CWz5R]. I should also confirm that molecular testing is not indicated when a nodule is below the FNA threshold, because molecular assays presuppose a cytology specimen; thus, observation without molecular testing remains appropriate in a subcentimeter, intermediate-risk but stable nodule without red flags [^114W9SZX] [^111GhvYz].

> But wait, what if the "TR4" label actually reflects an ACR TI-RADS 4 categorization rather than EU-TIRADS 4; does that change management at 8 mm? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; across TIRADS systems, subcentimeter intermediate-suspicion nodules generally do not meet FNA criteria and are observed with interval ultrasound, so even if "TR4" were ACR TI-RADS 4, the 8 mm size would still favor surveillance rather than immediate FNA, which aligns with the overarching principle of deferring biopsy for small, intermediate-risk nodules absent high-risk features or nodes [^114W9SZX] [^112qawJm].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that continuing annual ultrasound surveillance is guideline-concordant and adequately safe. Given the intermediate-risk classification, the subcentimeter size, the documented stability since 2022, and the absence of reported high-risk features or lymphadenopathy, no immediate FNA or intervention is indicated; scheduling the next ultrasound in 12 months with earlier reassessment if growth or new suspicious findings develop is the most evidence-aligned course [^111GhvYz] [^112NbJkF].

---

For an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule unchanged since 2022, **no immediate FNA is indicated** because it is below the 15 mm threshold for TR4 nodules [^111GhvYz]. Continue **ultrasound surveillance** at 12–24 month intervals [^112NbJkF], as stability over two years supports a low-to-intermediate malignancy risk [^11281n7i]. FNA is only needed if the nodule grows significantly (≥ 20% in two dimensions with ≥ 2 mm increase) or develops new suspicious features [^112NbJkF]. Surgery is not indicated unless there is significant growth, new suspicious features, or patient preference [^114t3ohb].

---

## Risk stratification and malignancy risk

TR4 nodules have a **moderate suspicion** pattern with an estimated malignancy risk of 5–20% [^116dV7gT]. Two-year stability since 2022 is reassuring and suggests risk at the lower end of this range [^11281n7i].

---

## Current guidelines for management

The 2023 ETA guidelines recommend **FNA for TR4 nodules only when ≥ 15 mm** [^111GhvYz]. For nodules < 15 mm, including this 8 mm nodule, **FNA is not indicated** unless there is significant growth or new suspicious features [^112f2ged].

---

## Recommended follow-up and surveillance

Continue **ultrasound surveillance** every 12–24 months [^112NbJkF]. Significant growth is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in at least two dimensions with a minimum increase of 2 mm [^112NbJkF] [^111zYYz1]. If significant growth or new suspicious features occur, FNA should be performed [^112NbJkF].

---

## Indications for biopsy or surgical intervention

- **Significant growth** occurs (≥ 20% increase in two dimensions with ≥ 2 mm minimum increase) [^112NbJkF] [^111zYYz1].
- **New suspicious ultrasound features** develop (e.g. irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape) [^112U1JoX].
- **Patient preference or clinical judgment** warrants intervention [^115d1TQ6].

---

## Clinical implications of stability

Two-year stability suggests a **low likelihood of malignancy** and supports continued surveillance over immediate intervention [^11281n7i].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing management

- **Age and comorbidities**.
- **Family history of thyroid cancer**.
- **Patient preference and anxiety levels**.
- **Clinical judgment and experience of the treating physician** [^112NbJkF].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of continued surveillance

Continued surveillance entails the following **risks and benefits**:

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Potential delayed diagnosis if malignancy develops later | Avoids unnecessary invasive procedures |
| Patient anxiety due to ongoing monitoring | Reduces risk of complications from unnecessary surgery |
| Minimal radiation exposure from repeated ultrasounds | Cost-effective management strategy |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Appropriate management of an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule unchanged since 2022 is **continued ultrasound surveillance** every 12–24 months [^112NbJkF]. FNA or surgical intervention is indicated only if there is significant growth or new suspicious features [^111GhvYz]. Two-year stability suggests a low likelihood of malignancy, further supporting surveillance [^11281n7i].

The 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend specific approaches for follow-up and surveillance of thyroid nodules, particularly those indeterminate by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). For patients with thyroid nodules exhibiting a low-to-intermediate suspicion ultrasound pattern, it is advised to repeat the ultrasound at 12–24 month intervals. In cases where there is ultrasound evidence of growth, such as a 20% increase in at least two nodule dimensions with a minimum increase of 2 mm, or a greater than 50% change in volume, or the development of new suspicious ultrasound features, it is recommended to consider repeating the FNA. Alternatively, continued observation with a repeat ultrasound should be undertaken, with a repeat FNA if continued growth is observed.

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

- **Methods**: The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. A similarly formatted system was developed to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

- **Results**: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinic.

On the whole, the recent findings and increasing use of comprehensive US-based risk stratification systems should reduce the "diagnostic burden" related to nodules classified as benign; they can be safely followed with visits every 2 or 3 years, and the frequency can be even further reduced if no changes have been noted at previous visits.

Patients whose nodules are cytologically classified as malignant or suspicious for malignancy (Bethesda classes V and VI; or suspicious molecular analysis) should generally be referred for surgery. However, for those with subcentimeter, intrathyroidal cancers with no high-risk features, active US surveillance can be proposed in lieu of immediate surgery. The first study published on this issue in 2003 found that more than 70% of microPTCs remained stable during surveillance, and the frequency of spread to the locoregional lymph nodes was quite low (~1%). The active surveillance strategy does not merely delay surgery; the likelihood of disease progression diminishes with age, and older patients are therefore less likely to require surgery during their lifespan. Similar results have been reported worldwide.

Active surveillance protocols initially provide for US neck examinations every 6 months. Once disease stability has been documented — in general, with 2 years of serial US examinations showing no evidence of progression — adjustments to the examination frequency may be considered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid nodules, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend considering the following ultrasound rating system for the risk of malignancy:

- **Class 1, low risk**: Mostly cystic (> 50%) nodules with reverberating artifacts not associated with suspicious ultrasound signs. Isoechoic spongiform nodules confluent or with a regular halo. The expected risk of malignancy is ~1%.

- **Class 2, intermediate risk**: Slightly hypoechoic nodules (compared to surrounding thyroid tissue) and isoechoic nodules with ovoid-to-round shape and smooth or ill-defined margins. Intranodular vascularization, elevated stiffness at elastography, macro- or continuous rim calcifications, or hyperechoic spots of uncertain significance may be present. The expected risk of malignancy is 5–15%.

- **Class 3, high risk**: Marked hypoechogenicity (compared to prethyroid muscles). Spiculated or microlobulated margins. Microcalcifications. Taller-than-wide shape. Evidence of extrathyroidal growth or pathologic adenopathy. The expected risk of malignancy is 50–90% in the presence of ≥ 1 suspicious finding.

The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the management of thyroid nodules (TNs) and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in adults were developed to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policymakers about the best available evidence and its limitations relating to the management of these conditions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional electronic survey of ATA members' perspectives on these CPGs, using a standardized survey (Clinician Guidelines Determinant Questionnaire) developed by the Guidelines International Network. A survey link was electronically mailed to members in February 2019, with reminders sent to non-respondents 2 and 5 weeks later. Data were descriptively summarized after excluding missing responses.

- **Results**: The overall response rate was 19.8% (348/1761). The effective response rate was 20.2% (348/1720) after excluding a recently deceased member and individuals who had either invalid email addresses or whose emails were returned. Of the respondents, 37.9% (132/348) were female, 60.4% (209/346) were endocrinologists, 27.5% (95/346) were surgeons, and 3.5% (12/346) were nuclear medicine specialists. The majority of respondents (71.9%; 250/348) were at a mid- or advanced-career level, and more than half were in academia (57.5%; 195/339). The majority (69.8%; 243/348) practiced in North America. The vast majority of respondents indicated that the CPGs explained the underlying evidence (92.3%; 298/323) and 92.9% (300/323) agreed or strongly agreed with the content. Most respondents stated…

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114g2jnh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is the next step in the triage of a thyroid nodule. It should be reserved for lesions found to be sufficiently suspicious on the basis of ultrasound and clinical findings. The results play a key role in optimizing subsequent management. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) was discussed in 2007 by a panel of experts at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. The first edition of the system was published in 2010, and an updated version followed in 2018. The BSRTC is widely used in the United States, and it has served as a model for similar tiered classification schemes developed more recently in other parts of the world.

The robust diagnostic framework provided by the BSRTC offers valuable guidance in developing management strategies for patients with thyroid nodules. Nonetheless, several potential diagnostic pitfalls exist that can lead to false-positive, false-negative, nondiagnostic, or indeterminate results. Cytology itself has limitations: it cannot, for example, distinguish between follicular-patterned hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodules, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinoma, and some cases of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid cytology can be considered only a screening test for these follicular-patterned lesions, the results of which will almost invariably be reported as "indeterminate", that is, assigned to Bethesda class III ("atypia of undetermined significance" or "follicular lesions of undetermined significance") or class IV ("follicular neoplasm").

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^115Fev8g]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer extracted from these guidelines are shown in Table 4. Regarding diagnostic procedures, all guidelines advocated thyroid sonography. Additionally, a measurement of TSH and free thyroxine levels should be performed in all patients. A routine measurement of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules is not recommended. However, although all guidelines supported FNA as the procedure of choice in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) define various nodular sizes as indications for FNA.

The German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (GAES), IKNL, and Northern Cancer Network (NCN) guidelines recommend that FNA should be performed in all nodules. Two CPGs recommend that the indication for FNA must be performed in nodules larger than 0.5 cm in diameter, and the other three CPGs suggest that FNA cytology is needed when the thyroid nodule is bigger than 1 cm in the absence of clinical suspicion. In the 2013 version of the NCCN guidelines, the threshold for FNA is a solid thyroid nodule larger than 1.5 cm if no suspicious sonographic features are present.

For laboratory evaluation, four CPGs recommend routine serum calcitonin, particularly before surgery for nodular thyroid disease. Four guidelines suggest a serum calcitonin assay as an optional test, but the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines cannot recommend or discourage the routine measurement of serum calcitonin due to insufficient evidence.

Follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, specifically in terms of follow-up evaluation, are crucial. According to the ATA 2016 guidelines, there is insufficient evidence to recommend ultrasound surveillance and the assessment of nodule growth as an indicator for repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to detect a missed malignancy in nodules with a very low suspicion ultrasound pattern, such as spongiform nodules. An ultrasound should be obtained at intervals of 24 months or more if repeated.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^116tpVuK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Concerning thyroid surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), patients with node-negative cancer 1 cm in diameter or more should be treated with total or near-total thyroidectomy, except where contraindications prevent this surgery. However, the NCCN and SEOM clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend total or subtotal thyroidectomy in tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter. In contrast, the LATS guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for DTC, regardless of tumor size. An additional surgical consideration is cervical lymph node dissection for patients with DTC. Three CPGs recommend that prophylactic central-compartment neck dissection may be performed in patients who present with a DTC with clinically uninvolved central-neck lymph nodes, especially for advanced primary tumors (nodule greater than 4 cm).

Recommendations for the postoperative care of DTC are varied. Radioiodine ablation is recommended for all high-risk patients, as determined from the presence of metastases, incomplete excision, gross extrathyroidal extension of the tumor regardless of tumor size, or a primary tumor greater than 4 cm, even in the absence of other higher-risk factors. However, the NCN guidelines mention that routine postoperative I 131 ablation of thyroid remnants has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve patient survival when patients have tumors more than 1 cm in diameter. Moreover, the NCCN guidelines recommend that I 131 ablation be performed in patients with thyroglobulin levels greater than 1 ng/ml. All CPGs emphasized the need for TSH suppression therapy following DTC surgery; however, the target levels of TSH varied across the guidelines.

### Decision analysis of discordant thyroid nodule biopsy guideline criteria [^115JbSEq]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines are discordant regarding diagnostic approaches to small (10–14 mm) thyroid nodules.

The objective of the study was to explore the relative desirability of alternative diagnostic approaches to small thyroid nodules using decision analysis.

Four diagnostic approaches to a 10- to 14-mm thyroid nodule are modeled: 1) observation only, consistent with American Thyroid Association guidelines; 2) routine fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), an approach traditionally chosen by many endocrinologists and consistent with American Thyroid Association guidelines; 3) FNAB only when microcalcifications are present, as recommended by Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound guidelines; and 4) FNAB only when the nodule is hypoechoic and has at least one other ultrasonographic risk factor, as endorsed by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included expected values; a priori likelihoods of prespecified outcomes; and two-way sensitivity analyses based on the utility of observation only in the setting of thyroid cancer and thyroid surgery for benign, asymptomatic thyroid disease.

- **Results**: Expected values (EVs) were similar among decision alternatives modeling Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound guidelines, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines, and routine observation (EVs from 0.912 to 0.927). Routine FNAB had the lowest EV (0.757–0.861), primarily related to a high a priori likelihood of having surgery for a benign nodule.

Conclusions indicate that as a general ap…

### Thyroid nodules: Past, present, and future [^111Tmch2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Over the past millennia, the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules have essentially remained the same, with thyroidectomy as the only reliable method to identify malignancy. However, in the last 30 years, technological advances have significantly improved the diagnostic management of thyroid nodules. Advances in imaging have allowed the development of a reliable risk-based stratification system to identify nodules at increased risk of malignancy. At the same time, sensitive imaging has caused collateral damage to the degree that we are now identifying and treating many small, low-risk nodules with little to no clinical relevance.

- **Objective**: To review the history of thyroid nodule evaluation with emphasis on recent changes and future pathways.

- **Methods**: Literature review and discussion.

- **Results**: Thyroid ultrasound remains the best initial method to evaluate the thyroid gland for nodules. Different risk-of-malignancy protocols have been developed and introduced by different societies. Reporting methods have been developed and improved, with goals of improving the ability to recognize nodules requiring further intervention and minimizing excessive monitoring of those who do not. Once identified, cytological evaluation of nodules further enhances malignancy identification, with molecular markers assisting in ruling out malignancies in indeterminate nodules, thus preventing unneeded intervention. All societies have urged the avoidance of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk cancers of little to no clinical relevance.

Regarding surgical interventions for thyroid nodules, specifically with respect to diagnostic surgical excision, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend considering surgery for histopathologic diagnosis if the cytologically nondiagnostic nodule has a high suspicion ultrasound pattern. Additionally, surgery should be considered if growth of the nodule (greater than 20% in two dimensions) is detected during ultrasound surveillance, or if clinical risk factors for malignancy are present.

### Diagnostic performance of four ultrasound risk stratification systems: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qawJm]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Several ultrasound (US)-based risk stratification systems have been increasingly used for the optimal management of thyroid nodules. However, there are considerable discrepancies across these systems. This study aimed to summarize and compare the category-based diagnostic performance in the detection of thyroid cancer of different US-based risk stratification systems from four societies: the American College of Radiology-Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS), the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the Korean Thyroid Association/Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KTA/KSThR; K-TIRADS), and the European Thyroid Association (EU-TIRADS).

- **Methods**: MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify original articles investigating the category-based diagnostic performance according to at least one of the following guidelines: ACR-TIRADS, ATA, K-TIRADS, and EU-TIRADS. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. A subgroup analysis on nodules of 1 cm or larger and a meta-regression analysis to identify factors associated with the diagnostic performance were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 29 articles including 33,748 thyroid nodules met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. For ACR-TIRADS, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 66% and 91% for category 5 and 95% and 55% for category 4 or 5. For ATA, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 74% and 88% for category 5 and 91% and 64% for category 4 or 5. For K-TIRADS, the pooled sensitivity…

### American Thyroid Association ultrasound system for the initial assessment of thyroid nodules: Use in stratifying the risk of malignancy of indeterminate lesions [^117VdjWu]. Head & Neck (2018). High credibility.

The ultrasound risk stratification system of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) is frequently adopted in clinical practice. Here, we evaluated its performance in a series of nodules with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) reports.

- **Methods**: Indeterminate thyroid nodules diagnosed at two medical centers were retrospectively screened. Ultrasound images were reevaluated, and lesions were classified according to the ATA. Single ultrasound parameters were also analyzed.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-three indeterminate lesions were included with 24.8% of malignancy. The high suspicion class showed a cancer rate (75%) significantly associated with larger nodules (> 4.1 cm). At multivariate analysis, only the ATA class of high suspicion and size > 4.1 cm were significantly associated with cancer (odds ratios [ORs] 19.4 and 5.4, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: The ATA ultrasound system is reliable in the risk stratification of indeterminate thyroid lesions.

### Thyroid incidentaloma: An evidence-based assessment of management strategy [^11797AyJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Palpable thyroid nodules are present in 4–7% of the population, and their prevalence increases with age. Thyroid incidentalomas — impalpable nodules detected fortuitously during a radiological investigation — may be found in up to 50% of patients. Although numerous guidelines indicate the appropriate management of palpable thyroid nodules, there are no accepted guidelines for the increasingly common thyroid incidentaloma. Presently, no level I or II evidence exists on this topic.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria was performed.

- **Results**: Thyroid incidentalomas are common and mostly benign lesions. A small proportion is malignant, mainly papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC). Lesions less than 5 mm in diameter, even if PTMC, rarely metastasize and can be safely left alone. Lesions between 5 mm and 9 mm without sinister radiological features need not be investigated. The appropriate follow-up remains controversial.

- **Conclusion**: It is unlikely that a trial of sufficient power to demonstrate or refute the beneficial effects of presymptomatic investigation of thyroid nodules will take place. We propose a pragmatic approach based on evidence that balances the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment with the cost to the patient and the healthcare system associated with unnecessary investigations and surgery.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for thyroid nodules, especially concerning fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend several practices to decrease the risk of false-negative results:

- **Routine use of FNA**: Ensure regular utilization of FNA for diagnosis.

- **Aspiration of multiple sites**: Aspirate at least two sites within the nodule to enhance accuracy.

- **Prioritization based on ultrasound findings**: In cases of multiple nodules, prioritize those to be sampled according to ultrasound findings.

- **Target solid or vascularized areas**: Sample solid or vascularized areas with FNA and submit cyst fluid for cytologic examination.

- **Review by an experienced cytopathologist**: Ensure the slides are reviewed by an experienced cytopathologist to maintain diagnostic accuracy.

- **Follow-up on benign nodules**: Implement follow-up measures for benign nodules to monitor any changes.

- **Repeat FNA if suspicious findings arise**: Perform repeat FNA on benign nodules with suspicious clinical or ultrasound findings.

- **Sampling of large lesions**: For large-sized thyroid lesions, sample peripheral and potentially solid areas to avoid fluid or necrotic zones.

These guidelines aim to optimize diagnostic accuracy and minimize the risk of overlooking malignancies in thyroid nodules.

### A clinical framework to facilitate risk stratification when considering an active surveillance alternative to immediate biopsy and surgery in papillary microcarcinoma [^1169dUzR]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

The 2015 American Thyroid Association thyroid cancer management guidelines endorse an active surveillance management approach as an alternative to immediate biopsy and surgery in subcentimeter thyroid nodules with highly suspicious ultrasonographic characteristics and in cytologically confirmed very low risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, the guidelines provide no specific recommendations with regard to the optimal selection of patients for an active surveillance management approach. This article describes a risk-stratified clinical decision-making framework developed by the thyroid cancer disease management team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The framework incorporates lessons learned from Kuma Hospital in Japan, as applied to a cohort of patients with probable or proven papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) being evaluated for an active surveillance management approach in the United States.

A risk-stratified approach to evaluating patients with probable or proven PMC for an active surveillance management approach requires assessing three interrelated but distinct domains:

- **Tumor/neck ultrasound characteristics**: Factors include the size of the primary tumor and the location of the tumor within the thyroid gland.
- **Patient characteristics**: Considerations include the age of the patient, comorbidities, and the patient's willingness to accept observation.
- **Medical team characteristics**: This involves the availability and experience of the multidisciplinary team.

Based on an analysis of the critical factors within each of these domains, patients with probable or proven PTC can be appropriately managed.

### Implementing key changes in the American Thyroid Association 2015 thyroid nodules/differentiated thyroid cancer guidelines across practice types [^114eRnXT]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

This article provides suggestions to help clinicians implement important changes in the 2015 American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma ("ATA 2015") across diverse settings.

- **Objective**: This text aims to guide clinicians in effectively applying the updated ATA 2015 guidelines.

- **Methods**: Key ATA 2015 changes are summarized regarding: (1) thyroid nodule management; (2) lobectomy versus thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC); and (3) surveillance following primary treatment of DTC. Advice to facilitate implementation is based on clinical experience and selected literature.

- **Results**: Strategies are described to enhance the acquisition of high-quality information that helps identify patients who may avoid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules or total thyroidectomy for DTC or undergo less intense postoperative surveillance. Sonographic imaging of nodules may improve if sonograms are obtained by clinicians ordering or performing FNA or trusted high-volume sonographers. Cytopathologic assessment and reporting can be improved by working with regional or national experts. Pre-operative evaluation by endocrinologists is important so that patients are referred to experienced, proficient surgeons and assisted with well-informed decision-making regarding surgical radicality. Endocrinologists and surgeons should ensure the performance of pre-operative neck ultrasonography, voice/laryngeal evaluation, and contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging when appropriate. Findings should be disseminated to all healthcare team members, ideally through a comprehensive medical information system.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: A review [^112PYsD4]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This prevalence is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and can be safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is the identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns, including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications, should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, the cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery, and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

In conclusion, most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, cytology is recommended to ensure appropriate management strategies are implemented.

### Managing incidental thyroid nodules detected on imaging: White paper of the ACR Incidental Thyroid Findings Committee [^1141aXjd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The incidental thyroid nodule (ITN) is one of the most common incidental findings on imaging studies that include the neck. An ITN is defined as a nodule not previously detected or suspected clinically but identified by an imaging study. The workup of ITNs has led to increased costs from additional procedures and, in some cases, to increased risk to the patient because physicians are naturally concerned about the risk of malignancy and a delayed cancer diagnosis. However, the majority of ITNs are benign, and small, incidental thyroid malignancies typically have indolent behavior. The ACR formed the Incidental Thyroid Findings Committee to derive a practical approach to managing ITNs on CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound studies. This white paper describes consensus recommendations representing this committee's review of the literature and their practice experience.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^113BnLxx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 60% of adults harbor one or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, though only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to health care favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are associated with potentially excessive costs and nonnegligible morbidity for patients.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We conducted a PubMed search for recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems, such as the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems, can estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules, and those that are cytologically benign, can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance, or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

- **Conclusion**: Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients.

### 2023 European Thyroid Association clinical practice guidelines for thyroid nodule management [^111Z3JGw]. European Thyroid Journal (2023). High credibility.

The ETA 2023 guidelines recommend specific strategies for the follow-up and surveillance of thyroid nodules, particularly for nodules classified as benign by fine needle aspiration (FNA) with Bethesda I cytology:

- **EU-TIRADS 3 (> 20 mm)**: Repeat FNA. Consider performing a core-needle biopsy if the result is still nondiagnostic. Obtain a re-evaluation within one year or offer surgery if the nodule remains nondiagnostic.

- **EU-TIRADS 4 (> 15 mm) and 5 (> 10 mm)**: Repeat FNA. Consider performing a core-needle biopsy or molecular testing (if available and with sufficient material) if the result is still nondiagnostic. Offer active surveillance or surgery if the nodule remains nondiagnostic.

### Investigation of thyroid nodules: A practical algorithm and review of guidelines [^114esRMR]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

High-resolution ultrasound has led to the early detection of subclinical tumors and a drastic increase in the incidence of thyroid malignancy. To achieve a balance in appropriate investigation without perpetuating an overdiagnosis phenomenon, a concise set of evidence-based recommendations to stratify risk is required.

- **Methods**: We sought to assemble an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm and accompanying pictorial review for the workup of thyroid nodules that summarizes the most recent guidelines. In addition, we conducted a literature search and analysis of our imaging databases.

- **Results**: Although many imaging features of benign and malignant nodules can be nonspecific, others, such as microcalcifications, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral invasion, are highly suggestive of malignancy. The predictive values of salient imaging characteristics are presented.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence-based guidelines are available such that a cost-effective algorithm for thyroid nodule workup can be devised. Conservative management with a focus on periodic monitoring is the working clinical consensus on the approach to thyroid nodules.

### Choosing the best algorithm among five thyroid nodule ultrasound scores: From performance to cytology sparing-a single-center retrospective study in a large cohort [^111EsKsc]. European Radiology (2021). High credibility.

The incidental diagnosis of thyroid nodules, and therefore thyroid cancer, has definitely increased in recent years, but the mortality rate for thyroid malignancies remains very low. Within this landscape of overdiagnosis, several nodule ultrasound scores (NUS) have been proposed to reduce unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The aim was to verify the suitability of five main NUS.

This single-center, retrospective, observational study analyzed a total number of 6474 valid cytologies. A full clinical and ultrasound (US) description of the thyroid gland and nodules was performed. Five available NUS were retrospectively applied: KTIRADS, ATA, AACE/ACE-AME, EUTIRADS, and ACRTIRADS. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were calculated, along with the number of possible fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sparing, according to each NUS algorithm and clustering risk classes within three macro-groups (low, intermediate, and high risk).

In a real-life setting of thyroid nodule management, available NUS scoring systems show good accuracy at ROC analysis (AUC up to 0.647) and higher NPV (up to 96%). The ability in FNA sparing ranges from 10 to 38% and reaches 44.2% of potential FNA economization in the low-risk macro-group. Considering the cohort, ACRTIRADS and AACE/ACE-AME scores provide the best compromise in terms of accuracy and spared cytology.

Despite several limitations, available NUS do appear to assist physicians in clinical practice. In the context of a common disease, such as thyroid nodules, higher accuracy and NPV are desirable features.

### Management of thyroid nodules [^114t3ohb]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

In the past 30 years, there has been a substantial rise in the detection of thyroid nodules. Largely asymptomatic, thyroid nodules are most often incidental findings that typically pose minimal risk. Data supporting these findings show a rapid rise in the incidental detection of thyroid nodules and cancer, but minimal effect on mortality rates despite treatment. These data imply that historical approaches to thyroid nodule and cancer care might at times include unnecessary or excessive care.

To address this issue, the past decade has witnessed an increasingly conservative approach to nodule management, seeking to individualize care and provide the most focused intervention that leads to favorable outcomes. Benign nodules can be safely monitored with minimal or long-interval follow-up imaging. Molecular testing should be considered for cytologically indeterminate nodules because of its ability to improve preoperative cancer risk determination and reduce unnecessary surgery.

The treatment of biopsy-proven malignant nodules has become increasingly nuanced, as recommendations for near-total thyroidectomy are no longer routine. Hemithyroidectomy is now commonly considered when operative intervention is favored. Some patients with small volume, isolated cancerous nodules are safely managed non-operatively with active monitoring.

In summary, modern management strategies for thyroid nodular disease seek to incorporate the growing amount of available diagnostic and prognostic data, inclusive of demographic, radiological, pathological, and molecular findings.

### Cost-effectiveness comparison between palpation- and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^111iHqfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

There are two thyroid nodule management guidelines with global recognition. The first is the management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines Taskforce. The second one is the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules.

After identification of a thyroid nodule that is more than 10–15 mm, ATA recommends measuring serum TSH level. If TSH is low, a thyroid scan is next. For a hot thyroid nodule, evaluation and treatment for hyperthyroidism is recommended. If the nodule is not hot, the algorithm points to diagnostic ultrasonography. The flowchart directs again to diagnostic ultrasonography for euthyroid and hypothyroid patients with thyroid nodules. If a nodule is ultrasonographically confirmed, a cytological evaluation is next.

ATA recommends ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNA) for nodules with more than 50% cystic component and for nodules located in posterior parts of the thyroid gland. Otherwise, either palpation-guided (P-FNA) or USG-FNA is next. In contrast, as indicated in the abstract of their guideline, AACE recommends universal application of USG-FNA for all thyroid nodules ≥ 10 mm, except for subjects with a low serum TSH level and a hot nodule, in whom FNA is not indicated.

Except for minor changes in the sequence of diagnostic steps, ATA and AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines differ only in these aspects.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^116Q5nJk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples; for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy.

After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery.

- **Options and patient communication**: When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

For health professionals, this means learning to work with som.

### Thyroid nodules: Advances in evaluation and management [^116ZnosJ]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant.

After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is the measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration.

The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring.

Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, except for molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

Follow-up examinations: what to look for

Figure 1 shows the simulated management strategies and outcomes of 1,000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The overall management pathway is based on the US-risk stratification of the target lesions and the cytology assessment (if any). These scenarios do not include symptomatic thyroid nodules that are already candidates for resection regardless of their sonographic features. In these cases, a biopsy might be performed to clarify the best surgical approach, but the results would not change the indication for surgery itself.

The distributions of US-defined risk classes, US-defined FNAB indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing, although other options are offered. However, if these alternative approaches, guided by clinical and US data, had been used, it is unlikely that the final number of resected nodules and their malignancy rate would be significantly different from those shown in Figure 1. The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%.

### The natural history of benign thyroid nodules [^11281n7i]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Detection of asymptomatic thyroid nodules has increased, but consensus is lacking regarding the optimal follow-up of cytologically proven benign lesions and sonographically nonsuspicious nodules. Guidelines recommend serial ultrasound examinations and reassessment of cytology if significant growth is observed.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency, magnitude, and factors associated with changes in thyroid nodule size. This prospective, multicenter, observational study involved 992 consecutive patients with 1 to 4 asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules. Patients were recruited from eight hospital-based thyroid-disease referral centers in Italy between 2006 and 2008. Data collected during the first five years of follow-up, through January 2013, were analyzed.

Nodule growth, the primary endpoint, was assessed with yearly thyroid ultrasound examinations. Size changes were considered significant if an increase of 20% or more was recorded in at least two nodule diameters, with a minimum increase of 2 mm. Baseline factors associated with growth were identified. Secondary endpoints included the sonographic detection of new nodules and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer during follow-up.

Nodule growth occurred in 153 patients (15.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-16.5%]). One hundred seventy-four of the 1567 original nodules (11.1% [95% CI, 10.3%-11.9%]) increased in size, with a mean 5-year largest diameter increase of 4.9 mm (95% CI, 4.2–5.5 mm), from 13.2 mm (95% CI, 12.1–14.2 mm).

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^11662oGw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of long-term surveillance should be to detect any previously missed malignancy and monitor thyroid nodule growth. The sonographically estimated malignancy risk also provides guidance in planning effective follow-up (Fig. 2). The algorithm shown in the figure is based on literature data, practice guidelines, and the authors' own experience.

Thyroid FNAB cytology has a very low false-negative rate (< 3%); similar findings have been reported for molecular analysis of FNAB fluid. However, nodules with highly suspicious features on the initial US examination — even if they have been cytologically or molecularly classified as benign — warrant a repeat biopsy within 12 months. Repeat biopsy is also indicated if new suspicious features or significant growth is observed during follow-up.

In a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort, the US-estimated malignancy risk class of 13.2% to 29.4% of the nodules increased during the first 5 years of follow-up. However, the risk-class increase was associated with a recommendation for FNAB for only 6% to 8% of the nodules whose biopsies had been deferred at baseline, and none of the increased risk estimates was associated with the discovery of a new malignancy. The development of new nodules is quite common during surveillance, but only 3% to 7% of these lesions meet the criteria for biopsy.

Some authors maintain that a sonographically documented change in the appearance of a nodule classified as benign (particularly its margins) is the most reliable indication for repeat FNAB. The growth alone of such nodules emerged from a meta-analysis, underscoring the importance of careful monitoring during follow-up.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^1128Z3eG]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In prospective trials, conclusions regarding the optimal selection of treatments must be based on retrospective analysis and the consensus of expert opinions. Several CPGs recommend total thyroidectomy if the primary tumor is at least 1 cm in diameter or if extrathyroidal extension or metastases are present, but some guidelines advise that total thyroidectomy may be performed in patients with large tumors (> 4 cm) in the absence of clinical suspicion. Whereas some CPGs recommend considering routine central-neck dissection for most patients with papillary thyroid cancer, the guidelines from the NCCN recommend only central-neck dissection in the presence of grossly positive metastasis.

The strengths of our review included:

- **Comprehensive search**: A thorough search for eligible guidelines.
- **Systematic application of criteria**: Application of eligibility criteria in a systematic and explicit manner.
- **Consideration of guideline quality**: Careful consideration of guideline quality using the AGREE-II instrument.
- **Analytical rigor**: A rigorous analytical approach.

Therefore, this study can be of additional value to already available guideline compendia and libraries such as the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence because these libraries depend on submissions from guideline organizations. However, several limitations could have biased our study. First, only CPGs written in English were included, and guidelines written entirely in other languages might have been overlooked. Second, CPGs that focus on non-DTC such as medullary thyroid cancer or unique techniques such as procedural guidelines for radioiodine therapy were excluded.

### Is the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer in accordance with recent consensus guidelines? - Results of a national survey [^116Sh2if]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to assess approaches to patients with a potentially malignant thyroid nodule and patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, comparing them with the European Consensus and Guidelines by the American Thyroid Association.

A survey was conducted among the 388 active members of the Belgian Thyroid Club. This involved a questionnaire addressing the management of an index case and four clinical variations, including variations in the size of the tumor and histological type. The index case involved a 40-year-old euthyroid woman with a 3-cm solitary thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology showed cellular aspirates with numerous follicular cells and no colloid.

The overall response rate was 41%. For the index case, respondents favored a right lobectomy. Variations in size and histopathology of the nodule altered the management approach. In the case of a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) of 3 cm in diameter, a total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central lymph node dissection were preferred. After a lobectomy showing a 3.5-cm follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), completion surgery followed by radioiodine administration was the most frequent proposal. For the follow-up of the index case with a low-risk disease, the determination of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) after recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) administration was considered by the majority of respondents. For the follow-up of a clinical variation with residual disease, immediate planning of a new treatment was mistakenly not considered by a majority of respondents.

In most cases, respondents were in accordance with prevailing guidelines and practices.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for thyroid nodules, specifically concerning fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend performing FNA on the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm). Alternatively, clinicians may choose to continue surveillance without FNA if none of the nodules exhibit a high or moderate suspicious ultrasound pattern. In cases where multiple sonographically similar nodules with very low or low suspicion patterns coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, surveillance without FNA may also be considered.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^111GJVi8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 1, the aspects of nodules considered in the risk-estimation process are fundamentally the same across all these systems: structural composition, echogenicity, shape, margins, and echogenic foci. Risk classes are defined by sets or clusters of two or more nodule features. The exception to this rule is the American College of Radiology (ACR) TIRADS. With this system, the same key aspects of the nodule are assessed individually. Each is rated with a numerical score, and the sum of the five scores determines the risk class to which the nodule is assigned.

There is some degree of heterogeneity across systems in terms of the definitions of certain nodule features, the relative weight assigned to individual features, and the size criteria used for FNAB (fine needle aspiration biopsy) recommendations. Substantial variability has also been observed in the different systems' ability to decrease the number of unnecessary FNABs. In one recent prospective analysis, the ACR TIRADS outperformed the four other widely used systems in reducing the number of biopsies performed on nodules ultimately diagnosed as benign: more than half of the biopsies would have been classified by the ACR system as deferrable, with a false-negative rate of only 2.2%. Although developed mainly for the detection of papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), the sonographic risk-stratification systems also seem to provide reliable recommendations for FNAB of follicular thyroid cancers, medullary thyroid cancers, and metastases to the thyroid gland.

### Thyroid nodules: Diagnosis and management [^115d1TQ6]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules, with a prevalence of almost 25% in the general population, are a common occurrence. Their prevalence varies considerably depending on demographics such as age and sex, as well as the presence of risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, risk stratification, and management strategies for thyroid nodules, with a particular focus on changes in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that have occurred over the past 10 years. Several sonography-based stratification systems, such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS), might help to predict the malignancy risk of nodules, potentially eliminating the need for biopsy in many instances. However, large or suspicious nodules necessitate cytological evaluation following fine-needle aspiration biopsy for accurate classification. In the case of cytology yielding indeterminate results, additional tools, such as molecular testing, can assist in guiding the management plan. Surgery is no longer the only treatment for symptomatic or malignant nodules; active surveillance or local ablative treatments might be beneficial for appropriately selected patients. Shared decision-making tools have been developed to enhance clinician-patient interactions and discussions about diagnostic options. A personalized, risk-based protocol promotes high-quality care while minimizing costs and unnecessary testing.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid nodules, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the 2016 ATA guidelines recommend considering a radionuclide (preferably iodine-123) thyroid scan. This is particularly advised for patients with multiple nodules and low or low-normal serum TSH levels, allowing comparison with ultrasound images to determine the functionality of each nodule that is ≥ 1 cm.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114W9SZX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

To address these shortcomings, several national and international professional organizations have developed US-based risk-stratification systems, often referred to as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS), terms derived from those used for breast cancer imaging. These systems assign thyroid nodules to categories characterized by increasing risks, or risk ranges, for cancer based on the presence or absence of the above-mentioned nodule features.

Within each risk class, size cutoffs are used to identify lesions whose fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) can safely be deferred. Avoiding unnecessary FNABs is an important goal. Aside from cost considerations, these procedures can be associated with minor and transient complications such as mild bruising, soreness, swelling, and neck discomfort. More important, inconclusive cytology results are not rare and often lead to additional testing, frequently quite expensive, and/or diagnostic surgery, undertaken to confirm that the nodule is indeed benign.

The accuracy of the risk estimates generated by these systems has been validated in some cases by retrospective and/or prospective studies; their performance has also been confirmed by a recent meta-analysis. These classifications also guide the timing of subsequent long-term follow-up evaluations and the eligibility of suspicious nodules for management limited to active surveillance.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^117MhJeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 60% of adults harbor one or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to health care favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are associated with potentially excessive costs and nonnegligible morbidity for patients.

We conducted a PubMed search for recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management. The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and a sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems, such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems, can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size.

When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance, or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients.

What to do with indeterminate results?

The term "indeterminate cytology" refers to Bethesda class III or class IV findings, which are associated with expected malignancy rates of 10% to 30% and 25% to 40%, respectively. The options suggested for identifying these nodules include repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for cytology and/or molecular testing, as well as diagnostic lobectomy. Some data suggest that a repeat ultrasound (US) risk stratification can be useful in predicting malignancy and planning further management steps for indeterminate nodules, particularly those in Bethesda class III. However, if nodules are properly selected beforehand and the pretest risk of malignancy is high, the utility of this approach may be reduced.

The cytological assessment of a second fine needle aspirate is commonly used but provides a definitive diagnosis for only 40% of class I (nondiagnostic) and III nodules. If the second cytological study remains indeterminate, diagnostic surgery (usually lobectomy) has traditionally been the only route to a definitive pathological diagnosis. This approach is expensive and associated with certain risks. If the nodule is found to be malignant, reoperation (completion thyroidectomy) is often indicated, which entails additional risks and costs. Up to 60% of patients undergoing lobectomy for an indeterminate nodule may be over- or undertreated in the initial surgery.

- **Nodule description**: Describe the position, size, shape, margins, content, echogenic pattern, and vascular features of the nodules.

- **Multiple nodules assessment**: Detail the nodules bearing ultrasound characteristics associated with malignancy, rather than merely describing the largest or dominant nodule.

- **Cervical compartment and lymph nodes**: Describe the cervical compartment, including the number, shape, size, margins, content, echogenic pattern, presence of hilum, and vascular features in cases of suspicious regional neck lymph nodes.

- **Risk stratification rating**: Add a rating that stratifies thyroid lesions based on their risk of malignancy to reliably communicate the expected risk of cancer.

### Management of the solitary thyroid nodule [^115CHtps]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, with up to 8% of the adult population having palpable nodules. With the use of ultrasound, up to 10 times more nodules are likely to be detected. Increasing numbers of nodules are being detected serendipitously because of the rising use of imaging to investigate unrelated conditions. The primary aim in investigating a thyroid nodule is to exclude the possibility of malignancy, which occurs in about 5% of nodules. This begins with a thorough history, including previous exposure to radiation and any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine diseases.

Clinical examination of the neck should focus on the thyroid nodule and the gland itself, but also the presence of any cervical lymphadenopathy. Biochemical assessment of the thyroid needs to be followed by thyroid ultrasound, which may demonstrate features that are associated with a higher chance of the nodule being malignant. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is crucial in the investigation of a thyroid nodule. It provides highly accurate cytologic information about the nodule from which a definitive management plan can be formulated.

The challenge remains in the management of nodules that fall under the "indeterminate" category. These may be subject to more surgical intervention than is required because histological examination is the only way in which a malignancy can be excluded. Surgery followed by radioactive iodine ablation is the mainstay of treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers, and the majority of patients can expect high cure rates.
