Clincal practice guideline chronic constipation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for clinical practice guidelines for chronic constipation management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and exclusion of secondary causes. Then, I should verify the initial nonpharmacologic strategies and their evidence. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic therapy, followed by escalation to prescription agents. After that, I need to check indications for physiologic testing and targeted therapies like biofeedback. Finally, I will consider refractory cases including surgery, special populations, and a practical algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and exclusion of secondary causes before committing to a treatment plan, because misclassification can derail therapy. Chronic idiopathic constipation is defined by Rome IV as the presence of two or more characteristic symptoms for at least 3 months with onset at least 6 months prior, and absence of structural disease or IBS features, so I should screen for alarm features and medication contributors before labeling someone as CIC [^1141C5hN]. Hold on, I should verify colonoscopy indications; constipation alone is not a red flag, but age-appropriate screening or concerning features such as hematochezia, anemia, weight loss, or family history should prompt endoscopic evaluation rather than empiric laxatives alone [^112jPYpF]. I need to ensure I also check for medications that cause constipation, including opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and iron, and consider basic labs such as TSH and calcium when clinically indicated, as these are standard parts of initial assessment in contemporary guidelines [^1141C5hN].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic first-line measures and be careful not to overstate their benefit. Dietary fiber and adequate hydration are strongly recommended as initial therapy, but I should double-check the evidence quality; ASCRS supports this as strong recommendation with low-quality evidence, and AGA–ACG suggests fiber supplementation with a conditional recommendation, emphasizing psyllium as the most consistently effective fiber and noting uncertain benefit for bran or inulin, which tempers enthusiasm for all fiber types equally [^114mxYru] [^116N6ytY] [^111LkrAP]. Wait, let me verify dosing and tolerability; typical targets are 20–30 g/day total fiber with adequate fluids, titrated to effect, and I should counsel that bloating and flatulence are common and may limit adherence, especially as intake increases, which is why slow titration and hydration counseling matter [^116SwXcf] [^1169eWXY]. I should also confirm that exercise is reasonable to encourage, though high-quality evidence is limited, and that patients with low baseline fiber intake are most likely to benefit from supplementation, which guides shared decision-making here [^111rCUZ8] [^116N6ytY].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacologic therapy, and I need to ensure I prioritize agents with the best balance of efficacy and safety. Polyethylene glycol is strongly recommended as first-line osmotic therapy with moderate certainty, and I should remember that its benefit is durable over months and that dose can be titrated to effect while watching for bloating and loose stools, which supports early placement in the algorithm after or even alongside fiber [^114KtWKs] [^114e8Xm5] [^111Th7Hq]. Hold on, I should verify comparative data; meta-analyses show PEG outperforms lactulose for stool frequency, consistency, and abdominal pain, reinforcing PEG as preferred over lactulose when choosing an osmotic agent, which is echoed by primary care guidance as well [^113JReQ8] [^114SbQon]. Let me consider magnesium oxide; the panel suggests MgO as an alternative osmotic, but I need to ensure renal function is adequate and avoid use in renal insufficiency due to hypermagnesemia risk, and I should start low and titrate cautiously given limited long-term data [^113oK2Mn] [^113mK1CT].

> But wait, what if the patient needs faster relief or is already on fiber/osmotics with inadequate response; I should review stimulant options and their role. Bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate are recommended for short-term or rescue therapy with moderate certainty, and I should frame them as intermittent or adjunctive rather than maintenance unless necessary, given abdominal cramping and diarrhea risks and limited long-term safety data, which supports a cautious, as-needed strategy [^1129fKtJ] [^116qZwNG]. I should double-check senna; the panel suggests senna with a conditional recommendation and low certainty, and I need to counsel that long-term safety remains uncertain, so if used, it should be at the lowest effective dose with monitoring for tolerance and side effects, aligning with a conservative approach [^116sdzyj] [^113vVaBL].

> Next, I should review escalation to prescription therapies for patients who fail or cannot tolerate OTC options, and I need to align choices with symptom phenotype and comorbidities. Linaclotide and plecanatide have strong recommendations with moderate certainty for CIC not responding to OTC agents, and both can improve CSBMs and global relief, though diarrhea is the most common adverse effect and may necessitate dose adjustment or discontinuation, which I should discuss upfront in shared decision-making [^115Jrgd2] [^11296aac]. Prucalopride, a 5-HT4 agonist, also carries a strong recommendation with moderate certainty and can be particularly helpful when motility is a prominent issue or when secretagogues are not tolerated, with typical side effects including headache, nausea, and diarrhea, and no clear label limit on duration, which supports longer-term use when effective [^113HYhNt] [^1172cedr]. Lubiprostone is conditionally recommended and may be favored when nausea risk is acceptable and when taken with food to mitigate GI upset; I should confirm dose adjustments in hepatic impairment and set expectations for early onset within 1–2 days in responders [^114zCJxB] [^1156redj].

> Hold on, I should verify the place of lactulose; I initially thought to avoid it entirely given inferiority to PEG, but the AGA–ACG guideline suggests lactulose after failure or intolerance of OTC therapies, so it remains a reasonable alternative when PEG is not suitable, albeit with awareness of bloating and flatulence that may limit adherence [^112mVq5j] [^112VYuML]. Let me reconsider combination therapy; in practice, combining classes such as osmotic plus secretagogue or adding prucalopride to a secretagogue can be useful in refractory cases, and I should document prior adequate trials before declaring failure to avoid premature escalation or invasive testing [^113gHohV].

> I need to ensure I do not miss pelvic floor dysfunction, because that changes management entirely. If symptoms suggest outlet obstruction or if constipation remains refractory despite appropriate medical therapy, anorectal testing with manometry and balloon expulsion is recommended, and biofeedback therapy is the first-line treatment for dyssynergic defecation, with high response rates that exceed those of laxatives alone, which is a critical pivot in the algorithm [^116SX8LV]. Wait, let me verify that guidelines converge here; both ASCRS and European neurogastroenterology guidance align on manometry and biofeedback as central, reinforcing the need to test before escalating pharmacotherapy indefinitely or considering surgery [^116SX8LV].

> For truly refractory cases, I should confirm surgical indications and counsel on trade-offs, because the evidence base is limited and patient selection is key. Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis can benefit carefully selected patients with isolated slow-transit constipation confirmed on physiologic testing, but risks include diarrhea, incontinence, and the potential need for stoma, so shared decision-making and expectation setting are essential, and segmental resection should generally be avoided given high failure rates [^116Zo6mF]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated certainty; ASCRS gives a conditional recommendation with low-quality evidence, so I should frame this as a last-resort option after exhaustive conservative and medical therapy, ideally in centers with experience [^116Zo6mF]. Fecal diversion may be considered in intractable cases, but regret and complications are not rare, so this should be reserved for exceptional circumstances with multidisciplinary input [^111WeEHK].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts so I do not apply a one-size-fits-all approach. In older adults, I need to monitor electrolytes with osmotic or stimulant laxatives, start low and go slow, and consider MgO cautiously due to renal clearance concerns, while still prioritizing PEG as first-line when appropriate [^113mK1CT] [^114KtWKs]. In pregnancy, I should avoid MgO and stimulants when possible and favor fiber and PEG as safer options, adjusting as gestation progresses and in coordination with obstetrics [^113mK1CT]. For opioid-induced constipation, I must recognize that standard laxatives may be insufficient and that PAMORA agents are preferred per OIC-specific guidelines, which requires a separate pathway and indication-specific prescribing [^112cUotn]. In IBS-C, I should confirm Rome IV criteria and consider that secretagogues and prucalopride may address both pain and constipation more effectively than simple laxatives, aligning with IBS-C guidance and explaining why some patients with overlapping symptoms respond better to these classes [^113gHohV].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and ensure it aligns with the evidence and shared decision-making principles. Start with history, exam, and exclusion of secondary causes and alarm features; initiate fiber and fluids with a preference for psyllium if supplementing; if inadequate, add PEG and titrate to effect; if still inadequate, use stimulants intermittently or as rescue; if OTC therapy fails, escalate to linaclotide, plecanatide, or prucalopride based on symptoms, comorbidities, and patient preference; if refractory, evaluate for pelvic floor dysfunction with manometry and balloon expulsion and pursue biofeedback; and if biofeedback fails and slow-transit is confirmed, consider TAC-IRA in expert centers, documenting response at each step to avoid premature switching [^114mxYru] [^114KtWKs] [^11296aac] [^113HYhNt] [^116Zo6mF]. Hold on, I should verify that this mirrors AGA–ACG and ASCRS; yes, both endorse early fiber and PEG, stimulants as rescue, prescription agents for OTC-refractory disease, and physiologic testing before surgery, which supports this flow [^111ewk73] [^114mxYru].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up, and I need to ensure I use objective measures where possible to guide titration and detect nonresponse early. Validated tools such as the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms and Constipation Severity Instrument can track severity and quality-of-life impact, and I should reassess every 4–6 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months once stable, adjusting therapy based on CSBMs, straining, stool form, and adverse effects, which operationalizes guideline emphasis on iterative care and shared decision-making [^111Fe1dg]. Let me reconsider the role of decision aids; for conditional recommendations, decision aids can help align choices with patient values regarding side effects, cost, and route, which is particularly relevant when selecting among secretagogues or considering biofeedback versus surgery [^113hJeXY].

> Finally, I should confirm key safety pearls and counseling points so I do not overlook preventable harms. With PEG, bloating and loose stools are common and dose-related, and durability beyond 6 months has been demonstrated, supporting long-term use when effective; with stimulants, limit to short courses or rescue to mitigate cramping and electrolyte disturbances; with MgO, avoid in renal insufficiency and monitor for hypermagnesemia; and with secretagogues, counsel on diarrhea and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if severe, which should be documented in the care plan and revisited at each visit [^111Th7Hq] [^111XY6WM] [^113mK1CT] [^11296aac]. I need to ensure I also reinforce hydration with fiber, review all OTC and prescription agents at each visit to avoid duplication, and set expectations that multimodal therapy and persistence are often required, which improves adherence and outcomes in real-world care [^116N6ytY] [^113gHohV].

Chronic constipation is defined by **Rome IV criteria** as persistent symptoms for ≥ 3 months, including < 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week, straining, hard stools, and incomplete evacuation. Initial management is **lifestyle and dietary changes** (increase fiber to 20–30 g/day, fluids, and activity) [^116HhvJX] [^116SwXcf]. If symptoms persist, use osmotic laxatives (PEG 17 g/day) as first-line pharmacologic therapy [^111Th7Hq]; stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, senna) are for rescue or second-line use [^114mxYru] [^116qZwNG]. For refractory cases, add secretagogues (linaclotide, plecanatide, lubiprostone) or prucalopride [^115Jrgd2] [^11296aac] [^113HYhNt]. Reserve surgery for severe, refractory slow-transit constipation after physiologic testing and multidisciplinary review [^116Zo6mF]. Evaluate for alarm features (weight loss, anemia, hematochezia) and consider colonoscopy if indicated [^112jPYpF].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

According to **Rome IV**, functional constipation is diagnosed when ≥ 2 of the following occur in ≥ 25% of defecations — straining, lumpy/hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockade, manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation, or < 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week — for ≥ 3 months, with symptom onset ≥ 6 months prior, and insufficient criteria for IBS [^116HhvJX].

---

## Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Directed history and exam to exclude secondary causes and characterize symptoms (strong, low-quality evidence) [^114mxYru].

- **Alarm features**: Weight loss, anemia, hematochezia, or family history of colorectal cancer warrant further evaluation [^112jPYpF].

- **Colonoscopy**: Indicated for age-appropriate screening or when alarm features are present [^112jPYpF].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacologic measures are **first-line** and should be initiated before medications:

- **Dietary fiber**: 20–30 g/day (soluble preferred, e.g. psyllium) [^116SwXcf] [^116N6ytY].

- **Fluids**: Adequate hydration (≥ 8 cups/day).

- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise to promote bowel motility.

- **Behavioral therapy**: Biofeedback for pelvic floor dysfunction [^116iUvDq].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line pharmacologic therapy

Osmotic laxatives are **first-line** because of their favorable efficacy and safety. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 17 g/day is strongly recommended and improves stool frequency and consistency with durable response [^114KtWKs] [^114e8Xm5]. Magnesium oxide is an alternative; use caution in renal insufficiency [^113oK2Mn] [^113mK1CT].

---

### Second-line pharmacologic therapy

Stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, senna) are for **rescue therapy or second-line use**, with short-term use preferred due to cramping and electrolyte effects [^114mxYru] [^116qZwNG].

---

### Advanced pharmacologic therapy

For refractory cases, **secretagogues and prokinetics** are recommended:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Linaclotide | Guanylate cyclase-C agonist | Strong |
| Plecanatide | Guanylate cyclase-C agonist | Strong |
| Lubiprostone | Chloride channel activator | Conditional |
| Prucalopride | 5-HT4 agonist | Strong |

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **severe, refractory slow-transit constipation** confirmed by physiologic testing. Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is conditionally recommended for isolated slow-transit constipation [^116Zo6mF]. Fecal diversion may be considered in intractable cases [^111WeEHK].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Use caution with magnesium-containing laxatives; monitor renal function [^113mK1CT].

- **Pregnancy**: PEG is safe; avoid stimulant laxatives if possible.

- **Opioid-induced constipation**: Use PAMORAs (e.g. naloxegol) [^116SX8LV].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should **assess efficacy, side effects, and adherence**. Patient-reported outcomes and quality-of-life tools can guide therapy adjustments [^111Fe1dg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Recommendation strength** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Dietary fiber, fluids, exercise | Strong |
| 2 | Osmotic laxatives (PEG) | Strong |
| 3 | Stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, senna) | Conditional |
| 4 | Secretagogues (linaclotide, plecanatide, lubiprostone) | Strong/Conditional |
| 5 | Prucalopride | Strong |
| 6 | Surgery (TAC-IRA) | Conditional |

---

Chronic constipation management is **stepwise**, beginning with lifestyle and fiber, then osmotic laxatives, followed by stimulants, secretagogues, or prokinetics, and finally surgery for refractory cases.

Background

Chronic constipation is a common condition seen in family practice among the elderly and women. There is no consensus regarding its exact definition, and it may be interpreted differently by physicians and patients. Physicians prescribe various treatments, and patients often adopt different over-the-counter remedies. Chronic constipation is either caused by slow colonic transit or pelvic floor dysfunction, and treatment differs accordingly.

Methods

To update our knowledge of chronic constipation and its etiology and best-evidence treatment, information was synthesized from articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Levels of evidence and recommendations were made according to the Strength of Recommendation taxonomy.

Results

The standard advice of increasing dietary fibers, fluids, and exercise for relieving chronic constipation will only benefit patients with true deficiency. Biofeedback works best for constipation caused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Pharmacological agents increase bulk or water content in the bowel lumen or aim to stimulate bowel movements. Novel classes of compounds have emerged for treating chronic constipation, with promising clinical trial data. Finally, the link between senna abuse and colon cancer remains unsupported.

Conclusions

Chronic constipation should be managed according to its etiology and guided by the best evidence-based treatment.

AGA–ACG recommendation strength interpretation clarifies that strong recommendations mean most patients would want the recommended course and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional recommendations mean the majority would want the suggested course but many would not; for clinicians, strong recommendations imply most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed, while conditional recommendations call for shared decision making and decision aids may be useful; for policy makers, strong recommendations can be adopted as policy or performance measures in most situations, while conditional recommendations require substantial debate and stakeholder involvement with performance measures assessing whether decision making is appropriate.

Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms

A number of groups have provided recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of constipation;, however, no standardized treatment guidelines have gained acceptance in general medical practice. Although the evidence for a number of interventions (including modifications to diet and lifestyle) is weak or contradictory, all the guidelines recommend that these be tried before pharmacological intervention. In general, where treatment pathways are recommended, the sequence is:

Exclude other pathologies and secondary causes.,
Begin treatment with dietary and lifestyle adjustments.,
Move to osmotic laxatives, stool softeners and bulk-forming agents – there is no consensus on the order in which these should be tried.
Move to stimulant laxatives, suppositories and/or enemas,– some guidelines recommend medical supervision at this stage.
Surgery should be used as a last resort or to treat identified disorders that require surgical correction.

Although prokinetic agents feature in the two sets of US guidelines (Grade A recommendation), these are now out of date. Tegaserod has now been limited to emergency use in the US and has not received licensing approval in the EU. Prucalopride has recently received EU approval for the treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief; this is not mentioned in the guidelines.

Once organic disorders and obstructions have been excluded, a functional bowel disorder is the most likely explanation for the constipation. Most patients with chronic constipation report minimal abdominal bloating or discomfort associated with their other symptoms of chronic constipation; however, in some patients, as symptoms often overlap, it may be difficult to distinguish chronic constipation and IBS-C. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Chronic Constipation Task Force defined IBS-C as clinically important abdominal discomfort associated with symptoms of constipation. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for IBS indicate a positive diagnosis only if the person has abdominal pain/discomfort that is either relieved by defecation, or associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form, and at least two of the following: altered stool passage; abdominal bloating, distension, tension, or hardness, symptoms made worse by eating and passage of mucus.

Chronic constipation — dietary and fiber-based initial management: The initial management of patients with symptomatic constipation involves dietary modifications and ensuring adequate fluid intake and fiber supplementation. Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence. Dietary modification and increasing water and fiber consumption are considered firstline treatments in the management of constipation and are typically recommended before investigations of pelvic floor function and colonic motility are performed. In a randomized trial of 72 patients, ingesting a combination of soluble and insoluble fiber resulted in similar increased bowel motility but was better tolerated than using psyllium alone. Daily dietary fiber supplementation with oat bran has been shown to allow discontinuation of laxatives in 59% to 80% of elderly patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. However, 80% of patients with slow colonic transit and 63% of patients with constipation because of outlet obstruction may not respond adequately to increased dietary fiber, whereas 85% of patients with an underlying pathologic finding may see symptomatic improvement. Compared with placebo, soluble fiber improved global constipation symptoms (86.5% vs 47.4%, p < 0.001), straining (55.6% vs 28.6%, p = 0.003), and mean number of stools per week (3.8 stools per week after therapy compared with 2.9 stools per week at baseline). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of female patients (n = 54) assigned to psyllium husk or placebo for 4 weeks, improvements related to fiber use included straining (55.2% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001), less than 3 BMs per week (86.2% vs 32%, p = 0.027), pain with BMs (58.6% vs 28.0%, p = 0.024), and less feeling of incomplete defecation (65.5% vs 16.0%, p < 0.001).

Chronic constipation — use of objective symptom and quality-of-life measures: Objective measures assessing the nature, severity, and impact of constipation on quality of life can be useful when evaluating patients with constipation. Strength of recommendation: conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

The Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium recommended using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire and the Constipation Severity Instrument when assessing patients with constipation.

Introduction

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults.

Methods

The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone.

Discussion

This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.

Chronic constipation — colonoscopy indications and colorectal neoplasia yield are summarized as follows: A meta-analysis of 8 cross-sectional studies found that constipation alone, as a presenting symptom, was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. In a retrospective study of 985 patients who underwent colonoscopy as part of their evaluation for constipation, the polyp detection rate was 9.7%, and 9 patients (6.3%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In general, a colonoscopy should be recommended if patients meet guideline criteria for general screening or if patients present with concerning symptoms, such as hematochezia, weight loss, or change in bowel habits; have a strong family history of colorectal cancer; or have anemia and warrant further investigation.

### Consensus recommendations for the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness [^114X5R2b]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Constipation is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with advanced, progressive illnesses. Although opioids are one of the most common causes of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness, it is important to note that there are many other potential etiologies and combinations of causes that should be taken into consideration when making treatment decisions. Management approaches involve a combination of good assessment techniques, preventive regimens, appropriate pharmacological treatment of established constipation, and frequent monitoring. In this vulnerable patient population, maintenance of comfort and respect for individual preferences and sensitivities should be overriding considerations when making clinical decisions. This consensus document was developed by a multidisciplinary group of leading Canadian palliative care specialists in an effort to define best practices in palliative constipation management that will be relevant and useful to health care professionals. Although a wide range of options exists to help treat constipation and prevent its development or recurrence, there is a limited body of evidence evaluating pharmacological interventions. These recommendations are, therefore, based on the best of the available evidence, combined with expert opinion derived from experience in clinical practice. This underscores the need for further clinical evaluation of the available agents to create a robust, evidence-based foundation for treatment decisions in the management of constipation in patients with advanced, progressive illness.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna recommendation: In adults with CIC, the panel suggests the use of senna over management without senna (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations state that trials were conducted for 4 weeks and longer term use is probably appropriate but needs data on tolerance and side effects; the dose evaluated in trials is higher than commonly used and the panel suggests starting at a lower dose and increase if there is no response; and abdominal pain and cramping may occur with a higher dose of senna.

Implementation considerations specify that short-term use is defined as daily use for 4 wk or less; while long-term use is probably appropriate, data are needed to better understand tolerance and side effects; this is a good option for occasional use or rescue therapy in combination with other pharmacological agents for CIC; and the most common side effects are abdominal pain, cramping and diarrhea, with the panel suggesting starting at a lower dose and increasing the dose as tolerated.

### Current management strategies and therapeutic targets in chronic constipation [^112qS6Wd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Constipated patients who are refractory to simple lifestyle interventions will usually resort to laxatives, whether prescribed or over the counter. Clinical trial evidence is scarce for older medications such as laxatives, especially with a condition as chronic and subjective as constipation. Newer polyethylene glycol-based laxatives have been investigated under rigorous clinical trial settings, but comparisons between different laxatives are not available. Newer prokinetic agents, targeting peristalsis, intestinal secretion and the colonic flora, have been developed for laxative refractory constipation. This review focuses on the evidence for each of these agents, and the relative indications for each of them.

Background

Current clinical guidelines for chronic constipation offer limited dietary recommendations. The aim of this project was to develop the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation in adults.

Methods

Four systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The findings generated from the meta-analyses were then used to develop guideline statements using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and a Delphi consensus survey among a multidisciplinary expert Guideline Steering Committee. Recommendation statements were produced for treatment response, stool output, gut symptoms, adverse events, and quality of life, and only based on the findings where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta-analysis. The strength of recommendation was assessed using the GRADE approach. Consensus voting among the Guideline Steering Committee was performed using a modified Delphi survey approach.

Results

The four systematic reviews included a total of 75 RCTs. Fifty-nine dietary recommendation statements were generated and accepted through the Delphi survey. For dietary supplements, 15 recommendation statements relate to fiber supplements, 20 relate to probiotics, two to synbiotics, five to magnesium oxide, two to senna, and three to kiwifruit supplements. For foods, three recommendation statements related to kiwifruits, two to prunes, and two to rye bread. For drinks, five recommendation statements related to high mineral-containing water. No recommendations were made for whole diet approaches due to lack of evidence. Twelve statements had a very low level of evidence, 39 had a low level of evidence, and eight had moderate evidence. Twenty-seven statements were strong recommendations, and 32 were qualified recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive evidence-based dietary guidelines for the management of constipation based upon a robust systematic review and GRADE processes. Recommendations were made for dietary supplements, foods, and drinks that have never been previously included in clinical guidelines, and can now be rapidly implemented into clinical practice, thereby improving clinical care and patient outcomes.

### Surgery for constipation: systematic review and practice recommendations: graded practice and future research recommendations [^1151eA4o]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

This manuscript forms the final of seven that address the surgical management of chronic constipation (CC) in adults. The content coalesces results from the five systematic reviews that precede it and of the European Consensus process to derive graded practice recommendations (GPR).

Methods

Summary of review data, development of GPR and future research recommendations as outlined in detail in the 'introduction and methods' paper.

Results

The overall quality of data in the five reviews was poor with 113/156(72.4%) of included studies providing only level IV evidence and only four included level I RCTs. Coalescence of data from the five procedural classes revealed that few firm conclusions could be drawn regarding procedural choice or patient selection: no single procedure dominated in addressing dynamic structural abnormalities of the anorectum and pelvic floor with each having similar overall efficacy. Of one hundred 'prototype' GPRs developed by the clinical guideline group, 85/100 were deemed 'appropriate' based on the independent scoring of a panel of 18 European experts and use of RAND-UCLA consensus methodology. The remaining 15 were all deemed uncertain. Future research recommendations included some potential RCTs but also a strong emphasis on delivery of large multinational high-quality prospective cohort studies.

Conclusion

While the evidence base for surgery in CC is poor, the widespread European consensus for GPRs is encouraging. Professional bodies have the opportunity to build on this work by supporting the efforts of their membership to help convert the documented recommendations into clinical guidelines.

Introduction

Chronic constipation is a common disorder with a reported prevalence ranging from 3% to 27% in the general population. Several management strategies, including diagnostic tests, empiric treatments, and specific treatments, have been developed. Our aim was to develop European guidelines for the clinical management of constipation.

Design

After a thorough review of the literature by experts in relevant fields, including gastroenterologists, surgeons, general practitioners, radiologists, and experts in gastrointestinal motility testing from various European countries, a Delphi consensus process was used to produce statements and practical algorithms for the management of chronic constipation.

Key Results

Seventy-three final statements were agreed upon after the Delphi process. The level of evidence for most statements was low or very low. A high level of evidence was agreed only for anorectal manometry as a comprehensive evaluation of anorectal function and for treatment with osmotic laxatives, especially polyethylene glycol, the prokinetic drug prucalopride, secretagogues, such as linaclotide and lubiprostone and PAMORAs for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation. However, the level of agreement between the authors was good for most statements (80% or more of the authors). The greatest disagreement was related to the surgical management of constipation.

Conclusions and Inferences

European guidelines on chronic constipation, with recommendations and algorithms, were developed by experts. Despite the high level of agreement between the different experts, the level of scientific evidence for most recommendations was low, highlighting the need for future research to increase the evidence and improve treatment outcomes in these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^114xeRU3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

As previously mentioned, guidelines and algorithms for the management and treatment of chronic constipation have not taken into account more recent therapeutic developments. Although a new set of Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithms covering the diagnosis and management of FGIDs including chronic constipationand refractory constipationhave been recently published, newer agents have not been included. According to these guidelines, patients with constipation that is refractory to a high-fiber diet and traditional laxatives should be referred for physiological testing, such as anorectal manometry, rectal balloon expulsion, and colon transit. Now, with the recent availability of prokinetic agents such as prucalopride, an additional therapeutic step can be added to these existing guidelines. Once idiopathic chronic constipation has been identified, and IBS and secondary constipation have been excluded, empirical treatment with osmotic and/or stimulant laxatives should be employed. Following this, if patients still experience continuous symptoms (e.g. bloating, abdominal discomfort and incomplete bowel movements), a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride could be considered (Fig. 2). If constipation symptoms are refractory to pharmacological treatment, patients should be referred for physiological testing as outlined in the published Rome algorithm for refractive constipation and difficult defecation (Fig. 3). Patients should only be referred for surgery following colon transit testing without, and then with, laxatives.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation – a European perspective [^114yh8BM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although constipation can be a chronic and severe problem, it is largely treated empirically. Evidence for the efficacy of some of the older laxatives from well-designed trials is limited. Patients often report high levels of dissatisfaction with their treatment, which is attributed to a lack of efficacy or unpleasant side-effects. Management guidelines and recommendations are limited and are not sufficiently current to include treatments that became available more recently, such as prokinetic agents in Europe.

Purpose

We present an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, current management and available guidelines for the treatment of chronic constipation, and include recent data on the efficacy and potential clinical use of the more newly available therapeutic agents. Based on published algorithms and guidelines on the management of chronic constipation, secondary pathologies and causes are first excluded and then diet, lifestyle, and, if available, behavioral measures adopted. If these fail, bulk-forming, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives can be used. If symptoms are not satisfactorily resolved, a prokinetic agent such as prucalopride can be prescribed. Biofeedback is recommended as a treatment for chronic constipation in patients with disordered defecation. Surgery should only be considered once all other treatment options have been exhausted.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation in adults: a scoping review [^116rJzkS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is notable that there was no diagnostic biomarker for IBS-C and FC in all CPGs, which indicated that this spectrum of diseases is still grouped together by symptoms with unclear pathological mechanisms. Assessments for the known pathophysiology of constipation were recommended in most FC CPGs. However, only one IBS CPG and one constipation CPG recommended visceral sensitivity test for IBS-C/FC patients. Even most CPGs acknowledged that visceral hypersensitivity was the key factor of abdominal pain, rare CPGs recommended testing visceral sensitivity in clinical practice. With limited clinical evidence and inconvenient testing method for visceral sensitivity, there was still a lack of objective criteria for the assessment of abdominal pain in clinical practice. Although CPGs did not recommend any biomarkers for IBS-C/FC, emerging evidence suggested that certain biomarkers such as serotonin, gut microbiota, and their metabolites could be potential in distinguishing between these conditions and improving diagnostic accuracy, as they might play important roles in pathophysiology of IBS-C/FC.

While this review primarily focused on diagnostic criteria, diagnosis is closely tied to treatment strategies. This study highlighted that effective management of both FC and IBS-C should take a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach, addressing not only bowel movement frequency and stool consistency but also abdominal pain intensity and frequency, the severity of constipation-related symptoms, and overall quality of life. A more holistic treatment strategy that considers these factors can lead to better symptom control, improved patient satisfaction, and enhanced long-term outcomes. In addition, both IBS-C and FC are chronic disorders with symptoms fluctuating over time, which posing a challenge for long-term disease management. Effective treatment requires a flexible and personalized approach tailored to symptom variability. Clinicians must adapt management strategies to address changing symptoms, ensuring that both bowel function and abdominal pain are appropriately managed. Furthermore, patients' perceptions of their symptoms and diagnosis influence their treatment adherence and overall satisfaction, making it essential for CPGs to incorporate patient-centered considerations in diagnostic frameworks.

Chronic constipation is prevalent in Western countries and is a complaint that is commonly seen in clinical practice. Only a relatively small percentage of constipated patients seek medical evaluation and most can be managed satisfactorily with first-line, conservative therapy. In patients with severe, refractory constipation, additional studies of colonic and anorectal function have clinical utility, as such patients are candidates for therapies not given to most constipated patients. This article reviews the modern principles and therapies used to manage chronic constipation of varying severities.

Stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate) for chronic idiopathic constipation: The panel recommends the use of bisacodyl or sodium picosulfate (SPS) short term or as rescue therapy over management without bisacodyl or SPS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were included: a United Kingdom study assigned participants in a 2:1 ratio to bisacodyl (n = 247) vs placebo (n = 121) for 4 weeks, and a German study randomized participants 2:1 to SPS (n = 229) or placebo (n = 133) for 4 weeks. Based on meta-analyzed data from 2 studies, SPS likely leads to a large increase in CSBMs per week (MD 2.54, 95% CI 1.37–4.01) and SBMs per week (MD 4.04, 95% CI 2.37–5.71) and improved stool consistency on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (MD 2.4 points higher). Implementation considerations state this is a good option for occasional use or rescue therapy in combination with other pharmacological agents for CIC; the most common side effects are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and the panel suggests starting at a lower dose and increasing the dose as tolerated.

ASCRS chronic constipation guidelines — patients with isolated refractory colonic slow-transit constipation may benefit from total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TAC-IRA); strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. Segmental colectomy can have a failure rate as high as 100%, whereas TAC-IRA is associated with clinical improvement in 50% to 100% of patients. In a retrospective series of 42 patients with a 15-year follow-up after TAC-IRA, 50% had less than 4 BMs per day and 21% experienced severe incontinence, and 8 patients (19%) ultimately underwent a permanent ileostomy. A survey of 75 patients after TAC-IRA reported diarrhea in 46% but more than 90% would undergo TAC-IRA again. An alternative, the Jinling subtotal colectomy with side-to-side cecorectal anastomosis, was reviewed in 117 patients with score improvements observed at 1 month and maintained at 48 months, and a comparison found cecorectal anastomosis more often associated with persistent constipation and lower patient satisfaction (73% vs 93%).

### Comparison of strategies and goals for treatment of chronic constipation among gastroenterologists and general practitioners [^1155SzvD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although guidelines have been published for the treatment of chronic constipation, little is known about the actual treatment strategies, the definitions of drug efficacy, the parameters for drug selection, and the conceived limitations of the available treatments. The purpose of this study was to address these issues by comparing treatment strategies among gastroenterology specialists (GIs) and general practitioners (GPs).

Methods

An internet survey was sent nationwide and at random to GIs and GPs in order to define treatment strategies, drug efficacy, main parameters for drug selections and the main limitations of the available drug therapy.

Results

Forty GIs and 132 GPs answered the survey. The maximal sample error was ± 13.4% and ± 8.8%. Treatment strategies varied considerably between GPs and GIs. The major parameters for drug selection were related to drug safety among GIs and to clinical outcome among GPs. The conceived limitations of drug therapy included lack of experience and unwanted side effects.

Conclusions

Awareness of the possible treatment options and the recommended order of prescription differs between GIs and GPs. There are still unmet needs for optimizing the treatment for chronic constipation.

Secretagogues — linaclotide for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) who do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) agents — the panel suggests the use of linaclotide over management without linaclotide (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). It can be used as a replacement or as an adjunct to OTC agents; duration of treatment in trials was 12 weeks, but the drug label does not provide a limit; it may be associated with side effects of diarrhea leading to discontinuation of treatment. In three 12-week randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials, linaclotide at 145 and 290 μg daily increased complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week (MD 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.95) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week (MD 1.97, 95% CI 1.59–2.36), improved stool consistency (MD 1.25, 95% CI 1.11–1.39 higher), and increased rates of global relief (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.63–2.35). Responder rates increased compared with placebo (RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.68–5.88), 119 more per 1,000 (from 38 to 271 more), but participants might be 3 times more likely to have diarrhea leading to treatment discontinuation (RR 3.35, 95% CI 2.09–5.36), 38 more per 1,000 (from 8 to 154 more).

### Chronic constipation: a critical review [^116anV1x]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a very common symptom that is rarely associated with life-threatening diseases, but has a substantial impact on patient quality of life and consumption of healthcare resources. Despite the large number of affected patients and the social relevance of the condition, no cost-effectiveness analysis has been made of any diagnostic or therapeutic algorithm, and there are few data comparing different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the long term. In this scenario, increasing emphasis has been placed on demonstrating that a number of older and new therapeutic options are effective in treating chronic constipation in well-performed randomised controlled trials, but there is still debate as to when these therapeutic options should be included in diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. The aim of this review is to perform a critical evaluation of the current diagnostic and therapeutic options available for adult patients with chronic constipation in order to identify a rational patient approach; furthermore we attempt to clarify some of the more controversial points to aid clinicians in managing this symptom in a more efficacious and cost-effective manner.

Fiber supplements (psyllium) — benefits, harms, and use in chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are described as follows: Based on a meta-analysis, the use of psyllium may lead to an increase in spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, and combined data from 2 studies showed that psyllium may increase global relief of symptoms with little to no difference in stool consistency. The certainty of evidence for SBM, serious adverse events, and global relief was low and for diarrhea was very low. In general, chronically constipated patients and nonconstipated persons drink similar amounts of fluid daily, and standard doses of fiber supplements are typically taken with 8–10 ounces of fluid. In individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms, especially those with low dietary fiber intake, a trial of fiber supplementation is warranted because it is low-risk, low-cost, and easily accessible.

Chronic constipation — osmotic and stimulant laxatives: Osmotic laxatives are an appropriate firstline medical therapy to manage chronic constipation. Stimulant laxatives, such as bisacodyl, can be considered for rescue therapy or as a second-line therapy, if needed. Strength of recommendation: strong based on moderate-quality evidence. Osmotic agents used in the treatment of constipation include polyethylene glycol (PEG)–based solutions and magnesium salt–based products, and osmotic laxatives are generally preferred over stimulants, such as senna or bisacodyl, given the short-term and long-term efficacy and safety with PEG-based treatment. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing superiority of PEG versus lactulose for improving stool frequency and consistency, relieving abdominal pain, and reducing use of other laxatives; magnesium salt laxatives such as magnesium sulfate have been shown to improve stool frequency and consistency compared with placebo with safety profiles comparable to PEG solutions. For stimulants, a meta-analysis demonstrated superior efficacy for sodium picosulfate and bisacodyl at 4 weeks compared to prescription motility agents and secretagogues, with abdominal pain as the most frequent side effect, and there is a lack of RCTs documenting the safety and efficacy of anthraquinone stimulant laxatives, including senna, cascara, and aloe, in treating chronic constipation.

### An appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for constipation: a right attitude towards to guidelines [^115cABvF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a disorder defined by incomplete defecation, and/or infrequent bowel movements which associated with persistent difficult and/or painful defecation, fecal incontinence, and abdominal pain. It is a common clinical functional diseases. The worldwide constipation surveys show a wide range of prevalence rates between 1% and > 20% in western populations, although, a recent epidemiological reports found 16% general adult populations were constipation. Constipation may be found for up to 20% of community-dwelling elderly individuals. Moreover the incidence of functional constipation in childhood estimated 3%.

Because of its high disease burden, the treatment of constipation has become an important issue for clinicians and patients. During the last two decade there were more than 20 developed clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to manage the constipation. The main role of the CPGs is to give clear recommendations to help clinicians make appropriate clinical decision for specific clinical circumstance.

However, not all guidelines are developed with the same methodologically rigorous approaches, there is no research for evaluating the quality of CPGs on constipation so far. With the above in mind, the objectives of the present study was to systematically review guidelines using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREEII) instrument related to constipation.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) — chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) efficacy, safety, dose, and certainty are summarized as follows: PEG is approved at a dose of 17 g daily and is widely available OTC, and studies using PEG with and without electrolytes demonstrated greater efficacy in increasing CSBMs, SBMs, response rate, stool form, straining, and global relief vs placebo, with no abdominal pain. No conclusive statements could be made about risks of serious adverse events with PEG, and the overall certainty of evidence for PEG was moderate. Individuals treated with PEG may experience bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, and it is stated that it is reasonable to use PEG earlier in the CIC management algorithm, either after or with fiber supplementation.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1169eWXY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder with an estimated prevalence of 12% in adults. It is characterized by predominant symptoms of infrequent, difficult, or incomplete defecation. Chronic constipation impacts quality of life, with impairments in social functioning and mental health. In the United States, each year there are more than 2.5 million visits to medical centers where constipation is the leading diagnosis, with annual direct costs of the condition ranging from $1912 to $11,991 per patient.

The management of chronic constipation can be challenging. Recommendations include lifestyle advice (e.g. increasing dietary fiber), followed by laxatives. However, half of people with constipation are dissatisfied with the current treatment options, primarily because of a lack of effectiveness and side effects. This highlights the need for better access to management strategies that can safely and effectively improve constipation symptoms.

Fiber supplementation is indicated as first-line management for chronic constipation in British, American, and European guidelines. Fiber encompasses all carbohydrates that are neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and have a degree of polymerization of 3 or more monomeric units, plus lignin. This includes prebiotic fibers, which are substrates that are selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring a health benefit. Soluble, viscous fibers can influence stool bulking directly through water retention in the colon, resulting in softer stools. Insoluble, nonviscous fibers can cause mechanical stimulation of the gut mucosa that accelerates gut transit time (GTT). Fermentable fibers may increase stool bulk indirectly through fermentation byproducts that influence contractile activity in the gut and increase microbial biomass through changes in the gut microbiome. However, fermentation also results in the production of gas, which can cause side effects, such as flatulence or bloating.

A meta-analysis published in 2016 indicated beneficial effects of fiber supplementation at improving stool frequency and consistency in adults with chronic constipation, although its consumption led to side effects, such as flatulence. The review included only 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), limiting the interpretation of the overall effectiveness and subgroup analyses based upon the types of fiber, doses, and treatment durations, rendering its application to clinical practice challenging. Many studies have since been performed evaluating a range of types and doses of fiber and measuring additional outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of fiber supplementation on response to treatment, stool output, GTT, symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, and compliance in adults with chronic constipation.

AGA–ACG chronic idiopathic constipation — inulin fiber evidence summarizes two studies: a randomized placebo-controlled trial in Brazil with 60 participants aged 18–65 years with at least 3 months of constipation and < 3 bowel movements per day (28 in fiber, 32 placebo) using a 4-day adaptation then a 3-week treatment with either 15g/d of inulin or 15 g/d of maltodextrin divided into 3 sachets of 5 g each, and a Belgian study in participants aged 50–70 years randomized to 7.5 g of inulin or placebo for 28 days with 37 participants per group and 4 weeks follow-up. Based on one small study, inulin had little to no effect on SBMs per week (MD −0.75, CI −2.60 to 1.10) and no impact on responder rate defined as ≥ 3 CSBMs per week (RR 1.21, CI 0.83–1.74); no serious adverse events were reported, though flatulence occurred more frequently in the inulin group, and there were no data on CSBMs per week, diarrhea, serious adverse effects, quality of life, or stool form. The guideline states we are very uncertain about the effects of inulin, with certainty of evidence very low for SBMs and low for responder rate.

Secretagogues — lubiprostone for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) who do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) agents — the panel suggests the use of lubiprostone over management without lubiprostone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). It can be used as a replacement or as an adjunct to OTC agents; duration of treatment in trials was 4 weeks, but the drug label does not provide a limit; nausea may occur and the risk of nausea is dose-dependent and seems to be lower when taken with food and water. Lubiprostone is approved by FDA for treating CIC at a dose of 24 μg 2 times daily; for IBS-C, the approved dose is 8 μg 2 times daily, and among individuals who respond, these effects generally manifest within 2 days. In randomized trials, lubiprostone increased spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week versus placebo (MD 1.98; 95% CI 1.17–2.79) and may increase responder rates (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.36–2.06), 226 more per 1,000 (from 122 to 358 more), with little to no difference in serious adverse events though increased risk could not be ruled out (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.42). Nausea was observed in 35% and led to discontinuation in only 5% of individuals; systemic absorption is negligible, and individuals with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency should receive a lower dose (i.e., 8 μg twice daily).

### Clinical practice guidelines from the French national society of coloproctology in treating chronic constipation [^116iUvDq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common symptom that regularly affects the quality of life of adult patients. Its treatment is mainly based on dietary rules, laxative drugs, perineal rehabilitation and surgical treatment. The French National Society of Coloproctology offers clinical practice recommendations on the basis of the data in the current literature, including those on recently developed treatments. Most are noninvasive, and the main concepts include the following: stimulant laxatives are now considered safe drugs and can be more easily prescribed as a second-line treatment; biofeedback therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of anorectal dyssynergia that is resistant to medical treatment; transanal irrigation is the second-line treatment of choice in patients with neurological diseases, but it may also be proposed for patients without neurological diseases; and although interferential therapy may be a new promising treatment, it needs further evaluation.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation — recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", with "we recommend" indicating strong and "we suggest" indicating conditional. For patients, under a strong recommendation "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while under a conditional recommendation "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with his or her values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations state "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate". Certainty of evidence definitions include "High" ("We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect".), "Moderate" ("We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), and "Low" ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".). For all recommendations, "the intervention is compared with 'not using the intervention' or the treatment is recommended or suggested 'over no drug treatment'. The comparator is not explicitly included in the recommendation statement to avoid redundancy".

### Real-world treatment strategies to improve outcomes in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^113gHohV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation are complex, overlapping conditions. Although multiple guidelines have informed healthcare providers on appropriate treatment options for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, little direction is offered on treatment selection. First-line treatment options usually include fiber and over-the-counter osmotic laxatives; however, these are insufficient for many individuals. When these options fail, prescription secretagogues (plecanatide, linaclotide, lubiprostone, and tenapanor [pending commercial availability]), or serotonergic agents (prucalopride and tegaserod) are generally preferred. Individuals experiencing concurrent abdominal pain and/or bloating may experience greater overall improvements from prescription therapies because these agents have been proven to reduce concurrent abdominal and bowel symptoms. Should initial prescription treatments fail, retrying past treatment options (if not adequately trialed initially), combining agents from alternative classes, or use of adjunctive therapies may be considered. Given the broad spectrum of available agents, therapy should be tailored by mutual decision-making between the patient and practitioner. Overall, patients need to be actively monitored and managed to maximize clinical outcomes.

Table 4 (continued) — medications to treat chronic idiopathic constipation lists lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride with mechanisms of action, guidance for dose titration, and additional comments. Lubiprostone is described as an intestinal secretagogue acting on chloride channel type 2 in the gut that increases chloride secretion; dose titration is per symptom response and diarrhea may occur in a subset of patients, leading to discontinuation; comments state it may have benefit for abdominal pain and is also approved for the treatment of IBS-C at a dose of 8 µg BID. Linaclotide is an intestinal secretagogue acting on guanylate cyclase-C, which activates CFTR in the gut to increase chloride secretion; dose titration is per symptom response and diarrhea may occur in a subset of patients, leading to discontinuation; comments note it may have benefit for abdominal pain and is also approved for the treatment of IBS-C. Plecanatide is an intestinal secretagogue acting on guanylate cyclase-C, which activates CFTR in the gut to increase chloride secretion; dose titration is per symptom response and diarrhea may occur in a subset of patients, leading to discontinuation; it is also approved for the treatment of IBS-C. For prucalopride, dose titration is per symptom response and headaches and diarrhea may occur in a subset of patients, leading to discontinuation; comments note it may have additional benefit for abdominal pain. Abbreviation footnotes define BID as twice a day and IBS-C as irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, and USD as US dollar.

### Chronic constipation: new insights, better outcomes? [^117Coowf]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Constipation is a symptom that affects around 11–20% of the adult population yearly. Most physicians consider infrequency of defecation as a hallmark of constipation. However, most patients view excessive straining as the biggest component of constipation and only a minority of patients with constipation have infrequent bowel movements. Constipation might be due to many different medical conditions or occur as a side-effect of drug therapy. When these medical conditions or drug therapies are not present, a diagnosis of functional constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is often made. In all patients with constipation, rectal outlet dysfunction should be excluded by physical examination because this condition occurs in approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic constipation and can be improved with different therapeutic approaches than administration of laxatives. Because of the availability of over-the-counter laxatives, most patients consider themselves able to self-manage constipation, and patients have often tried many different treatments before seeking professional help. The physician must carefully assess these previous efforts of self-treatment, optimise them, and strategically use the increasing list of prescription medications for management.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — plecanatide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) — The AGA suggests using plecanatide in patients with IBS-C (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Plecanatide is FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS-C and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) at a dosage of 3 mg once daily. In 2 large phase 3 trials over 12 weeks, 814 patients received plecanatide 3 mg and 818 received placebo; plecanatide achieved greater response by the FDA IBS-C end point (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92), with 27.4% vs 16.9% meeting the FDA end point. Individual outcomes showed improvement in abdominal pain (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.92; risk difference 10.1%) and CSBM (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91; risk difference 10.9%). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event, reported in 4.3% with plecanatide vs 1% with placebo, leading to discontinuation in 1.2% vs 0%; SAEs occurred in 0.8%, there were no diarrhea-related SAEs, and 1 death (drowning) was deemed unrelated to the study drug.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) — randomized trial regimens and key efficacy findings include the following: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials studied the effect of PEG on constipation. In two trials, the treatment consisted of 15 g of PEG with electrolytes dissolved in 250 mL of water twice daily; one had a 28-week treatment period and another used an initial 4-week PEG phase with responders randomized to PEG or placebo for 20 weeks. In a United States trial, participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to PEG 3350 or placebo at a dose of 17 g mixed in 8 ounces of liquid once daily for 6 months. PEG likely results in an increase in complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week compared with placebo (MD 2.90, CI 2.12–3.68).

Chronic constipation is a highly prevalent disorder that affects approximately 15% of the US population. Chronic constipation refers to patients who have had symptoms for more than 6 months. In clinical practice, chronic constipation is often used interchangeably with the term functional constipation. This is best defined using the Rome III criteria, which involves an evaluation of stool frequency in addition to symptoms of straining, feelings of incomplete evacuation, and the need to use manual maneuvers to assist with stool evacuation. Symptoms can be burdensome, leading to a reduction in patients' quality of life. As a national healthcare issue, chronic constipation is also important because it imposes a significant economic impact on the healthcare system. A number of treatment options are currently available, both over-the-counter and by prescription, although not all patients respond to these therapies. This review will focus on new medical treatment options for the management of chronic constipation, and the safety and efficacy of these agents will be reviewed. In addition, the efficacy of new diagnostic tests to evaluate colonic motility and anorectal function are described.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria and trial applicability — The Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by removing abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months; fewer individuals meet Rome IV than Rome III, and for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that measure abdominal pain, Rome IV is more applicable, though it is not known whether these diagnostic changes alter efficacy and safety outcomes in RCTs.
