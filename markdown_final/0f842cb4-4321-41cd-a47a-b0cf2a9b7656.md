## Question

description of TIA and cerebrovascular disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a description of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cerebrovascular disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern definition of TIA and why the tissue-based concept matters. Then, I should review core pathophysiology and etiologic categories. Next, I will quantify short- and long-term risks to set urgency. After that, I need to stratify risk clinically and with imaging. I will then outline urgent diagnostic evaluation, immediate antithrombotic treatment, etiology-specific interventions, and long-term prevention. Finally, I should determine disposition and systems-of-care implications, verifying each step against contemporary guidelines and data.

> Let me first confirm the definition, because everything else depends on it. Historically, TIA was time based (< 24 hours), but the modern, guideline-endorsed definition is tissue based: a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction, which mandates imaging to exclude infarction and hemorrhage and to refine risk stratification [^114aofZS] [^114nYsAo] [^115B5gm8].

> Hold on, I should verify the core clinical features to avoid overcalling mimics. TIA is focal and sudden, most symptoms cluster under minutes to an hour even though they can extend toward 24 hours, and the absence of infarction distinguishes it from ischemic stroke on diffusion-weighted MRI, which can reclassify a subset as minor stroke if lesions are present [^115B5gm8] [^114aofZS] [^114aofZS].

> Next, I will examine pathophysiology, because it ties TIA directly to the ischemic stroke spectrum. The mechanism is transient regional hypoperfusion due to thromboembolism or hemodynamic insufficiency, creating reversible dysfunction without cell death; common etiologies include large-artery atherosclerosis and stenosis, cardioembolism such as atrial fibrillation, cervical artery dissection, hypercoagulable states, and inflammatory vasculopathies, all of which share risk and management pathways with ischemic stroke [^115B5gm8].

> I need to quantify burden and near-term risk to justify the urgency of evaluation. Incidence is roughly 0.7–1.19 per 1,000 person-years in US populations, with hundreds of thousands of TIAs annually, and short-term stroke risk is about 10% at 90 days with nearly half of those events in the first 48 hours, which is why we treat TIA as a medical emergency [^115B5gm8] [^111TyoZU] [^111P9Yi8] [^115sLeqf]. Wait, I initially noted an "annual stroke risk of 12–20% in the immediate period after TIA", but that conflates time frames; the better-supported figures are approximately 5% in 48 hours and about 10% by 90 days, with contemporary data suggesting declining risk over decades due to improved prevention, which I should emphasize to avoid misinterpretation [^111P9Yi8] [^115hKd4S] [^115sLeqf].

> Now, I should review risk stratification to decide who needs inpatient care and intensified therapy. Let me consider nonmodifiable factors like age and sex, and modifiable ones such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and atrial fibrillation that must be targeted in secondary prevention; clinically, the ABCD2 score remains useful, where ESO defines high-risk TIA often at ABCD2 ≥ 4, while AHA/ASA suggests hospitalization when ABCD2 ≥ 3 if within 72 hours or when rapid evaluation cannot be arranged, and I need to integrate these with vascular and DWI imaging to refine early risk estimates [^115WBjtt] [^114aofZS].

> Let me verify imaging-based risk stratification because it changes disposition and therapy. DWI positivity in a patient with transient symptoms indicates acute ischemia and a higher early stroke risk compared with DWI-negative events, and vascular imaging to detect cervical and intracranial stenosis or dissection further stratifies risk and identifies candidates for revascularization or specific antithrombotic strategies [^113NMX33] [^115XRLEv] [^115bPb2x].

> Next, I should confirm the timing and scope of urgent diagnostic evaluation so we do not miss the high-risk window. AHA/ASA recommends brain imaging within 24 hours (preferably MRI with DWI) and completion or initiation of the full evaluation within 48 hours, with ECG promptly to detect atrial fibrillation and other cardiac issues; labs and risk factor assessment support etiologic classification and immediate prevention decisions [^114aofZS] [^112mWyw6] [^112fvjaf] [^114nYsAo].

> I will now examine immediate antithrombotic strategies, and I need to be careful to separate non-cardioembolic from cardioembolic mechanisms. For high-risk non-cardioembolic TIA (for example ABCD2 ≥ 4 or imaging-defined high risk), early short-course dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel initiated within 12–24 hours and continued for about 21–90 days reduces early recurrence versus monotherapy, after which single antiplatelet therapy is used; in contrast, for low-risk or uncertain TIA, monotherapy is favored to avoid bleeding risk [^1116LUyu] [^115xswAf] [^117GAp5Z] [^116TSrCH].

> But wait, what if the mechanism is cardioembolic? Then I should confirm that anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy is indicated, with DOACs or warfarin chosen according to patient factors and guideline specifics for atrial fibrillation and selected congenital heart disease scenarios, initiating once hemorrhage is excluded and considering timing by infarct size if an infarct is present on imaging [^notfound].

> Let me think about large-artery disease where revascularization changes outcomes. In patients with ipsilateral symptomatic carotid stenosis 70–99% after TIA, carotid endarterectomy performed within about 2 weeks by experienced operators reduces recurrent stroke risk and is generally preferred over stenting in older patients, whereas revascularization is not recommended when stenosis is < 50% [^115U1cxe] [^11192qGw] [^117EztCg] [^116Xmgpn].

> I should double-check recommendations for intracranial atherosclerotic disease, where medical therapy is nuanced. For recent high-risk TIA with ipsilateral intracranial stenosis > 30%, short-term ticagrelor plus aspirin may be considered, and cilostazol 200 mg/day added to aspirin or clopidogrel can be considered in 50–99% intracranial stenosis, whereas evidence for cilostazol in pure lacunar small-vessel disease is insufficient, so I should tailor therapy carefully to the vascular pathology [^117B1Avd] [^113T7Tbj] [^111id932] [^114187DU].

> Hold on, I should verify management of cervical artery dissection given its frequency in younger patients with TIA. Antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or warfarin for at least 3 months is reasonable after extracranial carotid or vertebral dissection, and if recurrent ischemic events occur despite antithrombotics, endovascular therapy can be considered in selected cases [^112V5KXC] [^113zY9ef] [^114gzeWP].

> Next, I need to ensure comprehensive secondary prevention is initiated immediately because it modifies near- and long-term risk. High-intensity statins are recommended with an LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL and consideration of ezetimibe or icosapent ethyl in appropriate triglyceride ranges; blood pressure should generally be reduced to < 130/80 mmHg with thiazides, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as first-line options; lifestyle changes including smoking cessation counseling are essential and should be embedded in care pathways [^112JR2iR] [^116ZBNQj] [^1164rirV] [^111LyqrD] [^112m6LHD].

> Finally, I should review disposition and systems of care, and I need to balance safety with resource realities. Many patients with suspected high-risk TIA warrant admission or rapid pathway evaluation; AHA/ASA supports hospitalization if within 72 hours with ABCD2 ≥ 3 or when rapid outpatient evaluation is not feasible, ESO recommends specialist review within 24 hours and TIA clinic models where available, and decision support tools can improve triage, speed imaging and etiologic workup, and prompt early therapies, all of which align with the ED-focused 2023 AHA statement emphasizing protocols for timely imaging of brain and vessels and safe disposition [^114aofZS] [^1145UrE4] [^115WBjtt] [^1114bm7C] [^115sLeqf].

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a **transient episode of focal neurological dysfunction** caused by brief cerebral, spinal, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction [^114aofZS], typically resolving within minutes to hours [^115B5gm8]. TIAs are a **harbinger of stroke** [^111P9Yi8], with a 90-day stroke risk of 10–15% [^115hKd4S] and about half occurring within 48 hours. Urgent evaluation with **MRI/DWI, vascular imaging, and ECG** [^113NMX33] [^115XRLEv] [^112fvjaf] is essential to identify etiology and guide prevention [^114aofZS]. Management includes early antiplatelet therapy [^1116LUyu] [^117GAp5Z], risk factor control [^1164rirV] [^112JR2iR], and revascularization when indicated [^115U1cxe] [^117EztCg] to reduce recurrent stroke risk [^115sLeqf].

## Definition and clinical features

- **Definition**: TIA is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia [^114aofZS], without acute infarction [^112ycXH3].

- **Clinical features**: Sudden onset of focal neurological deficits, such as unilateral weakness, speech disturbance [^1149DucM], monocular vision loss, or sensory deficits, typically resolving within minutes to hours [^114ogxyB].

- **Duration**: Symptoms usually last less than 1 hour [^115B5gm8], but by definition resolve within 24 hours.

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiologically, TIAs result from a temporary interruption of blood flow — often due to emboli or thrombi — leading to transient **ischemia** [^115B5gm8] without permanent tissue damage [^114aofZS]. Common causes include **large-artery atherosclerosis**, **carotid or vertebral artery stenosis**, **cardioembolic sources** (e.g. atrial fibrillation), and **small-vessel disease** [^113Jq1mg] [^114aofZS].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors include **non-modifiable** factors — advanced age, male sex, and family history of cerebrovascular disease [^115fWXQH] — and **modifiable** factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and atrial fibrillation [^1147LtoR] [^114aofZS].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) [^113NMX33] is preferred to detect acute ischemic lesions; CT is used when MRI is unavailable [^114nYsAo] [^114aofZS].

- **Vascular imaging**: Carotid ultrasound, CT angiography (CTA), or MR angiography (MRA) [^115XRLEv] to identify stenosis or occlusion [^115WBjtt] [^114aofZS].

- **Cardiac evaluation**: ECG and echocardiography [^114aofZS] to detect atrial fibrillation or other cardiac sources of emboli [^112fvjaf].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, glucose, lipid profile, and coagulation studies to identify risk factors and guide management [^112mWyw6] [^114aofZS].

---

## Management and prevention

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin or clopidogrel for non-cardioembolic TIA [^114aofZS]; dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) [^1116LUyu] for high-risk patients [^117GAp5Z].

- **Anticoagulation**: Warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for cardioembolic TIA due to atrial fibrillation [^114aofZS] [^115sLeqf].

- **Risk factor control**: Aggressive management [^114aofZS] of hypertension [^1164rirV], diabetes, hyperlipidemia [^112JR2iR], and smoking cessation [^112m6LHD].

- **Carotid endarterectomy**: Recommended [^115U1cxe] for patients with severe (70–99%) carotid stenosis and recent TIA [^11192qGw].

---

## Prognosis

Short-term risk is approximately **10–15% for stroke within 90 days**, with about **half occurring within 48 hours** [^115hKd4S] [^114aofZS]. Long-term risk includes increased risk of **recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death** [^115EXWg1] [^115K6WTL] [^114aofZS].

---

## Cerebrovascular disease

**Cerebrovascular disease** comprises a spectrum of disorders of the cerebral blood vessels, including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and TIA [^113fn7xV]. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with significant socioeconomic impact [^117TnQkg].

---

## Conclusion

TIA is a transient neurological event caused by brief ischemia without infarction [^114aofZS] and serves as a **warning sign for future stroke**. Prompt diagnosis, risk stratification, and aggressive risk-factor management are essential to prevent recurrent cerebrovascular events [^115sLeqf].

### Transient ischemic attack: Definition and natural history [^115B5gm8]. Current Atherosclerosis Reports (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on transient ischemic attack:

- **Definition**: A TIA is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour, but can persist for up to 24 hours, and without evidence of acute infarction.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of TIA involves a temporary disruption in blood flow to a specific area of the brain, often due to emboli or thrombi. This leads to ischemia in the affected area, causing transient neurological symptoms. Common conditions causing a TIA include cerebrovascular disorders such as large artery atherosclerosis, carotid or vertebral artery stenosis, and cervical artery dissection; cardiovascular disorders such as AF, valvular heart disease, and infective endocarditis; hypercoagulable conditions such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cancer, hyperhomocysteinemia, and sickle cell disease; and inflammatory vascular conditions such as FMD, giant cell arteritis, and primary angiitis of the CNS.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TIA in the US is estimated at 0.7–1.19 per 1,000 person-years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for TIA include advanced age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking, high sodium intake, high stress, cardiovascular diseases, and a family history of cerebrovascular accidents.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of a TIA is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms can include motor weakness, dysphasia, and altered consciousness.

### Transient ischemic attack overview: Defining the challenges for improving outcomes [^111P9Yi8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are reversible neurologic events that herald potentially catastrophic strokes. Well-designed studies have documented that approximately 10% of patients who have a transient ischemic attack will have a stroke within the succeeding 90 days; half of these strokes occur within 48 hours of the transient ischemic attack. Improved outcomes from transient ischemic attacks require a heightened awareness of the clinical features of transient ischemic attacks on the part of both patients and physicians. The significant potential for stroke in the immediate days after the transient ischemic attack imposes an urgency in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. A review of the literature suggests that there is a need for pathways to promote facilitated evaluations of transient ischemic attack patients in order to identify underlying correctable pathologies, and to direct medical and surgical management strategies.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with carotid artery stenosis (carotid endarterectomy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend performing carotid endarterectomy to reduce the risk of future stroke in patients with a TIA within the past 6 months and ipsilateral severe (70–99%) carotid artery stenosis, provided the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is less than 6%.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^112JR2iR]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, specifically in the context of managing dyslipidemia, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating lipid-lowering therapy with a statin. Ezetimibe may be added if needed to achieve the target goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. This approach helps reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with a TIA and atherosclerotic disease, including conditions affecting intracranial, carotid, aortic, or coronary arteries.

### Definition and evaluation of transient ischemic attack: A scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council; Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia; Council on Cardiovascular Radiology and Intervention; Council on Cardiovascular Nursing; and the Interdisciplinary Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease. The American Academy of Neurology affirms the value of this statement as an educational tool for neurologists [^114aofZS]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

This scientific statement is intended for use by physicians and allied health personnel caring for patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). The formal evidence review included a structured literature search of Medline from 1990 to June 2007, with data synthesis utilizing evidence tables, meta-analyses, and pooled analysis of individual patient-level data. The review supported endorsement of the following tissue-based definition of TIA: a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.

Patients with TIAs are at high risk of early stroke, and their risk may be stratified by clinical scale, vessel imaging, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Diagnostic recommendations include:

- **Neuroimaging evaluation**: TIA patients should undergo neuroimaging evaluation within 24 hours of symptom onset, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion sequences.
- **Noninvasive imaging**: Noninvasive imaging of the cervical vessels should be performed, and noninvasive imaging of intracranial vessels is reasonable.
- **Electrocardiography**: Electrocardiography should occur as soon as possible after TIA. Prolonged cardiac monitoring and echocardiography are reasonable in patients in whom the vascular etiology is not yet identified.
- **Routine blood tests**: Routine blood tests are reasonable.
- **Hospitalization**: It is reasonable to hospitalize patients with TIA if they present within 72 hours and have an ABCD(2) score ≥ 3, indicating a high risk of early recurrence, or if the evaluation cannot be rapidly completed on an outpatient basis.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, specifically in relation to antithrombotic therapy for non-cardioembolic TIA, the ESO 2021 guidelines recommend initiating short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over monotherapy. This should be subsequently followed by monotherapy in patients with an acute non-cardioembolic high-risk TIA (ABCD² score of ≥ 4).

### Trends in transient ischemic attack hospitalizations in the United States [^117TnQkg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States; however, recent studies have shown promising declines in prevalence and mortality. Although several studies have assessed recent temporal trends in hospitalizations for ischemic stroke, no study has assessed trends for transient ischemic attack (TIA). Several factors may influence temporal trends in TIA hospitalizations, including true changes in incidence, changes in the definition for TIA, alterations in management (inpatient vs. outpatient), and improvements in stroke detection (where events previously classified as TIA are classified as strokes). The aims of this study were to assess trends in race/ethnic, age, and sex‐specific rates of hospitalization for TIA between 2000 and 2010.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111VCY4Q]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with a carotid web, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating antiplatelet therapy. This therapy aims to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with a carotid web, especially when the ischemic stroke and TIA occur in the same distribution without other attributable causes of stroke.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Ln7rZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

- **Evolution of annual risks**: The annual risks of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac death in patients over time are illustrated in Figure 1. The plot size is inversely proportional to the within-study variance. IS indicates ischemic stroke; TIA, transient ischemic attack. Figure 2 shows the evolution of these risks concerning the duration of study follow-up, with similar plot sizing.

- **Risk analysis**: There was no significant difference in the risk of MI among study designs (P int = 0.48), types of ischemic event (P int = 0.42), and incident versus combined or unspecified IS/TIA (P int = 0.62). Although few studies reported the risk of MI by stroke etiology, the risk appeared consistent across large-artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel disease, and cardioembolism (P int = 0.91). The annual risk of MI did not vary based on whether an explicit definition of MI was provided (P int = 0.54).

- **Sensitivity analyses**: Analyses restricted to studies with a recruitment delay of less than one month from stroke onset (2.10%, 95% CI 1.30–2.90, 11 studies, 3015 patients, P het < 0.001) and those with complete follow-up ≥ 90% (1.78%, 95% CI 1.39–2.17, 41 studies, 111,729 patients, P het < 0.001) indicated a similar MI risk to the overall risk.

### A 5-decade analysis of incidence trends of ischemic stroke after transient ischemic attack: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hKd4S]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The management of transient ischemic attack (TIA) has gained significant attention during the past 25 years after several landmark studies indicated the high incidence of a subsequent stroke. The objective of this study was to calculate the pooled event rate of subsequent ischemic stroke within 2, 7, 30, and 90 days of a TIA and compare this incidence among the population with TIA recruited before 1999 (group A), from 1999 to 2007 (group B), and after 2007 (group C).

All published studies of TIA outcomes were obtained by searching PubMed from 1996 to the last update on January 31, 2020, irrespective of the study design, document type, or language. Of the 11,516 identified citations, 175 articles were relevant to this review. Both the classic time-based definition of TIA and the new tissue-based definition were accepted. Studies with a combined record of patients with TIA and ischemic stroke, without clinical evaluation for the index TIA, with diagnosis of the index TIA event after ischemic stroke occurrence, with low suspicion for TIA, or duplicate reports of the same database were excluded.

The study was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA, MOOSE, and EQUATOR guidelines. Critical appraisal and methodological quality assessment utilized the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Publication bias was visualized using funnel plots and measured by the Begg-Mazumdar rank correlation Kendall τ2 statistic and Egger bias test. Data were pooled using double arcsine transformations, DerSimonian-Laird estimator, and random-effects models.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on management of transient ischaemic attack [^115WBjtt]. European Stroke Journal (2021). High credibility.

The aim of the present European Stroke Organisation Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) management guideline document is to provide clinically useful evidence-based recommendations on approaches to triage, investigation, and secondary prevention, particularly in the acute phase following TIA. The guidelines were prepared according to the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and in line with GRADE methodology.

As a basic principle, we defined TIA clinically and pragmatically for generalisability as transient neurological symptoms likely due to focal cerebral or ocular ischaemia, lasting less than 24 hours. High-risk TIA was defined based on clinical features observed early after their event or having other features suggesting a high early risk of stroke, such as an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, weakness or speech disturbance lasting more than five minutes, recurrent events, or significant ipsilateral large artery disease, such as carotid stenosis or intracranial stenosis.

We strongly recommend using dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin short-term in high-risk non-cardioembolic TIA patients with an ABCD2 score of 4 or greater, as defined in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Further, we recommend a specialist review within 24 hours after the onset of TIA symptoms. We suggest that review occurs in a specialist TIA clinic rather than standard outpatient departments if managed in an outpatient setting. We make a recommendation to use either MRA or CTA in TIA patients for additional confirmation of large artery stenosis.

### Transient ischemic attack: Reviewing the evolution of the definition, diagnosis, risk stratification, and management for the emergency physician [^114xbrE5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of reversible neurologic deficit caused by temporary focal central nervous system hypoperfusion. TIA is a medical emergency. Because patients with TIA in the emergency department (ED) have a high risk for stroke within the next 48 hours, it is imperative for the clinician to recognize this golden opportunity to prevent a disabling stroke. This article reviews our conceptual understanding of TIA, its definition, diagnosis, ways to stratify stroke risk, the acute management and disposition in the ED, and the potential future role of diagnostic biomarkers.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^11111Gez]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) can be difficult. There is consensus on classic symptoms (e.g. motor weakness, dysphasia, hemianopia, monocular visual loss), but no consensus on several monosymptomatic events with sudden-onset, non-progressive, focal negative symptoms (e.g. isolated diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, ataxia, sensory loss, and bilateral visual disturbance), with much variation in investigation and treatment.

- **Methods**: We prospectively ascertained and investigated all strokes and sudden-onset transient neurological symptoms in a population of 92,728 people (no age restrictions) from Oxfordshire, UK. These individuals sought medical attention at nine primary care practices or at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK (Oxford Vascular Study). Patients classified at baseline with minor ischaemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score < 5), classic TIA, or non-consensus TIA were treated according to secondary prevention guidelines. Risks of stroke (7-day, 90-day, and 10-year risks) and risks of all major vascular events (from the time of first event and from the time of seeking medical attention) were established by face-to-face follow-up visits and were compared with the risk expected from age and sex-specific stroke incidence in the underlying study population.

- **Findings**: Between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2018, 2878 patients were identified with minor ischaemic stroke (n = 1287), classic TIA (n = 1021), or non-consensus TIA (n = 570). Follow-up was to October 1, 2018 (median 5.2 [IQR 2.6–9.2] years).

### National stroke association recommendations for systems of care for transient ischemic attack [^111RgWMu]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are common and indicate a high short-term risk of stroke. Evidence-based recommendations for the urgent evaluation and treatment of patients with TIA have been published. However, implementing these recommendations reliably and consistently will require changes in the systems of care established for TIA. The National Stroke Association convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop recommendations for the essential components of systems of care at hospitals to improve the quality of care provided to patients with TIA. The panel recommends that hospitals establish standardized protocols to ensure rapid and complete evaluation and treatment for patients with TIA, with particular attention to urgency and close observation in patients at high risk of stroke.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^11487ruB]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Up to 25% of strokes are preceded by a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The early risk of stroke following a TIA is high, and urgent investigation and treatment are required. In particular, treatment with antiplatelets is needed because these drugs substantially reduce the risk of early recurrent stroke. Diagnosis of TIA usually relies on the patient's description of symptoms and on the ability of clinicians to interpret them correctly. However, the high-level definition of TIA as a sudden, focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular origin lasting less than 24 hours provides no guidance on which symptoms are likely to be vascular in origin.

Agreement between clinicians regarding diagnosis of TIA is only moderate. Diagnostic criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) were developed by expert consensus to aid clinical practice and recruitment into research. Specifically, these criteria disqualify several sudden onset and focal monosymptomatic events deemed not to be TIAs, including isolated diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, ataxia, sensory loss, and bilateral visual impairment. The argument is that these isolated symptoms often have a non-vascular cause, but interobserver agreement in diagnosis between clinicians is poor.

### Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome: Diagnostic criteria [^116Vz7Ad]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Existing diagnostic classification systems for cerebrovascular disease are primarily based on clinical impressions of temporal features, clinical syndrome, inferred localization, or ischemic mechanism. The diagnostic certainty of ischemic pathology, based on supportive or refuting laboratory or radiological evidence, has been of secondary importance.

Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (AICS) describes a spectrum of clinical presentations that share a similar underlying pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Diagnostic criteria for AICS incorporate prior classification systems and currently available information provided by neuroimaging and laboratory data to define four categories, ranging from "definite AICS" to "not AICS", which specify the degree of diagnostic certainty.

Clinical trials testing new treatments for acute ischemic stroke or secondary stroke prevention should limit enrollment to patients with "definite" AICS whenever feasible.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172TdKM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Twenty-three (40%) studies provided an explicit definition of myocardial infarction (MI), which was based on clinical parameters, biological markers, ECG changes, or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). An explicit definition of recurrent stroke (reStroke) was given in 15 (38%) studies: a neurologic deficit lasting ≥ 24 hours was the definition used in most of the studies, and only one required a period of neurological stability between the index stroke and reStroke. The study shows the pooled risks of MI, reStroke, and cardiac and vascular deaths, overall and in the prespecified subgroups, with differences among subgroups assessed by meta-regressions.

### Risk of subsequent disabling or fatal stroke in patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke: An international, prospective cohort study [^115EXWg1]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Patients who have had a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events for the following five years. Our aim was to assess 5-year functional outcomes in these patients and to determine the factors associated with long-term disability.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from TIAregistry.org, an international, prospective, observational registry of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke from 61 specialized centers in 21 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, who had a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke within the previous seven days between May 30, 2009, and December 30, 2011, with a baseline modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 0–1, and who were followed up for five years, were eligible for inclusion in this study. We evaluated whether existing comorbidities and stroke recurrence, categorized as disabling (mRS score of > 1, including death) or non-disabling (mRS score of 0–1), at five years after baseline, were associated with poor functional outcome (defined as an mRS score of > 1). Multivariable generalized equation models were used for factors associated with poor functional outcome at five years, and multivariable cause-specific Cox hazard regression models were applied in case of stroke recurrence.

- **Findings**: Between May 30, 2009, and December 30, 2011, 3847 eligible patients were included in the study. Of these, 3105 (80.7%) had an mRS evaluation at five years of follow-up. The median follow-up duration was 5.00 years (IQR 4.78–5.00). Notably, 710 (22.9%) of 3105 patients had an…

### Brain enlarged perivascular spaces as imaging biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease: A clinical narrative review [^1178cGFb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack and acute stroke

- **Transient ischemic attack**: Enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVSs) in relation to transient ischemic attack (TIA) have not been extensively studied. One prospective study compared EPVSs in patients with either transient or persistent neurological deficits attributable to ischemic stroke and found no differences in the total small‐vessel disease (SVD) scores on imaging, which included EPVS scores as one of its components. Hypothetically, perivascular spaces (PVSs) may play a role in preventing the progression of TIA to ischemic stroke through effective clearance of inflammatory markers and timely interstitial fluid drainage. In this context, it remains to be tested whether a heavier load of EPVSs could increase the risk of stroke in the short-term following a TIA.

### Underlying causes of TIA and minor ischemic stroke and risk of major vascular events [^113Jq1mg]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The coexistence of underlying causes in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke, as well as their associated 5-year risks, are not well known. The objective of this study was to apply the ASCOD (atherosclerosis, small vessel disease, cardiac pathology, other cause, or dissection) grading system to assess the coexistence of underlying causes of TIA and minor ischemic stroke and the 5-year risk for major vascular events.

This international registry cohort (TIAregistry.org) study enrolled 4789 patients from June 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, with 1- to 5-year follow-up at 61 sites in 21 countries. Eligible patients had a TIA or minor stroke (with modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1) within the last 7 days. Among these, 3847 patients completed the 5-year follow-up by December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2022, to June 15, 2023.

The exposure was a five-year follow-up. The main outcomes and measures were the estimated 5-year risk of the composite outcome of stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or cardiovascular death.

Results showed a total of 3847 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [13.2] years; 2295 men [59.7%]) in 42 sites were enrolled and participated in the 5-year follow-up cohort (median percentage of 5-year follow-up per center was 92.3% [IQR, 83.4%-97.8%]). In 998 patients with probable or possible causal atherosclerotic disease, 489 (49.0%) had some form of small vessel disease (SVD). This includes 110 (11.0%) who likely had a lacunar stroke as a probable or possible cause, and 504 (50.5%) had no SVD; 275 (27.6%) had some cardiac finding.

### Epidemiology of transient ischemic attacks using time- or tissue-based definitions: A population-based study [^1138H2Xx]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) epidemiology may have changed in recent years as a consequence of improved identification and treatment of vascular risk factors. Our aim was to provide updated information about TIA epidemiology in Italy.

Cases of first-ever TIA were ascertained from January 1, 2011, until December 31, 2012, in a population-based prospective registry. All residents in the L'Aquila district with an incident TIA were included and followed up to 2 years after the event. Outcome events were reTIA, nonfatal and fatal stroke, nonfatal and fatal myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality.

A total of 210 patients with a TIA according to the traditional time-based definition were included (51.4% women); 151 patients (71.9%) with transient symptoms and negative brain neuroimaging were broadly considered as tissue-based TIA, 29 patients (13.8%) had transient symptoms and evidence of a congruous acute ischemic lesion, and 30 patients (14.3%) had an acute neurovascular syndrome. The crude annual incidence rate for traditional time-based TIA was 35.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 30.6–40.3) and 28.6 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval, 24.1–33.5) when standardized to the 2011 European population. The incidence peaked in subjects aged ≥ 85 years, in both sexes. At 2 years, outcome events occurred in 50 patients (23.8%) including 15 patients (7.1%) with nonfatal or fatal strokes.

Our population-based study found a low annual TIA incidence rate and a fair TIA prognosis confirming the effectiveness.

### Differentiating ischemic stroke subtypes: Risk factors and secondary prevention [^1147LtoR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Ischemic strokes account for 87% of all strokes in the US. Patients who suffer an initial ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at risk for recurrent strokes, as well as ischemic events in the coronary and peripheral vasculatures. Lifestyle modifications, alongside pharmacological and surgical interventions, are effective in reducing the risk of recurrent events in all stroke patients. Evidence-based guidelines for secondary stroke prevention are available. However, increasing evidence indicates that risk factors may be differentially associated with specific ischemic stroke subtypes. In the future, exploiting these differential associations may facilitate secondary stroke prevention and, therefore, improve patient outcomes.

### Transient ischemic attack: Part I. Diagnosis and evaluation [^114ogxyB]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

A transient ischemic attack is defined as transient neurologic symptoms without evidence of acute infarction. It is a common and important risk factor for future stroke but is greatly underreported. Common symptoms are sudden and transient and include unilateral paresis, speech disturbance, and monocular blindness. Correct and early diagnosis of transient ischemic attack versus mimicking conditions is important because early interventions can significantly reduce the risk of future stroke. Nonspecific symptoms and gradual onset are more likely with mimics than with true transient ischemic attacks. Transient ischemic attacks are more likely with sudden onset, focal neurologic deficit, or speech disturbance.

Urgent evaluation is necessary in patients with symptoms of transient ischemic attack and includes neuroimaging, cervicocephalic vasculature imaging, cardiac evaluation, blood pressure assessment, and routine laboratory testing. The ABCD(2) (age, blood pressure, clinical presentation, diabetes mellitus, duration of symptoms) score should be determined during the initial evaluation and can help assess the immediate risk of repeat ischemia and stroke. Patients with higher ABCD(2) scores should be treated as inpatients, whereas those with lower scores are at lower risk of future stroke and can be treated as outpatients.

### Incidence, outcome, risk factors, and long-term prognosis of cryptogenic transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: a population-based study [^116QcD52]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with cryptogenic events had a significantly lower risk of acute coronary events than those with large artery disease events (adjusted HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24–0.66; p = 0.0003) and a similar risk to those with non-large artery disease events (adjusted HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49–1.18; p = 0.22). Patients with cryptogenic events also had a low risk of presumed cardioembolic events (26 events, 10-year risk 6.4%, 95% CI 3.6–9.1), similar to that in patients with large artery disease and small vessel disease events combined (adjusted HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.62–2.17; p = 0.64).

No patients with cryptogenic events presented with any re-cardioembolic event within 90 days of the index event. Among all 85 re-strokes of cryptogenic or unknown cause after an index cryptogenic event, 82 were of a single vascular territory and three presented with acute infarcts in several vascular territories. Five peripheral vascular events with presumed embolic cause occurred with no proven embolic source after cryptogenic events versus two after small vessel disease and one after large artery disease events.

### Transient ischemic attack (TIA): The initial diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma [^113UECXk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Many patients experiencing transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are at high risk of stroke within the first few days of symptom onset. Emergency physicians and primary care physicians must quickly assess these patients and initiate appropriate secondary stroke prevention strategies. Recent advancements in diagnostic imaging have provided valuable insights into the risk stratification of patients with TIA. Clinical data regarding the urgent initiation of antiplatelet therapy specifically in this patient population with non-cardioembolic TIA are limited but promising. This review outlines the diagnostic tools available for the rapid assessment of patients presenting with TIA symptoms and discusses clinical trials relevant to these vulnerable patients.

### Evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack: an important component of stroke prevention [^111xXH1u]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) share similar risk factors and methods of evaluation and secondary prevention. Despite the resolution of neurological symptoms following a TIA, there has been a widespread perception that urgent evaluation and treatment are unnecessary. However, it is increasingly evident that the short-term stroke risk following a TIA is very high. Recent studies have identified independent predictors that indicate which patients are at the highest risk of recurrent ischemic events. These risk scores could enable physicians to target appropriate patients for urgent care. This review summarizes the recent literature on stroke risk after TIA and risk stratification, as well as recently published guidelines on evaluation and treatment.

### Long-term prognosis of patients with transient ischemic attack or stroke and symptomatic vascular disease in multiple arterial beds [^1124B8nM]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

As shown in Figure 1, the number of affected vascular beds increased with the number of atherosclerotic risk factors (P trend < 0.0001) with the highest prevalence in patients with triple-territory disease. Compared with patients with TIA/stroke only, those with double- or triple-territory disease had more hypertension (age/sex-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 2.76–4.27; P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 2.27–3.66; P < 0.0001), hypercholesterolemia (OR, 4.67; 95% CI, 3.85–5.66; P < 0.0001), and a history of smoking (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.26–1.84; P < 0.0001). The same was observed when comparing patients with triple-territory disease to those with TIA/stroke alone, and triple-territory disease was particularly strongly associated with known hypercholesterolemia (OR, 6.80; 95% CI, 4.39–10.53; P < 0.0001) with a baseline mean/SD total cholesterol of 4.5/1.2 mmol/L despite 62% being on statin treatment before the index TIA/stroke.

### Transient ischemic attacks: Advances in diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^113fn7xV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The definition of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has evolved over the past decade from a clinical diagnosis to a tissue-based definition based on neuroimaging results. TIA shares the same pathophysiology as stroke, which occurs in up to 5% of patients within 48 hours of the TIA and 10% within 90 days. This rate is decreasing, likely due to improved diagnostic and management strategies. Decision support scores have been developed to risk stratify patients, which include clinical and radiological elements. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, as well as carotid endarterectomy/stenting, have been shown to reduce the stroke occurrence after TIA.

### Rate and prognosis of brain ischemia in patients with lower-risk transient or persistent minor neurologic events [^114sFgMU]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Early treatment of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) reduces the risk of stroke. However, many patients present with symptoms that have an uncertain diagnosis. Patients with motor, speech, or prolonged symptoms are at the highest risk for stroke and the most likely to undergo comprehensive investigations. Lower-risk patients are much more likely to be cursorily investigated.

- **Objective**: To establish the frequency of acute infarct defined by diffusion restriction detected on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (DWI positive).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Diagnosis of Uncertain-Origin Benign Transient Neurological Symptoms (DOUBT) study was a prospective, observational, international, multicenter cohort study of 1028 patients with low-risk transient or minor symptoms referred to neurology within 8 days of symptom onset. Patients were enrolled between June 1, 2010, and October 31, 2016. Included patients were 40 years or older and had experienced nonmotor or nonspeech minor focal neurologic events of any duration or motor or speech symptoms of short duration (≤ 5 minutes), with no previous stroke.

- **Exposures**: Patients underwent a detailed neurologic assessment prior to undergoing a brain MRI within 8 days of symptom onset.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was restricted diffusion on a brain MRI scan (acute stroke).

- **Results**: A total of 1028 patients (522 women and 506 men; mean [SD] age, 63.0 [11.6] years) were enrolled. A total of 139 patients (13.5%) had an acute stroke as defined.

### Emergency medicine updates: Transient ischemic attack [^117NQ7tX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a condition commonly evaluated in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning TIA for the emergency clinician. TIA is a harbinger of ischemic stroke and can result from a variety of pathological causes. While prior definitions incorporated symptoms resolving within 24 hours, modern definitions recommend a tissue-based definition utilizing advanced imaging to evaluate for neurologic injury and its etiology.

In the ED, emergent evaluation includes assessing for signs and symptoms of neurologic dysfunction, appropriate imaging to investigate for minor stroke or stroke risk, and arranging appropriate disposition and follow-up to mitigate the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke. Imaging should include evaluation of great vessels and intracranial arteries, as well as advanced cerebral imaging to evaluate for minor or subclinical stroke.

- **Non-contrast computed tomography**: This has limited utility; it can rule out hemorrhage or a large mass causing symptoms but should not be relied on for any definitive diagnosis. Noninvasive imaging of the cervical vessels can also be used (CT angiography or Doppler ultrasound).

Treatment includes antithrombotic medications if there are no contraindications. Dual antiplatelet therapy may reduce the risk of re-ischemic events in higher-risk patients.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cFwfV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The annual risk of myocardial infarction (MI) was 1.67% (95% CI 1.36‐1.98), based on 46 studies involving 100,786 patients. There was significant heterogeneity across studies (P het < 0.001), with 96% of the heterogeneity explained by factors such as study design, study period, duration of follow-up, mean age, prevalence of antithrombotic therapy, and incident versus combined ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA). Over time, the annual risk of MI significantly decreased (P int = 0.021) as shown in Figure 1. This trend did not differ significantly between community-based studies (7 studies, 34,749 patients) and hospital-based studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (51 studies, 96,550 patients, P int = 0.58).

The risk of MI was lower in studies enrolling patients after 2005 (0.90%, 95% CI 0.49‐1.32, 6 studies, 5,914 patients) compared to those enrolling between 1990 and 2005 (1.53%, 95% CI 1.14‐1.91, 26 studies, 83,884 patients) and before 1990 (2.32%, 95% CI 1.63‐3.00, 14 studies, 10,988 patients, P int = 0.015). Over time, mean systolic blood pressure at the time of stroke admission (P int = 0.02) and the prevalence of smokers (P int = 0.04) decreased, whereas the mean age (P int = 0.81) and the proportion of men (P int = 0.65) did not change significantly. The risk of MI did not significantly vary with follow-up duration (range 1.0‐10.0 years, P int = 0.88, Figure 2).

The annual risk of MI was higher in studies restricted to patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (1.91%, 95% CI 1.45‐2.37, 5 studies, 2,309 patients) compared to those without such histories (0.85%, 95% CI 0.56‐1.14, 3 studies, 7,795 patients, P int = 0.036). In studies with a midyear period of ≥ 2000, the annual risk of MI was 1.02% (95% CI 0…).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a retrospective cohort study (Framingham Heart Study) of prospectively collected data from 14,059 participants with no history of TIA or stroke at baseline, followed up from 1948 to December 31, 2017. A sample of TIA-free participants was matched to participants with first incident TIA based on age and sex (ratio, 5:1).

- **Exposures**: Included calendar time (for TIA incidence calculation and time-trend analyses) and TIA (matched longitudinal cohort).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcomes were TIA incidence rates; the proportion of strokes occurring after TIA in the short term (7, 30, and 90 days) versus the long term (> 1–10 years); comparison of stroke occurrence after TIA versus among matched control participants without TIA; and the time trends of stroke risk at 90 days after TIA, which were assessed in three epochs: 1954–1985, 1986–1999, and 2000–2017.

- **Results**: Among 14,059 participants during 66 years of follow-up (366,209 person-years), 435 experienced TIA (229 women; mean age, 73.47 [SD, 11.48] years and 206 men; mean age, 70.10 [SD, 10.64] years) and were matched to 2,175 control participants without TIA. The estimated incidence rate of TIA was 1.19/1000 person-years. Over a median of 8.86 years of follow-up after TIA, 130 participants (29.5%) had a stroke; 28 strokes (21.5%) occurred in the short term.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^117WD1Km]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

In the context of specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly concerning patients with inherited thrombophilias, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of antiplatelet therapy. This is advised to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA of unknown source, despite thorough diagnostic evaluation, no other thrombotic history, and having any of the following conditions:

- **Prothrombin 20210A mutation**: Considered significant in the absence of other thrombotic history.

- **Activated protein C resistance**: Known to increase thrombotic risk.

- **Elevated factor VIII levels**: Associated with increased risk of thrombotic events.

- **Protein C deficiency**: A recognized condition contributing to thrombotic risk.

- **Protein S deficiency**: Includes risks similar to protein C deficiency.

- **Antithrombin III deficiency**: Known to elevate the likelihood of thrombotic conditions.

### Transient ischemic attack: Risk stratification and treatment [^111P87AA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A major challenge facing the physician evaluating patients with transient ischemic attack is determining which patients are at highest short-term risk of stroke. A number of stratification schemes have been recently developed incorporating easily obtainable clinical information about the individual patient. Emerging data suggest a role for brain and vascular imaging in risk stratification.

Many aspects of acute management of transient ischemic attack, such as which patients should be hospitalized and choice of acute antithrombotic therapy, remain controversial because of a lack of evidence from controlled trials. For longer-term prevention, there is much firmer evidence from multiple large randomized trials, and these data are reviewed in this article.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on management of transient ischaemic attack [^1145UrE4]. European stroke journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for transient ischemic attack, especially concerning the timing for the initial assessment, ESO 2021 guidelines recommend considering a prompt review in a TIA clinic or admitting to a stroke unit for evaluation by a stroke specialist. The decision should depend on local availability and patient preferences for those with a suspected high-risk TIA.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: Time-course analysis of randomised trials [^1138fSMF]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention after transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke based on trials showing a 13% reduction in long-term risk of recurrent stroke. However, the risk of major stroke is very high in the first few days after TIA and minor ischaemic stroke. Observational studies indicate significantly greater benefits of early medical treatment in the acute phase compared to longer-term trials. We hypothesized that the short-term benefits of early aspirin use have been underestimated.

Pooling the individual patient data from all randomised trials of aspirin versus control in secondary prevention after TIA or ischaemic stroke, we studied the effects of aspirin on the risk and severity of recurrent stroke. This was stratified by the following time periods: less than 6 weeks, 6–12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks after randomisation. We compared the severity of early recurrent strokes between treatment groups using shift analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To explore possible mechanisms of action, we also studied the time course of the interaction between the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole in secondary prevention of stroke.

Additionally, we conducted a further analysis by pooling data from trials of aspirin versus control where patients were randomised less than 48 hours following a major acute stroke. This was stratified by the severity of baseline neurological deficit to establish the very early time course of aspirin's effect on the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and how this effect differs by severity at baseline.

### Long-term risk of myocardial infarction compared to recurrent stroke after transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115K6WTL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

- **Results**: Of the 7,635 titles identified from searching databases, 686 abstracts were screened, leading to the assessment of 180 full texts. Bibliography screening of these eligible full texts resulted in the screening of 45 additional full texts. A total of 167 full texts were finally excluded, leaving 58 studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Characteristics of the included studies and definitions of MI, reStroke, and cardiac and vascular deaths are reported in Tables S1 to S4. The frequency and annual risks of each outcome in individual studies are given in Table S5.

	- There were 7 community-based studies, 25 hospital-based studies, and 26 RCTs, involving a total of 131,299 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range 1.0–10.0 years). Seven studies included patients with TIA only, 15 with IS only, 30 with TIA or IS, and 6 with IS and a small proportion of hemorrhagic stroke. Eight studies were restricted to incident IS/TIA, and 50 involved combined or unspecified IS/TIA. Delay from stroke onset to inclusion was less than 7 days in 9 studies, less than 1 month in 5 studies, less than 3 months in 13 studies, less than 6 months in 11 studies, less than 12 months in 1 study, less than 5 years in 1 study, and not reported in 18 studies.

	- Mean ages ranged from 59 to 77 years, and the prevalence of a history of CAD from 38% to 88%. Active prospective follow-up was undertaken in all except 4 studies, in which administrative follow-up was used. The proportions of patients treated at some point during follow-up with antithrombotic therapy ranged from 50% to 100%, with the lowest prevalence in old RCTs comparing antiplatelet therapy to placebo.

### National Stroke Association guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks [^1152cNyM]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are common and important harbingers of subsequent stroke. Management varies widely, and most published guidelines have not been updated in several years. The objective of this guideline development was to create comprehensive, unbiased, evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with transient ischemic attacks.

- **Methods**: Fifteen expert panelists were selected based on objective criteria, using publication metrics that predicted nomination by practitioners in the field. Prior published guidelines were identified through systematic review, and recommendations derived from them were independently rated for quality by the experts. The highest quality recommendations were selected and subsequently edited by the panelists using a modified Delphi approach with multiple iterations of questionnaires to reach consensus on new changes. Experts were provided systematic reviews of recent clinical studies and were asked to justify wording changes based on new evidence and to rate the final recommendations based on level of evidence and quality. No expert was allowed to contribute to recommendations on a topic for which there could be any perception of a conflict of interest.

- **Results**: Of 257 guideline documents identified by systematic review, 13 documents containing 137 recommendations met all entry criteria. Six iterations of questionnaires were required to reach consensus on wording of 53 final recommendations. These final recommendations covered initial management, evaluation, medical treatment, surgical treatment, and risk factor management.

The final recommendations summarize the comprehensive guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^113rEzDk]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ticagrelor 90 mg BID, in addition to aspirin, for up to 30 days. This is advised to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients who have experienced a recent (within 24 hours) minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) and have concomitant ipsilateral > 30% stenosis of a major intracranial artery.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^116iGtBj]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to secondary prevention through health system-based interventions, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of a decision support tool to improve diagnostic accuracy. This tool helps stratify patients into risk categories to support appropriate triage and prompts the initiation of medications and counseling for lifestyle modification. These measures aim to reduce the 90-day risk of recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients who present to their primary care provider as the first contact following a TIA or minor stroke.

### Incidence, outcome, risk factors, and long-term prognosis of cryptogenic transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: a population-based study [^115fWXQH]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The study focused on the number of atherosclerotic risk factors and the frequency of comorbid atherosclerotic disease across different transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke subtypes. Frequencies of risk factors and comorbid diseases were shown overall and separately for females and males. Data on smoking status were missing in four patients with cardioembolic events and two patients with cryptogenic events. Important risk factors identified included male sex, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, and a history of smoking. It is important to note that male sex was not considered in the sex-stratified analysis. Statistical heterogeneity among all subtypes was evaluated using the χ² test. Abbreviations used include ESUS for embolic strokes of undetermined source, LAD for large artery disease, PVD for peripheral vascular disease, and SVD for small vessel disease. The term "asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 50% at bifurcation" refers to specific vascular conditions observed.

The prevalence of different risk factors in cryptogenic versus other transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke subtypes is detailed. Patients with cryptogenic events exhibited the lowest prevalence of previous myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease when compared with large artery and cardioembolic events. Specifically, compared with patients presenting large artery TIA or stroke, those with cryptogenic events demonstrated significantly less peripheral vascular disease (40 [14%] vs 31 [4%]; adjusted OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17–0.45; p < 0.0001), with marginally lower incidence of myocardial infarction (39 [14%] vs 67 [8%]; adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44–1.04; p = 0.08). In comparing patients with non-large artery subtypes, those with cryptogenic events still had reduced occurrence of peripheral vascular disease (73 [7%] vs 31 [4%]; adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36–0.87; p < 0.001).

### Transient ischemic attack: Definitions and clinical presentations [^1149DucM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The definition of transient ischemic attack has changed from a focal neurologic event lasting less than 24 hours to one typically lasting less than 1 hour and not associated with changes on neuroimaging. Transient ischemic attacks, using the older definition, carry a 10% risk of stroke within 90 days and are therefore considered a serious condition meriting urgent attention. The manifestations of transient ischemic attacks are varied and include events involving the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations. Correct diagnosis depends on an accurate medical history and physical examination, combined with appropriate neuroimaging. It is uncommon for syndromes such as syncope, isolated dizziness, drop attacks, or global amnesia to be caused by cerebral ischemia or transient ischemic attack. With careful evaluation of symptoms according to this definition, a clinician can determine whether a transient ischemic attack has occurred and propose treatment that may decrease the likelihood of a subsequent stroke.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1116LUyu]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, particularly with respect to antithrombotic therapy for non-cardioembolic TIA, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend initiating early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel). This should ideally be done within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days, continuing for 21–90 days. Following this, single antiplatelet therapy should be used to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

Regarding the medical management for transient ischemic attack, specifically in relation to dyslipidemia management, the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of icosapent ethyl 2 g BID. This is advised to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a TIA who have fasting triglycerides of 135–499 mg/dL and LDL-C levels of 41–100 mg/dL. Patients should also be on moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, have an HbA1c of less than 10%, and no history of pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation (AF), or severe heart failure (HF).

### Is the long-term prognosis of transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke affected by the occurrence of nonfocal symptoms [^1121FTPG]. Stroke (2014). High credibility.

In patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke, nonfocal neurological symptoms, such as confusion and nonrotatory dizziness, may be associated with a higher risk of vascular events. We assessed the relationship between nonfocal symptoms and the long-term risk of vascular events or death in patients with a transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke.

- **Methods**: We related initial symptoms with outcome events in 2,409 patients with either transient ischemic attack (n = 723) or minor ischemic stroke (n = 1,686), included in the Life Long After Cerebral Ischemia cohort. All patients underwent a standardized interview on the occurrence of focal and nonfocal neurological symptoms during the qualifying event. The primary outcome was the composite of any stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death, vascular death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression.

- **Results**: Focal symptoms were accompanied by nonfocal symptoms in 739 (31%) patients. During a mean follow-up of 10.1 years, the primary outcome occurred in 1,313 (55%) patients. There was no difference in the risk of the primary outcome between patients with both focal and nonfocal symptoms and patients with focal symptoms alone (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.09; P = 0.60). The risk of each of the secondary outcomes was also similar in both groups.

- **Conclusions**: About one-third of the patients with a transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke have both focal and nonfocal symptoms.

### Diagnosis, workup, risk reduction of transient ischemic attack in the emergency department setting: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115sLeqf]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

At least 240,000 individuals experience a transient ischemic attack each year in the United States. Transient ischemic attack is a strong predictor of subsequent stroke. The 90-day stroke risk after transient ischemic attack can be as high as 17.8%, with almost half occurring within 2 days of the index event. Diagnosing transient ischemic attack can also be challenging given the transitory nature of symptoms, often reassuring neurological examination at the time of evaluation, and lack of confirmatory testing. Limited resources, such as imaging availability and access to specialists, can further exacerbate this challenge.

This scientific statement focuses on the correct clinical diagnosis, risk assessment, and management decisions of patients with suspected transient ischemic attack. Identification of high-risk patients can be achieved through the use of comprehensive protocols incorporating acute phase imaging of both the brain and cerebral vasculature, thoughtful use of risk stratification scales, and ancillary testing with the ultimate goal of determining who can be safely discharged home from the emergency department versus admitted to the hospital. We discuss various methods for rapid yet comprehensive evaluations, keeping resource-limited sites in mind. In addition, we discuss strategies for secondary prevention of future cerebrovascular events using maximal medical therapy and patient education.

### Management of transient ischemia attacks in the twenty-first century [^114Q1jLD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Patients who have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) represent a group that may appear well but are at high risk for stroke within 90 days. Management of patients with a TIA requires an understanding of the short-term risk for stroke to guide acute management and recognize the long-term benefits of medical and surgical therapies. The initial emergency department (ED) evaluation may be supplemented with simple TIA stroke risk scores to estimate short-term stroke risk. The addition of MRI provides further information regarding stroke risks while identifying specific causes of TIA. Extended testing may not be feasible in the ED; to address this limitation, new outpatient strategies for patients with a TIA have been developed. These include the use of an ED observation unit or an outpatient TIA clinic. Although controversy remains in some areas of acute TIA management due to the lack of evidence from controlled trials, evidence from large randomized trials has led to a better understanding of effective measures for the long-term prevention of stroke.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: Population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^116vCmCV]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) can be difficult. There is consensus on classic symptoms (e.g. motor weakness, dysphasia, hemianopia, monocular visual loss), but no consensus on several monosymptomatic events with sudden-onset, non-progressive, focal negative symptoms (e.g. isolated diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, ataxia, sensory loss, and bilateral visual disturbance). This leads to much variation in investigation and treatment.

- **Methods**: We prospectively ascertained and investigated all strokes and sudden-onset transient neurological symptoms in a population of 92,728 people (no age restrictions) from Oxfordshire, UK, who sought medical attention at nine primary care practices or at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK (Oxford Vascular Study). Patients classified at baseline with minor ischaemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Score < 5), classic TIA, or non-consensus TIA were treated according to secondary prevention guidelines. Risks of stroke (7-day, 90-day, and 10-year risks) and risks of all major vascular events were established by face-to-face follow-up visits and compared with the risk expected from age and sex-specific stroke incidence in the underlying study population.

- **Findings**: Between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2018, 2,878 patients were identified with minor ischaemic stroke (n = 1,287), classic TIA (n = 1,021), or non-consensus TIA (n = 570). Follow-up was conducted until October 1, 2018, with a median follow-up period of 5.2 years (IQR 2.6–9.2 years).
