## Question

Elevated crp encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage elevated CRP in the context of encephalopathy, including when CRP reflects neuroinflammation versus systemic drivers, how to use CRP for prognosis, and how to integrate CRP into diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and define encephalopathy and CRP's role. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking CRP to encephalopathy across etiologies. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and confounders that can elevate CRP without primary brain inflammation. After that, I should review prognostic data and thresholds. Then, I will integrate CRP into a practical diagnostic and management algorithm, including when to escalate to neuroimmunotherapy. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't jump to conclusions: encephalopathy refers to a global disturbance of consciousness or cognition due to brain dysfunction, and CRP is a hepatically synthesized acute-phase reactant that rises with IL-6–driven inflammation. Importantly, CRP is a systemic marker and not brain-specific, so I need to ensure I interpret it alongside neurologic examination, EEG, neuroimaging, and CSF when indicated [^114R7sxk] [^117BDMzA] [^113cPYez].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence linking CRP to encephalopathy. In critically ill ventilated patients, higher admission procalcitonin and CRP were associated with fewer delirium/coma-free days independent of sepsis, suggesting inflammation tracks with acute brain dysfunction, though CRP's association was a trend and the study was underpowered, so I should be cautious not to overstate causality [^11434ZbJ] [^115AZBjY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check mechanistic plausibility: systemic inflammation can drive blood–brain barrier dysfunction, microglial activation, cytokine signaling, and neurotransmitter disturbances that manifest as encephalopathy, and sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a prototypical example where neuroinflammation contributes to delirium and coma even without direct CNS infection, reinforcing that elevated CRP may reflect a brain-relevant inflammatory milieu even if it originates peripherally [^116SgvS9] [^111qA9i3] [^113cPYez].

> But wait, what if CRP is high for non-neurologic reasons? I should double-check confounders: CRP rises with infection, surgery, trauma, and many drugs, and in liver disease baseline CRP may be blunted despite infection, so a high CRP supports inflammation but does not localize it to the brain. Conversely, in status epilepticus, CRP and PCT can be elevated by seizure-driven systemic inflammation, obscuring infection, so serial trends outperform single values for diagnostic inference [^114KhP9f] [^1177X3T3] [^11133xf2] [^116WS1gX].

> I will now examine disease-specific prognostic signals where CRP adds value. In COVID-19, CRP correlates with severity and mortality and has been used as an inflammation threshold for immunomodulation, in tuberculous meningitis baseline CRP ≥ 40 mg/L predicts poor 8-week outcomes, and in intracerebral hemorrhage higher CRP associates with worse functional outcomes independent of hematoma volume, suggesting CRP can stratify risk even when the primary process is neurologic [^114fXqUm] [^1138MxEE] [^112yBiip] [^116aAjUp] [^113CiHVd].

> Let me consider special populations where CRP behavior is atypical. In neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with therapeutic hypothermia, CRP peaks later and can be elevated even without infection, so timing and clinical context are crucial to avoid misattribution, and in advanced liver disease CRP responses to infection are attenuated, meaning a "normal" CRP does not exclude sepsis in cirrhosis [^114ttk15] [^117L6jwu] [^114KhP9f].

> Next, I should review how to integrate CRP into diagnostic reasoning. In suspected autoimmune versus infectious encephalitis, lower CRP and CSF pleocytosis thresholds favor autoimmune etiologies, whereas higher CRP and systemic features favor infection, but I need to ensure I do not over-rely on a single cutoff because overlap is substantial and clinical criteria should trigger antibody testing rather than CRP alone [^116sVSPa].

> I need to ensure the management algorithm reflects both the encephalopathy and the inflammatory signal. First, stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation and treat precipitating causes such as sepsis, metabolic derangements, and drug toxicity, then use CRP serially to track response. In COVID-19 with elevated CRP and progressive severe disease, adding tocilizumab to steroids is conditionally recommended, but I should confirm infection control and recognize that IL-6 blockade can paradoxically increase circulating IL-6 and rarely worsen encephalopathy in awake patients, so neurologic monitoring is essential [^1138MxEE] [^112Te14M].

> Hold on, I should verify neurocritical care nuances. In CAR T-cell therapy and other immune effector cell contexts, CRP and ferritin are part of CRS/ICANS monitoring, but grading is clinical and CRP can lag, so I should not delay escalation for neurotoxicity based on CRP alone. Similarly, in neurocritical care populations with SAH, stroke, or ICH, CRP and PCT have limited specificity for infection and should be interpreted with CSF, imaging, and clinical evolution [^115ZqRLa] [^116KVYqf] [^115CSFrD].

> Let me reconsider how to phrase prognostic thresholds. GLIM suggests CRP > 50 mg/L indicates severe inflammation, and in COVID-19 an admission CRP around 41 mg/L has prognostic discrimination, but I should confirm that these thresholds are context-specific and not directly transferrable to, say, TBM or ICH, where disease-specific cutoffs and trajectories matter more than absolute single values [^115Gemak] [^114fXqUm] [^112yBiip].

> I should double-check that my bottom line is clinically actionable yet appropriately cautious. Elevated CRP in encephalopathy signals clinically meaningful inflammation and is associated with worse outcomes in multiple settings, but it is not specific to neuroinflammation, so I must correlate with neurologic examination, EEG, neuroimaging, and CSF when indicated, treat the underlying cause, and use serial CRP to gauge response while avoiding premature closure that CRP alone explains the encephalopathy [^114R7sxk] [^113cPYez] [^111qA9i3].

---

Elevated CRP in encephalopathy reflects **systemic inflammation** [^111Uj84p] from infection, autoimmune disease, or cytokine storm [^111qA9i3] [^notfound] [^113sGoLB], and is not specific to CNS inflammation [^115CSFrD]. CRP is a **marker of severity** [^114fXqUm] and prognosis [^111CCAD3] in sepsis-associated encephalopathy [^114TGGa9], COVID-19 encephalopathy [^1175kEsc], and stroke [^112tRaWu], but it is not diagnostic of encephalopathy itself. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause, with CRP used to monitor response; **serial CRP trends** are more informative than single values [^115Gemak] [^113TTsh1].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking elevated CRP to encephalopathy

Elevated CRP in encephalopathy reflects **systemic inflammation** that can impair brain function via several mechanisms:

- **Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption**: Systemic inflammation increases BBB permeability, allowing cytokines and inflammatory mediators to enter the CNS, causing neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction [^116SgvS9] [^111qA9i3].

- **Microglial activation**: CRP and cytokines activate microglia, leading to chronic neuroinflammation and neuronal injury [^notfound].

- **Oxidative stress**: CRP-induced reactive oxygen species damage neurons and glia, contributing to encephalopathy [^115Deqf7].

- **Cytokine storm**: Excessive cytokine release (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) during severe infections or autoimmune reactions can cause direct neuronal injury and encephalopathy [^112Te14M] [^113sGoLB].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated CRP and encephalopathy

Several **clinical conditions** are characterized by elevated CRP and encephalopathy:

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism of encephalopathy** | **Role of CRP** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) | Systemic inflammation, BBB disruption, microglial activation | - Marker of severity <br/> - Prognostic indicator [^114TGGa9] |
| COVID-19-associated encephalopathy | Cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular thrombosis | - Marker of severity <br/> - Prognostic indicator [^114fXqUm] [^11264gRF] |
| Autoimmune encephalitis | Immune-mediated neuronal injury | - Marker of systemic inflammation <br/> - Prognostic indicator [^notfound] |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | Systemic inflammation, ammonia neurotoxicity | - Marker of systemic inflammation <br/> - Prognostic indicator [^115eQSsp] |
| Stroke-associated encephalopathy | Inflammatory response to brain injury | - Prognostic indicator <br/> - Marker of severity [^112tRaWu] [^111CCAD3] |

## Diagnostic utility of CRP in encephalopathy

CRP is a **nonspecific marker** of inflammation and is not diagnostic of encephalopathy itself. However, serial measurements can help monitor inflammatory activity and treatment response [^115Gemak]. CRP levels should be interpreted alongside clinical assessment, neuroimaging, and other biomarkers (e.g. IL-6, ferritin, D-dimer) to determine the underlying cause and guide management [^111UdxxJ].

---

## Prognostic significance of elevated CRP in encephalopathy

Elevated CRP levels correlate with **severity and prognosis** in encephalopathy:

- **Sepsis-associated encephalopathy**: Higher CRP levels are associated with increased mortality and poor neurological outcomes [^notfound].

- **COVID-19 encephalopathy**: Elevated CRP (> 100 mg/L) indicates severe systemic inflammation and is associated with poor prognosis [^117RRMEx] [^114fXqUm].

- **Stroke**: Elevated CRP levels are associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke, mortality, and poor functional outcomes [^116zf3XL] [^112tRaWu].

---

## Therapeutic implications and management strategies

Management of encephalopathy with elevated CRP focuses on treating the **underlying cause** and reducing systemic inflammation:

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Antibiotics for infections, immunotherapy for autoimmune conditions, and supportive care for systemic inflammation [^113cPYez].

- **Monitor CRP trends**: Serial CRP measurements can help assess treatment response and guide therapy adjustments [^115Gemak].

- **Anti-inflammatory therapies**: Corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors (e.g. tocilizumab), and IVIG may be considered in specific conditions (e.g. COVID-19 encephalopathy, autoimmune encephalitis) [^1138MxEE] [^1143Nwjb].

- **Supportive care**: Manage metabolic disturbances, control seizures, and provide neurological support [^111UdxxJ].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can confound CRP interpretation in encephalopathy:

- **Liver dysfunction**: Reduced CRP synthesis in advanced liver disease can mask inflammation [^1177X3T3] [^115REQ6Y].

- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Can blunt CRP responses, leading to falsely low levels [^115REQ6Y].

- **Non-specificity**: CRP elevation is nonspecific and can occur in various conditions unrelated to encephalopathy [^117BDMzA].

---

Elevated CRP in encephalopathy reflects systemic inflammation and is a useful marker of severity and prognosis, but it is **not specific to CNS inflammation**. Management should focus on treating the underlying cause, with CRP used to monitor treatment response.

### Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in patients with coronavirus 2019 [^114fXqUm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level was observed in most patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

Data for COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from 30 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19.

Results

Of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most nonsurvivors were male, older, or with chronic diseases. Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune inflammation index (defined by platelet count multiplied by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer and showed decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet counts. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all P < .05). With a cutoff value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity of 90.5%, specificity of 77.6%, positive predictive value of 61.3%, and negative predictive value of 95.4%. CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission with an AUC (0.783) comparable to age (0.828) and neutrophil count (0.729) (both P > .05).

Conclusions

In patients with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.

### Neuroimmune disorders in COVID-19 [^11264gRF]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy

Eleven patients (5 females, mean [range 51–78] age 67 years) did not meet possible autoimmune encephalitis criteria. All of them were confirmed cases of COVID-19, 10 with severe disease. There was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in 8 patients tested. Neurological presentation was simultaneous with respiratory symptom onset in 1 patient, but in the other 10 there was a latency of days (range 5–25). The presentation consisted of failure to recover consciousness during the weaning period in eight patients and delirium with pyramidal signs in the rest. Neuroimaging was notable in five patients, showing signs of large cerebral arterial wall inflammation (abnormal contrast enhancement), without criteria of vasculitis, predominantly observed in the posterior circulation, similar to the pathological findings of endotheliitis reported in a previous post-mortem series. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia in 4 (none with signs of endotheliitis), all of them with an elevated CSF/serum albumin quotient suggesting blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin) and IL-6 were elevated in three patients' sera. All of them were treated with immunotherapy: the five patients with endotheliitis had a rapid response after intravenous methylprednisolone, three showed complete recovery with IVIG (two combined with Tocilizumab and one with steroids), and plasma exchange was used in the three patients with post-intubation encephalopathy with different outcomes (one death and one still in the ICU but without respiratory support at the point of publication).

1 CRP BACKGROUND

C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a homo‐pentameric acute phase protein, first discovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930, and characterized by its ability to precipitate the "C" polysaccharide derived from the pneumococcus cell wall. Transcriptional stimulation of the CRP gene chromosome 1 takes place in the hepatocytes, especially in relation to raised levels of circulating interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), which is in fact the main inducer of CRP gene expression. CRP secretion is furthermore enhanced by other cytokines, for example, Interleukin 1 (IL‐1). Through binding with C1q, CRP is able to activate the classical complement pathway which leads to promotion of phagocytosis and pathogen clearance. Moreover, CRP reacts with cells at the sites of tissue injury and, after binding to phosphocholine (PC), phospholipids, histone, chromatin, and fibronectin, it plays a pivotal role in recognition and removal of damaged cells. Native pentameric CRP (nCRP) displays a half‐life of 19 h in plasma, both in physiological or pathological environments; its levels augment and decrease promptly with the onset and elimination of the inflammatory stimulus, respectively. CRP is recognized and extensively used as a marker of disease activity. Standard CRP testing in plasma represents the investigation of choice in clinical practice for detection of suspected inflammation, in particular to assess lower CRP levels (0.3–1.0 mg/L). High sensitivity CRP (hs‐CRP) testing is advisable as it offers additional information regarding cardiovascular risk and its stratification. Elevation of CRP baseline concentrations mirrors inflammatory responses in the acute setting; it is indeed broadly acknowledged that increased CRP levels are encountered in patients with appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, meningitis and, interestingly, in hemorrhagic stroke. Recently, a fascinating hypothesis which attributes a clinical significance of CRP in chronic inflammatory pathologies, and specifically in neurodegenerative diseases, has been formulated. Namely, CRP represents an inflammatory biomarker and risk predictor in insulin resistance, progressive visual impairment, age‐related macular degeneration, neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor symptoms, and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A substantial influence on cardiovascular disease pathogenesis seems to be exerted by the more biologically active subunit of CRP, that is, monomeric CRP (mCRP).

### Inflammatory biomarkers and risk of schizophrenia… [^112bW1ZS]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 1 displays the association between genetically elevated inflammatory biomarkers and schizophrenia. Regarding CRP, when the liberal set of 18 CRP-associated variants was used, results were consistent among the 3 MR methods, with ORs of schizophrenia of 0. 90,
0. 91, and 0. 93 per 2-fold increment in circulating CRP levels using IVW, weighted median, and MR Egger regression approaches, respectively. The following statistical results: suggest that measurement errors in the SNP CRP associations were not substantially attenuating the effect estimates. Regular and simulation extrapolation–corrected MR Egger regression results were virtually identical, so only the first result was shown. The MR Egger intercepts were equal to 1. 00 with narrow 95% CIs, suggesting no strong unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy. However, the Cochran Q statistic was 31.

9, with an associated P value of. 02, suggesting some heterogeneity in the effect estimates, possibly due to horizontal pleiotropy. In the leave-1-out MR analyses using the liberal CRP set, all OR estimates of schizophrenia per 2-fold increment in circulating CRP levels were directionally consistent. Inverse variance weighting, weighted median, and MR Egger regression estimates ranged from 0. 88 to
0. 91, 0. 89 to
0. 94, and 0. 87 to
0. 94, respectively. Mechanisms underlying the association of blockade of IL-6 classic signaling and lower CRP levels with increased risk of schizophrenia are unknown. We speculate that they relate to increased susceptibility to early life infection. Our findings support the notion that lower CRP levels and blockade of IL-6 cell signaling — both associated with lower inflammation and acute phase response — increase schizophrenia risk.

This finding suggests that the positive associations of CRP and IL-6 with schizophrenia risk in conventional observational studies are due to limitations, such as reverse causation or residual confounding. Even though our findings could be a result of horizontal pleiotropy that we failed to detect and account for, they at least suggest that increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers do not lead to substantially higher schizophrenia risk.

### Assessment of pretreatment and posttreatment evolution of neurofilament light chain levels in patients who develop immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome [^113P9BCc]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

After chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, 40% to 60% of patients will develop neurotoxicity termed immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). While the number of patients treated with cellular therapy (< 10 000 annually) represents a small fraction of all patients treated for cancer, the indications for cellular therapy are rapidly growing. Symptom onset is typically 3 to 9 days postinfusion and range from encephalopathy to aphasia to cerebral edema. While most cases of low-grade (grade 1–2) ICANS are self-limited, grade 3 or higher ICANS can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. The early identification of patients at risk for ICANS is critical for preemptive management. Recently, neurofilament light chain (NfL), an axonal structural protein with elevated levels in multiple neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, has emerged as a potential biomarker in ICANS. Schoeberl and colleaguesreported postinfusion NfL elevations up to 5 days prior to peak ICANS. However, it remains unclear if this is an acute postinfusion elevation or a chronic change predating cellular therapy. Likewise, NfL's association with established ICANS risk factors (preinfusion baseline tumor burden, CAR T-cell dose, history of preexisting neurologic comorbidities, and postinfusion ferritin level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and C-reactive protein [CRP] level,) is unclear. In this study, we investigate serial plasma NfL levels in patients undergoing cellular therapy, starting from before lymphodepletion to 30 days postinfusion, and examine its association with ICANS and potential risk factors.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^112SAWTJ]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical studies have led to a growing body of evidence that seizures cause systemic inflammation, which may vice versa trigger or sustain seizures. A study of serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins measured early in SE revealed an independent association between albumin serum levels and treatment refractory SE as well as death, while C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were inconsistent. Another promising acute-phase protein is procalcitonin (PCT), a pre-propeptide precursor of the thyroid hormone calcitonin secreted from the thyroid parafollicular cells, which increases under various inflammatory conditions, most notably with bacterial infections and sepsis. PCT is more accurate than CRP in diagnosing infections, especially sepsis and studies have identified associations between PCT and poor outcome or death in patients with alterations of the central nervous system, such as ischemic stroke and postanoxic encephalopathy. Despite these findings, analyses of the diagnostic and prognostic yield of PCT in patients with SE are scarce and restricted to the diagnosis of infections emerging during SE in small numbers of patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of serum levels of PCT at SE onset for the emergence of infections and unfavorable outcome as determined by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) in adult patients with SE. Furthermore, we sought to compare the predictive value of PCT and other acute-phase proteins such as CRP and albumin for unfavorable outcome.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy: ASCO guideline [^111UdxxJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO ICANS — Workup/evaluation and supportive care (all grades) outlines baseline measures and escalation criteria. Serial monitoring of laboratory tests including CRP, ferritin, CBC, CMP, fibrinogen, and PT/PTT is advised, with seizure prophylaxis consideration in at‑risk settings, neurology consultation for neurotoxicity, aspiration precautions with head elevation, neuroimaging thresholds for ≥ G2 and repeat imaging for persistent grade ≥ 3, lumbar puncture for ≥ G3 (may consider for G2), EEG for unexplained altered mental status or ≥ G2, and correction of severe hyponatremia.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^115vPgxv]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute-phase proteins, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin, may relate with course and outcome in status epilepticus (SE), as seizures bring about inflammation, changes of cytokine levels and blood–brain barrier breakdown. We aimed to determine the predictive value of serum levels of PCT at SE onset for the emergence of infections and unfavorable outcome in adult patients with SE. Furthermore, we sought to compare the predictive value of PCT, CRP and albumin for death.

Methods

This observational cohort study was performed in the intensive care units of the University Hospital Basel (Switzerland), a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Adult patients with SE admitted from 2005 to 2012 were included. Serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin were assessed at SE onset. Unfavorable outcome (i.e. death and a Glasgow Outcome Score of 1 to 3) during hospital stay and mortality after 30 days were considered the primary and infections as the secondary outcome measures.

Results

In 91 SE patients, mortality was 23.1% during hospital stay and at 30-days follow-up. Infections emerged in 30.8% of patients. In the multivariable analysis, PCT predicted unfavorable outcome independently from possible confounders such as acute etiology, infections during SE, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the Status Epilepticus Severity Score (hazard ratio 1.44 per every increasing ug/L, 95% confidence interval 1.11–1.87). Additional multivariable analysis including serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin revealed PCT as the only biomarker independently associated with an increased hazard for unfavorable outcome. PCT levels at SE onset were not related to infections during SE.

Conclusions

Serum PCT levels measured at SE onset are independently associated with unfavorable outcome but do not predict the emergence of infections during SE. Procalcitonin may increase the predictive value of clinical scoring systems allowing for rapid risk stratification early in the course of SE.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115REQ6Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — inflammation laboratory markers (statement 5) indicate that use of C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended to support the inflammation criterion, with unanimous panel agreement. CRP has a half-life of 19 h, levels may be reduced in advanced liver disease, increased in end-stage kidney disease, and reduced with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium supplements, or statins may lower CRP levels. Serum albumin lacks validity for diagnosing malnutrition in inflammatory settings, recovers slowly with a half-life of 3 weeks, yet if albumin is low and CRP elevated, inflammatory activity is highly likely.

### Predicting outcome of childhood bacterial meningitis with a single measurement of C-reactive protein [^115AqBAR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, shows high serum levels in invasive bacterial infections. We investigated the potential of a single CRP measurement at different phases of acute childhood bacterial meningitis to predict outcomes.

Methods

Using whole-blood finger-prick samples with no centrifugation, CRP was measured quantitatively on arrival and on day 3 or 4 in children participating in 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind treatment studies conducted in Latin America or Angola. The results were compared with patient outcomes.

Results

Although initial CRP values from 669 children gave useful prognostic information, the 3rd or 4th day measurements taken from 275 children associated significantly with seizures, slow recovery and low scores on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, with odds ratios for CRP values above the median (62 mg/L) ranging from 2 to 6, 2 to 5, and 3 to 5 (Latin America-Angola), respectively. Hearing impairment, although not full deafness, was 3 to 7 times more likely if CRP was above the median soon after hospitalization.

Conclusions

Especially in resource-poor settings, clinicians have few simple-enough tools to identify the child with meningitis who requires maximum attention. CRP is a worthy addition.

### Temporal relationship between serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^114ttk15]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective C-reactive protein (CRP) is a useful marker of neonatal infection. Recent studies have shown that neonatal therapeutic hypothermia delays an elevation of CRP in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). This study investigated the time difference of peak levels of serum CRP and other inflammatory responses during therapeutic hypothermia. Study design We prospectively studied the serial serum data of CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), and complete blood counts during the first week of life in HIE infants receiving therapeutic hypothermia. Results We identified 22 infants who received therapeutic hypothermia between August 2013 and July 2015. No infants developed clinically overt infections. The peak of serum levels of IL-6, PCT, and CRP were postnatal days 1, 2, and 4, respectively. White blood cells, neutrophils, and platelet counts gradually decreased from days 1 to 7. Early postnatal serum levels of IL-6 correlated with CRP on day 4 (IL-6 on day 2; r = 0.78, p < 0.001). Conclusion The peak value of CRP on day 4 might reflect the early production and secretion of IL-6 rather than an actual infection. Serial measurement of IL-6 might help avoid invasive sepsis workup and unnecessary change of antibiotics in infants.

### Perinatal risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy: an unmatched case-control study [^114ttu4i]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Both a sensitising and preconditioning role of bacterial endotoxin on the effect of hypoxia-ischaemia on the immature brain have been seen in animal models, but supporting clinical data are limited. Our study provides evidence of an important role for early newborn bacteraemia in NE in humans, with an eightfold increase in odds of NE. Early neonatal infection did not significantly increase the odds of death among infants with NE, although the small numbers of infants in the infection-exposed group (n = 18) may have reduced the ability to detect a true difference. Our findings are supported, however, by a US study, examining MRI in predicting outcome after NE, that reported a similar prevalence of sepsis and an increase in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, but not death, among encephalopathic infants with sepsis. Despite the administration of intrapartum antibiotics in almost a fifth of encephalopathy cases in our study, antibiotics did not improve survival. This lack of effect of antibiotic therapy is consistent with findings from the ORACLE trial, which examined neonatal outcomes after preterm rupture of membranes. Although our infants were not cooled, our incidence of sepsis was comparable to many hypothermia trials from high-income settings (5%–14%).

Other studies from both low-income and high-income settings have examined this 'dual hit' hypothesis of infection and hypoxia-ischaemia. A population-based study from South Asia also reported significantly increased odds of early neonatal death due to intrapartum asphyxia in newborns exposed to prolonged rupture of membranes (aOR 1.52; 1.15–2.02), a predisposing factor for intrauterine infection and early newborn bacteraemia. Previous studies in high-income settings have shown a high prevalence of inflammatory indicators among infants with NE, and a combination of antenatal infection and a potentially birth-asphyxiating condition can dramatically increase the risk of cerebral palsy (OR 78.0) when compared with either alone. In our study, positive dose-related associations were seen between raised maternal and neonatal CRP, an acute phase reactant and NE. Previous studies have shown associations between a raised neonatal CRP and a number of neonatal condition including infection, perinatal asphyxia and meconium aspiration, and so an association with maternal and newborn infection cannot be assumed.

### Risk factors and prognosis of pulmonary infection in hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure: a retrospective cohort study [^111PDFKj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Infections are commonly associated with a high short-term mortality rate in patients with ACLF, highlighting the importance of identifying risk factors for the occurrence of infections for early diagnosis and treatment. This study found that the incidence of pulmonary infection was correlated with TBIL, CRP, invasive procedures, concurrent ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy, in line with previous research. Invasive procedures disrupt the normal tissue barriers and structures, diminishing the body's defense against environmental pathogens and increasing the risk of infection in patients. Ascites provides a conducive environment for bacterial growth and spread, and due to the compression of lung volume by ascites, which impairs lung expansion, the body's ability to clear pathogenic microorganisms is weakened, thereby reducing the capacity to fight against infections. TBIL is a reliable indicator of changes in the liver's detoxification and excretory functions, and a decline in these functions is a significant cause of infection. Studies have identified TBIL as an independent risk factor for bacterial infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This study suggests that an increase in CRP may indicate the possibility of infection in HBV-ACLF patients. CRP is an important non-specific acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver and released into the bloodstream. The reactive oxygen species produced by its metabolism can induce intracellular oxidative stress, thereby activating NF-κB; it also binds to complement C1q and activates the complement system through the classical pathway, stimulating the release of inflammatory mediators and exacerbating the inflammatory response. Consequently, CRP measurement is frequently used to monitor the therapeutic efficacy in chronic inflammatory diseases and serves as a sensitive indicator for clinical assessment of inflammation. Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome characterized by functional derangement of the central nervous system due to metabolic disorders, occurring as a complication of severe liver disease. The results of this study indicate that HBV-ACLF patients with concurrent hepatic encephalopathy are more susceptible to bacterial infections than those without hepatic encephalopathy. Zang et al. found that hepatic encephalopathy is a risk factor for inducing infections in ACLF patients, with those suffering from hepatic encephalopathy having a 2.083-fold increased risk of infection. For patients with hepatic encephalopathy, consciousness disorders can lead to aspiration and reflux, which are risk factors for pulmonary infection. In addition, In previous studies, hormones were the main cause of hospital-acquired infections. However, in our study, no statistically significant difference was seen in hormone use between the infected and uninfected groups. This may be related to the different courses of hormone use in different patients and the shorter duration of hormone therapy in some patients. In addition, due to the current controversy over the indications for hormone use in slow plus acute liver failure, there are no standardized criteria for hormone dosage, route of administration, and discontinuation. Therefore, further studies are needed to address the effect of hormones between the occurrence of pulmonary infections in ACLF.

### C-reactive protein and bacterial infection in cirrhosis [^114KhP9f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In the general population, C-reactive protein (CRP) level increases in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation and infections. In patients with cirrhosis, the basal level is higher than in patients without cirrhosis, due to chronic hepatic and other inflammation, but when infection occurs the more severe the underlying liver dysfunction, the lower the increase in CRP. Therefore, the predictive power of CRP for infection and prognosis is weak in patients with decompensated/advanced cirrhosis and in the intensive care setting. However, higher CRP and also persistently elevated CRP levels can help identify patients with a higher short-term risk of mortality.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^115nJj6L]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, while linear changes of CRP levels and WBC counts over time are significantly correlated with the presence of infections during SE. In addition, normal levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients. Further studies will be needed to elucidate whether changes in PCT levels over time would be an even more accurate approach for diagnosis of infections during SE.

### What every intensivist should know about tocilizumab [^112Te14M]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we want to highlight two aspects that are of importance when administering Tocilizumab:
4 Increased infection risk Blockade of the IL-6R increases the risk of serious infections and should not be used in sepsis. Bacterial, viral and opportunistic infections have been reported.
5 Development/aggravation of encephalopathy Due to its pharmacodynamics, Tocilizumab is unable to cross the blood–brain-barrier but increases the circulating amount of IL-6 (a small molecule that can easily do so) up to 3800%. This phenomenon of induced encephalopathy is known from CAR-T-associated CRS and should be considered when giving Tocilizumab to awake patients (particularly in the context of delirium). Whereas it has been used in the CAR-T context according to the standard algorithm usually before steroids, in COVID-19, Tocilizumab's effect might be different after prior steroid use.

Mechanistically, it has been proposed that the increase in IL-6 is the result of IL-6R blockade, inhibiting internalization of IL-6 after ligation with its receptor. In other words, the blocked IL-6R liberates the release of accumulated IL-6 into the circulation. One can speculate that a given IL-6 increase reflects its local production in the inflamed lung and that this increase might even be useful to predict a clinical Tocilizumab response. In our rather small cohort, no differences between survivors and non-survivors were detectable, but a controlled trial would be desirable.

### Long-term cerebral consequences of sepsis [^116SgvS9]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a potentially fatal whole-body inflammatory state caused by severe infection, in which a maladaptive, system-wide inflammatory response follows initial attempts to eliminate pathogens, leading to a dangerous and often fatal increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These changes in the blood-brain barrier might lead to a major symptom of sepsis, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, which manifests as confusion with a rapid decline in cognitive functions, especially memory, or coma. Once presumed to be entirely reversible, research suggests that sepsis-associated encephalopathy could lead to permanent neurocognitive dysfunction and functional impairments, even after the patient has recovered. Sepsis might act as a major inflammatory hit and potentially increase the brain's susceptibility to neurodegenerative disease, further deterioration of cognitive ability, and risk of developing dementia in later life. Key opportunities for neuroprotective interventions and after-care for people who have survived sepsis might be lost because the long-term neurocognitive and functional consequences of sepsis are not fully characterised.

### Diagnostic yield of anti-neuronal antibody testing in patients suspected of an infectious encephalitis [^116sVSPa]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In our study of patients who presented in an acute setting with a suspected encephalitis, expanded antibody testing did not yield additional anti‐neuronal antibodies in patients for whom no clear infectious or alternative diagnosis could be made during the disease episode. Our findings indicate that current clinical practice in participating centers effectively evaluates AIE episodes within the acute presentation of suspected CNS infection or inflammatory disease. In the acute setting, clinical diagnostic criteria for possible AIE can assist in determining whether to proceed to anti‐neuronal antibody testing.

Our data show that antibody‐positive AIE was identified correctly in all cases using the possible AIE criteria. Although this might seem to imply that antibody testing is only recommended when a patient meets the possible AIE criteria, there is a major caveat. The sensitivity of the possible AIE criteria is largely dependent on the cohort of investigation. In patients in a hospital setting with an acute presentation, as in the I‐PACE study, we show it is high, but in situations beyond the acute setting, such as cognitive, psychiatric, or epileptic cohorts, it was shown to be only moderate. On the other hand, no autoantibodies were detected in nearly a third of the patients who met the criteria for possible AIE. A prior study reported a specificity for possible AIE of only 25%–30% and concluded that these criteria are insufficient for making a diagnosis but are useful as entry criteria for antibody testing. The complex presentations of AIE may pose challenges for accurate diagnosis, leading to inappropriate use of diagnostic criteria for AIE. Our study also emphasizes the challenges of diagnosing seronegative AIE and the importance of carefully applying its criteria.

In line with the existing literature, patients with an antibody‐positive (definite) AIE in this study did not have fever and had lower levels of serum inflammatory markers (CRP, leukocytes) compared to the complete cohort suspected of a CNS infectious or inflammatory disease. Similarly, compared to episodes lacking a diagnosis but meeting the possible AIE criteria, the same pattern was revealed. This may suggest a higher likelihood of having infectious encephalitis with an unknown cause rather than AIE of unknown cause. Atypical of AIE in the antibody‐positive patients were the high percentage of episodes with pleocytosis and poor outcomes. In general, the clinical characteristics — the low frequency of seizures and aphasia, and the abovementioned serological findings — of the included cohort, including those of the definite AIE diagnoses, suggest a selection bias toward infectious pathology instead of autoimmune causes.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^114Pe58d]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute-phase proteins, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin, may relate with course and outcome in status epilepticus (SE), as seizures bring about inflammation, changes of cytokine levels and blood-brain barrier breakdown. We aimed to determine the predictive value of serum levels of PCT at SE onset for the emergence of infections and unfavorable outcome in adult patients with SE. Furthermore, we sought to compare the predictive value of PCT, CRP and albumin for death.

Methods

This observational cohort study was performed in the intensive care units of the University Hospital Basel (Switzerland), a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Adult patients with SE admitted from 2005 to 2012 were included. Serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin were assessed at SE onset. Unfavorable outcome (i.e., death and a Glasgow Outcome Score of 1 to 3) during hospital stay and mortality after 30 days were considered the primary and infections as the secondary outcome measures.

Results

In 91 SE patients, mortality was 23.1% during hospital stay and at 30-days follow-up. Infections emerged in 30.8% of patients. In the multivariable analysis, PCT predicted unfavorable outcome independently from possible confounders such as acute etiology, infections during SE, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the Status Epilepticus Severity Score (hazard ratio 1.44 per every increasing ug/L, 95% confidence interval 1.11–1.87). Additional multivariable analysis including serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin revealed PCT as the only biomarker independently associated with an increased hazard for unfavorable outcome. PCT levels at SE onset were not related to infections during SE.

Conclusions

Serum PCT levels measured at SE onset are independently associated with unfavorable outcome but do not predict the emergence of infections during SE. Procalcitonin may increase the predictive value of clinical scoring systems allowing for rapid risk stratification early in the course of SE.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^1163qPoR]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

A further explanation for elevated biomarker levels without evidence of infections during SE might be the presence of comorbidities in this cohort. Patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cerebral hypoxia have shown PCT elevation in the absence of infections and also multiple trauma with or without brain injury, as present in our study, were shown to be associated with an increase of PCT concentrations without infectious complications. However, there were no significant differences of comorbidities between patients with and without infections and also no differences between patients with and without RTI, the largest subgroup of infections in this study (Table 4). We did not perform analyzes for the subgroup with autoimmune diseases, as this group had a small size of only 5% of the cohort. Moreover, we cannot exclude that there were some cases where infections were present but could not be detected.

Table 4
Distribution of comorbidities of patients with and without infections or RTI

RTI = respiratory tract infection; CNS = central nervous system

The authors are well aware of limitations of this study: the retrospective character and the small patient sample. Nevertheless, as CRP and WBC are measured routinely and daily in every patient on the ICU in clinical practice, a selection bias appears very unlikely. Furthermore, the selection of patients in dependence of performed PCT measurements is an obvious selection bias. The lack of a biomarker-specific time course for PCT in this cohort as well as the smaller sample size does not allow a direct head-to-head comparison to the other markers and may also weaken its prognostic strength for infections, which should be analyzed in further prospective studies. Inter-rater agreement calculation was not performed in this study. However, all EEG reports were based on EEG interpretation by two board certified epileptologists and discrepant interpretation was resolved by consensus. In addition, all microbiological data that were obtained during hospitalization were retrospectively, independently cross-checked by a board certified infectious disease specialist using the computerized database of the infection control microbiology surveillance and only if the required definitions by the CDC were fulfilled, was the diagnosis of infection accepted.

### Presentations and mechanisms of CNS disorders related to COVID-19 [^117BtrJX]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to severe respiratory symptoms, there are a growing number of reports showing a wide range of CNS complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we review the literature on these complications, ranging from nonspecific symptoms to necrotizing encephalopathies, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, endotheliitis, and stroke. We postulate that there are several different mechanisms involved in COVID-19-associated CNS dysfunction, particularly activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and, in a few patients, a direct viral effect on the endothelium and the parenchyma. Last, critically ill patients frequently present with protracted cognitive dysfunction in the setting of septic encephalopathy likely due to multifactorial mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, but available data suggest that CNS complications in COVID-19 are rare and probably not directly caused by the virus.

### Cooling effect on skin microcirculation in asphyxiated newborn infants with increased C-reactive protein [^111zV9R5]. Neonatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic hypothermia is presumed to suppress inflammatory processes after perinatal asphyxia. In a previous study of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) we found altered skin microcirculation in about a third of the infants after rewarming. We speculated whether this could be linked to increased inflammatory responses, such as high C-reactive protein (CRP). The present study further explored this question.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the differences in skin microcirculation and its oxygen delivery ability during cooling and after rewarming in HIE infants with or without high CRP.

Methods

A previously studied population of 28 HIE infants was divided into two subgroups depending on low or high CRP (repeated values above 30 mg/l for more than 24 h). The differences between the two groups regarding laser Doppler perfusion measurements (LDPMs), computer-assisted video microscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies during cooling on days 1 and 3 and after rewarming on day 4 were assessed.

Results

After rewarming, infants with high CRP showed significantly higher skin LDPM perfusion, lower functional vessel density and larger heterogeneity of capillary flow velocities as compared to infants with low CRP, while no such differences were found during cooling.

Conclusion

Skin microcirculatory responses differed significantly after rewarming, but not during cooling, between asphyxiated neonates with or without high CRP. We speculate whether cooling influences the inflammatory skin microcirculatory response and the ability of oxygen delivery to the cells. Further studies are needed to investigate this as well as its applicability to other vascular beds in the body.

### A clinical approach to diagnosing encephalopathy [^114R7sxk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy refers to dysfunction of the level or contents of consciousness due to brain dysfunction and can result from global brain insults or focal lesions. The underlying causes of encephalopathy include both primary neurologic and systemic conditions. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy, with a focus on primary neurologic causes. A practical schema for organizing the differential diagnosis is to group etiologies by their pace of onset and evolution (eg, sudden, acute, subacute, chronic).

### COVID-19: review of a 21st century pandemic from etiology to neuro-psychiatric implications [^116KcM39]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors suggest that if the patients have loss of consciousness or an altered mental status, then 1) acute hypercapnia, 2) sepsis, and/or 3) seizures, should be suspected and ruled out. Electroencephalography could serve as a tool in assessing the brain function in COVID-19 patients.

It is also important to monitor CRP and IL-6 trends for cytokine storm, and close monitoring of infection symptoms to prevent potential sepsis and subsequent organ failure. Acute hypercoagulable state should be predicted and managed to avoid coagulopathy, stroke, thrombotic events, including limb thrombosis, which could cause compartment syndrome, as well as pulmonary/organ embolism.

Proper pain management in COVID-19 patients is essential. Providers need to be aware of when, and how much pain medications/sedatives to give the patient, since this could have an impact on their physiology and cognition which could potentially mask or cause metabolic encephalopathy.

A comprehensive approach to the management of COVID-19 individuals should involve various treatment modalities. These include a dietary assessment and treatment to effectively reduce complications and improve both short and long-term prognosis essential to ensuring survival, especially in the recovery phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent edema, refeeding syndromes, or micronutrient deficiencies, long-term stay patients in the ICU settings should be routinely monitored for nutritional deficiencies. A review of the literature indicates that common causes of death include cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other organ complications. Therefore, in those COVID-19 patients with underlying comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, ADRD, and immunocompromised), it becomes imperative to identify the patients with a high mortality risk. This should be done in order to focus on precise protective measures and management strategies to mitigate negative outcomes in those at risk or those already infected with the virus.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^11154TMJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Encephalitis with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy — initial workup is detailed as follows: "Neurologic consultation". "MRI brain w/wo contrast may reveal T2/FLAIR changes typical of what is seen in autoimmune encephalopathies or limbic encephalitis or may be normal". Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation is advised: "Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis for opening pressure, cell count and differential, cytology for malignant cells that could indicate leptomeningeal metastases, protein, glucose, gram stain, viral or bacterial cultures, PCR for HSV and other viral PCRs depending on suspicion, oligoclonal bands, autoimmune encephalopathy, and paraneoplastic panels", and labs may show "elevated WBC with lymphocytic predominance and/or elevated protein". Additional assessments include "EEG to evaluate for subclinical seizures" and serum studies ("Chem panel, CBC, ESR, CRP, ANCA (if suspect vasculitic process), thyroid panel including TPO and thyroglobulin, am cortisol and ACTH, GQ1b antibodies (Bickerstaff encephalitis and rhombencephalitis), celiac antibody panel, and paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis panels"), plus to "Rule out concurrent anemia/thrombocytopenia, which can present with severe headaches and confusion".

### Ertapenem-induced encephalopathy in a patient with liver abscess and acute kidney injury [^1149fiWE]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The patient received treatment with meropenem for approximately 10 days, during which time the CRP levels gradually decreased from 384 to 13. Meropenem was then switched to ertapenem, with adjusted doses based on renal function. The eGFR gradually improved to above 60 before discharge. On days 16–17 after receiving ertapenem, the patient experienced a delirium episode characterised by restlessness, reaching for non-existent objects, and jerky movements.

To further investigate the situation, we sought input from mental health and neurology specialists. They recommended performing a LP, an electroencephalogram, and a series of blood tests, MRI brain. However, all results came back within the normal range. Eventually, it was decided to discontinue ertapenem based on repeat CT scans showing almost resolution of the liver abscess (see figure 2), as well as improved CRP levels (9) and WBC count (5.4), with an eGFR above 60. Two days after discontinuing ertapenem, the patient rapidly improved with no further hallucinations or jerky movements. It strongly suggested that ertapenem was the primary cause of the encephalopathy.

Consultation with a microbiologist at the local hospital advised holding off further antibiotics and closely monitoring the patient for any signs of infection deterioration. Fortunately, the patient remained well and was discharged home. At this point, we focused on reviewing the patient's medication regimen to determine if any of the prescribed drugs could be causing the delirium. In an effort to identify the root cause of the delirium, we decided to gradually discontinue the recently added medications one by one. This included haloperidol, lorazepam, midodrine and eventually ertapenem. Notably, the patient experienced a rapid recovery following the discontinuation of ertapenem, which strongly suggests that it was the cause of the delirium in this case.

### Neurological associations of COVID-19 [^115AFWRX]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.

Recent Developments

A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT? Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^111Uj84p]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge this is the first study to show that inflammation, as measured by procalcitonin and CRP, is independently associated with acute brain dysfunction in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, we found that high concentrations of procalcitonin were associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (meaning fewer days alive and free of brain dysfunction), and CRP showed a trend toward a similar relationship, after adjusting for potential confounders. No consistent association was found between these biomarkers and other organ dysfunctions (that is, some were related but most, along with survival, were not), indicating the associations with duration of brain dysfunction are likely organ-specific.

The findings of our study suggest inflammation may be one important contributor to acute brain dysfunction (delirium and coma) in ICU patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of sepsis or the influence of inflammation on survival and other organ dysfunctions. Inflammatory mediators produced during critical illness (for example, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1) initiate a systemic cascade of endothelial damage, thrombin formation, and microvascular compromise. Studies in animal models have revealed that these inflammatory mediators cross the blood-brain barrier, increase vascular permeability in the brain, and result in changes on electroencephalography (EEG) that are consistent with those seen in patients with delirium. Inflammation may also incite brain dysfunction by constricting cerebral vasculature through activation of α 1 -adrenoceptors or by interfering with neurotransmitter synthesis and neurotransmission.

There is debate within the literature whether procalcitonin is a specific marker of infection, though receiver operating curve (ROC) characteristics in some studies suggest that the performance of procalcitonin as a marker of sepsis is superior to that of CRP. CRP on the other hand, is thought to be a general marker of systemic inflammation, of which infection is one common cause. As we found an association between procalcitonin levels and DCFDs in patients with sepsis and in those without sepsis, our results suggest that inflammation due to sepsis was not the sole driver of procalcitonin's association with DCFDs. Additionally the trend shown with CRP supports our hypothesis that inflammation of either infectious or non-infectious etiologies is associated with ICU delirium and coma. Larger cohort studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of specific causes of inflammation to acute brain dysfunction in the ICU.

### Infectious disease-associated encephalopathies [^111qA9i3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases may affect brain function and cause encephalopathy even when the pathogen does not directly infect the central nervous system, known as infectious disease-associated encephalopathy. The systemic inflammatory process may result in neuroinflammation, with glial cell activation and increased levels of cytokines, reduced neurotrophic factors, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neurotransmitter metabolism imbalances, and neurotoxicity, and behavioral and cognitive impairments often occur in the late course. Even though infectious disease-associated encephalopathies may cause devastating neurologic and cognitive deficits, the concept of infectious disease-associated encephalopathies is still under-investigated; knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, which may be distinct from those of encephalopathies of non-infectious cause, is still limited. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of encephalopathies associated with peripheral (sepsis, malaria, influenza, and COVID-19), emerging therapeutic strategies, and the role of neuroinflammation.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^117RRMEx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In COVID-19 infections, CRP levels that are minimally elevated (e.g. between 10 and 20 μg/mL) can be diagnostic of mild viral disease. Therapeutic considerations might focus on ways to control viral infectivity and replication using viral neutralization concepts (antibodies/vaccines and receptor blockers), or inhibiting viral-specific enzymes (e.g. remdesivir). COVID-19 patients with moderate elevations of CRP levels (e.g. > 20–40 μg/mL) may harbor some level of (reversible) tissue damage associated with the natural response to combating the viral disease. If these levels are measured relatively early in disease progression, before a cytokine storm response, these levels may suggest a confounding bacterial infection or more significant tissue involvement in disease. Therapeutic considerations may include, in addition to viral neutralization, the use of antimicrobials and immunomodulation using interferon therapies or biologic agents that can neutralize pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1, and IL-6 inhibitors). COVID-19 patients with significantly elevated CRP levels (e.g. > 100 μg/mL) more readily reflect advanced tissue damage and pathologies associated with cytokine storm, coagulation abnormalities, and multiple organ failure. Such high CRP levels would correlate with a life-threatening prognosis.

### C-reactive protein in intracerebral hemorrhage: time course, tissue localization, and prognosis [^113CiHVd]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the C-reactive protein (CRP) response after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and its relationship to outcome. We additionally characterized early brain localization of CRP.

Methods

In this prospective, multicenter, international, collaborative, longitudinal study with cross-sectional immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue, 223 patients (M/F: 132/91) were recruited during the 2010 calendar year. CRP was evaluated at admission (median 93 minutes from symptom onset), 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after sICH. Brains of 5 subjects with sICH were compared to brains of 2 aged controls without evidence of brain pathology and 7 patients with ischemic stroke. Plasma CRP was measured over 72 hours following sICH and its relationship to 30-day mortality and functional outcome at 30 days (Glasgow Outcome Scale) was determined. CRP immunostaining patterns were analyzed in samples of sICH autopsy brains.

Results

Plasma CRP increased over the 48 hours from admission and was significantly (p < 0.001) related to hematoma volume at later time points. The predictive utility of CRP for morbidity and mortality were maintained when adjusted for other risk factors and improved at 48 hours and 72 hours when compared with admission values. Although an early CRP localization was present in both ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions, an intense and diffuse neuropil staining was only present in sICH patients and particularly evident proximal to the hemorrhagic areas.

Conclusions

Plasma CRP production increases markedly over the 48 hours to 72 hours period following sICH and is related to outcome. CRP is also present in large amounts around the hemorrhagic lesion and within neurons and glia of patients who died within 12 hours of sICH.

### Consensus summary statement of the international multidisciplinary consensus conference on multimodality monitoring in neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^115CSFrD]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Inflammation and infection monitoring in neurocritical care — In SAH, comparison of neutrophil percentage in ventricular fluid in the first three days to other predictive scales suggests that it has good negative predictive value for patients who may develop delayed deterioration, but there is no evidence to support the use of WBC counts or indices of WBC to discriminate between infection and inflammatory changes in patients with EVDs. CRP and Pro-calcitonin are most frequently measured; while CRP may provide indirect confirmation of an infection or response to therapy, it does not reliably discriminate between bacterial meningitis from other forms of inflammation and has poor predictive value in SAH, ICH, or stroke, and Pro-calcitonin does not appear to be a useful monitoring technique to investigate infections in brain-injured patients.

### ASTCT consensus grading for cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity associated with immune effector cells [^115ZqRLa]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

ASTCT consensus — laboratory parameters are not included in the definition or grading of CRS; although C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely available, it is not specific for CRS and changes in CRP can lag behind clinical changes by at least 12 hours, so grading favors clinical observation while continued measurement of cytokines, CRP, ferritin, and other parameters is encouraged for future study.

### The usefulness of C-reactive protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for predicting the outcome in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis [^112MsrFE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

This was a retrospective observational cohort study performed at a university hospital. The study included a cohort of 184 consecutive cirrhotic patients hospitalized in a tertiary center from September 2011 to September 2012. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on liver biopsy or clinically when the patients had at least two of the following three criteria: an inhomogeneous hepatic surface with splenomegaly or portal hypertension on radiological findings; platelet count < 100,000/mm3 or variceal changes on endoscopy. The exclusion criteria were a previous diagnosis of HCC or extrahepatic malignancy and an elective admission to evaluate the suspicion of HCC. This study was approved by the Office of Human Research Protection Program, Catholic Medical Centre (CMC OHRP, reference number; OC13RISI0127) and the need for consent from participants was waived by the CMC OHRP. This study was also in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.

The main clinical events for hospitalization such as uncontrolled ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or other signs of hepatic deterioration were reviewed carefully and evaluated. When there was more than one main clinical event at admission, the criteria used to define the main cause of admission were the following: (a) Whenever variceal bleeding was coincident with other major complications, it was considered the main cause of admission, (b) In patients with hepatic encephalopathy and other events, the former was considered the main cause of admission, (c) All the types of infection were counted and analyzed even if it was a single present or co-exist with other clinical events.

At admission, patients routinely underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and X-ray of the chest and abdomen. Laboratory tests included blood chemistry and blood cell counts including CRP concentration and ascitic/pleural fluid cell counts. Serum CRP level was measured as high-sensitivity CRP by an immunoturbidimetric assay using the C-Reactive Protein, High Sensitivity reagent (Beckman Coulter, Inc. Fullerton, CA, USA; limit of detection, 0.08 mg/L). The NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. All the hospitalized patients were administered empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin) after initial laboratory test and physical examination, and the regimen was modified or stopped according to the results of the cultures or the infection.

### Ertapenem-induced encephalopathy in a patient with liver abscess and acute kidney injury [^114A5DPd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential

Prior to admission, the patient had a stable baseline functioning and did not report any cognitive impairment. They were taking felodipine as their sole medication. During the delirium workup, we conducted a comprehensive assessment to explore various potential. Possible differential diagnoses for the cause of his delirium include meningoencephalitis, status epilepticus, infection-induced delirium, acute psychosis, insomnia-induced psychosis and other medication-induced psychosis. A repeat imaging was performed to rule out worsening of the liver abscess but CT abdomen showed further improvement of liver abscess.

This involved reviewing the patient's medical history, conducting cognitive screenings and ordering laboratory tests to rule out underlying infections, metabolic imbalances. During this process, it was discovered that the patient had an overactive thyroid. The endocrine team provided guidance, and appropriate medication was initiated for the treatment of the thyroid condition. Unfortunately, despite this intervention, the patient did not show any improvement. We also considered the possibility of medication-related side effects. Despite thorough investigations, the exact cause of the delirium episode remained unclear. At the time of admission, the CRP level was 268 and the WBC count was 14, with inflammatory changes observed in the right chest on the X-ray. The patient required 2 L of supplemental oxygen. Two days later, the patient developed septic shock with a lactate level of 4.1. The CRP increased to 385, the WBC count rose to 16 and the eGFR dropped to 34. A CT scan revealed the presence of multiple liver abscesses.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19-related encephalopathy [^1143Nwjb]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Encephalopathy is emerging as a recurrent complication of COVID-19, yet the best approach to management and treatment remains unknown. We described five patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy, all of whom recovered following IVIg.

IVIg is an efficient anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment for a growing number of neurological disorders; however, its mode of action is complex and not yet fully understood. The pathophysiology underlying the diseases which respond to IVIg is highly heterogeneous, thus it is likely that IVIg acts on various disease-specific pathways.

In patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary involvement, treatment with IVIg led to a significant clinical improvement and concomitant reduction of serum inflammatory markers, observed as early as the first infusion day. Correspondingly, our patients showed a prompt and dramatic improvement of neurological manifestations following IVIg. Similar results have been achieved in six other patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy treated with high-dose corticosteroids. In our third case, steroid pulse therapy was ineffective, where subsequent IVIg was concomitant with clinical recovery. In support of our preliminary findings, IVIg led to improved neuropsychiatric symptoms in four COVID-19 patients with mixed central and peripheral neurological manifestations and to clinico-radiological recovery in a further patient with frontal status epilepticus and encephalopathy.

Clinical course and investigative findings observed in the present case series, including negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF, absence of significant elevation of CSF cells and protein levels, non-specific MRI findings, and the dramatic response to immunotherapy, suggest an inflammatory/immune-mediated pathogenesis rather than CNS viral invasion. An autoantibody-mediated mechanism is unlikely to explain CNS involvement, based on the brief temporal interval between CNS and infection-related symptom onset, negative testing for anti-neuronal antibodies, and the prompt and sustained response to IVIg. Cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation has been implicated in the underlying pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, and may have contributed to disease course in our patients. Except the third case, all patients suffered acute respiratory distress secondary to CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, case 3 is the only patient with previous cognitive impairment, a condition that possibly made her more susceptible to develop encephalopathy despite mild systemic inflammation, as in other reported geriatric patients. In patient 1 and 4, we observed a delay between the rise of inflammatory markers in serum and the onset/peak of neurological manifestations, possibly due to a delayed rise of CSF cytokines with respect to serum levels. Unfortunately, we were not able to measure CSF cytokines.

Inflammation severity and nutrition therapy outcome signal: Among patients with a high degree of severe inflammation — that is, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 100 mg/L — there was no beneficial effect of nutrition therapy on 30-day mortality, and successful management requires treatment of the underlying disease or condition as well as nutrition intervention.

### Infection-associated encephalopathies: their investigation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115Hziqh]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reduced level of consciousness is a common clinical finding in acutely sick patients. In the majority of cases a cause for the encephalopathy is readily identifiable, whilst in a minority the aetiology is more difficult to ascertain. Frequently the onset of encephalopathy is associated with, or follows, infection. The mechanisms through which infection leads to encephalopathy are diverse. They range from direct microbial invasion of the brain or its supporting structures, to remote, infection-triggered mechanisms such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Most common however, is the encephalopathy caused through a remote effect of systemic sepsis-septic encephalopathy. This article discusses the clinical presentation and underlying pathogeneses of the acute encephalopathies associated with infection, aiming to aid both their recognition and treatment.

### C-reactive protein as an effector molecule in COVID-19 pathogenesis [^111ZNSXL]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known as Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This disease can be asymptomatic or can affect multiple organ systems. Damage induced by the virus is related to dysfunctional activity of the immune system, but the activity of molecules such as C-reactive protein (CRP) as a factor capable of inducing an inflammatory status that may be involved in the severe evolution of the disease, has not been extensively evaluated. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to find articles related to Covid-19 immunity, inflammatory response, and CRP published from December 2019 to December 2020. High levels of CRP were found in patients with severe evolution of Covid-19 in which several organ systems were affected and in patients who died. CRP activates complement, induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces apoptosis which, together with the inflammatory status during the disease, can lead to a severe outcome. Several drugs can decrease the level or block the effect of CRP and might be useful in the treatment of Covid-19. From this review it is reasonable to conclude that CRP is a factor that can contribute to severe evolution of Covid-19 and that the use of drugs able to lower CRP levels or block its activity should be evaluated in randomized controlled clinical trials.

Neurological conditions are being more recognised in patients with COVID-19, with encephalopathy being the most prevalent problem. Posterior reversible encephalopathy is suspected to occur due to elevated blood pressure and overproduction of inflammatory markers, both of which have been reported in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Encephalopathy was the main presentation in this case, without respiratory dysfunction initially, and with imaging findings indicative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as an aetiology. Follow-up imaging showed resolution of the abnormal results with mental status returning to baseline upon discharge.

### Blood / brain biomarkers of inflammation after stroke and their association with outcome: from C-reactive protein to damage-associated molecular patterns [^115bsUXS]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke represents one of the most important causes of disability and death in developed countries. However, there is a lack of prognostic tools in clinical practice to monitor the neurological condition and predict the final outcome. Blood biomarkers have been proposed and studied in this indication; however, no biomarker is currently used in clinical practice. The stroke-related neuroinflammatory processes have been associated with a poor outcome in stroke, as well as with poststroke complications. In this review, we focus on the most studied blood biomarkers of this inflammatory processes, cytokines, and C-reactive protein, evaluating its association with outcome and complications in stroke through the literature, and performing a systematic review on the association of C-reactive protein and functional outcome after stroke. Globally, we identified uncertainty with regard to the association of the evaluated biomarkers with stroke outcome, with little added value on top of clinical predictors such as age or stroke severity, which makes its implementation unlikely in clinical practice for global outcome prediction. Regarding poststroke complications, despite being more practical scenarios in which to make medical decisions following a biomarker prediction, not many studies have been performed, although there are now some candidates for prediction of poststroke infections. Finally, as potential new candidates, we reviewed the pathophysiological actions of damage-associated molecular patterns as triggers of the neuroinflammatory cascade of stroke, and their possible use as biomarkers.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^115AZBjY]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, inflammation, as measured by high procalcitonin and CRP levels at admission, was associated with fewer days alive and free of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients, suggesting that inflammation plays an important role in delirium and coma in the ICU. Future studies are needed to elucidate further the inflammatory mechanisms of delirium and coma during critical illness.

### C-reactive protein concentrations during bacteraemia: a comparison between patients with and without liver dysfunction [^1177X3T3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the value of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations as a marker of sepsis in patients with biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction.

Design

A retrospective case-control comparison of serum CRP concentrations between patients with and those without liver dysfunction (prothrombin time over 18 s and serum bilirubin ≥ 20 micromol/l) during their first episode of bacteraemia.

Setting

The neurosciences and general adult intensive care units of a university teaching hospital.

Patients

Any patient from the above settings with a first episode of bacteraemia (first isolate of pathogenic bacteria from blood cultures) over a 3-year period.

Measurements and Results

After exclusions 126 first episodes of bacteraemia were identified, of which 33 were in patients with liver dysfunction. Serum CRP concentrations were significantly lower in patients with liver dysfunction (median 103 mg/l, IQR 29–204) than in those without (146 mg/l, 74, > 250).

Conclusions

Patients with biochemical evidence of liver disease generate significantly lower serum CRP concentrations during bacteraemia than patients without liver dysfunction. Serum CRP concentrations should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease to diagnose and monitor bacterial sepsis.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115Gemak]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds for inflammation — interpretation and use are as follows: CRP levels of 3.0–9.9 mg/L are consistent with mild inflammation, levels of 10–50 mg/L are consistent with moderate inflammation, and levels of > 50 mg/L are consistent with severe inflammation; these thresholds are provided to help support identification of individuals with inflammatory diseases and conditions, not to assess risk for development of disease. Serial CRP measures can be helpful when the status or contribution of inflammation is unclear in the setting of a chronic condition, and measurement of CRP trends can be helpful, because a single normal CRP value does not exclude the possible contribution of an inflammatory component; whenever possible, the opportunity to make use of CRP test results that have been ordered for other medical purposes is encouraged.

### Serum CRP as a prognostic biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis… [^115gNaDK]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that patients with ALS and elevated serum CRP levels progress more rapidly than do those with lower CRP levels and that this elevation may reflect a neuroinflammatory state potentially responsive to the immune regulators such as NP001. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis, the elevated CRP group had a significantly shorter survival compared with the normal CRP group. Moreover, the serum CRP level was significantly correlated with patient survival, showing that patients with ALS and elevated serum CRP levels at first evaluation had a significantly shorter survival compared with those with normal serum CRP levels. Similar results were found in an independent cohort obtained from a population-based registry of patients with ALS.

In particular, according to the hazard ratio evaluated in discovery and validation cohorts, for every 1-point increase in the serum CRP level, we detected an effect of 13% and 4%, respectively, on survival time in the patients with ALS evaluated in our study. CRP is associated with damaged fibers within senile plaques. 44 In our study, the significant correlation of serum CRP level with neurologic functional impairment and survival in patients with ALS in the early phase of the disease and without an active inflammatory process supports the hypothesis that the increment of CRP in the peripheral blood may be the mirror of the upregulation of the production of CRP in the central nervous system.

Recently, Lu et al45 showed that the cytokine IL-6 was strongly associated with CRP levels and was the only marker showing increasing expression toward end-stage disease in the longitudinal analysis. In a retrospective analysis, patients with Parkinson disease and elevated CRP levels at baseline had a significantly shortened survival compared with those with normal CRP levels. 46 Moreover, CRP has been associated with severity of functional impairment in other neuromuscular disorders.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, complicated by anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy [^115Yu2q6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Investigations and clinical examinations found the differential diagnoses to be cerebritis, encephalitis or PRES. CNS vasculitis could have been considered, although MRI findings are generally diffuse and irreversible. Metabolic encephalopathies can have similar presentations — but serum glucose, urea and electrolytes were normal. An EEG was not performed. If she had experienced persistent seizures or encephalopathy, then an EEG would have been indicated to exclude mimics or complications.

Cerebritis

In most cases, cerebritis progresses to a cerebral abscess by the time diagnosis is made, due to cerebral tissue necrosis. This is not in keeping with a radiological resolution of findings after 11 days. Autoimmune cerebritis is unlikely without encephalopathy and autoimmune diagnoses (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).

CNS infection

The patient had been neutropenic (secondary to myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy) and febrile with elevated CRP 133 at the time of the seizures occurring. The following laboratory investigations to locate a source of infection were normal and negative for pathogens; CSF culture and cytology, blood, urine and stool cultures, CSF viral PCR and serum beta-D-glucan. CTPA showed no evidence of respiratory tract infection and there were no skin lesions or rashes.

The CSF sample was obtained 2 days after the onset of seizures, showing normal cell counts and protein. In herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), 10% of CSF cell counts and 50% of CSF protein are normal within a week of illness.CSF PCR has high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (96%) in HSE when sampled at 48 hours and 10 days after symptom onset. The LP was not repeated at 10 days due to neurology and pathology having resolved and results would not change management. Furthermore, the patient and her family were keen to avoid unessential invasive procedures.

It is worth noting that intravenous antibiotics and antivirals were started 2 days prior to the LP and continued until after the symptoms and radiological findings had resolved. We cannot completely rule out CNS infection, but it would be less typical to see quick radiographic and clinical resolution.

### Bacterial translocation markers in liver cirrhosis [^112CGdZT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Infections are associated with increased mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and are a precipitating event in acute-on-chronic liver failure. The most common underlying mechanism of bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis is abnormal BT. BT disorder is also associated with an advanced stage of liver disease, a high inflammatory response, development of other complications of cirrhosis such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, variceal bleeding, and poor survival.

CRP and PCT are inexpensive surrogate markers and have been widely used for the diagnosis of infection and BT. However they are produced by the liver and their synthesis may be impaired in advanced liver failure. In addition, they lack specificity, as increased levels of these markers may not be indicative of BT disorder but of a latent bacterial infection. Infection is often difficult to diagnose and empiric antibiotic treatment is frequently prescribed. This carries the long-term risk of potentially increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance. Investigators showed that serum CRP and PCT have good diagnostic accuracy in discriminating patients with or without infection. However, there is controversy among studies regarding the clinically significant cutoff levels that may differentiate infected from non-infected cirrhotic patients, ranging from 29 to 59.4 mg/L and from 0.58 to 1.10 ng/mL for CRP and PCT, respectively. Hence, if these findings could be incorporated into clinical practice, empiric antibiotics should be administered in patients with high values but borderline documentation of infection and stopped in those with low values and no definitive evidence of infection.

### Erythromycin versus neomycin in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis: a randomized double-blind study [^115eQSsp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In relation to applicability, our sample was formed by subjects with more severe HE than in other studies (nine patients with HE grade 2, nine with grade 3 and two with grade 4), which is an important concern in HE trials. The option of using a new drug requires a close observation of these patients and the possibility of antibiotic switch in case of infections. Also of interest are the hospitalization duration as the study endpoint and its correlations with clinical and laboratory variables. Thus, the correlation of the number of in-hospital days with HE grade, IEH, GSC and CRP showed simple clinical aspects that could to estimate the time of HE recovery during which these patients are treated with antibiotics. Since the median in-hospital stay obtained in our trial was 5.6 days, very similar to the value found in an observational North American survey, our results would be reproducible in clinical practice.

The high correlation obtained between CRP levels and the total in-hospital days corroborates the impact of the systemic inflammatory status not only at the moment of hospital arrival, but also as an indicator of HE regression during the treatment with antibiotics. This finding is new and can be used to check the response to the treatment. Another study correlates the CRP levels with encephalopathy occurrence in cirrhotic patients, and many others have described the relevance of inflammation in HE neural physiopathology. Nevertheless, this is the first time that CRP levels are correlated with the hospitalization duration. The role of inflammatory cytokines in affecting the blood–brain barrier and increasing the ammonia diffusion in astrocytes was also well described by other authors. By associating these reports with our findings, we postulate that the CRP reduction must be a clinical target during antibiotic treatment in HE when the values obtained are high.

In contemporary practice, structural brain images may reveal atrophy patterns supportive of a particular neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

### Autoimmune and infectious encephalitis: development of a discriminative tool for early diagnosis and initiation of therapy [^112AXe7u]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal neurological deficits were more prevalent in IE compared to AE. While AE commonly presents with the typical triad of limbic encephalitis, consisting of cognitive deficits, epileptic seizures, and psychiatric disorders, focal deficits are less frequent. This may be due to the mesiotemporal pathology seen in many AE. The requirement for ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation was high in both patient subgroups. Some studies have linked these features to a poorer outcome. However, we did not observe a correlation with the overall outcome as measured by the mRS score. This unexpected result may have been influenced by a selection bias as multimorbid patients with severe encephalitis might not have been referred to intensive care in the first place.

Significant differences in laboratory parameters between AE and IE include CSF leukocyte count, as well as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), platelets, and sodium. In AE, reports have indicated either normal or only mildly elevated CSF leukocytes, with varying proposed cutoffs between 36 and 50 cells/µl to differentiate AE from IE. Lower serum sodium and platelets levels in IE compared to AE have been previously noted, possibly reflecting a more pronounced systemic reaction to infectious pathogens. These observations extend to clinical features such as headache and fever, which we found to be discriminative between the two conditions.

### Predictive value of C-reactive protein for the outcome after primary intracerebral hemorrhage [^116aAjUp]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) carries high morbidity and mortality rates. Several factors have been suggested as predicting the outcome. The value of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in predicting a poor outcome is unclear, and findings have been contradictory. In their population-based cohort, the authors tested whether, independent of confounding factors, elevated CRP levels on admission (< 24 hours after ictus) are associated with an unfavorable outcome.

Methods

The authors identified all patients who suffered primary ICH between 1993 and 2008 among the population of Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland, and from the laboratory records they extracted the CRP values at admission. Independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome (moderate disability or worse according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months) were tested by unconditional logistic regression in a model including all the well-established confounding factors and CRP on admission.

Results

Of 961 patients, 807 (84%) had CRP values available within 24 hours of admission, and multivariable analysis showed elevated CRP at that point to be associated with an unfavorable outcome (OR 1.41 per 10 mg/L [95% CI 1.09–1.81], p < 0.01), together with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.99 [95% CI 1.09–3.64], p < 0.05), age (1.06 per year [95% CI 1.04–1.08], p < 0.001), low Glasgow Coma Scale score (0.75 per unit [95% CI 0.67–0.84], p < 0.001), hematoma size (1.05 per mL [95% CI 1.03–1.07], p < 0.001), and the presence of an intraventricular hemorrhage (2.70 [95% CI 1.66–4.38], p < 0.001). Subcortical location predicted a favorable outcome (0.33 [95% CI 0.20–0.54], p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Elevated CRP on admission is an independent predictor of an unfavorable outcome and is only slightly associated with the clinical and radiological severity of the bleeding.

### Sepsis-associated encephalopathy and its differential diagnosis [^113cPYez]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, which is associated with increased mortality and is consistent with delirium but can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased in biomarkers of brain injury (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, S-100 beta-protein) and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination that can lead one to perform specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis. Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, at the same time avoiding neurotoxic drugs.

### Neurologic syndromes predict higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 [^1175kEsc]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present the largest inpatient cohort of SARS-CoV-2–infected patients to date, evaluating predictors of inpatient mortality as they relate to neurologic syndromes at presentation. The neurologic findings seen in this cohort were similar to other large cohort studies. A small but substantial subset of patients had associated neurologic presentations of sufficient severity to warrant imaging of the neuraxis. Although the majority had normal neuroimaging, the distinction between those with altered cognition or arousal and those exhibiting other neurologic signs and symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection (neuro-COVID-19 complex) appears to be important.

The etiology of altered mentation in COVID-19 is not clear. In this study, there was an association between altered mentation and hypotension, renal impairment as demonstrated by elevated BUN and creatinine, disturbed coagulation as evidenced by elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged INR and reduced platelet counts, and increased inflammation as evidenced by elevated levels of procalcitonin. These biomarker abnormalities are associated with multiorgan system failure and more severe SARS-CoV-2 illness. These patients were less likely to have traditional symptoms such as fever or decreased oxygen saturation. It is unclear whether these findings are exclusive to COVID-19 infection. Other studies have shown that delirium is a predictor for increased inpatient mortality irrespective of underlying diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients. Even when controlling for biomarker abnormalities, patients with impaired cognition or arousal without abnormal neuroimaging findings exhibited an increased risk of inpatient mortality, suggesting that other yet-to-be determined mechanisms may be at play. Irrespective of the etiologic factors, such neurologic presentations can be subtle but important indications of more severe SARS-CoV-2 illness and should be taken seriously in hospital emergency departments. While other biomarker findings such as hypotension, D-dimer, coagulopathy, and renal failure may be more predictive of illness severity, and mortality, neurologic syndromes portend a higher risk of mortality, and can be easily assessed early in a patient encounter. The biomarkers we found to be most correlative with poor outcome and potentially modifiable such as BUN, INR, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, and CRP could serve as potential targets for future research for treatments or management paradigms.

### Clozapine-induced elevated C-reactive protein and fever mimic infection [^11556kMk]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Clozapine-induced fever has been reported frequently, but clozapine-induced elevated serum C-reactive protein (S-CRP) over 100 mg/L with early onset, without associated myocarditis, has not been reported in the literature. In this case report, we present a case of an 80-year-old Slovenian female with dementia and psychotic symptoms who developed elevated S-CRP (122 mg/L) and fever (38.2 °C) on the seventh day with 25 mg of clozapine daily, which improved after clozapine discontinuation. The patient did not have symptoms and signs of infection. This case report can be used to remind clinicians of keeping in mind the potential of clozapine associated with very high elevated S-CRP with fever, which can be easily confused with more serious conditions.

### Low plasma C-reactive protein level as an early diagnostic tool for heatstroke vs central nervous system-associated infection in the ED [^111t7YFQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purposes

Heatstroke (HS) is a life-threatening condition, manifested by systemic inflammation and multiorgan failure. Rapid recognition and treatment are life saving. We report a laboratory-oriented characterization of HS by low plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level and propose its usefulness in distinguishing this type of hyperpyrexia from central nervous system-associated high core temperature.

Methods

After institutional review board approval, records of patients admitted to general intensive care unit between August 2008 and September 2011 with core temperature 39.0°C or higher due to HS or meningoencephalitis (ME) were reviewed. Patients' demographics, CRP on admission and 24 to 48 hours later, serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, platelets count, international normalized ratio, alanine transaminase, serum pH, and lactate levels were retrieved.

Results

Thirty-six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit with high core temperature: 19 patients, aged 21 to 85 years, had HS; 17 individuals, aged 22 to 81 years, had ME. None of the HS individuals had infection. Twelve HS patients were previously healthy; in 13 patients, the event occurred postexercise. Mean admission CRP levels was 2.1 ± 3.3 mg/L in the HS group compared with 129 ± 84 mg/L in the ME patients (P < .0001); mean 24- to 48-hour CRP levels were 14.6 ± 16.8 vs 139 ± 98 mg/L, respectively (P < .0001). There were no clinically significant differences between the groups regarding laboratory parameters indicative of end-organ damage. Six HS patients underwent computed tomography and/or lumbar puncture before starting intensive cooling, due to misdiagnosis; 5 of them died subsequently.

Conclusions

Low serum CRP levels characterize non-central nervous system-associated HS. This available laboratory test could identify noninfectious hyperthermic patients upon admission, saving precious time until treatment and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests.

### Long-term outcome of acute encephalitis of unknown aetiology in adults [^113oGFsk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is caused by a variety of conditions, including infections of the brain by a wide range of pathogens. A substantial number of cases of encephalitis defy all attempts at identifying a specific cause. Little is known about the long-term prognosis in patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology, which complicates their management during the acute illness. To learn more about the prognosis of patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology, patients in whom no aetiology could be identified were examined in a large, single-centre encephalitis cohort. In addition to analysing the clinical data of the acute illness, surviving patients were assessed by telephone interview a minimum of 2 years after the acute illness by applying a standardized test battery. Of the patients with encephalitis who qualified for inclusion (n = 203), 39 patients (19.2%) had encephalitis of unknown aetiology. The case fatality in these patients was 12.8%. Among the survivors, 53% suffered from various neurological sequelae, most often attention and sensory deficits. Among the features at presentation that were associated with adverse outcome were older age, increased C-reactive protein, coma and a high percentage of polymorphonuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. In conclusion, the outcome in an unselected cohort of patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology was marked by substantial case fatality and by long-term neurological deficits in approximately one-half of the surviving patients. Certain features on admission predicted an unfavourable outcome.

### Evaluation of C-reactive protein measurement for assessing the risk and prognosis in ischemic stroke: a statement for health care professionals from the CRP pooling project members [^116zf3XL]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Several studies have shown, in different populations, that modest elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in the range seen in apparently healthy individuals is a strong predictor of future vascular events. Elevated plasma CRP concentrations are also associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events and an increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke patients. These epidemiological and clinical observations suggest that determination of plasma CRP concentrations could be used as an adjunct for risk assessment in primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease and be of prognostic value. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for CRP as an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events in at-risk individuals and ischemic stroke patients and to consider its usefulness in evaluating prognosis after stroke.

Summary Of Review

CRP fulfils most of the requirements of a new risk and prognostic predictor, but several issues await further confirmation and clarification before this marker can be included in the routine evaluation of stroke patients and subjects at risk for cerebrovascular disease. Potentially important associations have been established between elevated plasma CRP concentrations and increased efficacy of established therapies, particularly lipid-lowering therapy with statins.

Conclusions

At present, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend measurement of CRP in the routine evaluation of cerebrovascular disease risk in primary prevention, because there is insufficient evidence as to whether early detection, or intervention based on detection, improves health outcomes, although shared risk of cardiovascular disease indicates this may be of value. In secondary prevention of stroke, elevated CRP adds to existing prognostic markers, but it remains to be established whether specific therapeutic options can be derived from this.

### C-reactive protein and bacterial infection in cirrhosis [^111WDDuV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. In about 30% of patients, infections are present at admission or develop during hospitalization. Moreover, bacterial infections are known to be a potential trigger factor for many complications of cirrhosis, including variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure and impairment in hemostasis.

Sixty percent of bacterial infections are community acquired, where the causative organisms are Gram negative bacilli (GNB) in about 60% (especially Escherichia coli) and Gram positive cocci (GPC) in about 30–35%, and forty percent are nosocomial infections, with 60% of GPC and 30% GNB, as result of the use of therapeutic procedures and previous antibiotic therapy. The most frequent infections are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infections, pneumonia, cellulitis and bacteremia.

A major problem is that "traditional" culture methods under diagnose sepsis in these patients, only being positive in 50–70% of cases, and culture methods take time; therefore surrogate markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may be useful to identify an infection early on.

Patients with cirrhosis have an increased risk to develop bacterial infection, sepsis, sepsis-induced organ failure and sepsis-related death; on the other hand, infections significantly increase the mortality rate, which reaches 38%. These patients are twice as likely to die from sepsis than individuals without cirrhosis. Hospital mortality with septic shock may exceed 70%, related to the development of multiorgan failure. In particular, renal failure occurs in 33% of patients with cirrhosis who have SBP and in 27% of those with sepsis unrelated to SBP: this is initially the hepatorenal syndrome, which in presence of shock rapidly develops into ischemic acute tubular necrosis.

### Acute cerebrovascular disease following COVID-19: a single center, retrospective, observational study [^112DDYqm]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inflammation has been increasingly recognised as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of CVDsand involved in the acute intravascular events triggered by the interruption of the blood supply. Several studies have reported the elevated levels of CRPs and D-dimer in patients with the coexistence of COVID-19. A study done in China with 191 patients included found that D-dimer greater than 1 µg/mL has an association with mortality in patients of COVID-19. Meanwhile, acute inflammation caused by COVID-19 is prone to be followed by a hypercoagulable state due to the increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokinesand serum inflammatory factors (eg, interleukin and CRP) responsible for early molecular events triggered by coagulation abnormalities. Compared with the patients without CVD, patients with CVD had a higher blood CRP level. Ten out of 11 patients with both CVD and COVID-19 had extremely high levels of D-dimer (median level of 6.9), by contrast, D-dimer of patients without CVD was at a lower level (median level of 0.5). According to the laboratory test index of blood, patients of COVID-19 with CVD had more severe inflammatory infection and were in a state of high coagulation. The significantly increased inflammatory response could be one of the causes of abnormal blood coagulation function in early stage and could be one of the reasons of onset of CVD.

The average time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to onset of CVD was about 12 days. Neurological injury has been confirmed in the infection of other coronaviruses such as in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MER-CoV). A study reported that 28 days after onset of SARS-CoV infection, patients experienced central nervous symptoms. A four-patient case report showed patients developed neuromuscular diseases approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS. Another three-patient case report showed brain MRI revealed significant changes characterised by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes after 25–28 days' onset of MER-CoV. Thus, in early stages, making a diagnosis according to clinical symptoms and lab tests and taking measures for anti-inflammatory treatment as early as possible may arrest the growth of COVID-19. It may be one way to reduce the risk of CVD.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy in cytokine release syndrome following immunotherapy or cellular therapies? [^113sGoLB]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation of CRS

In the clinical setting, CRS presents itself with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms, to severe life-threatening complications with onset within minutes to hours, depending on the inducing agent and the immune system activation. Mild symptoms, non-specific of CRS, include fever, fatigue, headache, rash, arthralgia and myalgia. Severe symptoms are characterized by high fever exceeding 40°C with multiorgan system failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The main organ systems involved are respiratory (ranging from symptoms such as tachypnea, dyspnea, cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe impairment of ventilation and oxygenation requiring sedation, intubation of the airway and mechanical ventilation); cardiac (cardiac failure with pulmonary edema); renal (AKI/failure); hepatic failure and neurological (confusion, aphasia, hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, seizures and coma).

Neurotoxicity is the second most common adverse event after CAR-T cell therapy being named 'CAR T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome' (CRES). CRES does not seem to be directly related to CRS since is currently considered an independent event, as the two complications have been described as being separate time events in some studies. Common laboratory abnormalities in patients with CRS include cytopenias, elevated creatinine and liver enzymes, deranged coagulation parameters and a high CRP.

In rare cases, CRS can overlap with clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities that resemble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). In these cases, the main cytokines observed to play an important role are represented by IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-10, which are in accordance with classic CRS. Patients with CRS-associated HLH display the typical clinical and laboratory findings of HLH/MAS such as high fevers, splenomegaly, highly elevated ferritin levels, coagulopathy and hypertriglyceridemia.

After treatment with blinatumomab in B-cell ALL, almost 25% of CRS patients had a diagnosis of HLH.

Moreover, because of the overlap in clinical symptoms between CRS and sepsis and because the population of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy or T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies is at higher risk of both CRS and sepsis, a thorough differential diagnosis has to be made, with active sepsis screening (table 2).

### Diagnostic performance of procalcitonin for bacterial infection in severe alcoholic hepatitis Compared with C-reactive protein [^112SyvKn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption has catastrophic consequences, with an estimated 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) globally in 2016 attributed to harmful alcohol use, including 607,000 deaths from alcohol-attributable liver diseases. Alcoholic liver disease encompasses a spectrum of conditions, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Patients with underlying alcoholic liver disease who continue heavy drinking may develop sudden-onset jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, and other signs of liver failure, known as alcoholic hepatitis. According to prospective studies, the patients of alcoholic hepatitis with modified discriminant function ≥ 32 showed a poor prognosis as high mortality in a month as 35–50%. Therefore, this condition is defined as severe alcoholic hepatitis. Steroid therapy is currently the only effective medical treatment that reduces 28-day mortality based on clinical trials and meta-analyses in severe hepatitis. Meanwhile, alcohol-induced derangement of the immune system triggers an extended inflammatory response, resulting in immune exhaustion and dysregulated compensatory anti-inflammatory pathway. Therefore, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis are susceptible to bacterial infections, with a known prevalence of 26–37%. Steroid therapy induces immune suppression, making severe infection or sepsis a contraindication. Therefore, it is crucial to identify evidence of infection upon admission.

However, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis often exhibit clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis, making it challenging to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious conditions. Culture is a specific diagnostic tool for bacterial infection, but it requires several days to obtain results. Therefore, clinicians frequently rely on early inflammatory biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) to detect sepsis in alcoholic hepatitis. While CRP is a useful acute phase protein that reflects the severity of inflammation, its levels can increase not only in infectious conditions but also in non-infectious conditions.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a precursor of calcitonin, and its concentration significantly increases in severe bacterial and fungal infections. However, it only shows a slight elevation in non-infectious inflammation, trauma, and malignancy, which makes it a valuable diagnostic biomarker for acute severe infections. However, there are limited studies that have investigated the comparative diagnostic capacity of PCT and CRP in severe alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, our intention is to compare the effectiveness of PCT and CRP in detecting bacterial infections in severe alcoholic hepatitis through a prospectively enrolled multicenter clinical trial.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^11133xf2]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infections in status epilepticus (SE) patients result in severe morbidity making early diagnosis crucial. As SE may lead to inflammatory reaction, the value of acute phase proteins and white blood cells (WBC) for diagnosis of infections during SE may be important. We examined the reliability of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and WBC for diagnosis of infections during SE.

Methods

All consecutive SE patients treated in the ICU from 2005 to 2009 were included. Clinical and microbiological records, and measurements of CRP and WBC during SE were analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed for additional PCT measurements in the first 48 hours of SE.

Results

A total of 22.5% of 160 consecutive SE patients had infections during SE. Single levels of CRP and WBC had no association with the presence of infections. Their linear changes over the first three days after SE onset were significantly associated with the presence of infections (P = 0.0012 for CRP, P = 0.0137 for WBC). Levels of PCT were available for 31 patients and did not differ significantly in patients with and without infections. Sensitivity of PCT and CRP was high (94% and 83%) and the negative predictive value of CRP increased over the first three days to 97%. Specificity was low, without improvement for different cut-offs.

Conclusions

Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, while their linear changes over time significantly correlate with the presence of infections. In addition, low levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^115Deqf7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Recent studies in this important area of critical care have focused on elucidating risk factors of delirium and developing strategies to reduce the prevalence and duration of delirium, but little work has been done to determine the mechanisms causing delirium in critically ill patients.

Present theories regarding the pathogenesis of delirium postulate a role for neurotransmitter imbalances (dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and serotonin), amino acids perturbations, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Studies have shown that higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 are associated with a greater incidence of delirium in postoperative hip surgery patients. These biomarkers may be general measures of complex inflammatory processes that promote delirium, or they may directly contribute to brain dysfunction. CRP, for example, can incite the formation of reactive oxygen species, causing disruption of the blood brain barrier and resultant neuronal dysfunction, which may manifest as delirium. Procalcitonin has recently gained popularity as an early marker for sepsis, though no study to our knowledge has examined the role of this or other inflammatory biomarkers in delirium in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients.

The primary aim of our prospective cohort study was to test the hypothesis that systemic inflammation, as measured by the inflammatory biomarkers procalcitonin and CRP, is associated with a longer duration of brain dysfunction in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^114hxduM]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infection rate of patients with status epilepticus (SE) is high and associated with increased morbidity, need for treatment escalation, prolonged hospital stay and additional resource utilization. SE patients are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the need for mechanical ventilation during their state of altered consciousness. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of hospital-acquired infections during SE is crucial.

Since its identification in 1930, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been studied as a screening device for inflammation, a marker for disease activity, and as a diagnostic adjunct as values of CRP may reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury. Like many acute phase proteins, CRP is normally present in trace levels in serum but increases rapidly and dramatically in response to a variety of infectious or inflammatory conditions. With the availability of rapid or bedside tests, determining its diagnostic value is of increasing importance.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a pre-pro-peptide precursor of the thyroid hormone calcitonin. Circulating levels of the PCT can rise several thousand times above normal under various inflammatory conditions, but most notably if caused by bacterial infections. Therefore, CRP and PCT may be promising markers for rapid detection of infectious complications during SE in the intensive care unit (ICU).

However, SE itself may lead to systemic inflammatory reaction with an increase of cytokines in serum during or immediately after epileptic seizures. Therefore, epileptic activity may also lead to an increase of CRP, PCT and white blood cells (WBC) without the presence of infections and thus reduce the reliability of these biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of infectious complications during SE.

The aim of this study was to examine whether levels of serum CRP, PCT and WBC are reliable indicators for the diagnosis of infectious complications during SE.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^1123M2Jv]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

There are several strengths and limitations in our study. First, this pilot investigation, which evaluated 87 patients, may lack adequate statistical power to detect some clinically important associations. Furthermore, the limited number of patients prevented us from studying potential differences in various subgroups such as surgical versus medical ICU patients; for example, some data suggest that post-surgical patients have elevated levels of procalcitonin dependent on the nature and extent of surgery. Despite these limitations, we were able to show associations between procalcitonin and CRP with DCFDs, providing a basis for studying the role of inflammation in delirium and coma in the ICU. Second, because we studied only baseline procalcitonin and CRP levels, we were unable to assess whether changes in these inflammatory markers over time are associated with the resolution or persistence of brain dysfunction. Third, because of our small sample size, only a limited number of covariates could be included in our regression models; the inclusion of additional potential confounders would have increased the possibility of obtaining unreliable results due to overfitting. We did, however, adjust for sepsis, which represents a major risk factor. Furthermore, our results are consistent with studies that have shown an association of CRP with delirium in non-ICU cohorts, delirium following stroke and sepsis, and delirium in one small study of 32 ICU patients, which did not adjust for confounders. Additionally, we found that among septic patients, higher baseline CRP levels were associated with a greater duration of renal dysfunction, which is in concordance with a previous study by Lobo et al. that showed that increased admission CRP was proportional to days of renal support therapy. Fourth, our chosen outcome of delirium/coma-free days (representing the days alive without delirium or coma) can be influenced by death, which in turn may be dependent on other organ dysfunctions. We assessed the role of both procalcitonin and CRP in non-brain organ dysfunctions and survival and found little evidence that the observed associations between the biomarkers and delirium/coma-free days were driven by a relationship with survival. In fact, there were no associations between the biomarkers and survival in our study. Finally, we assessed patients only once a day for delirium, and patients who were CAM-ICU negative were considered to be "free of brain dysfunction" for the entire day. Given that delirium is a fluctuating state of mental status, it is possible that some patients developed delirium later in the day and were missed in our study.

### Effect of therapeutic hypothermia on C-reactive protein levels in patients with perinatal asphyxia [^117L6jwu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the changes in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during therapeutic hypothermia.

Study Design

Between January 2011 and June 2013, 133 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy patients being followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit of Dr. Sami Ulus Maternity and Children's Hospital are prospectively evaluated. Group 1; patients that received therapeutic hypothermia (n = 74) and group 2; patients that did not required therapeutic hypothermia (n = 59). All the patients underwent serial complete blood cell count and CRP assessments; blood cultures were obtained from all the cases at the time of admission and when CRP levels were elevated.

Results

Positive blood cultures were encountered in five cases (6.7%) in group 1 while no blood culture-proven septicemia was encountered in group 2. The CRP levels elevated gradually reaching a peak level on the 4th day and then decreased during the therapeutic hypothermia in patients with no blood culture-proven septicemia in group 1. The CRP levels showed statistically significant changes reaching a peak level on the 7th day in patients with blood culture-proven septicemia in group 2. Also, the CRP levels showed no alteration with time in group 2.

Conclusion

Therapeutic hypothermia itself might be associated with CRP elevation rather than an actual infection.

### C-reactive protein levels after cardiac arrest in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia [^113Bg528]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

Prognostication of outcome after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. We assessed the prognostic value of daily blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a cheap and widely available inflammatory biomarker, after CA.

Methods

We reviewed the data of all patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) after CA between January 2009 and December 2011 and who survived for at least 24h. We collected demographic data, CA characteristics (initial rhythm; location of arrest; time to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC]), occurrence of infection, ICU survival and neurological outcome at three months (good = cerebral performance category [CPC] 1–2; poor = CPC 3–5). CRP levels were measured daily from admission to day 3.

Results

A total of 130 patients were admitted after successful resuscitation from CA and survived more than 24h; 76 patients (58%) developed an infection and overall mortality was 56%. CRP levels increased from admission to day 3. CRP levels were higher in in-hospital than in out-of-hospital CA, especially on admission and day 1 (44.1 vs. 2.1 mgL(-1) and 74.5 vs. 29.5 mgL(-1), respectively; p < 0.001), and in patients with non-shockable than in those with shockable rhythms. In a logistic regression model, high CRP levels on admission were independently associated with poor neurological outcome at 3 months.

Conclusion

CRP levels increase in the days following successful resuscitation of CA. Higher CRP levels in patients with in-hospital CA, non-shockable rhythms and infection, suggest a greater inflammatory response in these patients. High CRP levels on admission may identify patients at high-risk of poor outcome and could be a target for future therapies.

### Association of plasma C-reactive protein levels with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^116CnnPT]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) participates in the systemic response to inflammation. Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between plasma CRP and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We measured plasma CRP in 203 subjects with AD, 58 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 117 normal aging subjects and administered annual Mini-Mental State Examinations (MMSE) during a 3-year follow-up period to investigate CRP's relationship with diagnosis and progression of cognitive decline. Adjusted for age, sex, and education, subjects with AD had significantly lower levels of plasma CRP than subjects with MCI and normal aging. However, there was no significant association between plasma CRP at baseline and subsequent cognitive decline as assessed by longitudinal changes in MMSE score. Our results support previous reports of reduced levels of plasma CRP in AD and indicate its potential utility as a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.

### High levels of serum C-reactive protein are associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality, but not dementia, in the oldest-old: results from the 90 + study [^11269Yoh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate whether high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum are associated with greater risk of all-cause dementia or mortality in the oldest-old.

Design

Prospective.

Setting

Research clinic and in-home visits.

Participants

Population-based sample of adults (N = 227; aged 93.9 ± 2.8) from The 90+ Study, a longitudinal cohort study of people aged 90 and older.

Measurements

CRP levels were divided into three groups according to the assay detection limit: undetectable (< 0.5 mg/dL), detectable (0.5–0.7 mg/dL), and elevated (≥ 0.8 mg/dL). Neurological examination was used to determine dementia diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox regression, and results were stratified according to and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype.

Results

Subjects with detectable CRP levels had significantly greater risk of mortality (HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0–2.9), but not dementia (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.6–2.1), 0.4 to 4.5 years later than subjects with undetectable CRP. The highest relative risk for dementia and mortality was in APOE4 carriers with detectable CRP (dementia HR = 4.5, 95% CI = 0.9–23.3; mortality HR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.0–30.7).

Conclusion

High levels of CRP are associated with greater risk of mortality in people aged 90 and older, particularly in APOE4 carriers. There was a trend toward greater risk of dementia in APOE4 carriers with high CRP levels, although this relationship did not reach significance. High levels of CRP in the oldest-old represent a risk factor for negative outcomes.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^115E8bEe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The interplay among acute-phase proteins, infections and outcomes in patients with SE may be elucidated by recent findings, focusing on the interrelationships of systemic inflammatory reactions and epileptic activity. During acute inflammation, cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are released, which subsequently induce acute-phase responses. There is a growing body of evidence for the value of acute-phase proteins to predict mortality in the early phase of diseases in neurocritically ill patients.

Serum albumin, a negative acute-phase protein, has been shown to decrease by about 20% in inflammatory states. Low serum albumin has been identified as a predictor of death in acute ischemic stroke, underscoring the impact of acute inflammatory reactions in critically ill patients. The results of our univariable comparisons between survivors and non-survivors in the present study confirm our previous findings that low serum albumin is a predictor of mortality in SE. However, PCT was not included in our prior study. In our current multivariable model, including albumin, CRP, and PCT serum levels, albumin did not remain an independent predictor of death and a GOS of 1–3; these results are most likely explained by the fact that in our current multivariable model PCT was added as a new predictor, which overpowered the predictive value of albumin and CRP serum levels.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^113TTsh1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the reliability of CRP, WBC and PCT for the diagnosis of infections in patients with SE. Of note, the knowledge about systemic inflammatory reactions with elevated cytokine serum levels during SE is increasing, accelerating the uncertainty for the clinicians about the use of acute phase proteins for the diagnosis of infections in SE. Numerous studies have identified different cut-off levels for CRP, PCT and WBC for the presence of infections in ICU patients but a consensus was not found.

In our study, CRP demonstrated a high negative predictive value for infections in patients with SE. In addition, its sensitivity steadily increased from Day 1 to Day 3 of SE. However, specificity and positive predictive value were low, making it a poor predictor for the presence of infections during SE. However, the cut-off chosen for CRP (< 10 mg/L) is low and might have led to high sensitivity and low specificity. Single values of WBC counts were insufficient to either rule in or rule out the presence of infections during SE. ROC curves were not performed, as linear changes of CRP and WBC levels over time were highly significant with the presence of infections and, as mentioned above, many previous studies have found numerous cut-off values by focusing on infection in ICU patients, making it complex and obscure for the clinicians to rely on multiple recommendations. Therefore, we have focused on the change of biomarker levels over time. In our study population, the linear changes with time for both CRP and WBC levels were significantly associated with the diagnosis of infections, suggesting that both parameters are useful when evaluating their time course rather than single values. For the presented odds ratios, it has to be taken into account that they are given for each change of 1 mg/L of CRP and 10⁹/L for WBC, respectively. This finding might be reflected by the increasing specificity on day 3 of SE in comparison to day 1.

### Association of chronic low-grade inflammation with risk of Alzheimer disease in apoE4 carriers [^114crryZ]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4 [OMIM]) allele is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). However, not all ApoE4 carriers develop AD, even among those older than 90 years. It is likely that a complex interaction of genetic vulnerabilities with environmental risk factors lead to AD and identifying such factors could be beneficial for the prevention of AD. One such interacting factor could be sustained or frequent systemic inflammations, as infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract systems are common in elderly individuals.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an immune system response to toxins or injuries in systemic inflammation, while CRP levels increase with age. Although multiple AD-related genes are associated with the level of CRP, the association between blood CRP levels and risk of AD are not conclusive in the literature, with studies showing both low and high levels of CRP in patients with AD. Since AD is a chronic disease characterized by neurodegeneration in the brain, chronic low-grade inflammation, either sustained or frequently episodic, may be a risk factor for AD. However, most studies to date rely on one-time measurements of CRP and thus do not distinguish between a condition of acute inflammatory reaction followed by recovery and a condition of chronic inflammation without complete recovery or frequent episodic inflammation. Since preclinical studies suggest that CRP plays a role in ApoE4 leading to AD, we thus hypothesized that the association of chronic elevated CRP levels with the risk of AD would be different across ApoE genotypes. This hypothesis prompted our study that includes longitudinal measures of high levels of CRP as a biomarker of chronic low-grade inflammation to determine the risk for development of AD.

The Framingham Heart Study is a large population-based, multigeneration cohort with long and intensive follow-up that includes multiple measurements of serum CRP taken during a 2-decade period. The purpose of this study was to determine if and how peripheral CRP levels are associated with the onset of AD in the context of ApoE genotypes. Included in this study is the Framingham Heart Study Generation 2 cohort enrolled in 1971, who had up to 3 CRP measurements between 1979 and 2001. Chronic low-grade inflammation was defined as meeting specified cutoff levels of plasma CRP in at least 2 measurements taken years apart. We examined the association between chronic low-grade inflammation, and risk of a diagnosis of dementia, including AD, and brain volumes, stratified by ApoE genotype.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^1177PszS]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Increasing levels of serum CRP have been described to indicate growing intracerebral hematomas and mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, and to predict poor neurofunctional outcome and death in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, external validation of these finding with prospective studies are pending, and the predictive value of CRP for outcome after ischemic stroke remains controversial, as other studies did not confirm these associations. The evidence for the predictive value of CRP for outcome in SE patients has been scarce so far and is mostly restricted to a few studies in children. The present study demonstrates that in adult patients suffering from SE, CRP does not reliably predict death, a GOS of 1–3, or infectious complications.

PCT has been reported as a biomarker for outcome in patients with ischemic strokes and postanoxic encephalopathy. However, the predictive value for outcome in SE patients has not been evaluated. The fact that in our study, increasing PCT serum levels were not significantly associated with the emergence of infections during SE but with mortality, indicates that the acute-phase response from PCT, which is likely to be triggered by prolonged seizures, overpowers the PCT response induced by infection. This finding is supported by previous investigations of the interplay of immunological reactions during epileptic activity. We cannot exclude that in some cases infections were present but not detected and that the limited sample size may have influenced our results. However, the latter seems unlikely, as the confidence intervals in our results are small. The possible promoting influence of specific underlying acute etiologies, including ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury on increasing PCT serum levels in our study was addressed by adjusting for acute etiologies of SE in our multivariable model including these entities. As there is a large overlap of low measurements of PCT between survivors and non-survivors, our results do not indicate that a lower PCT level has a predictive value for outcome.

### C-reactive protein in the very early phase of acute ischemic stroke: association with poor outcome and death [^112tRaWu]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are found in up to three quarters of patients with ischemic stroke. Increases in CRP may reflect a systemic inflammatory response following ischemic stroke, the extent of tissue injury, or concurrent infections. Moreover, in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, CRP increased secondary brain damage through activation of the complement system.

Several studies have assessed the value of CRP in the very early phase of stroke as a prognostic factor of functional outcome. These studies were either small, included a selected group of patients, or tested only the relation between CRP and mortality instead of functional outcome. The findings were inconclusive as some found a positive association, but others not.

Verification of the role of CRP as an early prognostic factor of functional outcome after ischemic stroke may be of clinical importance, because it is an easily-measured and readily available inflammatory marker. The aim of our study was therefore to determine the prognostic value of CRP measured in the very early phase of ischemic stroke for poor functional outcome and death in a large sample of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Differences in PCT levels between VAE and viral pneumonia patients

To compare the differences in PCT levels between VAE and viral pneumonia patients, 36 children with viral pneumonia but without encephalopathy were recruited as the control group. The clinical characteristics of sex and age were not significantly different between the two groups. The platelet count in the VAE group was lower (80.00 [IQR, 23.00–194.00]) than that in the viral pneumonia group (281.50 [IQR, 238.00–395.00]) (p = 0.000). The CRP level in the VAE group was higher (5.59 [IQR, 1.80–15.41]) than that in the viral pneumonia group (1.40 [IQR, 0.44–5.55]) (p = 0.003). The serum PCT level was higher in the VAE group (25.30 [IQR, 1.01–76.31]) than in the viral pneumonia group (0.09 [IQR, 0.05–0.20]) (p = 0.000). The WBC count was not significantly different between the two groups (p > 0.05) (Table 2).

We enrolled 135 adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), including 83% living with HIV. Participants with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 40mg/L had 3 times higher odds of an 8-week modified Rankin scale ≥ 4 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.78; 95% CI: 1.28–6.04; p = 0.010). CRP is a viable prognostic biomarker in TBM.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, and outcome after ischemic stroke… [^111CCAD3]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

The proportion of patients with hs-CRP levels in the highest quartile increased markedly from mild to moderate to severe stroke. Median follow-up was 4. 0 years. Outcomes included 80 recurrent strokes, 18 MIs, 53 vascular deaths, and 159 deaths. Unadjusted HRs for the association of hs-CRP and Lp-PLA2 with several outcomes across quartiles of these markers are given in Table 3. The cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke among individuals in the highest quartile of hs-CRP was
17. 9% compared with a risk of 20. 4% among those in the lowest quartile. During approximately 4 years of follow-up, hs-CRP levels were associated with increased mortality but not recurrent stroke or combined ischemic events.

Levels of Lp-PLA2, however, were a stronger predictor of recurrent stroke risk than mortality in this population, and they also predicted recurrent stroke, MI, and vascular death. An hs-CRP level greater than 10. 1 mg/L measured within 72 hours of stroke predicted increased mortality during follow-up of up to 4 years. 33 Other researchers34 found that the measurement of CRP at 24 or 48 hours, but not at hospital admission, predicted outcome. An hs-CRP level greater than 15 mg/L at hospital discharge was significantly associated with the occurrence of a new vascular event or death at 1 year in another study, 35 with an HR of 9.
4. Other investigators36 measured hs-CRP levels at least 3 months after a first ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and found that patients in the highest quintile had significantly increased risk of subsequent stroke or MI.

Relatively few studies have examined hs-CRP in relation to recurrent stroke independent of an effect on mortality, and those have been limited to specific subtypes of stroke and hospitalized recurrences. 37, 38 Further limitations in these studies include a hospital-based design and post hoc determination of threshold levels. The present data provide evidence that hs-CRP predicts mortality but not recurrent stroke.

### Elevated C-reactive protein levels are associated with prevalent dementia in the oldest-old [^116uZFHT]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that is increased in the brain and serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with increased risk of developing dementia. Inflammation increases with age, and the number of people reaching age 90 years and older is growing, making the association between inflammation and dementia increasingly relevant. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined whether high levels of serum CRP are associated with increased odds of prevalent dementia in the oldest-old.

Methods

Serum CRP levels of 305 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 94.3 ± 2.9 years) from the 90+ Study, a longitudinal cohort study of people aged 90 years and older, were evaluated with respect to all-cause dementia. Levels of CRP were divided into three categories: undetectable (< 0.5 mg/dL), detectable (0.5–0.7 mg/dL), and elevated (≥ 0.8 mg/dL). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression, and were adjusted for covariates.

Results

Relative to participants with undetectable CRP levels, participants with detectable or elevated CRP levels had increased odds of all-cause dementia (detectable: OR, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–7.3; elevated: OR, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–12.9). When participants were subdivided by gender, significantly increased ORs were seen only in women.

Conclusions

In the oldest-old, high CRP levels are associated with increased odds of all-cause dementia, particularly in women. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm whether increased CRP levels are associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in this age group.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^116WS1gX]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, possibly due to a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by SE itself.

- Linear changes of CRP levels and WBC counts significantly correlate with the presence of infectious complications during SE.

- Low levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^11434ZbJ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts have shown an association between inflammatory disturbances and delirium, though these relationships have not been studied in critically ill patients. This study sought to investigate the relationship between two inflammatory biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and duration of acute brain dysfunction in ventilated patients.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the Maximizing Efficacy of Targeted Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction (MENDS) trial were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU. Plasma levels of procalcitonin and CRP were obtained within 24 hours of enrollment. Proportional odds logistic regression was used to examine the association between procalcitonin and CRP separately with delirium/coma-free days, adjusting for age, acute physiology score (APS) of the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, sedation group (dexmedetomidine vs. lorazepam), and sepsis. Secondary analyses examined the association of these markers with other organ dysfunctions and 28-day survival.

Results

Eighty-seven patients were included in this analysis. The median age of the patients was 60 years with APACHE II scores of 28; 68% had sepsis within 48 hours of admission. Higher levels of procalcitonin were associated with fewer delirium/coma-free days [odds ratio (OR), 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3 to 1.0; P = 0.04], whereas higher CRP levels showed trends towards fewer delirium/coma-free days (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.1; P = 0.08). Similar relationships were found regardless of the presence of sepsis. No associations were found between procalcitonin or CRP with 28-day survival (P = 0.40 and 0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

In our pilot study, high baseline inflammatory biomarkers predicted prolonged periods of acute brain dysfunction, implicating inflammation as an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of delirium and coma during critical illness, irrespective of whether patients had sepsis or not.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^114TGGa9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 103 patients enrolled in the MENDS study, baseline procalcitonin and CRP data were available for 87 subjects who were included in the final analysis (16 patients had inadequate plasma samples for CRP and procalcitonin measurements). Baseline characteristics of the study population are listed in Table 1. The median APACHE II and SOFA scores were high at baseline, indicating this group of patients was critically ill; 68% of the population was diagnosed with sepsis within 48 hours of admission to the ICU using the standard definition of suspected infection accompanied by at least two SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) criteria.

Associations of biomarkers with delirium/coma-free days

After adjusting for covariates, higher baseline procalcitonin levels were associated with fewer DCFDs, that is, more brain dysfunction (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.0; P = 0.04; Table 2 and Figure 1), and higher baseline CRP levels showed a trend towards fewer DCFDs (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.1; P = 0.08; Table 2 and Figure 2). Patients with a baseline procalcitonin level of 0.4 ng/ml (the 25 th percentile value in our study population) had a mean (95% CI) of 1.2 (0.1, 2.5) more days alive and free of delirium and coma than those with a procalcitonin level of 6.7 ng/ml (the 75 th percentile). Similarly, patients with a baseline CRP level of 107 mg/L (the 25 th percentile) had a mean (95% CI) of 1.0 (-0.25 to 2.3) more day alive and free of delirium and coma than those with a CRP level of 281.5 mg/L (the 75 th percentile). Sepsis did not modify the relationships between the biomarkers and DCFDs (that is, no interactions were present); thus, patients with higher levels of procalcitonin or CRP had fewer delirium/coma-free days irrespective of whether they had sepsis or not.

### Defining the clinicoradiologic syndrome of SARS-CoV-2 acute necrotizing encephalopathy: a systematic review and 3 new pediatric cases [^111N8nEt]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

We characterize clinical and neuroimaging features of SARS-CoV-2-related acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE).

Methods

Systematic review of English language publications in PubMed and reference lists between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2023, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for sporadic and genetic ANE were included.

Results

From 899 articles, 20 cases (17 single case reports and 3 additional cases) were curated for review (50% female; 8 were children). Associated COVID-19 illnesses were febrile upper respiratory tract infections in children while adults had pneumonia (45.6%) and myocarditis (8.2%). Children had early neurologic deterioration (median day 2 in children vs day 4 in adults), seizures (5 (62.5%) children vs 3 of 9 (33.3%) adults), and motor abnormalities (6 of 7 (85.7%) children vs 3 of 7 (42.9%) adults). Eight of 12 (66.7%) adults and 4 (50.0%) children had high-risk ANE scores. Five (62.5%) children and 12 (66.7%) adults had brain lesions bilaterally and symmetrically in the putamina, external capsules, insula cortex, or medial temporal lobes, in addition to typical thalamic lesions of ANE. Hypotension was only seen in adults (30%). Hematologic derangements were common: lymphopenia (66.7%), coagulopathy (60.0%), or elevated D-dimers (100%), C-reactive protein (91.7%), and ferritin (62.5%). A pathogenic heterozygous c/.1754 C > T variant in RANBP2 was present in 2 children: one known to have this before SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a patient tested because the SARS-CoV-2 infection was the second encephalopathic illness. Three other children with no prior encephalopathy or family history of encephalopathy were negative for this variant. Fifteen (75%) received immunotherapy (with IV methylprednisolone, immunoglobulins, tocilizumab, or plasma exchange): 6 (40.0%) with monotherapy and 9 (60.0%) had combination therapy. Deaths were in 8 of 17 with data (47.1%): a 2-month-old male infant and 7 adults (87.5%) of median age 56 years (33–70 years), 4 of whom did not receive immunotherapy.

Discussion

Children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 ANE have similar clinical features and neuroimaging characteristics. Mortality is high, predominantly in patients not receiving immunotherapy and at the extremes of age.

IDSA COVID-19 Recommendation 11 — Among hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 who have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, the IDSA guideline panel suggests tocilizumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remarks add that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab, and that in the largest trial the criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥ 75 mg/L.

### C-reactive protein in the very early phase of acute ischemic stroke: association with poor outcome and death [^117GJQ1V]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Some methodological limitations should be discussed. First, this study was part of a larger clinical trial, and not designed to evaluate the prognostic value of CRP with regard to clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke. As a consequence, a detailed history of inflammatory conditions was not recorded.

Levels were determined with different analyzers, which may have resulted in a systematic error. For this reason, measurements performed with analyzers with an inter-assay coefficient of variation ≥ 7.5% or that demonstrated bias relative to the other participating centers were excluded from further analysis. Secondly, the lowest detection limit for CRP varied from 1 to 7 mg/L among the centers. Therefore, CRP levels had to be dichotomized. This makes it more difficult to compare our results with previous studies. However, in three of the five studies that assessed the relation between CRP levels in the very early phase of acute stroke and clinical outcome, a similar cut-off point level was selected. Furthermore, all CRP values were recoded with 7 as the lower bound, in order to study a possible level-risk relationship.

A fourth issue might be that rather few patients with very severe stroke were included, which may affect the generalisability of the results.

In patients with ischemic stroke, increased levels of CRP may reflect a pre-existing degree of atherosclerosis or the presence of vascular risk factors. We found that patients with higher levels of CRP were more often smokers and more frequently had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, cardioembolic strokes were observed more often in patients with higher levels of CRP. Moreover, patients with CRP ≥ 7 mg/L used statins less often than patients with low CRP levels, suggesting that drugs in this class reduce levels of CRP. These findings are supported by previous studies.

Why could CRP concentration be a prognostic factor for poor outcome and death? Early after onset of ischemic stroke, increased CRP levels may reflect an accompanying inflammatory reaction. Inflammatory processes play an important role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Cerebral ischemia triggers an inflammatory response characterized by activation and release of acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines. The inflammatory processes may start within 2 h after stroke onset and sustain for days, and may contribute to ischemic brain damage even in that early stage.

### C-reactive protein levels and risk of dementia-observational and genetic studies of 111, 242 individuals from the general population [^115pKB72]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are devastating neurodegenerative diseases affecting more than 47 million individuals. This number is estimated to increase 3‐fold by 2050, mainly due to increased life expectancy. At present there are no curative treatment options, and large fractions of the underlying biology are unknown. Interestingly, several discoveries have recently linked AD and inflammation. Increased plasma levels of C‐reactive protein (CRP) in midlife are associated with increased risk of AD, whereas in older age the opposite association is observed. Whether these associations are due to confounding and/or reverse causation, or whether CRP may be directly implicated in the development of AD is not known.

CRP is a well‐known acute‐phase reactant primarily produced in the liver, known to function as an opsonin, activate the complement system, and modulate leukocyte actions via Fc gamma receptor I and II (FCγRI and FCγRII). Levels of CRP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals with intact blood–brain barrier (BBB) is highly correlated with plasma levels of CRP, albeit with lower concentrations as would be anticipated, and plasma levels of CRP may thus likely mimic brain CRP levels. CRP has been observed within neurofibrillary tangles and in amyloid plaques in brains of AD patients, is produced locally in the brain, and is upregulated both at the mRNA and protein level in affected areas of AD brains. Whether CRP may be directly implicated in the development and progression of AD or is a mere marker of underlying inflammatory processes remains to be established.

We tested the hypothesis that low plasma levels of CRP are associated with increased risk of AD and all‐cause dementia. We further tested whether genetic variants in CRP — associated with low CRP levels — were associated with risk of dementia, thereby addressing whether a lifelong modest decrease in CRP contributes to the development of dementia. For this purpose, we studied 111,242 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS), all with baseline plasma CRP measurements. Of these individuals 104,672 were genotyped for rs3093077, rs1205, rs1130864, and rs3091244 — four genetic variants within the CRP gene that compiled are reported to associate with up to a 64% change in plasma levels of CRP, and that together describe full haplotype diversity in people of European descent. Individuals were followed for up to 27 years for development of AD and all‐cause dementia.
