## Question

Should patients with type 1 diabetes plus heart failure with reduced ejection fraction be prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SGLT2 inhibitors should be prescribed for a patient with type 1 diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and how to weigh benefits, risks, and guideline positions to reach a recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF and whether benefits extend to patients without type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify the specific safety concerns in type 1 diabetes, especially euglycemic ketoacidosis, and how guidelines frame this risk. Next, I will review regulatory status and labeling constraints. After that, I need to consider practical mitigation strategies if off-label use is contemplated. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced recommendation and monitoring plan, ensuring I cross-check each claim against high-quality trials and guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic rationale in HFrEF. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses show that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in HFrEF, with benefits evident in people with and without diabetes, and with early onset of benefit, which supports their role as foundational therapy in HFrEF regardless of glycemic status [^1117cmk6] [^1169HKvZ] [^117CCox5] [^113Y5edZ].

> Wait, let me verify the diabetes-specific nuance here. The pivotal HFrEF trials (DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced) enrolled patients with and without type 2 diabetes and demonstrated consistent benefit, but they excluded type 1 diabetes, so the direct efficacy evidence in T1D is lacking even though the pathophysiologic rationale for benefit in HFrEF is compelling and largely glucose-independent [^117Nfq74] [^111YKihi] [^111f3C73].

> I need to check the key safety concern next. The dominant risk in T1D is euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, which is mechanistically plausible with SGLT2 inhibition due to reduced insulin dose requirements and increased ketogenesis. This risk is well-described in T1D populations and led to removal of SGLT2 inhibitors for T1D in Europe and lack of approval for T1D in the US, with multiple guidelines advising avoidance or extreme caution in T1D [^116YVF9N] [^112f9c16] [^117Gxq7k].

> Hold on, I should verify the regulatory and guideline posture to avoid overstatement. The FDA label for dapagliflozin in HFrEF excludes type 1 diabetes, and contemporary ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC heart failure guidelines prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors as Class I therapy in HFrEF but do not extend this to T1D due to the absence of trial data and safety concerns, while diabetes guidelines focus recommendations on T2D with HF rather than T1D [^113rqkUv] [^115fS4on] [^113Y5edZ] [^112eD6bU].

> Let me consider whether any emerging signals change this. Observational data suggest some clinicians have prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors off-label in T1D with cardiorenal indications, but these are not randomized efficacy data and do not adequately quantify DKA risk; thus, they cannot substitute for trial evidence in T1D-specific HF populations [^117Gxq7k] [^117Uvee8].

> I should double-check practical risk-mitigation steps if, after shared decision-making, off-label use is pursued. If considered, it should be restricted to highly selected, closely monitored patients with stable insulin regimens, clear DKA education, sick-day rules, and readiness to monitor ketones during intercurrent illness, with attention to eGFR thresholds and volume status; even then, the absence of supportive T1D-specific outcome data means this remains an expert-opinion approach rather than evidence-based standard of care [^116YVF9N] [^112f9c16] [^1151z6DZ].

> But wait, what about the strength of the HFrEF benefit signal — could that justify off-label use despite T1D risk? The relative risk reductions for death and HF hospitalization are robust in HFrEF, yet without T1D-specific safety and efficacy data, the balance of evidence does not support routine SGLT2 inhibitor use in T1D with HFrEF outside of a clinical trial or exceptional circumstances with meticulous safeguards and informed consent [^1117cmk6] [^1169HKvZ] [^112f9c16].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For a patient with T1D and HFrEF, SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended routinely because of the absence of supportive trial data in T1D and the meaningful risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. If contemplated off-label, it should be rare, individualized, and accompanied by rigorous DKA risk mitigation and close follow-up, while prioritizing guideline-directed HFrEF therapies with proven benefit in this population [^113Y5edZ] [^116YVF9N] [^112f9c16].

---

SGLT2 inhibitors are **not routinely recommended** for patients with type 1 diabetes and HFrEF because of the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the lack of dedicated trials in this population [^116YVF9N] [^117Gxq7k]. However, **individualized use may be considered** in select patients with careful risk assessment, patient education, and close monitoring for DKA, especially if HFrEF symptoms are severe or refractory to standard therapy. If used, start at a low dose, monitor ketones, and adjust insulin as needed. Routine use is not supported by current guidelines, and decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

---

## Clinical evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF

Robust evidence supports SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF, with **consistent reductions in cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality** in patients with and without type 2 diabetes [^1117cmk6] [^1148L3pV]:

- **DAPA-HF**: dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure by 26% in HFrEF, with similar benefits in patients with and without diabetes [^114AEsMZ].
- **EMPEROR-Reduced**: empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization by 25% in HFrEF, including patients without diabetes [^113oQx2b].
- **Meta-analyses**: consistent benefits across HFrEF populations, including reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death [^1117cmk6] [^1148L3pV].

---

## Safety concerns in type 1 diabetes

The main concern in type 1 diabetes is **euglycemic DKA**, which can occur without marked hyperglycemia and may be precipitated by insulin omission, illness, or dehydration [^116YVF9N]:

- **DKA risk**: SGLT2 inhibitors increase DKA risk in T1D, including euglycemic cases, due to increased ketone production and reduced insulin requirements [^116YVF9N] [^117Gxq7k].
- **Guideline stance**: major guidelines advise caution or avoidance of SGLT2 inhibitors in T1D because of DKA risk [^116YVF9N] [^112f9c16].
- **Monitoring**: if considered, close monitoring of ketones, insulin adjustments, and patient education are essential [^116YVF9N].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines focus on type 2 diabetes and do not provide firm recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors in T1D with HFrEF:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding sglt2 inhibitors in t1d with hfref** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | - Recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for T2D with HF <br/> - No specific recommendation for T1D with HFrEF |
| ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 | - Strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF <br/> - Does not address T1D specifically |
| ESC 2021 | - Recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for HFrEF <br/> - Does not address T1D specifically |

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks in T1D with HFrEF

Patients with T1D and HFrEF have **high morbidity and mortality**, and while SGLT2 inhibitors may offer cardiovascular benefits, the lack of T1D-specific data and DKA risk limit routine use. Potential benefits include reduced cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations, as seen in HFrEF trials, but the **DKA risk is higher in T1D**, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^1117cmk6] [^1148L3pV] [^116YVF9N].

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

If considering SGLT2 inhibitors in T1D with HFrEF, **clinicians should**:

- **Patient selection**: choose patients with severe or refractory HFrEF symptoms despite optimal therapy.
- **Education**: provide thorough education on DKA recognition, sick-day management, and ketone monitoring.
- **Monitoring**: regularly monitor ketones, renal function, and volume status.
- **Insulin adjustment**: adjust insulin to mitigate DKA risk.
- **Start low**: begin with a low dose and titrate cautiously.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

SGLT2 inhibitors are **not routinely recommended** for patients with T1D and HFrEF because of the lack of dedicated trials and the risk of euglycemic DKA. Individualized use may be considered in select patients with careful risk assessment, education, and monitoring. Routine use is not supported by current guidelines, and decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

### The dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse-outcomes in heart failure (DAPA-HF) trial: baseline characteristics [^116kpK5U]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aims of this study were to: (i) report the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial, (ii) compare DAPA-HF patients to participants in contemporary heart failure (HF) registries and in other recent HF trials, and (iii) compare individuals with diabetes, pre-diabetes and a normal glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in DAPA-HF.

Methods and Results

Adults with HF in New York Heart Association functional class ≥ II, a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, an elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration and receiving standard treatment were eligible for DAPA-HF, which is comparing dapagliflozin 10mg once daily to matching placebo. In patients without a history of diabetes, previously undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a confirmed HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. Among patients without known or undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes was defined as a HbA1c ≥ 5.7% The remainder of patients, with a HbA1c < 5.7%, were defined as normoglycaemic. Of the 4744 patients (mean age 66years; 23% women) randomized, 42% had known diabetes and 3% undiagnosed diabetes. Of the remainder, 67% had pre-diabetes and 33% normal HbA1c. Overall, DAPA-HF patients were generally similar to those in recent registries and in relevant trials and had high levels of background therapy: 94% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, 96% beta-blocker, and 71% mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; 26% had a defibrillator. Patients with diabetes had worse HF status, more co-morbidity, and greater renal impairment but received similar HF therapy. Patients with diabetes received non-insulin hypoglycaemic therapy alone in 49%, insulin alone in 11%, both in 14%, and none in 26%.

Conclusions

Patients randomized in DAPA-HF were similar to those in other contemporary HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) registries and trials. These patients were receiving recommended HFrEF therapy and those with diabetes were also treated with conventional glucose-lowering therapy. Consequently, DAPA-HF will test the incremental efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in HFrEF patients with and without diabetes.

Table 1
Effects of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin on heart failure and renal outcomes in trials of patients with type 2 diabetes and in trials of patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction

Most of the patients in the trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes did not have heart failure at the time of enrolment, and the phenotype of heart failure was not well-characterized. Since the investigators did not routinely perform cardiac imaging, it was unclear if the effect of these drugs to reduce heart failure events applied to patients with a reduced or preserved ejection fraction. However, in the DECLARE-TIMI58 trial, the benefit on cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was greater in those with reduced ejection fraction than with a preserved ejection fraction at baseline (hazard ratio 0.62, 95%CI 0.45–0.86 and 0.88, 95%CI 0.76–1.02, respectively, interaction P = 0.046). The benefit was particularly striking in those with an ejection fraction ≤ 30%.

In addition to a lack of information regarding the phenotype of heart failure, the trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes provided little insight about the concomitant use of drugs that are known to prolong survival in patients with heart failure. Therefore, it was not known whether SGLT2 inhibitors would reduce risk of heart failure hospitalizations if patients had received optimal treatment for heart failure. Although many patients in the trials of type 2 diabetes were receiving inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, most were not receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or neprilysin inhibitors. In one trial, concomitant treatment with spironolactone and eplerenone appeared to attenuate the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce heart failure events. Furthermore, because the cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes were carried out before the availability of sacubitril/valsartan, it was not clear how inhibitors of SGLT2 and neprilysin might interact. Therefore, it was important to carry out large-scale definitive trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with well-characterized heart failure who were taking all appropriate treatments for heart failure, including the use of cardiac devices.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to patients with HF, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to include an SGLT-2 inhibitor for both glycemic management and prevention of HF hospitalizations (irrespective of HbA1c) in adult patients with T2DM and HF (with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction).

### European Society of Cardiology / heart failure association position paper on the role and safety of new glucose-lowering drugs in patients with heart failure [^114KPK7n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Significant advances have recently occurred in the treatment of T2DM, with evidence of several new glucose-lowering medications showing either neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, some of these agents have safety characteristics with strong practical implications in HF [i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors]. Regarding safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin is not recommended in HF because of a greater risk of HF hospitalisation. There is no compelling evidence of excess HF risk with the other DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs have an overall neutral effect on HF outcomes. However, a signal of harm suggested in two small trials of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction indicates that their role remains to be defined in established HF. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) have shown a consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation regardless of baseline cardiovascular risk or history of HF. Accordingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could be recommended to prevent HF hospitalisation in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors. The recently completed trial with dapagliflozin has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and HF events in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with or without T2DM. Several ongoing trials will assess whether the results observed with dapagliflozin could be extended to other SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HF, with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence of T2DM. This position paper aims to summarise relevant clinical trial evidence concerning the role and safety of new glucose-lowering therapies in patients with HF.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111ouxva]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Sotagliflozin (SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor) — evidence, indications, and safety — was recently approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors, and is distinct from other SGLT inhibitors by inhibiting intestinal SGLT1 in addition to increasing urinary glucose excretion; it is not currently approved by the FDA for glycemic management of type 2 diabetes. In the SCORED trial, which was ended early due to lack of funding, prespecified primary end points were changed prior to unblinding due to lower-than-anticipated event counts, and the primary end point of deaths from cardiovascular causes, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent visits for heart failure was reduced with sotagliflozin; in SOLOIST, sotagliflozin initiated during or shortly after hospitalization in people with diabetes also reduced the risk for the primary end point of deaths from cardiovascular causes and hospitalizations and urgent visits for heart failure. Although no heterogeneity of treatment effect by ejection fraction was noted, individuals with HFpEF made up only 21% of the study population, which may limit subgroup interpretation. The use of SGLT inhibitors increases the susceptibility to diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly with additional risk factors or situations, and cardiovascular and heart failure outcomes trials reported no increases of ketoacidosis but excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes and/or recent history of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113LWY67]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for heart failure, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate an SGLT inhibitor with proven HF prevention benefit in patients with T2DM and asymptomatic (stage B) HF or with high risk of or established CVD to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116dUpym]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2023 type 2 diabetes — cardiovascular risk therapy selection states that GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) lower major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in meta-analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.93, P < .001), while sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death, including a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76]) and a 15% reduction in CV death (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.78–0.93]) versus placebo. For persons with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk, a GLP-1 RA with cardiovascular benefit should be initiated as first-line therapy independent of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and as an alternative clinicians may recommend an SGLT2i with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce MACE or CV death in persons with T2D and established ASCVD. SGLT2is should be recommended in persons with T2D and HF regardless of A1C goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments, and they have been shown to improve HF-related symptoms irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction and background therapies. High-risk trial features included "albuminuria or proteinuria, HTN and LV hypertrophy, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and/or ABI < 0.9". DPP-4 inhibitors show neutrality for MACE, but saxagliptin increased HF hospitalizations and caution is advised with alogliptin in New York Heart Association Class III or IV CHF. Thiazolidinediones can worsen fluid retention and should not be used in symptomatic HF, and initiation of pioglitazone is contraindicated in New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV CHF.

### 2019 update to: management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^115bJ3YY]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have briefly updated their 2018 recommendations on management of hyperglycemia, based on important research findings from large cardiovascular outcomes trials published in 2019. Important changes include: 1) the decision to treat high-risk individuals with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), hospitalization for heart failure (hHF), cardiovascular death, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression should be considered independently of baseline HbA 1c or individualized HbA 1c target; 2) GLP-1 receptor agonists can also be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) but with the presence of specific indicators of high risk; and 3) SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure, particularly those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, to reduce hHF, MACE, and CVD death, as well as in patients with type 2 diabetes with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, particularly > 300 mg/g) to prevent the progression of CKD, hHF, MACE, and cardiovascular death.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on cause-specific mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of ejection fraction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^1173K38o]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

This pooled analysis of the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) and Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trials investigates the effect of dapagliflozin on specific causes of cardiovascular mortality across the spectrum of ejection fraction.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on cause-specific mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of ejection fraction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^1174kFGN]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this participant-level, pooled, prespecified secondary analysis of the DAPA-HF and DELIVER randomized clinical trials, we conclude that rates of CV death, principally sudden death and HF death, were higher among HF patients with lower EF, whereas non-CV deaths were largely consistent across the EF spectrum. Reductions in CV mortality with dapagliflozin across the CV spectrum appear to be associated with lower rates of sudden death and death from progressive HF. These data provide additional support for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to treat patients with symptomatic HF, regardless of LVEF.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: new horizons for rheumatologists [^111d1JoG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

CURRENTLY APPROVED INDICATIONS OF SGLT2 INHIBITORS

The currently approved indications for SGLT2 inhibitors, as illustrated by a review of the key articles below, include

(1) Type 2 diabetes mellitus
(2) Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus
(3) Heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction
(4) Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the setting of type 2 diabetes mellitus

Type 2 diabetes

SGLT-2 inhibitors were initially approved for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus, as their glucosuric effects improve glycemic control, however their effects on hemoglobin A1c were found to be relatively weak with a decrease by only 0.5–1%. SGLT2 inhibitors are approved as second-line or third-line therapy for type 2 diabetes depending on prior medications utilized and other medication contraindications. For patients with diabetes and associated kidney disease, studies have shown SGLT2 inhibitors to decrease risks of dialysis, transplantation, and death due to chronic kidney disease in patients previously maximized on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition (RAAS).

### Sodium ‑ glucose co-transporter ‑ 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes with heart failure [^115n9AnL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure, which is valuable for clinical decision-making, was recently released. This guideline recommended patients with heart failure with type 2 diabetes sodium‑glucose co-transporter‑2 inhibitors for the management of hyperglycemia and to reduce heart failure-related morbidity and mortality (Class 1, Level A). It is important to note that the source of evidence based on this recommendation is from EMPEROR-Reduced, DAPA-HF, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 and does not include newly published PRESERVED-HF, CHIEF-HF, and EMPEROR-Preserved. Here we reviewed these important trials in order to provide more clinical references for patients with diabetes and heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of type 2 diabetes [^112qFEcj]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

A recently reported meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials demonstrated cardiorenal benefits across the SGLT2 inhibitor class versus placebo. CV benefits included a 12% reduction in 3P-MACE (without significant heterogeneity; I² = 21.2%, p = 0.19), based on six cardiorenal studies that reported this outcome, and a 16% reduction in CV death. However, these results should be caveated; there were differences in outcomes, study designs, patient populations, and medications across the cardiorenal studies included in the meta-analysis. The 12% reduction in 3P-MACE was based on data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, CREDENCE, DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin), VERTIS CV (ertugliflozin) and SCORED (sotagliflozin). Notably, sotagliflozin has both SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitory activity and is not a licensed treatment for T2D (but is licensed for type 1 diabetes in Europe), and SCORED was a cardiorenal study (patients had T2D and CKD) that used a different 3P-MACE outcome (CV death, HHF and urgent visits for HF) than the other studies (CV death, nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke). The dapagliflozin CVOT, DECLARE-TIMI 58, did not show a benefit in either 3P-MACE (HR [95% CI] 0.93 [0.84–1.03], p = 0.17) or CV deaths (0.98 [0.82–1.17]). However, DECLARE-TIMI 58 had a very different profile of baseline characteristics to EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, as a majority of patients had high CV risk but not established CVD, and there were fewer patients with CKD. Therefore, the different outcomes in DECLARE-TIMI 58, compared with EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS, may be due to differences in study design and cohort composition rather than intrinsic differences between the study drugs. Two HF and renal outcomes studies, designed to assess the effect of dapagliflozin vs placebo in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; DAPA-HF) or CKD (DAPA-CKD) with or without T2D, both reported trends towards reductions in CV death in the T2D subgroups (HR [95% CI] 0.79 [0.63–1.01] and 0.85 [0.59–1.21], respectively). In the VERTIS CV study of ertugliflozin, all patients had established CVD at baseline, but no benefit was observed in 3P-MACE (HR [95% CI] 0.97 [0.85–1.11]) or CV death (HR [95% CI] 0.92 [0.77–1.11]). These findings suggest that significant improvements in CV outcomes, which were observed in CVOTs of empagliflozin and canagliflozin, may not apply to all SGLT2 inhibitors.

Limitations and Future Directions

There are several limitations to these meta‐analyses that should be noted. First, the duration of the intervention and the follow‐up were variable across all trials, although the validation of results on the efficacy and safety outcomes after standardizing the results as incident rate ratios helps to mitigate the impact of this bias. Due to the small number of included RCTs, detecting heterogeneity of effects was difficult, and measures of heterogeneity may be unreliable. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the analyses concerning the safety outcomes studied here is limited by the low number of observed events, resulting in wide CIs that encompass the neutral effect and a range of potential effects spanning from benefit to harm. Indeed, SGLT2is have already been distinguished by their relatively low rate of adverse events, particularly for ketoacidosis, which likely leads to a lack of power to detect significant differences in previous RCTs. Nonetheless, further large‐scale pharmacovigilance real‐world studies could help formally clarify this aspect in the specific subpopulation of patients with AHF. Similarly, the results from the meta‐regression regarding the impact of diabetes status may also have been influenced by the small number of available RCTs. Given the lack of power previously described in RCTs evaluating the safety of SGLT2is, the gradual accumulation of future observational pharmacovigilance data will help clarify this point. Of note, the statistically significant results concerning all‐cause death and HF rehospitalizations were characterized by low heterogeneity between the studies, whether including exclusively diabetic patients or others.

Moreover, the sensitivity analyses conducted after excluding open‐label trials did not confirm the improvement in mortality rates and HF hospitalizations. Yet the risk of information bias does not appear to be substantial given the use of objective outcomes (all‐cause death, hospitalization) and standardized definitions. This difference may not be explained by a publication bias, since no other RCTs, even unpublished ones, were found on, suggesting rather a probable lack of power following the exclusion of these patients. Additionally, some definitions of adverse events were inconsistent across trials, especially for AKI, with some studies using a definition based on a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate below a certain threshold, while others used a threshold increase in creatinine. Although no RCT specified inclusion restrictions on the basis of LVEF values, all RCTs primarily included patients with reduced or mildly reduced mean/median LVEF, limiting the strict applicability to patients with preserved LVEF, on whom further studies could focus.

### The role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, regardless of diabetes status: focus on cardiovascular disease [^114A9TGN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinical guidance and an overview of the available data on the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Data Sources

We searched the MEDLINE database via PubMed (from January 2015 to November 2020) for the following key terms: SGLT2 inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, SGLT2i, heart failure, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

To be included in the review, the articles needed to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in the heart failure (HF) scenario.

Data Synthesis

There is consistent evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events and hospitalization in patients with HFrEF, even in the absence of T2DM. On May 5, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dapagliflozin for adults with HFrEF, regardless of the presence of T2DM, even in those patients on standard therapy, including an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

The SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated, and their once-daily dosing without the need for adjustments is convenient. These drugs can be considered a major breakthrough in pharmacotherapy for HF, providing physicians with a new treatment approach to reduce major clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitor therapy reduces CV death and hospitalizations in HFrEF patients regardless of T2DM. The decision to prescribe this class of drugs should not be determined by glycemic status.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on cause-specific mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of ejection fraction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^116jPux9]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this participant-level, pooled, prespecified secondary analysis of cause-specific mortality in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER randomized clinical trials reflecting the experience of 11 007 patients with HF across the full spectrum of LVEF, the reductions in CV death with dapagliflozin were driven principally by lower rates of sudden death and, to a lesser extent, death from progressive HF. These treatment effects appeared to be consistent across EF levels, despite higher rates of overall CV, sudden, and HF-associated deaths among patients with lower EF. Rates of death from stroke, MI, and other CV causes were relatively low and did not appear to vary across the spectrum of EF. Although the proportionate contribution of non-CV death to overall mortality was greater in the higher EF categories, overall rates of non-CV death were relatively consistent across all patients except those with the lowest baseline EF and were not influenced by dapagliflozin treatment. Together, these data support the consistent benefits of dapagliflozin on CV mortality regardless of EF.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in chronic coronary disease (CCD) and heart failure — clinical effects and value: Among patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization and improve quality of life (QOL), and they "should be avoided or used with caution" in type 1 diabetes or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). For reduced ejection fraction, projected value is intermediate ($50 000 to < $150 000 per QALY gained), with modeling assuming dapagliflozin cost $4192 annually and projecting 0.63 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval, 0.25–1.15), an incremental lifetime cost of $42 800 (95% uncertainty interval, $37 100–$50 300), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $68 300 per QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $54 600–$117 600), being cost-effective in 94% of simulations at a threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. In HF with preserved ejection fraction, SGLT2 inhibitors improved functional capacity and QOL; CCD prevalence was 35% in EMPEROR-PRESERVED and 20% in PRESERVED-HF, with the CCD rate not reported in DELIVER. For preserved ejection fraction, assuming no reduction in cardiovascular mortality and minimal QOL improvement, empagliflozin yields low value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $437 000), whereas assuming a 9% reduction in cardiovascular mortality lowers the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to $174 000.

Empagliflozin (SGLT2i) in HF with LVEF ≥ 40% — EMPEROR‑Preserved showed a significant benefit of empagliflozin in symptomatic HF with LVEF ≥ 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The primary composite was reduced by 21%, driven mostly by a 29% reduction in time to first hospitalization, with nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.09) and no benefit on all‑cause mortality. Additional effects included a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, a decrease in the slope of eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks; benefit was similar irrespective of diabetes, there was no significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (< 50%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%), and there was a signal for lower benefit at higher LVEFs ≥ 62.5%.

### Kidney and heart failure outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use [^1125TUUC]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure affect many people worldwide. Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, both diseases remain associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. After observations that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors - originally developed as glucose-lowering agents - improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, dedicated trials were initiated to evaluate the cardiovascular and kidney protective effects in patients with CKD or heart failure. The results of these clinical trials and subsequent detailed analyses have shown that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent across many patient subgroups, including those with and without type 2 diabetes, at different stages of CKD, and in patients with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. In addition, post-hoc analyses revealed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of anaemia and hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD. With respect to their safety, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated. More specifically, no increased risk of hypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with CKD or heart failure without diabetes and they do not increase the risk of acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors therefore provide clinicians with an exciting new treatment option for patients with CKD and heart failure.

### Baseline characteristics of patients with HF with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction: DELIVER trial [^11737MCt]. JACC: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This report describes the baseline clinical profiles and management of DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) trial participants and how these compare with those in other contemporary heart failure with preserved ejection fraction trials.

Background

The DELIVER trial was designed to evaluate the effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on cardiovascular death, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, or urgent HF visits in patients with HF with mildly reduced and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Methods

Adults with symptomatic HF and LVEF > 40%, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus, elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and evidence of structural heart disease were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo.

Results

A total of 6,263 patients were randomized (mean age: 72 ± 10 years; 44% women; 45% type 2 diabetes mellitus; 45% with body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²; and 57% with history of atrial fibrillation or flutter). Most participants had New York Heart Association functional class II symptoms (75%). Baseline mean LVEF was 54.2 ± 8.8% and median NT-proBNP of 1,399 pg/mL (IQR: 962 to 2,210 pg/mL) for patients in atrial fibrillation/flutter compared with 716 pg/mL (IQR: 469 to 1,281 pg/mL) in those who were not. Patients in both hospitalized and ambulatory settings were enrolled, including 10% enrolled in-hospital or within 30 days of a hospitalization for HF. Eighteen percent of participants had HF with improved LVEF.

Conclusions

DELIVER is the largest and broadest clinical trial of this population to date and enrolled high-risk, well-treated patients with HF with mildly reduced and preserved LVEF. (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure [NCT03619213]).

### Evidence summary… [^113cUAyx]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Do sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. 1 The authors performed subgroup analyses of patients with preserved ejection fraction. Patients with diabetes mellitus and an ejection fraction greater than 45% were randomized to treatment with ertugliflozin, 5 or 15 mg per day; dapagliflozin, 10 mg per day; sotagliflozin, 200 or 400 mg per day; or placebo with a follow-up of nine to 50 months. The SGLT-2 inhibitors did reduce the first hospitalization from heart failure but did not decrease cardiovascular mortality. The validity of the primary outcome was limited by significant heterogeneity.

2 Patients with diabetes and an ejection fraction greater than 45% were randomized to ertugliflozin, 5 or 15 mg per day, or dapagliflozin, 10 mg per day, vs. placebo and were followed for 42 to 50 months. A 2022 meta-analysis evaluated the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors vs. placebo on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization from heart failure. The interventions were empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and sotagliflozin; patients were followed for six to nine months. The meta-analysis of all three studies showed that, compared with placebo, SGLT-2 inhibitors decreased hospitalization from heart failure but had no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.

### Dapagliflozin across the range of ejection fraction in patients with heart failure: a patient-level, pooled meta-analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^116sR2N7]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Whether the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduces the risk of a range of morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with heart failure regardless of ejection fraction is unknown. A patient-level pooled meta-analysis of two trials testing dapagliflozin in participants with heart failure and different ranges of left ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 40% and > 40%) was pre-specified to examine the effect of treatment on endpoints that neither trial, individually, was powered for and to test the consistency of the effect of dapagliflozin across the range of ejection fractions. The pre-specified endpoints were: death from cardiovascular causes; death from any cause; total hospital admissions for heart failure; and the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs)). A total of 11,007 participants with a mean ejection fraction of 44% (s.d. 14%) were included. Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76–0.97; P = 0.01), death from any cause (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82–0.99; P = 0.03), total hospital admissions for heart failure (rate ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.65–0.78; P < 0.001) and MACEs (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81–1.00; P = 0.045). There was no evidence that the effect of dapagliflozin differed by ejection fraction. In a patient-level pooled meta-analysis covering the full range of ejection fractions in patients with heart failure, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular causes and hospital admissions for heart failure (PROSPERO: CRD42022346524).

### Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors with outcomes in type 2 diabetes with reduced and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction: analysis from the CVD-REAL 2 study [^1172Cdmt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The term "diabetic cardiomyopathy" introduced in 1972 referred to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in the absence of coronary artery disease and hypertension, leading to heart failure (HF) in patients with diabetes. 1 We now recognize that HF may occur with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), without passing through a stage of reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a known risk factor for all types of HF, including HFpEF. 2 Since there is, as yet, no therapy proven to improve outcomes in HFpEF, its prevention is of utmost importance.

Recently, large outcomes trials in patients with established HF, with or without diabetes, have demonstrated that sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the composite of HF hospitalization (HHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death. 3, 4 However these completed HF trials exclusively included HFrEF (not HFpEF). In earlier CV outcomes trials in T2D, secondary analyses suggested that SGLT2 inhibitor treatment may reduce the risk of both HFrEF and HFpEF events, 5 and that the magnitude of effects on preventing HHFs and death among patients with pre‐existing HF may depend on baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 6 Yet the numbers of patients with LVEF assessed in these secondary analyses were relatively modest, and real‐world evidence on this topic has thus far been lacking.

Using data from routine clinical practice, we aimed to compare the risk of HHF or death in T2D patients starting SGLT2 inhibitors versus other glucose lowering drugs (OGLDs) according to baseline LVEF.

### Projected clinical benefits of implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure [^115shDdd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors form the latest pillar in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and appear to be effective across a range of patient profiles. There is increasing interest in initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors during hospitalization, yet little is known about the putative benefits of this implementation strategy.

Methods

We evaluated Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF (≤ 40%) hospitalized at 228 sites in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) registry in 2016 who had linked claims data for ≥ 1 year postdischarge. We identified those eligible for dapagliflozin under the latest U.S. Food and Drug Administration label (excluding estimated glomerular filtration rates < 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, dialysis and type 1 diabetes). We evaluated 1-year outcomes overall and among key subgroups (age ≥ 75 years, gender, race, hospital region, kidney function, diabetes status, triple therapy). We then projected the potential benefits of implementation of dapagliflozin based on the risk reductions observed in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial.

Results

Among 7523 patients hospitalized for HFrEF, 6576 (87%) would be candidates for dapagliflozin (mean age 79 ± 8 years, 39% women, 11% Black). Among eligible candidates, discharge use of β-blockers, ACEi/ARB, MRA, ARNI, and triple therapy (ACEi/ARB/ARNI+β-blocker+MRA) was recorded in 88%, 64%, 29%, 3%, and 20%, respectively. Among treatment-eligible patients, the 1-year incidence (95% CI) of mortality was 37% (36–38%) and of HF readmission was 33% (32–34%), and each exceeded 25% across all key subgroups. Among 1333 beneficiaries eligible for dapagliflozin who were already on triple therapy, the 1-year incidence of mortality was 26% (24%-29%) and the 1-year readmission due to HF was 30% (27%-32%). Applying the relative risk reductions observed in DAPA-HF, absolute risk reductions with complete implementation of dapagliflozin among treatment-eligible Medicare beneficiaries are projected to be 5% (1%-9%) for mortality and 9% (5%-12%) for HF readmission by 1 year. The projected number of Medicare beneficiaries who would need to be treated for 1 year to prevent 1 death is 19 (11–114), and 12 (8–21) would need to be treated to prevent 1 readmission due to HF.

Conclusions

Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF who are eligible for dapagliflozin after hospitalization due to HF, including those well-treated with other disease-modifying therapies, face high risks of mortality and HF readmission by 1 year. If the benefits of reductions in death and hospitalizations due to HF observed in clinical trials can be fully realized, the absolute benefits of implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors among treatment-eligible candidates are anticipated to be substantial in this high-risk postdischarge setting.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on worsening heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure with and without diabetes [^1169HKvZ]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Additional treatments are needed for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may be an effective treatment for patients with HFrEF, even those without diabetes.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin in patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Exploratory analysis of a phase 3 randomized trial conducted at 410 sites in 20 countries. Patients with New York Heart Association classification II to IV with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and elevated plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide were enrolled between February 15, 2017, and August 17, 2018, with final follow-up on June 6, 2019.

Interventions

Addition of once-daily 10 mg of dapagliflozin or placebo to recommended therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of an episode of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death. This outcome was analyzed by baseline diabetes status and, in patients without diabetes, by glycated hemoglobin level less than 5.7% vs greater than or equal to 5.7%.

Results

Among 4744 patients randomized (mean age, 66 years; 1109 [23%] women; 2605 [55%] without diabetes), 4742 completed the trial. Among participants without diabetes, the primary outcome occurred in 171 of 1298 (13.2%) in the dapagliflozin group and 231 of 1307 (17.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.60–0.88]). In patients with diabetes, the primary outcome occurred in 215 of 1075 (20.0%) in the dapagliflozin group and 271 of 1064 (25.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63–0.90]) (P value for interaction = .80). Among patients without diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin level less than 5.7%, the primary outcome occurred in 53 of 438 patients (12.1%) in the dapagliflozin group and 71 of 419 (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.47–0.96]). In patients with a glycated hemoglobin of at least 5.7%, the primary outcome occurred in 118 of 860 patients (13.7%) in the dapagliflozin group and 160 of 888 (18.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59–0.94]) (P value for interaction = .72). Volume depletion was reported as an adverse event in 7.3% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6.1% in the placebo group among patients without diabetes and in 7.8% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 7.8% in the placebo group among patients with diabetes. A kidney adverse event was reported in 4.8% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6.0% in the placebo group among patients without diabetes and in 8.5% of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 8.7% in the placebo group among patients with diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this exploratory analysis of a randomized trial of patients with HFrEF, dapagliflozin compared with placebo, when added to recommended therapy, significantly reduced the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death independently of diabetes status.

Clinical background

Epidemiology

Patients with HF have a four-fold higher prevalence of T2DM (20%) than patients without HF (4–6%), and this rises to 40% in T2DM patients hospitalized for HF. T2DM worsens prognosis for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but even more with HFpEF, by increasing the risk of death and hospitalization. Patients with T2DM have a 75% higher risk of CV death or HF hospitalization compared with those without T2DM. Furthermore, the risk to develop HF is 2.5-fold increased for patients with T2DMand 1.7-fold for patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or insulin resistancecompared with normal (non-diabetic) individuals, respectively. In T2DM patients who are older than 65 years, the coexistence of HF portends a 10-fold higher mortality risk. Thus, epidemiological evidence implies a bidirectional association between HF and T2DM (Figure 1), with one increasing the incidence and worsening the prognosis of the respective other.

Figure 1
Systemic interdependence of heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In heart failure, neuroendocrine activation alters haemodynamics and metabolism, predisposing to the development of diabetes through insulin resistance. In diabetes, hyperglycaemia induces macro- and microvascular dysfunction, and myocardial ischaemia and/or infarction bias towards systolic dysfunction (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), while in the absence of ischaemia, diastolic dysfunction (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) prevails through a combination of sarcomere stiffness and fibrosis. Inflammation is a key systemic factor that contributes to several of these processes. The specific points of intervention by glucose-lowering drugs are indicated (all have in common that they lowed hyperglycaemia).

### Effect of dapagliflozin on outpatient worsening of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a prespecified analysis of DAPA-HF [^113ePK3e]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure), dapagliflozin, added to guideline-recommended therapies, reduced the risk of mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. We examined the frequency and significance of episodes of outpatient HF worsening, requiring the augmentation of oral therapy, and the effects of dapagliflozin on these additional events.

Methods

Patients in New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% and elevation of NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), were eligible. The primary outcome was the composite of an episode of worsening HF (HF hospitalization or an urgent HF visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death, whichever occurred first. An additional prespecified exploratory outcome was the primary outcome plus worsening HF symptoms/signs leading to the initiation of new, or the augmentation of existing, oral treatment.

Results

Overall, 36% more patients experienced the expanded, in comparison with the primary, composite outcome. In the placebo group, 684 of 2371 (28.8%) patients and, in the dapagliflozin group, 527 of 2373 (22.2%) participants experienced the expanded outcome (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.65–0.82]; P < 0.0001). Each component of the composite was reduced significantly by dapagliflozin. Over the median follow-up of 18.2 months, the number of patients needed to treat with dapagliflozin to prevent 1 experiencing an episode of fatal or nonfatal worsening was 16. Among the 4744 randomly assigned patients, the first episode of worsening was outpatient augmentation of treatment in 407 participants (8.6%), an urgent HF visit with intravenous therapy in 20 (0.4%), HF hospitalization in 489 (10.3%), and cardiovascular death in 295 (6.2%). The adjusted risk of death from any cause (in comparison with no event) after an outpatient worsening was hazard ratio, 2.67 (95% CI, 2.03–3.52); after an urgent HF visit, the adjusted risk of death was hazard ratio, 3.00 (95% CI, 1.39–6.48); and after a HF hospitalization, the adjusted risk of death was hazard ratio, 6.21 (95% CI, 5.07–7.62).

Conclusion

In DAPA-HF, outpatient episodes of HF worsening were common, were of prognostic importance, and were reduced by dapagliflozin. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT03036124.

### The double burden: type 1 diabetes and heart failure-a comprehensive review [^1152Fma8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Individuals with T1D face a significantly elevated risk of HF compared to those without DM. Despite the clear association between T1D and HF, the exact mechanisms are still not fully understood. Studies are needed to elucidate the underlying processes, pinpoint specific risk factors, and establish precise diagnostic biomarkers. On the other hand, evaluating comprehensive cardioprotection strategies and exploring adjunctive therapies are crucial. While certain therapeutic groups, such as SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D, show promise, their effectiveness and safety in T1D patients with HF remain uncertain and require further investigation.

Results

Within the data, we identified 240,252 patients who had evidence of heart failure, type 2 diabetes, and had used glucose lowering therapies (see Additional file 1: Appendix Fig. S1 for the CONSORT flow diagram). After the criteria of new use were applied, there were 23,959 and 95,564 remaining initiators of SGLT2i and DPP4i, respectively, and 27,340 and 35,111 eligible initiations for SGLT2i and GLP-1RA, respectively. After requirements for pertinent heart failure hospitalizations and other exclusion criteria (e.g. T1D) were applied, the four pair-wise comparison cohorts were comprised of: (Cohort 1a) 13,882 HFrEF patients initiating SGLT2i versus DPP4i; (1b) 6951 HFrEF patients initiating SGLT2i versus GLP-1RA; (2a) 17,493 HFpEF patients initiating SGLT2i versus DPP4i; and (2b) 9053 HFpEF patients initiating SGLT2i versus GLP-1RA (see Additional file 1: Appendix Tables S1–S4 for information on unadjusted and adjusted baseline characteristics for all four cohorts).

Prior to IPT weighting, SGLT2i users differed from their non-gliflozin counterparts with respect to pertinent baseline characteristics (defined as a standardized difference > 10%). Regardless of HF subtype, patients initiating DPP4i (compared to SGLT2i) were older and more likely to be diagnosed with MI, peripheral vascular disease and renal insufficiency, while those initiating GLP-1RA (compared to SGLT2i) were more likely to be female, have previously used insulin, and have evidence of microvascular complications of diabetes.

After IPT weighting, baseline characteristics in all four cohorts were well balanced with no standardized difference exceeding 10% (Tables 1 and 2). The most commonly observed guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF was beta blockers, followed by ACE inhibitors or ARBs, while approximately one-third of the patients were on aldosterone antagonists. Reasons for censoring were similar among the four study cohorts, and discontinuation of index exposure was the most prevalent contributor to censoring (Additional file 1: Appendix Table S5).

### Effect of dapagliflozin on cause-specific mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of ejection fraction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^115r8C3f]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

As in other clinical trial populations, we observed that overall mortality rates tracked closely with LVEF, driven principally by rising rates of sudden death and death from progressive HF with declining EF. When analyzing rates of cause-specific CV mortality according to categories defined by the recently proposed Universal Definition of Heart Failure, rates of CV death and its key components were similar in patients with HF and mildly reduced EF (41%-49%) to those with HF and reduced EF (≤ 40%) but substantially lower in those with HF and preserved EF (> 50%), with only slight differences between those with EF of 51% to 59% and those with EF of 60% or greater. The higher proportionate contribution of non-CV death with rising EF may be partly responsible for the limited progress in reducing the burden of overall mortality in patients with HF and preserved EF using CV therapies. Nonetheless, CV mortality accounted for 40% to 50% of deaths in patients with HF and preserved EF, with the largest proportion of these adjudicated as sudden deaths. These data underscore the important contribution of sudden death and death from progressive HF to overall mortality in HF with preserved EF. Importantly, however, it remains unclear if the mechanisms driving sudden death and HF death in those with preserved EF are the same as that in those with reduced EF. Sudden death in those with HF and reduced EF is often ascribed to arrhythmic death, but the risk for ventricular arrhythmias is typically lower in those with higher EF. As well, since overall cardiac output is often preserved even in end-stage HF with preserved EF, mechanisms other than pump failure (such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, or worsening kidney function) may account for death due to HF in this population.

Methods

DAPA‐HF is an international, multicentre, parallel group, event‐driven, randomized, double‐blind, trial in patients with chronic HFrEF, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, given once daily, in addition to standard of care, on the risk of worsening heart failure and cardiovascular death. The trial is registered asIdentifier: NCT03036124.

Study design and conduct

Patients

Men and women aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of heart failure for at least 2 months are eligible if they are in New York Heart Association functional class II or above, have a left ventricular ejection fraction documented to be ≤ 40% within the last 12 months, are optimally treated with pharmacological and device therapy for heart failure, and willing to provide written informed consent. In addition, patients must have a N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide concentration ≥ 600 pg/mL or, if hospitalised for heart failure within the previous 12 months, ≥ 400 pg/mL. Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter must have a level ≥ 900 pg/mL, irrespective of history of heart failure hospitalization. Full details are provided in the online supplementary Appendix S1.

Key exclusion criteria include: recent treatment with or intolerance of a SGLT2 inhibitor, type 1 diabetes mellitus, symptoms of hypotension or systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg, recent worsening heart failure or other cardiovascular events or procedures (or planned procedures), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (or rapidly declining renal function) and other conditions likely to prevent patient participation in the trial or greatly limit life expectancy. A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in Table 1.

Power calculations and statistical analysis

Key questions in designing DAPA‐HF were what rate might be anticipated for the novel primary composite endpoint and what treatment effect size is clinically relevant and realistic? The event rate was estimated based on recent trials, particularly PARADIGM‐HF. 32 A treatment effect size of 20% was chosen as clearly clinically relevant and reasonably conservative in light of the ∼30% relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization observed in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9 DAPA‐HF is powered for this treatment effect on the primary composite outcome and not the individual components of the composite, particularly cardiovascular death. Furthermore, for nearly all other plausible scenarios, using the treatment effect sizes observed in DECLARE–TIMI 58 and in the SGLT2 inhibitor trial meta‐analysis, DAPA‐HF has ≥ 80% power to detect a benefit of dapagliflozin. 7, 8, 9

Safety considerations

In view of the safety information collected in prior trials, including DECLARE–TIMI 58, adverse event reporting has been simplified (with agreement of the regulatory authorities) — only serious adverse events, adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption/dose reduction and adverse event of special interest are collected. Adverse events of interest (in light of the profile of dapagliflozin above and concerns with SGLT2 inhibitors and other diabetes drugs more generally) include volume depletion, renal dysfunction, major hypoglycaemic episodes, fractures, and diabetic ketoacidosis. There is also a regulatory requirement to document amputations as a result of observations in the canagliflozin development programme but not in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME or DECLARE–TIMI 58. 43

Current status

The first enrolment (Visit 1) took place 8 February 2017 and the first randomization (Visit 2) occurred 15 February 2017. Subsequent recruitment in DAPA‐HF was rapid, and randomization was completed 17 August 2018.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^111YKihi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of incident heart failure hospitalization in individuals with type 2 diabetes who have, or are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. Most patients in these trials did not have heart failure at baseline and the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on outcomes in individuals with established heart failure (with or without diabetes) is unknown.

Design and Methods

The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF) is an international, multicentre, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, study in patients with chronic heart failure, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, given once daily, in addition to standard care, on the primary composite outcome of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalization or equivalent event, i.e. an urgent heart failure visit) or cardiovascular death. Patients with and without diabetes are eligible and must have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, a moderately elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The trial is event-driven, with a target of 844 primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include the composite of total heart failure hospitalizations (including repeat episodes), and cardiovascular death and patient-reported outcomes. A total of 4744 patients have been randomized.

Conclusions

DAPA-HF will determine the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to conventional therapy, in a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

### Applicability of US food and drug administration labeling for dapagliflozin to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in US clinical practice: the get with the guidelines-heart failure (GWTG-HF) registry [^113rqkUv]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

In May 2020, dapagliflozin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), based on the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial. Limited data are available characterizing the generalizability of dapagliflozin to US clinical practice.

Objective

To evaluate candidacy for initiation of dapagliflozin based on the FDA label among contemporary patients with HFrEF in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 154 714 patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) hospitalized at 406 sites in the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) registry admitted between January 1, 2014, and September 30, 2019. Patients who left against medical advice, transferred to an acute care facility or to hospice, or had missing data were excluded. The FDA label (which excluded patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, those undergoing dialysis, and those with type 1 diabetes) was applied to the GWTG-HF registry sample. Data analyses were conducted from April 1 to June 30, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of patients hospitalized with HFrEF who would be candidates for dapagliflozin under the FDA label.

Results

Among 154 714 patients hospitalized with HFrEF, 125 497 (81.1%; 83 481 men [66.5%]; mean [SD] age, 68 [15] years) would be candidates for dapagliflozin according to the FDA label. Across 355 sites with patients with 10 or more hospitalizations, the median proportion of candidates for dapagliflozin according to the FDA label was 81.1% (interquartile range, 77.8%-84.6%) at each site. This proportion was similar across all study years (interquartile range, 80.4%-81.7%) and was higher among those without type 2 diabetes than with type 2 diabetes (85.5% vs 75.6%). Among GWTG-HF participants, the most frequent reason for not meeting the FDA label criteria was eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at discharge (18.5%). Among 75 654 patients with available paired admission and discharge data, 14.2% had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at both time points, while 3.8% developed an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by discharge. Although there were more older adults, women, and Black patients in the GWTG-HF registry than in the DAPA-HF trial, most clinical characteristics were qualitatively similar between the 2 groups. Compared with the DAPA-HF trial cohort, there was lower use of evidence-based HF therapies among patients in GWTG-HF.

Conclusions and Relevance

These data from a large, contemporary US registry of patients hospitalized with heart failure suggest that 4 of 5 patients with HFrEF (with or without type 2 diabetes) would be candidates for initiation of dapagliflozin, supporting its broad generalizability to US clinical practice.

Diabetes — symptomatic heart failure therapy and metformin use: In individuals with diabetes, guideline-directed medical therapy for myocardial infarction and symptomatic stage C heart failure is recommended with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, MRAs, angiotensin receptor or neprilysin inhibitor, β-blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors, similar to guideline-directed medical therapy for people without diabetes. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, therapy with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit for reduction of heart failure–related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function is recommended. In people with type 2 diabetes with stable heart failure, metformin may be continued for glucose lowering if estimated glomerular filtration rate remains > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized individuals with heart failure.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure: a comprehensive meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials [^1148L3pV]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibitors are strongly recommended in guidelines to treat patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their clinical benefits at higher ejection fractions are less well established. Two large-scale trials, DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction have been done, providing power to examine therapeutic effects on cardiovascular mortality and in patient subgroups when combined with the earlier trials in reduced ejection fraction.

Methods

We did a prespecified meta-analysis of DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, and subsequently included trials that enrolled patients with reduced ejection fraction (DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced) and those admitted to hospital with worsening heart failure, irrespective of ejection fraction (SOLOIST-WHF). Using trial-level data with harmonised endpoint definitions, we did a fixed-effects meta-analysis to estimate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on various clinical endpoints in heart failure The primary endpoint for this meta-analysis was time from randomisation to the occurrence of the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. We assessed heterogeneity in treatment effects for the primary endpoint across subgroups of interest. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022327527.

Findings

Among 12251 participants from DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced composite cardiovascular death or first hospitalisation for heart failure (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·73–0·87]) with consistent reductions in both components: cardiovascular death (0·88 [0·77–1·00]) and first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·74 [0·67–0·83]). In the broader context of the five trials of 21947 participants, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure (0·77 [0·72–0·82]), cardiovascular death (0·87 [0·79–0·95]), first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·72 [0·67–0·78]), and all-cause mortality (0·92 [0·86–0·99]). These treatment effects for each of the studied endpoints were consistently observed in both the trials of heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction and across all five trials. Treatment effects on the primary endpoint were generally consistent across the 14 subgroups examined, including ejection fraction.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalisations for heart failure in a broad range of patients with heart failure, supporting their role as a foundational therapy for heart failure, irrespective of ejection fraction or care setting.

Funding

### GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing in people with diabetes… [^117Gxq7k]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease was defined as any 1 of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure. D, Percentage of overall T1D population, T1D population with obesity, T1D population with cardiovascular disease, and T1D population with chronic kidney disease prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors in each calendar year from 2013 to 2023. Two newer glucose-lowering medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, have significant cardiorenal benefits and advantages in weight management. 1 These medications are not approved for type 1 diabetes, but some evidence indicates their use in this population. 2 This study explored prescribing trends for individuals with T1D prescribed GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors.

Characteristics of the overall T1D population in 2023 and those newly prescribed GLP-1RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors were compared using χ2 or t tests. prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors had significantly higher rates of preexisting cardiovascular and kidney conditions, whereas those who were newly prescribed GLP-1RAs had a higher rate of obesity. Prescribing for both GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in a T1D population identified in Cosmos increased between 2010 and 2023. Differences in characteristics of the overall T1D population and those newly prescribed the medications are often associated with elevated cardiorenal risk profiles, suggesting use of these newer treatments was intended to address additional medical needs.

Concerns about euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis led to the removal of SGLT2 inhibitors for T1D in Europe, and the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved their use in T1D. Concerns exist about GLP-1RAs causing substantial weight loss and increasing the risk of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia. 5, 6 However, use of these newer medications in T1D may continue due to the significant weight management and cardiorenal benefits observed in people with and without type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus with heart failure — SGLT-2 inhibitors to prevent hospitalization: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, stated that the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was high, and found that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) for patients with T2DM and HF outweighed the potential harm. Guideline-directed medical therapy includes SGLT-2 inhibitors as part of an initial "four pillar" approach for patients with heart failure along with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a regimen in a patient already achieving glycemic goals might require de-escalation of other medications to limit the risk of hypoglycemia. Evidence cited notes empagliflozin has been shown effective in patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and that dapagliflozin similarly reduced the rate of heart failure outcomes, while some systematic reviews suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) might also reduce HHF but the overall impact on HHF is likely minimal without albiglutide, which is no longer marketed in the U.S. Implementation should consider patient factors and tolerability described here, including urinary frequency (especially with coexisting bladder or prostate conditions), a history of recurrent or severe genitourinary infections, and in older patients on other antihypertensives or diuretics or those with systolic heart failure the possibility of symptomatic hypotension or volume depletion that might require de-escalation or discontinuation of therapy.

Primary prevention and pre–heart failure care: Primary prevention is important for those at risk for HF (stage A) or pre-HF (stage B), and stages of HF were revised to emphasize the terminologies of "at-risk for HF" for stage A and "pre-HF" for stage B; healthy lifestyle habits are recommended, blood pressure should be controlled, and SGLT2i are recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and either established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk. Natriuretic peptide biomarker–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent development of left ventricular dysfunction or new-onset HF (pre-HF, stage B), validated multivariable risk scores can also be useful to estimate subsequent risk of incident HF, and in asymptomatic patients with LVEF ≤ 40% (pre-HF, stage B), ACEi, ARB, evidence-based beta blockers, statins, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are recommended in certain patients.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: established and emerging indications [^1179Pp5B]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used in patients with type 2 diabetes as glucose lowering therapies, with additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Data from cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted that these drugs confer protection against major cardiovascular disease in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure, and reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ongoing research using hard renal endpoints such as end stage kidney disease rather than surrogate markers might clarify the renoprotective benefits of both agents. When used for glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are most effective if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is more than 60 mL per min per 1·73m 2 at initiation and should be avoided where there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in those with a history of medullary thyroid cancer and used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis of a known cause. These drugs are now second-line, or even arguably first-line, glucose lowering therapies in patients with cardiorenal disease, irrespective of glycaemic control. If an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is considered suitable in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment should be prioritised according to existing evidence: GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered in patients at a high risk of, or with established, cardiovascular disease and SGLT2 inhibitors considered for patients with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction) or chronic kidney disease (with or without established cardiovascular disease). There is now compelling data on the benefits of these drugs for a range of other clinical indications even without type 2 diabetes, including for GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with obesity and overweight with weight-related comorbidities.

Overall, when administering GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy, it is important to adopt an individualized approach to therapy taking into account individual preferences, costs and coverage, AE profile, consideration of kidney function and glucose-lowering efficacy, desire for weight loss, and comorbidities such as frailty. Fortunately, the combination of a SGLT2i and a GLP-1RA can be used regardless of the background anti-diabetic treatment, especially metformin, since their benefits are independent of any other drugs administered simultaneously. Figure 2 suggests a decision algorithm for prescribing GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy in patients with T2DM.

### The double burden: type 1 diabetes and heart failure-a comprehensive review [^116s9EJU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) currently represents a global health problem due to the significant levels of morbidity and mortality associated with it. Although the treatment of HF has improved in recent years, its prevalence and incidence have increased, leading to a substantial number of hospital admissions, progressive deterioration in the quality of life, and increased mortality. It is well established that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for the development of heart disease, including HF. Numerous epidemiological studies have established that diabetes is independently associated with the risk of developing HF. Importantly, recent findings have revealed that among individuals with DM, especially those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), HF is increasingly becoming the primary manifestation of cardiovascular conditions, overtaking atherosclerotic diseases in this regard. Indeed, the rising prevalence of DM worldwide and the aging of the world's population have led to the emergence of a significant problem associated with diabetes-related HF. The relationship between DM and HF is complex and multifactorial, and several mechanisms have been implicated. Diabetes increases the risk of HF regardless of classical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or coronary heart disease. While the existence of distinct diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains a subject of debate, numerous experimental and preclinical studies have shown that hyperglycemia results in structural, functional, metabolic, and hemodynamic alterations in the myocardium.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in HF due to the development of new therapies, including glucose-lowering medications, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2), which have demonstrated significant cardioprotective effects, leading to notable improvements in HF symptoms, reduced hospitalizations rates, and decreased mortality. Nonetheless, most of the knowledge concerning HF and the evidence from cardiovascular safety trials involving antidiabetic drugs refer to T2D.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Similar to what occurs in T2D, cardiovascular disease, which includes HF, emerges as a long-term complication in T1D. Recent epidemiological findings have shown an increasing prevalence of HF in individuals with T1D, potentially linked to a growing population of older individuals with long-standing T1D. However, HF in patients with T1D has not been studied as comprehensively as in patients with T2D. Understanding the complex mechanisms that link T1D and HF is crucial for the development of effective strategies for prevention and management. In this review, our primary focus will be on examining the evidence regarding heart failure in individuals with T1D, with particular attention paid to aspects such as epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment options.

### Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors with outcomes in type 2 diabetes with reduced and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction: analysis from the CVD-REAL 2 study [^117S79cs]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

This study of real-world data from the Maccabi database in Israel compared the risk of heart failure hospitalization (HHF) or death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs) according to baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). After propensity-matching patients by baseline EF there were 10 614 episodes of treatment initiation; 57% had diabetes for > 10years, the mean glycated haemoglobin level was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), ∼43% had cardiovascular disease, ∼7% had heart failure and∼20% had chronic kidney disease. A total of 2876 patients (∼9%) had reduced EF (< 50%). Over a mean follow-up of 1.5years there were 371 HHFs or deaths, 88 (23.7%) in patients with reduced EF. Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors versus OGLDs was associated with lower risk of HHF or death overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–0.70]; P < 0.001) and in patients with both reduced EF (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40–0.93) and preserved EF (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43–0.70), with no significant heterogeneity (P interaction = 0.72). Our findings from real-world clinical practice show that the lower risk of HHF and death associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors versus OGLDs is consistent in T2D patients with both reduced and preserved EF.

### Initial eGFR changes with SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes and associations with the risk of abnormal serum potassium level [^117L1PJL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia increases the risk of death and cardiac arrhythmias and limits the use of medications like RAS inhibitors or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that improve clinical outcomes in patients with CKD or systolic HF. The patient‐level meta‐analysis of 6 trials of SGLT2i evaluating 49 875 participants reported that 1754 participants developed severe hyperkalemia, and an additional 1119 hyperkalemia events were reported by investigators.SGLT2is reduced the risk of severe hyperkalemia as well as investigator‐reported hyperkalemia consistent across 6 studies. Reductions in severe hyperkalemia were observed in a variety of subgroups, including impaired kidney function at baseline, history of HF, and use of RAS inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and diuretics. Furthermore, SGLT2i did not increase the risk of hypokalemia. The post hoc analysis of Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR‐Reduced) and The Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR‐Preserved) combined also showed that empagliflozin reduced the incidence of hyperkalemia without a significant increase in hypokalemia in patients with HF. In conclusion, SGLT2is reduce the risk of severe hyperkalemia in patients with T2D through a variety of risk factors without increasing the risk of hypokalemia.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in HFrEF — In DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced, SGLT2i compared with placebo reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization by approximately 25%, with greater reduction in HF hospitalization (30%); with dapagliflozin, risk of cardiovascular death was lowered (18%) and all-cause mortality (17%). In SOLOIST-WHF, among patients with diabetes and HF hospitalization (79%: LVEF, < 50%) enrolled before discharge or within 3 days of discharge, sotagliflozin reduced the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or urgent HF visits by 33%. SGLT2i increased risk for genital infections, and caution is warranted for euglycemic ketoacidosis, genital and soft tissue infections, and adjustment of diuretics, if needed, to prevent volume depletion.

In addition to the pre‐specification of the composite of serious adverse renal outcomes as the primary endpoint, the pooled analysis has three secondary endpoints: (i) all‐cause mortality; (ii) cardiovascular death; and (iii) time to new‐onset diabetes in patients with pre‐diabetes.

All pre‐specified endpoints will be evaluated as time‐to‐first‐event analyses, using Cox proportional hazards model with the following covariates: treatment, study, gender, geographical region and baseline glycaemic status as categorical variables, and ejection fraction, eGFR and age as continuous variables. Subgroup analyses will be based on age, sex, race, body mass index, ischaemic vs. non‐ischaemic aetiology of heart failure, presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes at baseline, systolic blood pressure, heart failure hospitalization within 12 months, New York Heart Association functional class, history of atrial fibrillation or flutter, and baseline use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction… [^115yu5nn]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question How has the adoption rate and variation in use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors changed for US patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40% since publication of clinical trial evidence of benefit in 2021. Findings In this cohort study of 158 849 patients across 557 US hospitals, SGLT2i prescription rates increased from approximately 4% in July to September 2021 to approximately 24% in July to September 2023, with substantial variation found across hospitals. Meaning In this study of discharge prescription of an SGLT2i among patients hospitalized for heart failure, prescription rates increased substantially within 2 years after publication of clinical trial evidence documenting benefit, although considerable variation in rates was found, highlighting the need to understand strategies used by higher prescribing centers to increase SGLT2i adoption.

Importance Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are the first therapy shown to improve clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%. Nationwide adoption of SGLT2is in the US since publication of the Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in August 2021 is unknown. Objective To examine trends and hospital-level variation in SGLT2i adoption. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included patients with LVEF greater than 40% who were hospitalized for decompensated HF at 1 of 557 sites in the US between July 1, 2021, and September 30, 2023, from the Get With The Guidelines–Heart Failure registry. Results Of 158 849 patients, 22 126 eligible patients with HF and an LVEF greater than 40% were prescribed an SGLT2i at hospital discharge.

Conclusion and Relevance For patients with HF and an LVEF greater than 40%, discharge prescription of SGLT2is increased from 4. 2% to
23. 5% during the first 2 years after the EMPEROR-Preserved trial demonstrating treatment benefits; however, these rates varied across US hospitals.

### Practical guide to prescribing sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for cardiologists [^1151z6DZ]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose-lowering therapies that have been shown to reduce risks of heart failure (HF) events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at high-risk for or with cardiovascular disease. The United States Food and Drug Administration has expanded the regulatory label for empagliflozin and canagliflozin for use to lower cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease. SGLT2 inhibitors are being actively studied in the treatment of patients with HF, including in those without diabetes mellitus. Despite the accumulating data supporting this class of therapies in HF prevention, cardiologists infrequently prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors, potentially due to lack of familiarity with their use. We provide an up-to-date practical guide highlighting important elements for treatment initiation, dosing, anticipated adverse effects, and barriers to uptake.

### Dapagliflozin across the range of ejection fraction in patients with heart failure: a patient-level, pooled meta-analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^116dSSJD]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of total (that is, first and subsequent) hospital admissions for HF (RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.65–0.78), P < 0.001) and there was no evidence of a treatment interaction with ejection fraction, whether analyzed by category (P for interaction = 0.62) or as a continuous variable (P for interaction = 0.84). The pre-specified supportive analysis of time to first hospital admission showed a consistent benefit of dapagliflozin (HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.66–0.82); P < 0.001). The ARR was 3.2% (95% CI 2.0–4.4%) and the NNT over the median follow-up was 32 (95% CI 23–51).

Applying the overall relative risk reduction to the placebo group event rate gave an NNT (95% CI) to prevent a death from CV causes in patients with reduced, mildly reduced and preserved ejection fractions of 61 (37–246), 59 (35–237) and 76 (46–309), respectively. The corresponding NNTs for a first hospitalization for HF were 28 (21–41), 30 (24–45) and 29 (23–43) and, for death from any cause, 72 (39–764), 56 (31–593) and 64 (35–684), respectively.

Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin also reduced the incidence of the MACE composite of death from CV causes, MI or stroke, although this effect was of borderline statistical significance (HR 0.90 (5% CI 0.81–1.00); P = 0.045). Again, there was no interaction between ejection fraction and the effect of treatment whether analyzed categorically (P for interaction = 0.72) or as a continuous measure (P for interaction = 0.93). The ARR was 1.3% (95% CI 0.0–2.6%) and the NNT over the median follow-up was 76 (95% CI 39–2187).

### Adjusting the use of glucose-lowering agents in the real-world clinical management of people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^115HvWyr]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Practice guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and the Korean Diabetes Association recommend that selection of second-line therapy for T2D (following first-line metformin and lifestyle changes) should be based on patient assessment for atherosclerosis and CVD (ASCVD), heart failure, or CKD. Updated ADA practice guidelines are shown in Fig. 5. For patients with ASCVD, an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is recommended, while an SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended for those with CKD or heart failure, independent of metformin use and HbA 1c at baseline. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Work Group also recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with metformin should be considered as first-line therapy in patients with T2D and CKD, with additional drug therapy for glycaemic control as needed.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^115dQ9dC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although being one of the most common, disabling and deadly complications of diabetes, heart failure has not been the focus of cardiovascular outcome trials evaluating glucose‐lowering therapies. 1, 2 Despite this, evidence has accrued that different diabetes medications have distinct effects on the risk of developing heart failure. 1, 2 Specifically, thiazolidinediones and saxagliptin (and possibly alogliptin) increase the risk of heart failure hospitalization, whereas in three recent trials there were nominally statistically significant reductions in heart failure hospitalization with sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 In the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, the relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with empagliflozin was 35%, 7 in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study Program (CANVAS), the reduction was 33%, 8 and in the Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events trial (DECLARE–TIMI 58) the reduction was 27%. 9 These exciting findings have raised many questions, including what type (or types) of heart failure occurred in these patients (i.e. with reduced or preserved ejection fraction), through which mechanism(s) SGLT2 inhibitors exert these salutary effects and whether they may even be independent of glucose‐lowering, and if they might extend to patients without type 2 diabetes? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Additional mechanisms proposed include diuretic and haemodynamic actions, improved myocardial metabolism, effects on cardiac ion channels and others. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function may also be relevant. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ykfE2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

This meta‐analysis combines data from 4 large randomized studies, each with a robust design and low risk of bias, providing good power to explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes both overall and for subgroups. The broad constancy of the findings across subgroups suggests wide clinical utility for the drug class and that the few differences in effects observed in the overview should be treated with caution. The statistical evidence of heterogeneity of effects between patient subsets in these analyses is in almost every case only moderate in strength and unless confirmed by future analyses the overall effect estimates provide the best current guide for clinical practice. The lack of individual patient data for some of the included studies is a limitation to the current analysis, but is unlikely to change the overall findings of this report.

The low absolute rates of events for those without a history of CVD at baseline meant that there was limited statistical power to define effects of SGLT2 inhibition separately in that patient subset. However, given comparable directions of effect and no evidence of heterogeneity between effects for any outcome between those with and without CVD, the overview findings support consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in primary, as well as secondary, prevention settings. Similarly, only a small proportion of patients had HF at baseline, and HF was defined by history rather than by rigorous validation based on imaging and natriuretic peptide assay. The recently published DAPA‐HF study 30 in HF with reduced ejection fraction has provided additional insight into the role of SGLT2 inhibition in HF, with a clear reduction in hospitalization for HF and other key cardiovascular outcomes. The DEFINE‐HF (Dapagliflozin Effect on Symptoms and Biomarkers in Patients With Heart Failure) trial 33 also demonstrated an improvement in HF‐related health status, as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire in those with HF with reduced ejection fraction treated with SGLT2 inhibition. There remains some uncertainty with respect to the benefit in HF with preserved ejection fraction that will be addressed in ongoing large trials DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) [NCT03619213] and EMPEROR‐Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) [NCT03057951].

In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors protect against CVD and death in diverse subsets of patients with T2DM. The magnitude of protection achieved may vary across patients, but among those studied to date, the available evidence does not identify clearly a patient group that is unlikely to achieve significant cardiovascular protection from use of this drug class.

Whereas the aforementioned trials provided robust evidence to suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent incident heart failure, 2 important questions remained unanswered. First, could these therapies also be used in the treatment of prevalent heart failure, and second, is the benefit seen in people without type 2 diabetes? Importantly, in this regard, the recently completed DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial, which enrolled 4,744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction demonstrated a marked reduction on worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death on top of excellent heart failure standard-of-care therapy. Furthermore, this benefit was similar in those with and without type 2 diabetes and was consistent across the spectrum of A 1c evaluated either categorically or continuously.

SGLT2i in the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases

SGLT2i have demonstrated improved outcomes for patients with HF across the spectrum of LVEF in a number of pivotal clinical trials. For patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), EMPEROR-reduced, DAPA-HF, SOLOIST-WHF, and DEFINEprovided the evidence that ultimately led to inclusion of SGLT2i as a Class I recommendation for HFrEF in the contemporary HF guidelines. Similar to those with HFrEF, pivotal trials for patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) including EMPEROR-Preserved, DELIVER, PRESERVED-HF, and some participants from SOLOIST-WHFestablished the efficacy of SGLT2i. These studies provided the first evidence of benefit from the addition of HF therapy for patients with improved ejection fraction, adding to evidence surrounding initiation and continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).

Several major trials established the efficacy of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM and established CV disease. These included the CANVAS Program, DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, SCORED trialwhich not only established the CVD benefit of SGLT2i in patients with T2D but also laid the groundwork for further studies to illustrate their benefits in patients with HF and CKD. These trials not only established the CVD benefit of SGLT2i in patients with T2D but also laid the groundwork for further studies to illustrate their benefits in patients with HF and CKD.

Finally, 3 major trials evaluated the efficacy of SGLT2i in patients with CKD with and without T2DM including the CREDENCE trial, DAPA-CKD trial, and the EMPA-Kidney trial. These trials demonstrated in patients with both reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria with SGLT2i, leading to reductions in kidney disease progression and kidney and CV-associated death.

SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin — EMPEROR-Preserved outcomes and HFmrEF-relevant subgroup: EMPEROR-Preserved showed a significant benefit of the SGLT2i, empagliflozin, in patients with symptomatic HF, with LVEF > 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The 21% reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time to HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death was driven mostly by a significant 29% reduction in time to HF hospitalization (nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.0]), with no benefit on all-cause mortality. Empagliflozin also resulted in a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, decrease in the slope of the eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks, and the benefit was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes at baseline. In a subgroup of 1983 patients with LVEF 41% to 49% in EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, and the benefit in the primary endpoint did not have a significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (41%–49%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%).

### SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a meta-analysis of the EMPEROR-reduced and DAPA-HF trials [^1117cmk6]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both DAPA-HF (assessing dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-Reduced (assessing empagliflozin) trials showed that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with or without diabetes. However, neither trial was powered to assess effects on cardiovascular death or all-cause death or to characterise effects in clinically important subgroups. Using study-level published data from DAPA-HF and patient-level data from EMPEROR-Reduced, we aimed to estimate the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on fatal and non-fatal heart failure events and renal outcomes in all randomly assigned patients with HFrEF and in relevant subgroups from DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials.

Methods

We did a prespecified meta-analysis of the two single large-scale trials assessing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes: DAPA-HF (assessing dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-Reduced (assessing empagliflozin). The primary endpoint was time to all-cause death. Additionally, we assessed the effects of treatment in prespecified subgroups on the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. These subgroups were based on type 2 diabetes status, age, sex, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) treatment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, race, history of hospitalisation for heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body-mass index, and region (post-hoc). We used hazard ratios (HRs) derived from Cox proportional hazard models for time-to-first event endpoints and Cochran's Q test for treatment interactions; the analysis of recurrent events was based on rate ratios derived from the Lin-Wei-Yang-Ying model.

Findings

Among 8474 patients combined from both trials, the estimated treatment effect was a 13% reduction in all-cause death (pooled HR 0·87, 95% CI 0·77–0·98; p = 0·018) and 14% reduction in cardiovascular death (0·86, 0·76–0·98; p = 0·027). SGLT2 inhibition was accompanied by a 26% relative reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death or first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·74, 0·68–0·82; p < 0·0001), and by a 25% decrease in the composite of recurrent hospitalisations for heart failure or cardiovascular death (0·75, 0·68–0·84; p < 0·0001). The risk of the composite renal endpoint was also reduced (0·62, 0·43–0·90; p = 0·013). All tests for heterogeneity of effect size between trials were not significant. The pooled treatment effects showed consistent benefits for subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes, treatment with an ARNI and baseline eGFR, but suggested treatment-by-subgroup interactions for subgroups based on NYHA functional class and race.

Interpretation

The effects of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin on hospitalisations for heart failure were consistent in the two independent trials and suggest that these agents also improve renal outcomes and reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with HFrEF.

In persons with T2D and established HF (regardless of ejection fraction, background glucose-lowering or HF therapies, or A1C), use SGLT2is with proven HF benefits to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF or CV death and to improve HF-related symptoms. In persons with T2D and ASCVD or at high risk for ASCVD, GLP-1 RAs with proven benefit for reduction in the risk of stroke are recommended; in persons with insulin resistance, prediabetes, or T2D and a prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, pioglitazone should be considered to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.

Abstract

This study of real‐world data from the Maccabi database in Israel compared the risk of heart failure hospitalization (HHF) or death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors versus other glucose‐lowering drugs (OGLDs) according to baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). After propensity‐matching patients by baseline EF there were 10 614 episodes of treatment initiation; 57% had diabetes for > 10 years, the mean glycated haemoglobin level was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), ∼43% had cardiovascular disease, ∼7% had heart failure and ∼ 20% had chronic kidney disease. A total of 2876 patients (∼9%) had reduced EF (< 50%). Over a mean follow‐up of 1.5 years there were 371 HHFs or deaths, 88 (23.7%) in patients with reduced EF. Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors versus OGLDs was associated with lower risk of HHF or death overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46‐0.70]; P < 0.001) and in patients with both reduced EF (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40‐0.93) and preserved EF (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43‐0.70), with no significant heterogeneity (P interaction = 0.72). Our findings from real‐world clinical practice show that the lower risk of HHF and death associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors versus OGLDs is consistent in T2D patients with both reduced and preserved EF.

### Chapter 3: clinical trials of sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 inhibitors for treatment of heart failure [^113WyBQH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular outcomes trials of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated consistent signals of benefit in terms of both prevention and treatment of heart failure (HF), in patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). In response to growing evidence of the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, including increased survival, reduced hospitalizations and improved patient-reported symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, the treatment landscape for HF has evolved. Importantly, these agents have also demonstrated safety and tolerability in individuals with HF across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction, with improvements in clinical and patient-reported outcomes occurring as early as days to weeks after treatment initiation. For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), SGLT2 inhibitors are now increasingly recognized as foundational disease-modifying therapy. An updated joint guideline from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association now recommends including SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with HF across the spectrum of ejection fraction, irrespective of the presence of diabetes, and regardless of background therapy (Class 1 recommendation for HFrEF, Class 2a recommendation for HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction [HFmrEF] and HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]). The European Society of Cardiology also include a Class I recommendation to use SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with HFrEF to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF and CV death, irrespective of T2D status. This chapter reviews published clinical trial data about the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with HFrEF, HFpEF, and patients hospitalized for HF.

REVIEW OF GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE SGLT2I BY DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES (SUPPLEMENTARY TABLE S3)

Diabetology guidelines

In 2018 the Canadian Diabetes Association published its recommendations for antihyperglycemic medication selection and dosing in CKD. In this guideline, SGLT2i are used as 'anti-hyperglycaemic drugs' in people who cannot achieve glycaemic targets. The authors recommend using SGLT2i with proven renal benefits for reducing the risk of CKD progression in people with T2DM, cardiovascular disease and CKD who have eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m² with a level for recommendation '2B for empagliflozin' and '3C for canagliflozin'.

The most recent 2022 joint American Diabetes Association (ADA) European Association for Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement regarding the choice of glucose-lowering therapy in patients with T2DM. The recommendation is that the therapy should be based on assessment of established ASCVD, CKD or HF with goals of glycaemic control and cardiorenal protection considered in partnership. SGLT2i are indicated in people with T2DM independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target to reduce cardiac events, HF, cardiovascular death, and progression of CKD. In particular, SGLT2i were recommended for people with HF with moderately reduced ejection fraction or CKD (eGFR 30 to 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) or T2DM and HFrEF because they reduce cardiac events and cardiovascular death. As a distinct recommendation, for patients with high risk for amputation, SGLT2i should be prescribed after risks are explained and with comprehensive education on foot care. The 2023 updated ADA ADA guideline on Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes suggests that both cardiorenal risk and glycaemic control should be assessed in parallel with SGLT2i first line therapy for cardiorenal risk.

Background

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are risk factors for heart failure and adverse heart failure outcomes. The Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trial showed that dapagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral dapagliflozin in these patients by their baseline glycaemia categories.

DELIVER was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done in 350 health-care centres and hospitals across 20 countries. Patients aged 40 years or older with New York Heart Association class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%, elevated natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 300 pg/mL or ≥ 600 pg/mL for patients in atrial fibrillation or flutter), and evidence of structural heart disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo, administered orally, and followed up for a median of 2·3 years (IQR 1·7–2·8). The primary outcome, a composite of time from randomisation to first worsening heart failure events (defined as an unplanned hospitalisation or urgent heart failure visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death, in participants with type 2 diabetes (history of or identified by HbA 1c ≥ 6·5% [48 mmol/mol] at baseline) or prediabetes (HbA 1c 5·7 to < 6·5% [39 mmol/mol to < 48 mmol/mol] at baseline) was compared with those with normoglycaemia (HbA 1c < 5·7% [39 mmol/mol]). Efficacy of dapagliflozin versus placebo was assessed according to glycaemic status and based on HbA 1c as a continuous measure. The full-analysis set comprised all patients who were randomly assigned to study treatment, with patients analysed according to their randomised treatment assignment, irrespective of the treatment received (ie, intention to treat). The safety analysis set comprised patients who were randomly assigned to study treatment and who took at least one dose of investigational product, with patients analysed according to the treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03619213.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2018, and Jan 18, 2021, 6263 patients were randomly assigned to oral dapagliflozin (n = 3131) or placebo (n = 3132). Of these patients, 1175 had normoglycaemia, 1934 had prediabetes, and 3150 had type 2 diabetes and were included in the glycaemia subgroup analysis (3515 [56·2%] of 6263 patients were men and 4435 [70·9%] were White). The incidence rate of the primary outcome was 6·9 per 100 patient-years in the normoglycaemia subgroup (reference), increasing to 7·6 per 100 patient-years in the prediabetes subgroup (hazard ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·90–1·31]) and 10·1 per 100 patient-years in the type 2 diabetes subgroup (1·46 [1·24–1·73]; p < 0·0001 for trend). Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome versus placebo in each subgroup (hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·57–1·04], log-rank p = 0·088, for patients with normoglycaemia, 0·87 [0·69–1·08], log-rank p = 0·21, for patients with prediabetes, and 0·81 [0·69–0·95], log-rank p = 0·0077, for patients with type 2 diabetes; p interaction = 0·82) and across the continuous HbA 1c range (p interaction = 0·85). Volume-related or renal serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug, hypoglycaemia, and amputations were not differentially affected by treatment in any of the glycaemia categories.

Interpretation

In patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, oral dapagliflozin improved heart failure outcomes to a similar extent in three glycaemia subgroups: normoglycaemia, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the heart failure benefits of dapagliflozin seem to be consistent across a continuous glycaemic range.

### Dapagliflozin and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: an exploratory analysis from DAPA-HF [^111mJT1J]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular mortality and worsening heart failure in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial. This report explores the effect of dapagliflozin on incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the cohort without diabetes enrolled in the trial.

Research Design and Methods

The subgroup of 2,605 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), no prior history of diabetes, and an HbA 1c of < 6.5% at baseline was randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo. In this exploratory analysis, surveillance for new-onset diabetes was accomplished through periodic HbA 1c testing as part of the study protocol and comparison between the treatment groups assessed through a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

At baseline, the mean HbA 1c was 5.8%. At 8 months, there were minimal changes, with a placebo-adjusted change in the dapagliflozin group of -0.04%. Over a median follow-up of 18 months, diabetes developed in 93 of 1,307 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group and 64 of 1,298 (4.9%) in the dapagliflozin group. Dapagliflozin led to a 32% reduction in diabetes incidence (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.50–0.94; P = 0.019). More than 95% of the participants who developed T2D had prediabetes at baseline (HbA 1c 5.7–6.4%). Participants who developed diabetes in DAPA-HF had a higher subsequent mortality than those who did not.

Conclusions

In this exploratory analysis among patients with HFrEF, treatment with dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of new diabetes. This potential benefit needs confirmation in trials of longer duration and in people without heart failure.

Heart failure and diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) — The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i as first‑line agent for hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes with HF or at high risk of HF, and SGLT2i are the first class of glucose‑lowering agents to receive FDA approval for treatment of HFrEF. In type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin are associated with reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events including hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Two RCTs totaling 8474 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and EF ≤ 40% (DAPA‑HF and EMPEROR‑Reduced) showed significant reductions in the relative risk of all‑cause death (13%).

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Out of a total of 5988 patients enrolled in the study, 2938 (49%) had diabetes at baseline, including 10 patients (0.2%; 5 patients in each treatment group) with type 1 diabetes, and the remaining with type 2 diabetes. Among 2938 patients with diabetes, the large majority had a history of diabetes; only 277 patients had newly identified diabetes on the basis of a pretreatment HbA1c value ≥ 6.5%. Compared with patients without diabetes, those with diabetes were younger, were more frequently men, and had higher body mass index and HbA1c levels (Table 1). Patients with diabetes also had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease as the principal cause of HF and more commonly a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, but a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, patients with diabetes had a worse New York Heart Association class but lower levels of NT-proBNP than those without diabetes. Patients with diabetes had higher median urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio with a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria, but similar eGFR. They were more frequently treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, aspirin, and lipid-lowering agents, and less frequently with anticoagulants. Glucose-lowering agents other than SGLT2i had been prescribed in 79.5% of patients with diabetes; the most commonly used agent was metformin, followed by insulin and sulfonylureas.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics in Patients With and Without Diabetes

Among the 3050 (51%) patients without diabetes at baseline, 1980 (33% of the total population) had prediabetes and 1070 (18% of the total population) had normoglycemia. Baseline characteristics of patients with normoglycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes are provided in.

### Time to benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with heart failure… [^117CCox5]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

This study's findings found a rapid clinical benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors, suggesting that their use may be beneficial for most individuals with heart failure. Importance Emerging evidence has consistently demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death among patients with HF. However, it remains unclear how long a patient needs to live to potentially benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors in this population. Further analyses indicated a shorter time to benefit for HF hospitalization and among patients with diabetes or HF with reduced ejection fraction. Conclusions and Relevance In this comparative effectiveness research study of estimating the time to benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with HF, a rapid clinical benefit in reducing CV death or worsening HF was found, suggesting that their use may be beneficial for most individuals with HF.

Emerging evidence has consistently demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death among patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction or reduced ejection fraction. 1–5 These findings have been incorporated into the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic HF6 and then the 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guideline for the management of HF.
7. It is noteworthy to mention that patients may obtain quicker treatment benefits on the risk of HF hospitalization, or among patients with diabetes or reduced ejection fraction. Our study underscored the urgency of initiating SGLT2 inhibitor use to overcome clinical inertia in patients with chronic HF.

inhibitor is a novel class of antidiabetic drugs and several CV outcomes trials have shown its cardiorenal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes. 25–27 Recent trials or systematic reviews have found that SGLT2 inhibitors could prevent CV deaths and HF hospitalizations among patients with HFpEF or HFrEF. Furthermore, we found that it only took approximately 5 months on average to prevent 1 composite event in 50 patients, suggesting that for most patients with a life expectancy greater than 5 months, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors may likely outweigh their harms. Of note, it seemed that patients with HFrEF or diabetes may benefit from the treatment of SGLT2 inhibitors more rapidly than their counterparts.

### The cardiovascular outcomes, heart failure and kidney disease trials tell that the time to use sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is now [^1112gD1P]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The CVOTs reported to date include empagliflozin's EMPA‐REG Outcome, 10 canagliflozin's integrated CANVAS Program 11 (comprised of two trials: CANVAS and CANVAS‐R), dapagliflozin's DECLARE‐TIMI‐58 12 and ertugliflozin's VERTIS‐CV. 13 The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, 10, 14 demonstrated superiority of empagliflozin for the three‐point major cardiovascular event (MACE‐3: a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke), with significantly lower rates of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), all cause death and kidney outcomes. Similar to empagliflozin, canagliflozin 11 was demonstrated to be superior to placebo for the MACE‐3. On the other hand, dapagliflozin 12 and ertugliflozin 13 only achieved non‐inferiority in their respective cardiovascular safety trials, DECLARE‐TIMI‐58 and VERTIS‐CV.

DAPA‐HF 15 and EMPEROR‐reduced 16 recruited patients with or without T2D but with reduced ejection fraction (EF < 35%). Both studies showed highly significant reductions in the primary outcome of HHF or cardiovascular death irrespective of baseline kidney function, proteinuria, gender, race, diabetic status. CREDENCE 17 and DAPA‐CKD 18 examined the effects of canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with persistent kidney damage, that is, persistent macroalbuminuria and impaired eGFR (between 30 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m²) on a background of maximally tolerated therapy with RASi. While CREDENCE recruited patients with type 2 diabetes, DAPA‐CKD also included patients without T2D. These CKD trials not only demonstrated that the drugs reduced a composite that involved worsening kidney function, the need for dialysis, and reduced cardiovascular outcomes.

The rapidly expanding landscape of the SGLT2i trials can be rather daunting to follow, given the variable study designs, populations, and the sequential testing strategy employed by the study authors. There remains understandable confusion about the relative merits of one SGLT2i versus another since individual study results tend to be presented as "significant" or "nonsignificant" without consideration of the totality of evidence across trials. In the present meta‐analysis we will synthesize the primary outcomes and the high‐profile adverse events, which to the authors' opinion seem to act as a barrier against the wider adoption of the SGLT2i.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^111Pmm8o]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Key inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients with HFrEF have both a high prevalence of dysglycaemia and high risk of adverse outcomes. 1, 2, 13, 14 Those with persisting symptoms and elevation of natriuretic peptides despite conventional therapy are in particular need of additional treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality. The additional mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitor action discussed above should be beneficial not only in patients with diabetes and pre‐diabetes, but also in the minority who are euglycaemic. 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Hence DAPA‐HF includes patients irrespective of diabetes status and HbA1c concentration.

Because of the known reduction in blood pressure with SGLT2 inhibition and similar action of conventional therapies for HFrEF, entry systolic blood pressure must be 95 mmHg or above. Similarly, because of the small initial reduction in eGFR expected with dapagliflozin (and similar effects from conventional HFrEF therapies), as well as the diminished glycosuric action of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment, patients are only eligible for DAPA‐HF if their eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Key aspects of trial design

A visit early (14 ± 3 days) after randomization is included to check renal function and blood pressure (as well as for symptoms of hypotension); this visit also allows for adjustment of background diuretic or other non‐essential therapies (as reduction of doses of key life‐saving HFrEF therapies is discouraged). Dose reduction to 5 mg of dapagliflozin or matching placebo (or discontinuation of study drug) is permitted, as needed at this visit or any subsequent visit; however, dose up‐titration (or re‐initiation) is encouraged thereafter in all cases, where possible.

Optional biomarker and echocardiography sub‐studies are being conducted.

### Effect of glucose-lowering therapies on heart failure [^112M94Zf]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is one of the most common comorbidities of diabetes mellitus. Glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure or improve outcomes in patients with established heart failure are of critical importance among those with type 2 diabetes. Several types of glucose-lowering drugs have been assessed in this setting. Metformin has been shown to modestly improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure, whereas the effect of insulin in those with established heart failure is less clear. The effect of sulfonylureas on improving heart failure is controversial; observational reports have suggested that they are harmful in these patients, but these data have not been confirmed in randomized, controlled trials. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with established heart failure and have also been known to cause heart failure. Furthermore, certain dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors seem to increase heart failure hospitalization. The effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists might differ in patients with or without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, perhaps the most important finding has been that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; also known as SLC5A2) inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalizations and, in the case of empagliflozin, markedly reduce the rate of cardiovascular death. Given the known neutral (or even harmful) effects of other glucose-lowering drugs on heart failure outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors might well be considered the drug class of choice in patients with diabetes and heart failure, or in those at high risk of developing heart failure.

### Managing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in clinical practice [^114AjZu1]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic has significantly heightened the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on the global burden of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), originally developed for type 2 diabetes treatment, have demonstrated in randomised controlled trials their ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This has led to substantial improvements in patient outcomes. SGLT2i, in particular, are the first class of drugs proven to improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that also GLP-1RA might be beneficial in these patients. Remarkably, the benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are independent of type 2 diabetes status or baseline renal function. The critical role of these drug classes in managing high cardiovascular risk patients is increasingly acknowledged in guidelines, which now advocate their use across broader clinical phenotypes. This review compiles evidence supporting the use of these drugs in various clinical scenarios, highlighting their impact on outcomes and identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from their prescription. Guideline recommendations are summarised at the conclusion of each section. In the conclusion, we highlight how these drugs have changed our approach to cardiometabolic diseases and emphasise the potential advantages achievable by using their reciprocal combination and combinations with other drugs representing the foundation of the guidelines-directed medical therapy.

### Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with heart failure: proposal of a novel mechanism of action [^111tktXD]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Only 1 class of glucose-lowering agents-sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors-has been reported to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events primarily by reducing the risk of the development or progression of heart failure. In a landmark trial called Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes [EMPA-REG Outcomes], long-term treatment with empagliflozin prevented fatal and nonfatal heart failure events but did not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke in diabetic patients.

Observations

The beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure cannot be explained by their actions on glycemic control or as osmotic diuretics. Instead, in the kidneys, SGLT2 functionally interacts with the sodium-hydrogen exchanger, which is responsible for the majority of sodium tubular reuptake following filtration. The activity of sodium-hydrogen exchanger is markedly increased in patients with heart failure and may be responsible for both resistance to diuretics and to endogenous natriuretic peptides. In addition, in the heart, empagliflozin appears to inhibit sodium-hydrogen exchange, which may in turn lead to a reduction in cardiac injury, hypertrophy, fibrosis, remodeling, and systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the major pathophysiological derangements of heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction may be mitigated by the actions of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce blood pressure, body weight, and fluid retention as well as to improve renal function. The benefits of spironolactone in patients with heart failure with either a reduced or a preserved ejection fraction may also be attributable to the actions of the drug to inhibit the sodium-hydrogen exchange mechanism.

Conclusions and Relevance

The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure may be mediated by the inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchange rather than the effect on glucose reabsorption. This hypothesis has important implications for the design and analysis of large-scale outcomes trials involving diabetic or nondiabetic patients with chronic heart failure.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114AEsMZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — heart failure outcomes in diabetes — reduce the incidence of heart failure and improve heart failure–related outcomes in people with diabetes with preserved or reduced ejection fraction; in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin led to a significant 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo, and in CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58 the reductions were 33% and 27%, respectively. In DAPA-HF, adults with New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less had lower risks with dapagliflozin for the primary composite (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]), first worsening heart failure (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.83]), and cardiovascular death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69–0.98]), with the primary outcome effect consistent regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. EMPEROR-Reduced showed reduction of the primary outcome in adults with NYHA class II–IV chronic HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), and a similar benefit for heart failure outcomes was seen in DELIVER for dapagliflozin in people with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. A large meta-analysis including EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, DAPA-HF, DELIVER, and SOLOIST-WHF included 21,947 individuals and demonstrated reduced risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, first hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

### Treatment of heart failure with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: current evidence and future directions [^116Yhbfk]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes is one the most common comorbidities among people with established heart failure. Interest in heart failure as an outcome among people with diabetes has emerged since it was shown that there was an association between increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure with use of thiazolidinediones and some dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Recently, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors were shown to lead to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and either cardiovascular risk factors or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These findings appear to be consistent in people both with and without a baseline history of heart failure. Based on current evidence there are several clinical scenarios in which the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors would be justified for people with heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: (1) in people with a new diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes and for whom anti-hyperglycaemic management strategies are being considered; (2) in people with sub-optimal glycaemic control, regardless of baseline antihyperglycaemic therapy; and (3) in people with symptomatic heart failure (or other high-risk features such as recent hospitalization for heart failure), if glycaemic control is optimized and the individual is on a sulfonylurea or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor; here, it may be reasonable to consider substituting one of those therapies for a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. There are now a number of ongoing trials evaluating the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors as therapy for people with established heart failure (with preserved or with reduced ejection fraction) and regardless of the presence of diabetes. These trials will provide the evidence for the safety and efficacy of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors among people with established heart failure.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors and mortality among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: linked database study [^114Lkf55]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor use and risk of all cause mortality among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Design

Linked database study.

Setting

National registers in Denmark, July 2020 to June 2023.

Participants

Patients with heart failure, aged ≥ 45 years, with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was all cause mortality comparing initiation and continued treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors versus continued treatment with other standard-of-care heart failure drugs and non-use of SGLT-2 inhibitors; secondary outcomes were the composite of cardiovascular mortality or admission to hospital with heart failure and its individual components. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity scores.

Results

The study included 6776 patients who started SGLT-2 inhibitors (79% dapagliflozin; 21% empagliflozin) and 14686 patients who remained on other standard-of-care heart failure drugs and did not use SGLT-2 inhibitors. Most SGLT-2 inhibitor users were male (70%), the mean age was 71.2 (standard deviation 10.6) years, and 20% had type 2 diabetes. During follow-up, 374 deaths occurred among SGLT-2 inhibitor users (incidence rate 5.8 per 100 person years) and 1602 among non-users (8.5 per 100 person years). The weighted hazard ratio for all cause mortality was 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.85); the weighted incidence rate difference was -1.6 (95% confidence interval -2.5 to -0.8) per 100 person years. Secondary outcomes showed a weighted hazard ratio of 0.94 (0.85 to 1.04) for cardiovascular mortality or hospital admission with heart failure, 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.03 (0.92 to 1.15) for hospital admission with heart failure. The weighted hazard ratios for all cause mortality were consistent in patients with and without diabetes (0.73 (0.58 to 0.91) and 0.73 (0.63 to 0.85); P = 0.99).

Conclusions

In this large database study among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a 25% lower risk of all cause mortality, supporting their effectiveness in routine clinical practice.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114v9fYd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

### Which patients with heart failure benefit from an SGLT2 inhibitor? [^116ewyqx]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractRandomized controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in the composite of heart failure events and death from cardiovascular causes with use of SGLT2 inhibitors, regardless of whether a patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. This evidence led to a class 1A indication for SGLT2i for adults with heart failure. However, recent data demonstrate that the adoption of SGLT2i into practice has been slow. This article describes benefits, risks, pivotal trials, prescribing pearls, and areas of uncertainty related to the use of SGLT2i for adults with heart failure.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes: barriers and solutions for improving uptake in routine clinical practice [^112WhabJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite recent recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in collaboration with European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) on the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in T2D management,(Figure 1), prescription rates in patients with T2D remain low in day‐to‐day clinical practice. The aim of this review is to identify potential barriers to prescribing SGLT‐2 inhibitors in patients with T2D, addressing viewpoints from endocrinology, cardiology, nephrology, and primary care, and to propose targeted solutions to overcome these barriers. Opinions for this review were gathered during an expert roundtable discussion involving all authors.

### Real-world use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^115tg3yP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce mortality/morbidity in heart failure (HF). We explored the implementation of SGLT2i over time, and patient characteristics associated with their use, in a large, nationwide population with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods and Results

Patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction < 40%), no type 1 diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20ml/min/1.73m 2 and/or on dialysis, registered in the Swedish HF Registry between 1 November 2020 and 5 August 2022 were included. Independent predictors of use were investigated by multivariable logistic regressions. Of 8192 patients, 37% received SGLT2i. Use increased overall from 20.5% to 59.0% over time, from 46.2% and 12.5% to 69.8% and 55.4% in patients with and without type 2 diabetes, from 14.7% and 22.3% to 58.0% and 59.8% in eGFR < 60 versus ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2, from 21.0% and 18.9% to 61.6% and 52.0% in males versus females, from 24.2% and 18.0% to 60.8% and 57.7% in patients with versus without recent HF hospitalization, from 26.1% and 19.8% to 54.7% and 59.6% in inpatients versus outpatients, and from 20.2% and 21.2% to 59.2% and 58.7% in those with HF duration < 6 versus ≥ 6months, respectively. Important characteristics associated with SGLT2i use were male sex, recent HF hospitalization, specialized HF follow-up, lower ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes, higher education level, use of other HF/cardiovascular interventions. Older age, higher blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and anaemia were associated with less use. Discontinuation rate at 6 and 12months was 13.1% and 20.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

Use of SGLT2i increased three-fold over 2years. Although this indicates a more rapid translation of trial results and guidelines into clinical practice compared to previous HF drugs, further efforts are advocated to complete the implementation process while avoiding inequities across different patient subgroups and discontinuations.

### Heart failure: SGLT2 inhibitors and heart failure – clinical implications [^114FSDWG]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

The latest findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial show a 34% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients receiving empagliflozin, a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with placebo. These outstanding results call for discussion of the clinical implications, and in-depth studies of the mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors.

SGLT2 inhibitors and heart failure (HF) events — trial results in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) show consistent reductions in HF outcomes: in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CV death or HF hospitalization was reduced by 34% (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.79) and HF hospitalization alone had a similar effect (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85); in CANVAS, HF hospitalization decreased by 33% (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87); in CREDENCE, HF hospitalization fell by 39% (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.80); and in DECLARE-TIMI 58, the composite CV death or HF hospitalization improved by 17% (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.95), driven by a 27% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.88). Across CV outcome trials, ~90% of patients did not have HF at baseline. In HFrEF treatment, DAPA-HF demonstrated a 26% relative reduction in CV death or worsening HF (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.85) with an independent reduction in CV death (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.98), while DEFINE-HF improved HF-related symptoms, functional status, and quality of life after 12 weeks without a significant difference in mean N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, the study's coprimary endpoint.

### Effect of luseogliflozin on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in patients with diabetes mellitus [^112CEdKk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

For the past 2 decades, a better prognosis was able to be achieved than was previously possible in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) because of the advent of guideline‐based medicine and device therapy. However, the effectiveness of these therapeutic agents has not been clarified in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in clinical trials. 1, 2, 3, 4 Furthermore, recent guidelines suggest no effective medication for HFpEF. 5, 6

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which are antidiabetic drugs for promoting urinary glucose excretion, have been suggested to reduce hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in recent randomized controlled trials. 7, 8, 9 Recently, a randomized study showed that dapagliflozin decreased worsening heart failure in patients with heart failure and a reduced EF, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. 10 SGLT2 inhibitors are being studied in large trials for HFpEF, but no detailed data on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF have been obtained.

To investigate whether an SGLT2 inhibitor has preventative effects on heart failure beyond glucose‐lowering effects in patients with HFpEF, we prospectively compared luseogliflozin and alpha‐glucosidase in the MUSCAT‐HF (Management of Diabetic Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) trial. We compared the drug efficacy of luseogliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) with voglibose (an alpha‐glucosidase inhibitor), which have established safety for cardiovascular events 11 as control agents. BNP (B‐type natriuretic peptide) was used as the index of the therapeutic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and HFpEF. This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of this SGLT2 inhibitor on HFpEF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: a position statement by kasralainy nephrology group (KANG) [^117Uvee8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit cardiovascular benefits, including reduced heart failure risk and improved outcomes in patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Expanding evidence supports their use in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD, heart failure, and potentially type 1 diabetes.

Current indications for SGLT2 inhibitors include CKD, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Emerging evidence indicates these drugs are also prescribed to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Approved SGLT2 inhibitors include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The latter is the first dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor and is approved in Europe for both type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM.

As a result, SGLT2 inhibitors have become indispensable in managing CKD, DKD, and associated cardiovascular risks, underscoring their growing importance in nephrology. However, careful patient selection, monitoring, and management of potential side effects are essential.

Review Points.

Verify the latest clinical guidelines regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology.
Include recent trial data and ensure that the draft incorporates the most current evidence.
Ensure accuracy in recommended dose adjustments and monitoring protocols for patients with varying levels of kidney function.

### The SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a multicenter randomized trial [^114tJCK1]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

PRESERVED-HF was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of individuals with chronic, symptomatic HFpEF (Supplementary Table 2). The trial was conducted across 26 sites in the United States. The list of participating sites and investigators is given in Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1. The primary outcome was HF-disease-specific health status as assessed by KCCQ-CS. The study protocol is provided in the Supplementary Data.

PRESERVED-HF was an investigator-initiated trial with the concept developed, and the trial sponsored and executed by, the national coordinating center at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in collaboration with the Executive Committee (Supplementary Table 4), independent of the funding source (AstraZeneca). The study was monitored by an independent data safety and monitoring committee. Institutional review boards approved the study for all sites (Supplementary Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1), and all patients provided informed consent for research participation. The trial was conducted in accordance with the ICH E6(R1) Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Patient selection

Full inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Supplementary Table 5. Adult ambulatory patients with or without T2D, clinical diagnosis of HFpEF, LVEF ≥ 45% and NYHA class II–IV symptoms were screened for participation. Patients additionally had to have elevated natriuretic peptides (NTproBNP ≥ 225 or BNP ≥ 75 pg mL –1; if AF, NTproBNP ≥ 375 pg mL –1 or BNP ≥ 100 pg mL –1); requirement for diuretic therapy (loop, thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics) and either HF hospitalization or urgent HF visit with intravenous diuretic treatment in the past 12 months; documented elevated filling pressures on right or left heart catheterization; or echocardiographic evidence of structural heart abnormalities. Key exclusion criteria were recent hospitalization (within 7 days) for decompensated HF, eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m² at the screening visit, type 1 diabetes or previous history of DKA.
