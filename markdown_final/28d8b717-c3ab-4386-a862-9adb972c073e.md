## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recognizing and interpreting right bundle branch block (RBBB) on ECG, including diagnostic criteria, variants, acute coronary syndrome implications, prognostic significance, and management pathways. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise diagnostic criteria for complete versus incomplete RBBB. Then, I should verify the characteristic ECG morphology and lead-specific findings. Next, I will consider incomplete RBBB and how to distinguish it from mimics like Brugada. After that, I need to review the clinical contexts that change the significance of RBBB, especially acute coronary syndromes and bifascicular patterns. Finally, I will synthesize prognostic data and outline a practical evaluation and management algorithm with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criteria for complete RBBB in adults. The ACC/AHA/HRS guideline defines complete RBBB as QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, with an S wave in leads I and V6 that is either longer than the R wave or > 40 ms, and a prolonged R peak time in V1 > 50 ms while R peak time in V5–V6 remains normal, which reflects delayed right ventricular activation and terminal rightward forces; incomplete RBBB shares the same morphology but with QRS 110–119 ms, so I should double-check the QRS width before labeling complete versus incomplete RBBB [^114HH6HZ] [^111vVKZN] [^111JZsPk].

> Wait, let me verify the classic ECG morphology I expect to see. In V1–V2, I should see an RSR′ pattern with a broad terminal R′ and secondary ST-T changes directed opposite to the terminal QRS deflection, while in the lateral leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 I should see a broad, slurred terminal S wave reflecting late rightward forces; I need to ensure I am not overcalling small r′s in V1–V2 as RBBB when the QRS is narrow, since that can be a normal variant, particularly in children or with lead malposition [^116Fs872] [^113ozpDS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about incomplete RBBB. I initially thought QRS 100–119 ms might suffice, but I should correct that: in adults, incomplete RBBB is defined by the same RBBB morphology with QRS 110–119 ms, and in children the thresholds are lower; importantly, a small rsr′ in V1–V2 with normal QRS duration can be a normal variant and should not be labeled as RBBB, so I need to check lead placement and age-appropriate criteria before diagnosing incomplete RBBB [^113ozpDS] [^114HH6HZ].

> I will now examine mimics and differentials, especially Brugada patterns that can resemble incomplete RBBB. Brugada types 2–3 often show rsr′ in V1–V2 with J-point and ST-segment elevation; simple angular criteria such as the β angle can help discriminate Brugada from benign rsr′, with β > 58° favoring Brugada and supporting the need for sodium-channel challenge and specialist referral when suspected; I should confirm ST morphology and consider family history or prior syncope before concluding benign RBBB [^113eAUgq] [^113x1aFF].

> Next, I should review the clinical context because the significance of RBBB depends on when and why it appears. In asymptomatic individuals without known heart disease, isolated RBBB is often incidental and may be benign, though some cohorts show modestly increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; in contrast, new or presumably new RBBB in the setting of chest pain or acute coronary syndrome signals high risk and warrants urgent evaluation for occlusion, as TIMI 0–2 flow is common even without classic ST elevations, and mortality is high if reperfusion is delayed [^116Fs872] [^116ZC7Cj] [^113Nhnfc] [^1128ZYkm].

> Let me consider bifascicular and trifascicular patterns carefully. RBBB combined with left anterior or posterior fascicular block constitutes bifascicular block and increases the risk of progression to complete heart block; if there is also first-degree AV block, that is trifascicular disease and often mandates pacing evaluation even without symptoms, so I should check the axis, PR interval, and any prior ECGs to determine chronicity and stability [^notfound].

> I should double-check the prognostic data nuances. Population studies suggest that isolated RBBB without cardiovascular disease confers a small but statistically significant increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, whereas RBBB combined with fascicular block more clearly portends heart failure and adverse outcomes; exercise testing cohorts show reduced functional capacity and slower heart rate recovery in RBBB, which may reflect subclinical disease or conduction system degeneration, so I need to integrate symptoms, risk factors, and imaging rather than relying on the ECG alone [^116Fs872] [^116ZC7Cj] [^11549xUs].

> Now, I need to ensure the management pathway aligns with guidelines. For asymptomatic isolated RBBB, a one-time transthoracic echocardiogram is reasonable to screen for occult structural disease; if symptoms suggest intermittent bradycardia or conduction disease, ambulatory monitoring and electrophysiology study can be considered; in acute chest pain with new or presumably new RBBB, I should treat as high-risk ACS and pursue urgent coronary angiography and reperfusion irrespective of ST-segment changes, given the frequent presence of infarct-related artery occlusion and the high early mortality observed in registries [^114ACrFq] [^11198mdM] [^113Nhnfc] [^1128ZYkm].

> But wait, what if the ECG shows RBBB with concerning repolarization features outside V1–V3. I should confirm that new ST-segment elevation or ischemic T-wave abnormalities in leads outside the right precordium are not simply secondary to RBBB; the Universal Definition notes that in RBBB, new or presumed-new ST elevation ≥ 1 mm or ischemic ST-T changes outside V1–V3 may indicate acute ischemia, and absence of expected secondary ST-T changes in inferior or lateral leads in stable RBBB may actually flag underlying pathology, so I must compare with prior tracings and the clinical picture before attributing changes to conduction delay alone [^113Nhnfc] [^114uKvPv].

> Let me reconsider special populations and settings. In heart failure, RBBB is associated with mechanical dyssynchrony and less predictable response to CRT than LBBB, so if LV function is reduced and symptoms persist, advanced imaging and heart failure evaluation may refine prognosis and therapy; in athletes and aircrew, incomplete RBBB is common and often benign, but complete RBBB merits echocardiography and exercise testing to exclude structural disease before clearance [^113t3ED3] [^113YKV74] [^114hxQBM].

> In summary, I should confirm RBBB using the ACC/AHA/HRS criteria with QRS ≥ 120 ms, appropriate terminal forces, and lead-specific morphology, distinguish complete from incomplete forms, screen for mimics like Brugada when morphology is atypical, contextualize the finding by chronicity and symptoms, and escalate promptly to invasive evaluation when RBBB is new in the setting of suspected ACS; with this structured approach, I can avoid both over-calling benign variants and missing high-risk presentations that require urgent reperfusion and pacing decisions [^114HH6HZ] [^113Nhnfc] [^1128ZYkm].

Right bundle branch block (RBB) on ECG is defined by a **QRS duration ≥ 120 ms** with an **rsR' pattern in V1–V2** and a broad terminal S wave in lateral leads (I, V5–V6) [^116Fs872]. It reflects delayed right ventricular activation and is diagnosed when these features are present without other causes of QRS widening. RBBB can be benign in healthy individuals, but new RBBB — especially with symptoms — warrants evaluation for underlying structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w] [^117Kp8Qf]. Management is guided by the cause and symptoms; isolated RBBB without disease requires no treatment, whereas new or symptomatic cases need targeted workup and therapy [^11198mdM].

## Electrocardiographic criteria for RBBB

The following criteria are **required for diagnosis** of RBBB [^114HH6HZ]:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| QRS duration | ≥ 120 ms in adults [^114HH6HZ] |
| Terminal R wave | - R' in V1–V2 (rsR' or rSR') <br/> - R' > R <br/> - R peak time > 50 ms in V1 [^114HH6HZ] |
| Terminal S wave | - Broad, slurred S in I, V5, V6 <br/> - S duration > R or > 40 ms [^114HH6HZ] |
| Secondary ST-T | - ST depression and T inversion in V1–V2 <br/> - Opposite to QRS [^11549xUs] |

---

Incomplete RBBB shows the same morphology with **QRS 110–119 ms** [^111JZsPk].

---

## Clinical significance of RBBB

RBBB may be **benign in healthy individuals**, but it can also signal underlying disease:

- **Benign**: Common in healthy individuals; often incidental [^116Fs872].
- **Pathological**: Associated with structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w] [^117Kp8Qf].
- **Prognosis**: New RBBB in acute settings (e.g. MI, PE) indicates higher risk and warrants evaluation [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w].

---

## Common causes of RBBB

RBBB has diverse **etiologies**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Structural heart disease | - Coronary artery disease <br/> - Myocardial infarction <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Cardiomyopathies [^113tiDpV] |
| Pulmonary conditions | - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Chronic lung disease <br/> - Pulmonary hypertension [^113e9n7w] |
| Congenital heart disease | - Atrial septal defect <br/> - Ventricular septal defect <br/> - Tetralogy of Fallot [^notfound] |
| Degenerative conduction disease | - Lenègre-Lev disease <br/> - Age-related fibrosis [^113tiDpV] |
| Acute conditions | - Acute coronary syndrome <br/> - Myocarditis <br/> - Pulmonary embolism [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on the **underlying cause and symptoms**:

- **Isolated RBBB**: No treatment needed; observe [^11198mdM].
- **New RBBB with symptoms**: Evaluate for acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or structural heart disease [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w].
- **Underlying disease**: Treat the cause (e.g. reperfusion for MI, anticoagulation for PE, valve surgery for structural disease) [^1128ZYkm] [^113e9n7w].
- **Progressive conduction disease**: Consider pacemaker if bifascicular or trifascicular block with symptoms or AV block [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **cause and context**. Isolated RBBB generally confers a benign outlook, whereas RBBB in acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism signals higher risk and worse outcomes [^113Nhnfc] [^113e9n7w]. Persistent RBBB after MI or with structural disease is associated with increased mortality and complications [^111gcFcm].

---

Right bundle branch block on ECG is defined by QRS ≥ 120 ms with rsR' in V1–V2 and a broad terminal S in lateral leads; it may be benign or indicate significant disease, so **new or symptomatic RBBB requires targeted evaluation and management** [^114HH6HZ] [^11198mdM].

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block? [^113YLuUS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the authors did not analyze patients with isolated RBBB versus those with concomitant fascicular blocks (see above). Thus, we do not know if it is the RBBB itself or only RBBB associated with fascicular block that predicts mortality.

Thus, the current study of mostly asymptomatic patients added an important piece of information about the long‐term significance of RBBB in patients without known heart disease; yet, it has not solved the mystery as to the underlying pathophysiological characteristics and the mechanism of increased mortality in these patients.

### Mortality in patients with right bundle-branch block in the absence of cardiovascular disease [^116Fs872]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Right bundle‐branch block (RBBB) is defined by ECG findings suggestive of either significant delay or lack of electrical conduction through the RBB and distal Purkinje fibers, resulting in ventricular activation occurring primarily via the left bundle branch and fascicular system. 1 The prevalence of RBBB has been reported to be in the range of 0.2% to 1.3%. 1 Typically, it is an incidental finding noted on electrocardiography and is diagnosed using the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society criteria. 2 These criteria consist of 3 parameters: (1) a QRS duration > 120 ms, (2) a secondary R wave in V 1 or V 2, and (3) a wide, slurred S wave in leads I, V 5, and V 6. 2

In some cases, however, RBBB can be a signal of other, more sinister underlying conditions, including but not limited to ischemic, inflammatory, or infiltrative heart disease as well as pulmonary embolism. 1, 3, 4, 5 In patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart failure (HF), RBBB is known to be a predictor of negative outcomes. 6, 7, 8 Multiple studies evaluating a range of acute coronary syndrome presentations, including unstable angina and ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, have demonstrated that RBBB is an independent predictor of in‐hospital and early (≈6 month) mortality. 6, 7, 9 Moreover, RBBB has been shown to be an independent predictor of decreased right ventricular ejection fraction (EF), which in itself is a predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. 10

Whether the association between RBBB and mortality, as well as other adverse outcomes, remains in patients without prior CVD is controversial. Data from the Copenhagen City Heart Study, for example, which included 18 441 participants without prior myocardial infarction or HF, found that RBBB was a strong predictor of increased all‐cause mortality and cardiac death. 11 In contrast, a separate study conducted in women led by the Women's Health Initiative, did not find a significant relationship between RBBB and mortality in participants without CVD. 12

Thus, we sought to determine the prevalence and significance of RBBB on long‐term outcomes, including mortality, in patients without underlying CVD.

Right bundle-branch block (RBBB) in the patient with acute coronary syndrome is a marker of significant potential cardiovascular risk; the RBBB pattern in the patient with acute coronary syndrome identifies a subgroup of patients with quite high short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Right bundle-branch block is not an uncommon finding on an electrocardiogram in the emergency department patient, noted incidentally and thus without clinical import or, conversely, encountered in the early phase of significant cardiovascular dysfunction. This review will address RBBB in the acute coronary syndrome setting.

### Significance of an isolated new right bundle branch block in a patient with chest pain [^1146wDxB]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is a common presenting symptom in emergency departments, and a typical manifestation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recognition of ECG changes in AMI is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) may be an isolated sign of AMI, and was previously considered as a criterion for fibrinolytic therapy. Since the most recent European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in 2013, RBBB alone is no longer considered a diagnostic criterion of AMI, even if it occurs in the context of acute chest pain, as RBBB does not usually interfere with the interpretation of ST-segment alteration. Our case illustrates an acute septal myocardial infarction with an isolated RBBB, and thus the importance of recognising this pattern in order to permit timely diagnosis and treatment.

### Left bundle-branch block – pathophysiology, prognosis, and clinical management [^114iPUXw]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Given its broad use as a screening tool, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has largely become one of the most common diagnostic tests performed in routine clinical practice. As a result, the finding of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) in the absence of a well-defined clinical setting has become relatively frequent and raises questions and often concerns. While in the absence of clinically detectable heart disease LBBB does not necessarily imply poor outcomes, physicians should be aware of the role of LBBB in stratifying risk of cardiovascular events and death in subjects with both ischemic and nonischemic heart disease. This paper reviews historical landmarks, pathophysiologic features, prognostic implications, and clinical management of LBBB in apparently healthy subjects and those with heart disease.

Right bundle-branch block and LVH criteria — Right bundle-branch block (RBBB) "reduces the amplitude of the S wave in the right precordial leads and tends to reduce the sensitivity of electrocardiographic criteria for LVH". Ancillary features "have enhanced value for the diagnosis of LVH in the presence of RBBB". Proposed RBBB-specific thresholds include "SV1 greater than 2 mm (0.2 mV), RV5–6 greater than 15 mm (1.5 mV)", with reported "sensitivities of 46% to 68% and specificities of 57% to 71%".

Clinical manifestations of conduction disorders — the manifestations primarily depend on the underlying cause; patients may often be asymptomatic, particularly in isolated right bundle branch block (RBBB) or fascicular block, whereas patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) may present with heart failure that may be attributable to cardiac dyssynchrony or an underlying cardiomyopathy; the document uses definitions from the "AHA/ACCF/HRS Recommendations for the Standardization and Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram: Part III: Intraventricular Conduction Disturbances", while acknowledging that these recommendations are not without controversy.

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block? [^11549xUs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

If patients with concomitant imaging stress test had been included, reporting the data could have shed light on the issue of sensitivity to detect ischemia. Confirming the findings in previous studies, Gaba et al 18 reported that patients with RBBB were older than those without RBBB. In addition, peak heart rate was significantly lower and metabolic equivalents achieved was significantly lower. The percentage of the patients reaching target heart rate and the average percentage of the age‐adjusted maximal heart rate reached are not reported. With an average peak heart rate of 134.4 beats per minute and average age of 59 years (Tables 1 and 3), it is possible that a higher percentage of patients with RBBB did not reach target heart rate and, therefore, significant ischemia could have been missed. Moreover, patients with RBBB often have ST depression in the right precordial leads that become deeper during exercise. Isolated ST depression in V1 to V3 in patients with RBBB is usually not interpreted as a sign of ischemia. Studying a cohort of patients who underwent pharmacologic stress test could answer the question of whether RBBB at rest is associated with extensive coronary artery disease and worse prognosis, as was recently suggested for patients with acute coronary syndromes. 19, 20, 21

In the current cohort, patients with RBBB had lower exercise capacity, had slower heart rate recovery, and more often need to stop the test because of dyspnea compared with the patients without RBBB. 18 Thus, RBBB can be a marker for underlying subclinical cardiac conditions, including diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function; hypertension was more frequent in the patients with RBBB than in those without.

In addition, it is unclear whether the study included only patients with RBBB at baseline ECG in the RBBB group or also those with exercise‐induced RBBB. Stein et al reported that the mortality of patients with exercise‐induced RBBB during a stress test is relatively high. 22 However, these patients were older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients without exercise‐induced RBBB. After adjusting for age, exercise‐induced RBBB was no longer significantly associated with all‐cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. 22

### Primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block: should new onset right bundle branch block be added to future guidelines as an indication for reperfusion therapy? [^112EUmVU]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients are well known to carry the high mortality risk. Nevertheless, the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) list only LBBB as an indication for urgent reperfusion therapy. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines provide similar recommendations. Thus, the current guideline-recommended electrocardiographic (ECG) indications for reperfusion therapy in AMI include ST-segment elevation (STE) and LBBB of new or unknown onset. It is not well known whether also new or unknown onset RBBB should be an indication for reperfusion therapy, especially in the modern era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of this analysis was to investigate the coronary angiographic (CAG) findings, reperfusion therapies used, and in-hospital outcomes of patients with AMI presenting with RBBB when compared with those presenting with LBBB or with other ECG patterns.

### Mortality in patients with right bundle-branch block in the absence of cardiovascular disease [^114zZGZ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that patients with RBBB without prior diagnosis of CVD have an increased risk of cardiovascular‐related and all‐cause mortality. Our data also suggest that these patients have a higher likelihood of reduced exercise capacity compared with those without RBBB. Given the potential significance of these findings, these data merit further prospective and multicenter evaluation.

Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) requires "QRS duration ≥ 120 ms in adults" with "R peak time ≥ 60 ms in leads V5 and V6, but normal in leads V1, V2, and V3, when small initial r waves can be discerned in the precordial leads", and incomplete LBBB is defined by "QRS duration between 110 and 119 ms in adults".

For complete LBBB in adults, QRS duration is ≥ 120 ms and R peak time is > 60 ms in leads V5 and V6; incomplete LBBB is defined by QRS duration between 110 and 119 ms in adults.

### Absence of ST-segment elevation in inferior and lateral leads in patients with complete right bundle branch block is an index of underlying cardiac pathology [^114uKvPv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent report called attention to the nature of the ST-segment elevation (STSE) in some or all inferior and/or lateral electrocardiogram (ECG) leads (i.e. I, II, III, aVL, aVF, V 5, and V 6), which are frequently encountered in patients with stable or transient complete right bundle branch block (RBBB). These STSEs represent secondary repolarization changes due to late depolarization RBBB alterations; are stable over the course of many years in patients with RBBB; and do not reflect cardiac pathology, as the automated ECG interpretation algorithms erroneously indicate. Indeed, the absence of such STSEs in patients with RBBB suggests the presence of underlying acute or old myocardial infarction, acute myocardial ischemia, or left ventricular hypertrophy and thus constitute an as yet undescribed ECG index of cardiovascular pathology.

Complete right bundle-branch block (RBBB) — QRS duration criterion is defined as QRS duration greater than or equal to 120 ms in adults, greater than 100 ms in children ages 4 to 16 years, and greater than 90 ms in children less than 4 years of age.

### Clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of acute coronary syndrome in patients with right bundle branch block on presentation [^111gcFcm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

We examined the relations between right bundle branch block (RBBB) and clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes among a broad spectrum of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Admission electrocardiograms of patients enrolled in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) electrocardiogram substudy and the Canadian ACS Registry I were analyzed independently at a blinded core laboratory. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the independent prognostic significance of admission RBBB on in-hospital and 6-month mortality. Of 11,830 eligible patients with ACS (mean age 65; 66% non-ST-elevation ACS), 5% had RBBB. RBBB on admission was associated with older age, male sex, more cardiovascular risk factors, worse Killip class, and higher GRACE risk score (all p < 0.01). Patients with RBBB less frequently received in-hospital cardiac catheterization, coronary revascularization, or reperfusion therapy (all p < 0.05). The RBBB group had higher unadjusted in-hospital (8.8% vs 3.8%, p < 0.001) and 6-month mortality rates (15.1% vs 7.6%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for established prognostic factors in the GRACE risk score, RBBB was a significant independent predictor of in-hospital death (odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07, p = 0.039), but not cumulative 6-month mortality (odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.74, p = 0.098). There was no significant interaction between RBBB and the type of ACS for either in-hospital or 6-month mortality (both p > 0.50). In conclusion, across a spectrum of ACS, RBBB was associated with preexisting cardiovascular disease, high-risk clinical features, fewer cardiac interventions, and worse unadjusted outcomes. After adjusting for components of the GRACE risk score, RBBB was a significant independent predictor of early mortality.

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block? [^116ZC7Cj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Bussink et al reported on the outcomes of subjects with RBBB in the general population, using the CCHS (Copenhagen City Heart Study). 14 Among 18 441 participants without history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or left BBB, 1.4% of the men and 0.5% of the women had RBBB and 4.7% and 2.3% had incomplete RBBB, respectively. RBBB was associated with increased risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality (the age‐adjusted HR was 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54] and 1.87 [95% CI, 1.48–2.36], respectively). In addition, RBBB was associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and pacemaker implantation, but not with chronic heart failure. A similar risk was detected in men and women. 14 Incomplete RBBB was not associated with increased risk. 14

In the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) Study, a total of 159 patients of 14 478 patients included in the study had RBBB. Over a follow‐up of 18 years, RBBB combined with either LAFB or left posterior fascicular block, but not lone RBBB, were predictors of heart failure. 15

Among 2981 patients without baseline cardiovascular events followed up at primary health centers in Spain for 5 years, 4.6% had incomplete RBBB and 3.2% had complete RBBB. In univariate analysis, complete RBBB was associated with increased all‐cause mortality, but only bifascicular block (RBBB with LAFB or left posterior fascicular block) was significant after adjusting for confounders. 16 Incomplete RBBB was not associated with increased risk. 16

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Conduction disorders — clinical manifestations depend on the underlying cause; patients may often be asymptomatic in isolated right bundle branch block (RBBB) or fascicular block, whereas left bundle branch block (LBBB) may present with heart failure that may be attributable to cardiac dyssynchrony or underlying cardiomyopathy.

### Three-year follow-up of patients with right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads: Japanese registry of Brugada syndrome. idiopathic ventricular fibrillation investigators [^114rn4pK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the prevalence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST segment elevation in the working Japanese population, as well as the event rate during a three-year prospective follow-up period.

Background

A poor prognosis of RBBB and ST segment elevation has been reported in Europe and South America, even in asymptomatic patients; however, a large population of asymptomatic patients with sporadic RBBB and ST segment elevation has not been studied.

Methods

Ten thousand 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained during annual check-ups of working adults in the Tokyo area. This three-year prospective follow-up study consisted of 105 patients, including 20 with ventricular fibrillation, 18 with syncope and 67 who were asymptomatic. They were registered from 46 institutions in Japan.

Results

The prevalence of ECG abnormalities in working adults was 0.16%. A coved-type ST segment elevation was related to a history of cardiac events, and 18% of registered patients had PR prolongation and 9.5% had left-axis deviation. The cumulative cardiac event-free rate was 67.6% in the symptomatic group and 93.4% in the asymptomatic group (p = 0.0004) after three years.

Conclusions

The recurrence rate of cardiac events in symptomatic patients was similar to that reported previously, but it was very low in sporadic asymptomatic patients. The ECG findings may help us to select patients for further examination and more accurate evaluation of their prognoses.

Heart rate recovery after exercise and functional exercise capacity as measured by metabolic equivalent tasks was significantly slower and lower, respectively, in patients with RBBB compared with those without the rhythm abnormality. This may be because of the hemodynamic effects of having a RBBB as described above, that is greater dyssynchrony in ventricular relaxation (because of depolarization dyssynchrony), ventricular remodeling, and resultant development of HF or arrhythmias. 12 Alternatively, it is possible that the RBBB suggests some element of premature conduction disease that may lead to subtle or subclinical chronotropic abnormalities prior to stress testing.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — bundle branch block: For right bundle branch block (RBBB, adults), complete RBBB requires QRS duration ≥ 120 ms with an S wave of greater duration than R wave or > 40 ms in leads I and V6 in adults and normal R peak time in leads V5 and V6 but > 50 ms in lead V1; incomplete RBBB has the same morphology but with a QRS duration between 110 and 119 ms. For left bundle branch block (LBBB, adults), complete LBBB includes QRS duration ≥ 120 ms in adults, absent Q waves in leads I, V5, and V6 except a narrow Q wave in aVL, R peak time ≥ 60 ms in leads V5 and V6 but normal in V1, V2, and V3, and ST and T waves usually opposite in direction to QRS. Incomplete LBBB is characterized by QRS duration between 110 and 119 ms in adults, presence of left ventricular hypertrophy pattern, and absence of Q wave in leads I, V5, and V6.

Right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevations

ST-segment elevations (as defined in the methods section) were recognizable on electrocardiograms of 226 (53%) RBBB patients, while in 201 (47%) of patients presenting with AMI and RBBB no STEs could be found. TIMI flow 0–2 was found on emergent coronary angiography among 135 (67%) patients with RBBB and no STEs and 205 (91%) of those who had RBBB and STEs.

### Primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block: should new onset right bundle branch block be added to future guidelines as an indication for reperfusion therapy? [^1128ZYkm]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The current guidelines recommend reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB). Surprisingly, the right bundle branch block (RBBB) is not listed as an indication for reperfusion therapy. This study analysed patients with AMI presenting with RBBB [with or without left anterior hemiblock (LAH) or left posterior hemiblock (LPH)] and compared them with those presenting with LBBB or with other electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. The aim was to describe angiographic patterns and primary angioplasty use in AMI patients with RBBB.

Methods and Results

A cohort of 6742 patients with AMI admitted to eight participating hospitals was analysed. Baseline clinical characteristics, ECG patterns, coronary angiographic, and echocardiographic data were correlated with the reperfusion therapies used and with in-hospital outcomes. Right bundle branch block was present in 6.3% of AMI patients: 2.8% had RBBB alone, 3.2% had RBBB + LAH, and 0.3% had RBBB + LPH. TIMI flow 0 in the infarct-related artery was present in 51.7% of RBBB patients vs. 39.4% of LBBB patients (P = 0.023). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 80.1% of RBBB patients vs. 68.3% of LBBB patients (P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality of RBBB patients was similar to LBBB (14.3 vs. 13.1%, P = 0.661). Patients with new or presumably new blocks had the highest (LBBB 15.8% and RBBB 15.4%) incidence of cardiogenic shock from all ECG subgroups. Percutaneous coronary intervention was done more frequently (84.8%) in patients with new or presumably new RBBB when compared with other patients with blocks (old RBBB 66.0%, old LBBB 62.3%, new or presumably new LBBB 73.0%). In-hospital mortality was highest (18.8%) among patients presenting with new or presumably new RBBB, followed by new or presumably new LBBB (13.2%), old LBBB (10.1%), and old RBBB (6.4%). Among 35 patients with acute left main coronary artery occlusion, 26% presented with RBBB (mostly with LAH) on the admission ECG.

Conclusion

Acute myocardial infarction with RBBB is frequently caused by the complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery and is more frequently treated with primary PCI when compared with AMI + LBBB. In-hospital mortality of patients with AMI and RBBB is highest from all ECG presentations of AMI. Restoration of coronary flow by primary PCI may lead to resolution of the conduction delay on the discharge ECG. Right bundle branch block should strongly be considered for listing in future guidelines as a standard indication for reperfusion therapy, in the same way as LBBB.

### Primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block: should new onset right bundle branch block be added to future guidelines as an indication for reperfusion therapy? [^1163Xwdf]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Acute myocardial infarction with new or presumably new RBBB on the admission ECG is frequently related with complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery and with primary PCI treatment when compared with AMI + LBBB. In-hospital mortality of patients with AMI and new or presumably new RBBB (especially when the block is bifascicular) is highest from all ECG presentations of AMI. Restoration of coronary flow by primary PCI may lead to resolution of RBBB on the discharge ECG.

New or presumably new RBBB (± LAH or LPH) should be listed in future guidelines as a standard indication (possibly class I, level C) for reperfusion therapy, in the same way as LBBB, i.e. irrespective of the presence or absence of ST-segment denivelations.

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — electrocardiography (ECG) definitions specify that heart rate (bpm) is "A measurement that describes the frequency of rate of contractions of the heart measured within a unit time". LBBB is described as "a cardiac conduction abnormality seen on the ECG. In this condition, activation of the left ventricle of the heart is delayed, which causes the left ventricle to contract later than the right ventricle". RBBB is "a heart block in the right bundle branch of the electrical conduction system". The presence of abnormal Q waves is defined as " ≥ 0.03 s in width and ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in depth in at least 2 contiguous leads". The QTc interval is "The time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac cycle as corrected with a nonspecific correction formula", and heart block is "An electrocardiographic finding of blocked cardiac electrical impulses along the fibers normally responsible for impulse conduction".

A review of Wellens' syndrome, its criteria and pathophysiology, and its proposed appearance in the setting of LBBB is presented.

Electrocardiography (ECG) conduction abnormalities — left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, and presence of abnormal Q waves — are defined with explicit thresholds. LBBB is an electrocardiographic finding of delayed conduction to the left ventricle with absence of Q waves in leads V5, V6, I, and aVL and with QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. RBBB is an electrocardiographic finding of delayed conduction to the right ventricle with QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay is a widened QRS duration typically > 110 ms that does not meet morphological criteria for standard bundle branch or fascicular block patterns. Abnormal Q waves are defined as ≥ 0.03 s in width and ≥ 1 mm (0.1 mV) in depth in at least 2 contiguous leads.

Right bundle branch block and ST-segment shifts/Q waves

Some authors, request for the diagnosis of AIM with RBBB other ECG changes (e.g. ST-segment elevations) to be present, while this is not the case for LBBB (where it is generally accepted that LBBB masks ST-segment shifts). Right bundle branch block is thought not to mask the repolarization phase changes or Q waves, therefore other ECG changes have to be present to conclude the diagnosis of AIM. However, otherswarn before this 'clear-cut' opinion pointing out that minor ST elevations in the anterior leads (V1–V4) can be missed due to compensation by pseudo-normalization of the negative T waves. Our experience showed that even in large infarcts (caused by left main or proximal LAD coronary artery occlusion) bifascicular block (RBBB + LAH or rarely RBBB + LPH) may occur without typical STEs and thus a large life threatening AMI might be missed when ST elevations are required. Authors of this study repeatedly experienced mistakes in the clinical decision making in the real life practice, when patients with ischaemic symptoms and new or presumably new RBBB (but without STEs) were neither referred to urgent coronary angiography ± PCI nor treated by thrombolysis, sometimes with catastrophic consequences. This bad experience was the actual trigger for this study.

It has been also shown that interpretation of Q-waves can be tricky in the presence of RBBB. Gussak et al.showed that RBBB after myocardial infarction shortened Q wave duration, thus enabling false-negative diagnosis of inferior myocardial infarction. Also the term 'RBBB-dependent Q-wave' was introduced by Rosenbaum et al.who described appearance of new Q waves in leads V1–V2 that disappeared after restoration of normal conduction. Thus false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of myocardial infarction can be made when describing ECG with RBBB in suspicion of myocardial infarction.

Study limitations

The main study limitation is a retrospective character of analysis. However, all participating centres enrol AMI patients to their own or nationwide registries, thus minimizing the risk of losing a subject from analysis. Another limitation relates to the fact that coronary angiography analysis was not performed in a core lab and by blinded manner. However, we have analysed 'real life' data similar to other registries published and this is not a comparison of different treatment approaches.

### Ventricular fibrillation associated with complete right bundle branch block [^111zjvTv]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A substantial number of patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) present with no specific electrocardiographic (ECG) findings.

Objective

To evaluate complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) in patients with IVF.

Methods

Patients with IVF showing complete RBBB were included in the present study. Structural and primary electrical diseases were excluded, and provocation tests were performed to exclude the presence of spastic angina or Brugada syndrome (BrS). The prevalence of complete RBBB and the clinical and ECG parameters were compared either in patients with IVF who did not show RBBB or in the general population and age and sex comparable controls with RBBB.

Results

Of 96 patients with IVF, 9 patients were excluded for the presence of BrS. Of 87 patients studied, 10 (11.5%) patients showed complete RBBB. None had structural heart diseases, BrS, or coronary spasms. The mean age was 44 ± 15 years, and 8 of 10 patients were men. Among the ECG parameters, only the QRS duration was different from that of the other patients with IVF who did not show complete RBBB. Ventricular fibrillation recurred in 3:2 in the form of storms, which were well suppressed by isoproterenol. Complete RBBB was found less often in control subjects (1.37%; P < .0001), and the QRS duration was more prolonged in patients with IVF: 139 ± 10ms vs 150 ± 14ms (P = 0.0061).

Conclusions

Complete RBBB exists more often in patients with IVF than in controls. A prolonged QRS complex suggests a conduction abnormality. Our findings warrant further investigation of the role of RBBB in the development of arrhythmias in patients with IVF.

### Impact of quantitative ST-T analysis in patients with suspected myocardial infarction presenting with right bundle branch block [^111S6uGk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a well-known risk feature in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and a rapid invasive management is recommended, data supporting this strategy for patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) is less robust.

Methods

In total, 2139 patients with suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were triaged to acute coronary angiography based on a prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Sensitivity and specificity for STEMI-ECG criteria were compared in RBBB and non-BBB patients. Adjusted hazard ratios for 1-year overall mortality were computed.

Results

STEMI was adjudicated in 1832/2139 (85.6%) of all patients and in 102/117 (87.2%) of RBBB patients. ST-segment deviation followed typical ST-T patterns in most RBBB patients. Of 17 RBBB patients without significant ST changes, STEMI was adjudicated in 14 (82%). Diagnostic accuracy of STEMI criteria was comparable in RBBB and non-RBBB patients for inferior (sensitivity: 51.1% vs 59.1%, P = 0.14; specificity: 66.7% vs 52.1%, P = 0.33) and anterior STEMI (sensitivity: 35.2% vs 36.6%, P = 0.80; specificity: 58.3% vs 49.5%, P = 0.55). Diagnostic performance was lower for lateral STEMI in RBBB patients (sensitivity: 14.8% vs 4.4%, P = 0.001; specificity: 75.0% vs 98.4%, P < .001). Patients with RBBB had higher 1-year mortality compared with non-BBB patients (hazard ratio 2.3%; 95% confidence interval, 1.25–4.21.

Conclusion

ECG criteria used for detection of STEMI showed comparable diagnostic accuracy in RBBB and non-BBB patients. However, STEMI was frequently present in RBBB patients not fulfilling diagnostic ECG criteria. RBBB patients showed poorer outcome after 1 year. Consequently, the presence of RBBB in suspected STEMI cases signifies a high-risk feature, aligning with established guidelines.

### Electrocardiographic features and prevalence of bilateral bundle-branch delay [^112Do6G4]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Definitive diagnosis of bilateral bundle-branch delay/block may be made when catheter-induced right bundle-branch block (RBBB) develops in patients with baseline left bundle-branch (LBB) block. We hypothesized that a RBBB pattern with absent S waves in leads I and aVL will identify bilateral bundle-branch delay/block.

Methods and Results

Fifty patients developing transient RBBB pattern in lead V1 during right heart catheterization were studied. Patients were grouped according to whether the baseline ECG demonstrated a normal QRS, left fascicular blocks, or LBB block pattern. The RBBB morphologies in each group were compared. The prevalence of bilateral bundle-branch delay/block pattern was examined in our hospital ECG database. All patients with baseline normal QRS complexes (n = 30) or left fascicular blocks (4 anterior, 5 posterior) developed a typical RBBB pattern. Among the 11 patients with a baseline LBB block pattern, 7 developed an atypical RBBB pattern with absent S waves in leads I and aVL and the remaining 4 demonstrated a typical RBBB. The absence of S waves in leads I and aVL during RBBB was 100% specific and 64% sensitive for the presence of pre-existing LBB block. Among the consecutive 2253 hospitalized patients with RBBB, 34 (1.5%) had the bilateral bundle-branch delay/block pattern.

Conclusions

An ECG pattern of RBBB in lead V1 with absent S wave in leads I and aVL indicates concomitant LBB delay. Pure RBBB and bifascicular blocks are associated with S waves in leads I and aVL.

### Masquerading bundle branch block: an often missed electrophysiological event [^115rYdGY]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

First described by Justin L. Richman and Louis Wolff in 1954, masquerading bundle branch block (MBBB) is an ECG pattern of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) in precordial leads and complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) in limb leads with qR waves or absent S waves in lead aVR or I. There are two described patterns of MBBB, namely, the standard type and the precordial type.

The presence of a MBBB pattern on the electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates severe fibrotic degeneration of the left bundle pathways and a remarkably elevated risk of progression to complete atrioventricular dissociation. It is associated with high mortality (41.4%) and pacemaker insertion (38.9%), with combined endpoints of 80.2% over 4 years.

### Catheter-induced right bundle branch block: practical implications for the cardiac electrophysiologist [^116KHNui]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The right bundle branch (RBB), due to its endocardial course, is susceptible to traumatic block caused by "bumping" during right-heart catheterization. In the era of cardiac electrophysiology, catheter-induced RBB block (CI-RBBB) has become a common phenomenon observed during electrophysiological studies and catheter ablation procedures. While typically transient, it may persist for the entire procedure time. Compared to pre-existing RBBB, the transient nature of CI-RBBB allows for comparative analysis relative to the baseline rhythm. Furthermore, unlike functional RBBB, it occurs at similar heart rates, making the comparison of conduction intervals more reliable. While CI-RBBB can provide valuable diagnostic information in various conditions, it is often overlooked by cardiac electrophysiologists. Though it is usually a benign and self-limiting conduction defect, it may occasionally lead to diagnostic difficulties, pitfalls, or undesired consequences. Avoidance of CI-RBBB is advised in the presence of baseline complete left bundle branch block and when approaching arrhythmic substrates linked to the right His-Purkinje-System, such as fasciculo-ventricular pathways, bundle branch reentry, and right-Purkinje focal ventricular arrhythmias. This article aims to provide a comprehensive practical review of the electrophysiological phenomena related to CI-RBBB and its impact on the intrinsic conduction system and various arrhythmic substrates.

3.2.1. Resting 12-Lead Electrocardiogram

Recommendations for resting 12-lead ECG

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

A 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is the first diagnostic test that should be performed for any patient with a stable, wide, QRS complex tachycardia to differentiate VT from SVT prior to attempts to terminate the tachycardia. Criteria that support a diagnosis of VT include AV dissociation, a QRS complex > 0.14 seconds, monophasic R wave in aVR, positively or negatively concordant QRS complexes in the precordial leads, the absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads, and an RS interval > 100 ms in at least 1 precordial lead. For patients with preexisting bundle branch block, comparison of the QRS morphology during sinus rhythm with QRS morphology during wide complex tachycardia is important. Various QRS morphologies (eg, bundle branch block pattern) strongly support the diagnosis of VT. An identical QRS complex during sinus rhythm and broad QRS tachycardia, however, does not rule out the presence of bundle branch reentry (BBR) tachycardia. Patients without SHD can present with idiopathic VT (eg, fascicular VT) that can be easily recognized by 12-lead ECG. For nonsustained VAs (PVCs or nonsustained VT), the 12-lead QRS morphology is critical to allow for identification of the SOO. Idiopathic VAs (eg, right and left OT VAs, PVCs from the aortic SV, papillary muscle VAs) can be recognized, given they exhibit characteristic ECG patterns (see Section 5.2).
A 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm is helpful to evaluate the presence of underlying heart disease and might be a clue for scar location and origins of related VAs, such as inferior wall or anterior wall Q waves. An inherited arrhythmia disorder can also be identified, such as ARVC (epsilon waves and/or inverted T waves in right precordial leads), long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome (coved-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads), and ChD (right bundle branch block [RBBB] and/or left anterior hemiblock). In patients with SHD, QRS duration and the presence of conduction abnormalities might provide additional prognostic information.

Electrocardiographic patterns

Electrocardiographic reading was done by the treating cardiologist. Electrocardiograms from all patients with RBBB have been reviewed once more at the time of this manuscript preparation by another independent cardiologist. The patients were divided into the following subgroups based on the first (admission) ECG:
ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI, n = 3447, i.e. 51.1%): persistent STEs in at least two contiguous leads (≥ 2 mm in the chest leads or ≥ 1 mm in the extremity leads),
ST-segment depression acute myocardial infarction (STDMI, n = 907, i.e. 13.5%): horizontal or descending ST-segment depressions in at least two contiguous leads (≥ 2 mm in the chest leads or ≥ 1 mm in the extremity leads),
acute myocardial infarction with LBBB, irrespective of any ST-segment deviations were present on ECG (LBBB-MI, n = 291, i.e. 4.3%): QRS ≥ 120 ms and LBBB shape,
acute myocardial infarction with RBBB, irrespective of any ST-segment deviations were present on ECG (RBBB-MI, n = 427, i.e. 6.3%) with subgroups of RBBB alone (2.8%), RBBB + left anterior hemiblock (LAH) (3.2%), RBBB + left posterior hemiblock (LPH) (0.3%): QRS ≥ 120 ms and RBBB shape, electrical axis extreme left (> −45°) for LAH, respectively, extreme right (> +105°) for LPH. In all RBBB patients, a special care was taken to describe the presence or absence of STEs and all ECGs were once more analysed by an independent cardiologist.
acute myocardial infarction with other ECG (other ECG-MI, n = 1670, i.e. 24.8%): any other ECG patterns (negative T waves, small ST shifts not fulfilling the above criteria, non-specific or even negative ECG).

The information whether any bundle branch block (BBB) is old, new, or unknown origin and whether BBB persisted or disappeared during the hospital stay was collected. Analyses in this manuscript are done with all RBBB (including bifascicular blocks) as one patient group (i.e. RBBB ± LAH or LPH).

### Electrocardiographic features of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia [^112hWBCT]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to reevaluate the ECG features of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). The second objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the standard and newly proposed diagnostic ECG markers in the presence of a right bundle-branch block (RBBB).

Methods and Results

One hundred patients with ARVD (57 men; aged 39 ± 15 years) and 57 controls (21 men; aged 40 ± 17 years) were included. Among the 100 patients with ARVD, a complete RBBB was present in 17 patients, and 15 patients had an incomplete RBBB. T-wave inversion through V(3) demonstrated optimal sensitivity and specificity in both ARVD patients without a complete RBBB or incomplete RBBB (71% [95% confidence interval, 58% to 81%] and 96% [95% confidence interval, 81% to 100%], respectively) and in ARVD patients with incomplete RBBB (73% [95% confidence interval, 45% to 92%] and 95% [95% confidence interval, 77% to 100%], respectively). Between ARVD patients and controls with a complete RBBB, the only 2 parameters that differed were the prevalence of T-wave inversion through V(4) (59% versus 12%, respectively; P < 0.05) and an r'/s ratio in V(1) < 1 (88% versus 14%, respectively; P < 0.005). In ARVD patients with complete RBBB, the most sensitive and specific parameter was an r'/s ratio < 1.

Conclusions

We evaluated comprehensively the diagnostic value of ECG markers for ARVD. On the basis of the findings, we propose an algorithm, with examination of QRS morphology being the first step, for ECG evaluation of ARVD patients. Definite criteria are then applied on the basis of the presence of no RBBB, incomplete RBBB, and complete RBBB to obtain the best diagnostic utility of the ECG.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^113Nhnfc]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial infarction — conduction disturbances and pacemakers — diagnosis is complicated by conduction-related ST-T changes, with specific electrocardiogram (ECG) findings that may indicate acute ischemia. Comparison to a preadmission ECG may be helpful if it "does not delay time to treatment". Ischemic symptoms with presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) or right bundle branch block (RBBB) that is not rate-related are "associated with an adverse prognosis". In LBBB, "ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm concordant with the QRS complex in any lead may be an indicator of acute myocardial ischemia", and "similar findings can be useful" in right ventricular paced rhythms; for some non–pacemaker-dependent patients, temporarily switching off the pacemaker "may also be useful", though interpretation must consider "stimulation-induced changes (electrical memory)". In RBBB, "new or presumed new ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm, or ST-segment or T wave abnormalities (excluding leads V1–V3)… may indicate acute myocardial ischemia", and new/presumed new RBBB without associated ST/T changes "is associated with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0–2 flow in as many as 66% of patients (compared with > 90% in those with ST-segment or T wave changes)".

### New electrocardiographic criteria for discriminating between Brugada types 2 and 3 patterns and incomplete right bundle branch block [^113eAUgq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate new electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for discriminating between incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and the Brugada types 2 and 3 ECG patterns.

Background

Brugada syndrome can manifest as either type 2 or type 3 pattern. The latter should be distinguished from incomplete RBBB, present in 3% of the population.

Methods

Thirty-eight patients with either type 2 or type 3 Brugada pattern that were referred for an antiarrhythmic drug challenge (AAD) were included. Before AAD, 2 angles were measured from ECG leads V(1) and/or V(2) showing incomplete RBBB: 1) α, the angle between a vertical line and the downslope of the r'-wave, and 2) β, the angle between the upslope of the S-wave and the downslope of the r'-wave. Baseline angle values, alone or combined with QRS duration, were compared between patients with negative and positive results on AAD. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to identify optimal discriminative cutoff values.

Results

The mean β angle was significantly smaller in the 14 patients with negative results on AAD compared to the 24 patients with positive results on AAD (36 ± 20° vs. 62 ± 20°, p < 0.01). Its optimal cutoff value was 58°, which yielded a positive predictive value of 73% and a negative predictive value of 87% for conversion to type 1 pattern on AAD; α was slightly less sensitive and specific compared with β. When the angles were combined with QRS duration, it tended to improve discrimination.

Conclusions

In patients with suspected Brugada syndrome, simple ECG criteria can enable discrimination between incomplete RBBB and types 2 and 3 Brugada patterns.

### Mortality in patients with right bundle-branch block in the absence of cardiovascular disease [^112excer]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, this was a retrospective analysis, and as such, our data were susceptible to inherent biases. Second, the data are from a large tertiary care center, which is subject to referral bias. Third, the majority of patients were male and White; thus, these results must be interpreted in such a context. However, we did adjust for sex specifically for this reason, as prior studies had contrasting results that could be sex‐based. Fourth, although multiple confounders were accounted for in the multivariable analysis performed, there may have been other residual confounders that influenced the ultimate results of the study. Fifth, although patients did not have any noted diagnosis of CVD, it does not mean that patients did not have some element of subclinical coronary disease, myocardial dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, etc. Specifically, our study was not structured to provide further insights into the physiology underlying the differences in mortality seen with RBBB. It should be noted, however, that a scenario of testing only those patients for whom we systematically and completely excluded all pre‐existing CVD through a combination of invasive and noninvasive testing would not be generalizable to any patient population; thus, we see this as a positive aspect of our study. Finally, the patient population evaluated underwent stress testing presumably for a guideline‐recommended indication. Thus, some impetus for referral may have been based on concern for a not‐yet‐diagnosed cardiovascular condition, and the results must be interpreted in such a context. Although the current AHA/ACC guideline on risk assessment neither endorses nor does not endorse exercise testing for risk assessment, the practice at our institution often includes assessment of functional capacity more frequently than in other practices, which accounts for the frequency of the number of patients undergoing "routine" stress testing included in this population. 16 Thus, it is likely that the risk conferred by RBBB may be different, depending on the indication for which stress testing was performed (eg, presence of cardiac symptoms).

### Electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with right bundle branch block [^113YKV74]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Though fairly benign reputation, the right bundle branch block (RBBB) can cause left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (LVMD). Still, the relationship between electrical disturbance and LVMD is partly unclear among these patients.

Methods

Thirty patients with RBBB and 60 matching controls were studied with vector electrocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging phase analysis. RBBB group was divided into those with and those without LVMD.

Results

Prevalence of LVMD among RBBB patients was 50% and among controls 22%. Odds ratio (OR) for LVMD in patients with RBBB vs controls without RBBB was 3.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 9.3). Ejection fraction (EF), end-systolic volume, the angle between QRS and T vectors, and the QRS angle in the sagittal plane were significantly different between RBBB patients with and without LVMD. The QRS duration was comparable in these groups. EF associated independently with LVMD, explaining 60% of its variation. A cut-off value of EF ≤ 55% detected LVMD in 100% specificity (sensitivity of 47%).

Conclusion

Half of the patients with RBBB had LVMD. The OR for LVMD between RBBB and normal ECG was 3.6. It seems that EF, rather than electrical parameters, is the main determinant of LVMD. This information might be useful when evaluating indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy.

### S / QRS ratio in lead I: a surface electrocardiographic finding associated with need for permanent pacemaker in patients with right bundle branch block [^117ENYFL]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern does not imply normal left bundle branch conduction but may simply indicate a more diseased right bundle branch. In lead I, initial rapid QRS forces represent left ventricular depolarization and the terminal S wave represents slower right ventricular depolarization. We postulated that slurring of initial forces with resulting narrowing of the S-wave duration and a smaller S/QRS ratio may be associated with a need for a permanent pacemaker (PPM).

Objective

This study aimed to assess the S/QRS ratio in lead I as an electrocardiogram measurement associated with a need for PPM.

Methods

We measured the PR interval, QRS axis, QRS duration (QRS d), S-wave duration in lead I, and S/QRS ratio in 2 groups of patients, all with RBBB: (1) controls, patients who did not require PPM, and (2) cases, patients who received PPM for alternating bundle branch block, Mobitz 2/complete heart block, or bifascicular block with abrupt syncope. Immediate preimplant and oldest available electrocardiograms that showed RBBB were analyzed.

Results

A total of 218 patients with RBBB were included. For controls (n = 109), over a follow-up of 90.16 months (range 4.5–347), QRS d increased from 145.2 to 146.7 ms (P = 0.67), and the S/QRS ratio decreased from 0.59 to 0.57 (P = 0.02). For cases (n = 109), over follow-up of 89.22 months (range 2.21–262.75), QRS d increased from 139.9 to 147.6 ms (P < .001), and the S/QRS ratio decreased from 0.52 to 0.43 (P < .001). On multivariable analyses, an S/QRS ratio of < 0.56 was associated with a need for PPM (odds ratio 6.87, confidence interval 3.87–12.67, P < .001).

Conclusion

In patients with RBBB, narrowing of the S wave in lead I with an S/QRS ratio of < 0.56 is associated with increased need for PPM, even after adjusting for QRS d.

Discussion

Outcomes of acute myocardial infarction patients with bundle branch block

Historically, the mortality of patients with AMI and RBBB before the thrombolytic era reached 77%. A more recent study from Denmark still revealed the highest mortality of AMI among patients with BBB (left or right): 33.3% patients died in-hospital and 54.8% were dead at 1 year. In the study of Dubois et al.patients with BBB (both left and right) had more complications and higher Killip class on admission. Both in-hospital mortality (32 vs. 10%, P < 0.001) and 3-year mortality (37 vs. 18%, P < 0.001) were higher among patients with complete BBB. In one study of 1238 consecutive patients with AMI, RBBB was found in 10.9% of patients. It was newly diagnosed in 37.8%, was known to be old in 34.1%, and in 28.1% the time of RBBB origin could not be established. Right bundle branch block patients had 1-year mortality 40.7 vs. 17.6% mortality in patients without RBBB (P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly higher for new RBBB (43.1%, P < 0.001) than for old (15.5%) and indeterminate (15.3%) RBBB. For isolated RBBB vs. bifascicular block, early mortality was 14.4 vs. 40.6%, and 1-year mortality was 30.2 vs. 54.2% (P < 0.05 for both). Multivariate analysis showed an independent prognostic value of RBBB for early and 1-year mortality.

Bundle branch block onset time

In the usual clinical reality (at the time of decision for urgent CAG procedure), BBB frequently cannot be securely established as new or old. Thus, patients without information about previous ECG are described as 'BBB of unknown origin' and were evaluated together with patients in whom previous ECG did not show BBB.

### QTc interval evaluation in patients with right bundle branch block or bifascicular blocks [^117Pm664]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Evaluation of the QTc interval is an important diagnostic tool in clinical practice to identify patients at high risk for ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. 1 The presence of a bundle branch block (BBB) represents a particular challenge in properly measuring the QTc interval. 2 Following international recommendations, QT interval should be measured in leads showing the longest QT interval, which is usually in right precordial leads. 3 In presence of a right bundle branch block (RBBB) or a bifascicular block, these leads are strongest affected by conduction delay and therefore hamper adequate measurement. In 2014, a new formula for evaluation of the QT interval in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) was reported (Figure 1). 4 Application of this so‐called "Bogossian formula", in combination with the Bazett formula for heart rate correction showed to be a simple and reliable tool in clinical practice for QTc interval evaluation in patients with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and LBBB. 4, 5, 6, 7 However, the importance of the Bogossian formula has never been evaluated in patients with RBBB or bifascicular block. Moreover, for QTc interval evaluation, the Bogossian formula has never been combined with Fridericia's or Hodge's formulas.

### Posterior myocardial infarction and complete right bundle-branch block [^116MPN74]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

We describe two patients with posterior myocardial infarction (PMI) with unusually atypical clinical presentations and cardiac enzymatic profiles, but with the abrupt development of complete AV block in patient 1, and Mobitz II second-degree AV block with paroxysmal phases of higher degrees of AV block in patient 2, and mitral regurgitation leading to symptomatic pulmonary congestion. Also, both patients had complete right bundle-branch block (RBBB) [old in patient 1, new in patient 2], the pattern of which was altered due to the associated PMI. The alteration included tall R waves involving the early part of the QRS complex, and tall T waves, both noted in the right precordial leads. The mechanism of these ECG modulations of the RBBB pattern was believed to be a superimposition of the early depolarization and repolarization consequences of the PMI. The significance of this observation lies in the ECG detection of PMI, frequently underdiagnosed particularly in patients with an atypical presentation, and with the RBBB adding further to the complexity. Thus, it is gratifying to note the contribution of the ECG to diagnostics, the only modality that provided a pathophysiologic insight in these two patients who appeared to be abruptly deteriorating clinically without an apparent reason.

Stress testing considerations in left bundle branch block (LBBB) — the text states "The threshold to consider stress testing is lower in patients with LBBB and concern for ischemia as well, given the higher probability of associated cardiac disease". When LBBB is present, "ischemic electrocardiographic changes are more difficult to interpret, and an imaging component is necessary". Additional observations include that "Rate related LBBB has also been reported as a possible cause of non-ischemic chest pain", and "Exercise induced LBBB, but not exercise induced RBBB, has been associated with increased risk of death and cardiac events".

### Intraventricular conduction abnormality – an electrocardiographic algorithm for rapid detection and diagnosis [^111mSCsT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intraventricular conduction abnormalities are commonly seen on the electrocardiograms of patients in the emergency department population. The significance of such a finding can vary widely. When placed into clinical context, determination and description of an intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) can assist in the management of a number of pathologies — directly cardiac and otherwise. The IVCDs discussed in this review include the unifascicular blocks (right bundle branch block [RBBB], left anterior fascicular block [LAFB], and left posterior fascicular block [LPFB]) and the bifascicular blocks (left bundle branch block, RBBB plus LAFB, and RBBB plus LPFB). After a review of these IVCDs, a simplified algorithm that will aid in the electrocardiographic diagnosis of these conduction abnormalities is presented.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: evaluation of the current diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis [^114eamyr]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias

The spectrum of ventricular arrhythmias in ARVC ranges from isolated premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest. The severity of the arrhythmia is variable between individual patients and during the course of the disease. The assessment of the morphology of the arrhythmic QRS complexes on 12-lead ECG may allow identification of the ventricular site of origin and the mechanism of the arrhythmia.

According to the 2010 ITF diagnostic criteria, the morphology of VT has an impact on diagnosis. Ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB)/inferior axis suggesting right (or left) ventricular outflow tract origin is considered a 'minor' diagnostic criterion because of its low specificity which may lead to misdiagnosis of ARVC in patients with idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)-VT. However, VT with an LBBB pattern and superior or indeterminate axis suggesting RV free wall origin is more specific for ARVC and this is classified as a 'major' diagnostic criterion. VT with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology may occur as a manifestation of additional or predominant LV involvement.

### Right bundle branch block-like pattern during uncomplicated right ventricular pacing and the effect of pacing site [^113YWrFX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) configuration is an unexpected finding during right ventricular (RV) pacing that raises the suspicion of inadvertent left ventricular lead positioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of paced RBBB pattern in relation to RV lead location. This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter study, which randomized implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients to an apical versus midseptal defibrillator lead positioning. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded during intrinsic rhythm and RV pacing. Paced RBBB-like pattern was defined as positive (> 0.05 mV) net amplitude of QRS complex in leads V1 and/or V2. In total, 226 patients (65.6 ± 12.0 years, 20.8% women, 53.1% apical site) were included in the study. The prevalence of paced RBBB pattern in the total population was 15.5%. A significantly lower percentage of patients in the midseptal group demonstrated RBBB-type configuration during RV pacing compared with the apical group (1.9% vs 27.5%, p < 0.001). Baseline RBBB, prolonged QRS duration during intrinsic rhythm, and reduced ejection fraction were not associated with increased likelihood of paced RBBB. In the subgroup of patients with RBBB type during pacing, 91.4% of patients had a paced QRS axis from -30° to -90°, whereas 100% of patients displayed a negative QRS vector at lead V3. In conclusion, RBBB configuration is encountered in a considerable percentage of device recipients during uncomplicated RV pacing. Midseptal lead positioning is associated with significantly lower likelihood of paced RBBB pattern compared with apical location.

### The surface electrocardiogram predicts risk of heart block during right heart catheterization in patients with preexisting left bundle branch block: implications for the definition of complete left bundle branch block [^114ZWc33]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) undergoing right heart catheterization can develop complete heart block (CHB) or right bundle branch block (RBBB) in response to right bundle branch (RBB) trauma. We hypothesized that LBBB patients with an initial r wave (≥ 1 mm) in lead V1 have intact left to right ventricular septal (VS) activation suggesting persistent conduction over the left bundle branch. Trauma to the RBB should result in RBBB pattern rather than CHB in such patients.

Methods

Between January 2002 and February 2007, we prospectively evaluated 27 consecutive patients with LBBB developing either CHB or RBBB during right heart catheterization. The prevalence of an r wave ≥ 1 mm in lead V1 was determined using 118 serial LBBB electrocardiographs (ECGs) from our hospital database.

Results

Catheter trauma to the RBB resulted in CHB in 18 patients and RBBB in 9 patients. All 6 patients with ≥ 1 mm r wave in V1 developed RBBB. Among these 6 patients q wave in lead I, V5, or V6 were present in 3. Four patients (3 in CHB group and 1 in RBBB group) developed spontaneous CHB during a median follow-up of 61 months. V1 q wave ≥ 1 mm was present in 28% of hospitalized complete LBBB patients.

Conclusions

An initial r wave of ≥ 1 mm in lead V1 suggests intact left to right VS activation and identifies LBBB patients at low risk of CHB during right heart catheterization. These preliminary findings indicate that an initial r wave of ≥ 1 mm in lead V1, present in approximately 28% of ECGs with classically defined LBBB, may constitute a new exclusion criterion when defining complete LBBB.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Conduction tissue disease — electrocardiographic definitions: In adults, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay is defined as QRS duration > 110 ms where morphology criteria for right bundle branch block (RBBB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB) are not present. Left anterior fascicular block criteria include QRS duration < 120 ms, frontal plane axis between −45° and −90°, qR (small q, tall R) pattern in lead aVL, R-peak time in lead aVL of > 45 ms, and rS pattern (small r, deep S) in leads II, III, and aVF. Left posterior fascicular block criteria include QRS duration < 120 ms, frontal plane axis between 90° and 180° in adults, rS (small r, deep S) pattern in leads I and aVL, and qR (small q, tall R) pattern in leads III and aVF; because of the more rightward axis in children up to 16 years of age, this criterion should only be applied to them when a distinct rightward change in axis is documented. The maximum predicted heart rate for age is calculated as 220−age (y).

### Painful left bundle branch block syndrome: clinical and electrocardiographic features and further directions for evaluation and treatment [^111UFfKG]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Painful left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a rarely diagnosed chest pain syndrome caused by intermittent LBBB in the absence of myocardial ischemia. Its prevalence, mechanism, detailed electrocardiographic (ECG) features, and effective treatments are not well described.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to characterize clinical and ECG features of patients with painful LBBB syndrome with respect to the LBBB ECG morphology (in particular QRS axis and the precordial S/T wave ratio), clarify diagnostic criteria and possible mechanisms, and provide directions for further evaluation and treatment.

Methods

We analyzed clinical (n = 50) and ECG (n = 15) features of patients with painful LBBB syndrome (4 patients in our practice and 46 cases identified in the literature).

Results

All 15 ECGs of patients with painful LBBB syndrome had an inferior QRS axis and a very low (< 1.8) precordial S/T wave ratio, which was consistent with the "new LBBB" pattern. We report a case of painful LBBB syndrome coexisting with coronary artery disease. Right ventricular apical pacing resolved intractable chest pain in 1 case of painful LBBB.

Conclusion

Painful LBBB ECG morphology within seconds/minutes of its onset is consistent with the new LBBB pattern with a very low (< 1.8) precordial S/T wave ratio and inferior QRS axis. Painful LBBB syndrome can coexist with coronary artery disease, complicating the assessment of chest pain in the setting of LBBB. An electrophysiology study might be considered to investigate whether changing ventricular activation pattern by pacing provides consistent pain control and to select the most effective pacing configuration.

### Prevalence, patterns of development, and prognosis of right bundle branch block in heart transplant recipients [^115RC3Ux]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is the most common electrocardiographic abnormality in heart transplant recipients, but the cause remains unknown, data regarding the prognosis are conflicting, and all previous studies have been limited to < 100 patients. This was a study of patients who underwent heart transplantation at Stanford University Medical Center from 1981 to 1995 with known outcomes and ≥ 2 available electrocardiograms (ECGs). Outcomes were assessed in those with and without conduction disturbances recorded from the ECGs closest to the time of transplantation and the most recent ECGs. Of the 322 heart transplant recipients studied, 141 (44%) died over a mean follow-up of 9 ± 3.5 years, and 40 (13%) died of sudden cardiac death. In the first ECG obtained, a mean of 1.8 ± 2.4 years after transplantation, 44 patients (14%) had incomplete RBBB and 26 (8%) had RBBB; in the second ECG, obtained a mean of 5.6 ± 3.7 years after transplantation, 59 patients (18%) had incomplete RBBB and 63 (20%) had RBBB. Increasing time from transplantation was associated with a greater likelihood for RBBB on the first and second ECGs (p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). QRS duration, incomplete RBBB, RBBB, or the development of RBBB was not associated with mortality or sudden cardiac death. In conclusion, although RBBB was the most common electrocardiographic abnormality in our study, the prevalence was lower than previously reported. The cause of RBBB appears to be largely related to events that occur well after transplantation, and the prognosis is benign.

QRS complex duration and morphology — eligibility thresholds and predictors of response. In current guidelines, QRS duration > 120 ms is the electrical criteria used to determine eligibility for CRT in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–IV patients. While patients with QRS duration > 150 ms respond well to CRT, values between 120 and 150 are associated with a more variable response, and there is conflicting evidence from observational studies as to whether patients with a narrow QRS (< 120 ms) benefit from CRT. Recent multicentre studies have provided strong evidence that QRS morphology is as important as QRS duration to predict response to CRT, with a typical left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology a strong predictor of response, whereas right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology and non‑specific intraventricular conduction delay are associated with less benefit.

Catheter ablation — background and idiopathic VT: RF ablation can be applied in the treatment of VT in patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI, cardiomyopathy, bundle-branch reentry, and various forms of idiopathic VT. In patients with no overt structural heart disease, ablation therapy may be curative, and these typically present as a single VT arising from the RV with an LBBB inferior axis morphology or from the LV with a right bundle-branch block (RBBB) morphology and, in general, are associated with a good prognosis.

### QTc interval evaluation in patients with right bundle branch block or bifascicular blocks [^111kG51X]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although this study involves artificially created bifascicular blocks, similar to those initially shown with the LBBB, the experimentally validated Bogossian formula has already shown that it holds true in clinical setting. 5

The present study examined the feasibility of correcting RBBB and bifascicular blocks. Although we did not create an isolated RBBB ECG pattern with our stimulation maneuvers, it could be shown, that the longest QT interval could be measured in the leads V1 or V2. Since these leads are also most affected in isolated RBBB, it can be assumed that the Bogossian formula can also be applied to this form of bundle branch block.

An adequate evaluation of the QT interval is anything but trivial. Even in experienced colleagues, a correct hit rate of only 60% has been described in the past. 21 In case of a BBB, the evaluation is made even more difficult. Therefore, standardized, simple and investigator‐friendly methods are needed to facilitate the evaluation. Since there was no significant difference in QTc interval measurements by the two independent operators in this trial, the Bogossian formula shows to have the capability to facilitate QT interval determination in patients with bifascicular block and probably in RBBB too.

### Brugada syndrome behind complete right bundle-branch block [^113ABcZ1]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The characteristic ECG of Brugada syndrome (BS) can be masked by complete right bundle-branch block (CRBBB) and exposed by resolution of the block or pharmacological or pacing maneuvers.

Methods and Results

The study consisted of 11 patients who had BS and CRBBB. BS was diagnosed before the development of CRBBB, on the resolution of CRBBB, or from new characteristic ST-segment changes that could be attributable to BS. Structural heart diseases were excluded, and coronary spasm was excluded on the basis of a provocation test at catheterization. In 7 patients, BS was diagnosed before the development of CRBBB. BS was diagnosed when CRBBB resolved spontaneously (n = 1) or by right ventricular pacing (n = 3). The precipitating cause for the spontaneous resolution of CRBBB, however, was not apparent. On repeated ECGs, new additional upward-convex ST-segment elevation was found in V2 or V3 in 3 patients. In 2 patients, new ST-segment elevation was induced by class IC drugs. The QRS duration was more prolonged in patients with BS and CRBBB compared with age- and sex-matched controls: 170 ± 13 versus 145 ± 15 milliseconds in V1 and 144 ± 19 versus 128 ± 7 milliseconds in V5 (both P < 0.0001). The amplitude of R in V1 was smaller in the BS patients than in the control subjects (P = 0.0323), but that of R' was similar (P = 0.0560).

Conclusions

BS can coexist behind CRBBB, and CRBBB can completely mask BS. BS might be demonstrated by relief of CRBBB or by spontaneous or drug-induced ST-segment elevation. The prevalence, mechanism, and clinical significance of a combination of CRBBB and BS are yet to be determined.

### Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew [^114hxQBM]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Right bundle branch block

Incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a very common finding in aircrew and is seen in 2–3% of routine aircrew ECGs. In isolation, it can be regarded as a normal variant and further investigation is not required. Individuals with complete RBBB (which is found in < 1% of aircrew ECGs), should undergo further investigation for structural heart disease, despite it being a normal variant in a proportion of the normal population. Investigation in aircrew should include an echocardiogram, an exercise ECG, and consideration of Holter monitoring. If underlying disease can be excluded, aircrew can be considered fit to continue all duties. In aircrew aged > 40 years, coronary artery assessment may also be considered. Flying restriction and follow-up is usually not necessary.

### Findings from 12-lead electrocardiography that predict circulatory shock from pulmonary embolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113e9n7w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Treatment guidelines for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) recommend risk stratifying patients to assess PE severity, as those at higher risk should be considered for therapy in addition to standard anticoagulation to prevent right ventricular (RV) failure, which can cause hemodynamic collapse. The hypothesis was that 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) can aid in this determination. The objective of this study was to measure the prognostic value of specific ECG findings (the Daniel score, which includes heart rate > 100 beats/min, presence of the S1Q3T3 pattern, incomplete and complete right bundle branch block [RBBB], and T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4, plus ST elevation in lead aVR and atrial fibrillation suggestive of RV strain from acute pulmonary hypertension), in patients with acute PE.

Methods

Studies were identified by a structured search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Scopus, and bibliographies in October 2014. Case reports, non-English papers, and those that lacked either patient outcomes or ECG findings were excluded. Papers with evidence of a predefined reference standard for PE and the results of 12-lead ECG, stratified by outcome (hemodynamic collapse, defined as circulatory shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, or in hospital or death within 30 days) were included. Papers were assessed for selection and publication bias. The authors also assessed heterogeneity (I(2)) and calculated the odds ratios (OR) for each ECG sign from the random effects model if I(2) > 24% and fixed effects if I(2) < 25%. Funnel plots were used to examine for publication bias.

Results

Forty-five full-length studies of 8,209 patients were analyzed. The most frequent ECG signs found in patients with acute PE were tachycardia (38%), T-wave inversion in lead V1 (38%), and ST elevation in lead aVR (36%). Ten studies with 3,007 patients were included for full analysis. Six ECG findings (heart rate > 100 beats/min, S1Q3T3, complete RBBB, inverted T waves in V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, and atrial fibrillation) had likelihood and ORs with lower-limit 95% confidence intervals above unity, suggesting them to be significant predictors of hemodynamic collapse and 30-day mortality. OR data showed no evidence of publication bias, but the proportions of patients with hemodynamic collapse or death and S1Q3T3 and RBBB tended to be higher in smaller studies. Patients who were outcome-negative had a significantly lower mean ± SD Daniel score (2.6 ± 1.5) than patients with hemodynamic collapse (5.9 ± 3.9; p = 0.039, ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc), but not patients with all-cause 30-day mortality (4.9 ± 3.3; p = 0.12).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed 10 studies, including 3,007 patients with acute PE, that demonstrate that six findings of RV strain on 12-lead ECG (heart rate > 100 beats/min, S1Q3T3, complete RBBB, inverted T waves in V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, and atrial fibrillation) are associated with increased risk of circulatory shock and death.

### Clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with right bundle branch block and superior axis: comparison of apical crux area and posterior septal left ventricle [^116SV267]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) with superior axis electrocardiographic (ECG) morphology is common in patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia (VA) originating from the left posterior fascicle (LPF), from the left ventricular (LV) posterior papillary muscles (PPM), and rarely from the cardiac apical crux.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the ECG and clinical characteristics of idiopathic VA presenting with RBBB and superior axis.

Methods

We studied 40 patients who underwent successful catheter ablation of idiopathic VAs originating from the LPF (n = 18), LV PPM (n = 15), and apical crux (n = 7). We investigated clinical and ECG characteristics, including maximum deflection index and QRS morphology in leads aVR and V6.

Results

Syncope was more frequently seen in apical crux VA compared with other VAs (57% vs 6%, P < .001). Patients with apical crux VA more frequently had an maximum deflection index ≥ 0.55 compared with LPF VA and PPM VA (P = 0.02). A monophasic R wave in aVR and QS or r/S ratio < 0.15 in V6 (P < .001) could distinguish apical crux VA from other VAs with high accuracy. All patients with VA underwent attempted ablation in the endocardium (success rate: LPF 89%, PPM 80%, crux 14%). Only 1 of 7 patients with apical crux VA had acute success with ablation in the middle cardiac vein. In 2 of apical crux patients, epicardial ablation using subxiphoid approach was performed successfully.

Conclusion

We could distinguish LPF VA, PPM VA, and apical crux VA using a combination of clinical and ECG characteristics. These findings might be useful for counseling patients and planning an ablation strategy.

### Masquerading bundle branch block: an often missed electrophysiological event [^113xgkhf]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

MBBB is a mixed pattern of RBBB in precordial leads and LBBB in limb leads with qR or absent S waves in lead aVR or I. It was first described by Richmann and Wolf in 1954. There are two described patterns of MBBB, namely, the standard type and the precordial type. In the first commonly described standard type, the precordial leads V1–V6 demonstrate the RBBB pattern, whereas the limb leads demonstrate an LBBB pattern. This pattern is postulated to result from a high degree of left anterior hemiblock or concomitant left anterior posterior block.

In the precordial type, there is an LBBB pattern in leads V4–V6 with the absence of S waves and an RBBB pattern in precordial leads V1–V3. It is hypothesised that this ECG pattern is produced by a focal block in the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle in the setting of an RBBB or due to strong superiorly directed vectors of left anterior hemiblock with concomitant RBBB. It is most commonly caused by ischaemic/coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, long-standing hypertension, Lenegre-Lev disease and Chagas myocarditis.

In this patient, he developed varying degrees of transient bradyarrhythmias including bifascicular block, trifascicular block and idioventricular rhythm with a complete heart block. This may have been exacerbated by his home medication of donepezil. His most persistent rhythm was an MBBB accompanied by a trifascicular block, which is defined as a right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock with prolonged PR interval. Patients with trifascicular block often develop complete heart block. Our patient's presentation suggests severe progressive degeneration of the atrioventricular conduction system in keeping with Lenegre-Lev disease.

The presence of this specific bundle branch block pattern indicates severe fibrosis of the left bundle pathways and a remarkably elevated risk of progression to complete atrioventricular dissociation than seen in the standard bifascicular block. Regardless of the presence or absence of trifascicular block, MBBB indicates significant degeneration of the conduction system, leading to a poor outcome. It is associated with high mortality (41.4%) from cardiac arrest and pacemaker insertion (38.9%) with combined endpoints of 80.2% over 4 years.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Conduction disorders with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction — scope, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation: This section focuses on QRS abnormalities caused by fascicular blocks and bundle branch blocks caused by delayed or blocked conduction within ≥ 1 of the branches of the His-Purkinje system, and the combination of right bundle branch with 1 of the left bundle's fascicles is denoted bifascicular block (which also includes LBBB). Although first-degree atrioventricular block is more accurately a conduction disorder rather than atrioventricular block, for historical reasons full discussion and recommendations on this condition are provided in the section on atrioventricular block. The normal conduction axis consists of the sinus node, atrial muscle, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, fascicles, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, and in general, it may be helpful to characterize the process as static or progressive. Clinically, isolated fascicular and bundle branch blocks are rarely associated with symptoms on their own although their presence may be a marker for underlying structural heart disease, and cardiac dyssynchrony from LBBB may cause symptoms particularly in the setting of reduced left ventricular function; the presence or absence of symptoms potentially referable to intermittent bradycardia will usually guide evaluation of the patient with fascicular or bundle branch block.

### Significant delayed activation on the right ventricular outflow tract represents complete right bundle-branch block pattern in Brugada syndrome [^117CG6tA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is characterized by coved‐type ST elevation in the right precordial leads and sudden cardiac death caused by nocturnal ventricular fibrillation (VF). Although the mechanisms underlying the ECG changes and VF remain controversial, repolarization abnormality and/or depolarization abnormality have been critical in the pathogenesis of BrS. In recent years, the epicardial ablation technique has revealed conduction abnormality on the epicardial surface of the right ventricular free wall, particularly the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Abnormal delayed activation of the RVOT could be a source of ST elevation and a substrate of VF in patients with BrS.

Complete right bundle‐branch block (CRBBB) can occur in patients with BrS. Previous studies have shown that patients with BrS with CRBBB might have a severe clinical phenotype, such as frequent VF episodes or electrical storm.CRBBB usually occurs due to a complete conduction block at the main trunk of the right bundle branch (RBB), and activation of the right ventricle (RV) originates from the left ventricle (LV) through the intraventricular septum.

Recently, it has been reported that the conduction block at the trunk of the left bundle branch usually causes left bundle‐branch block; however, some patients have left bundle‐branch block pattern with intact His‐Purkinje conduction due to conduction disturbance being distant from the Purkinje system. Evaluation of the disturbed site could be useful for predicting the effects of His or left bundle‐branch block pacing in patients with heart failure. The results of a study in which the block site of RBBB was evaluated were reported in the 1960s, which showed that RBBB was mainly present in the RBB trunk in various heart diseases. A study of patients with congenital heart disease and who received surgical repairs showed that CRBBB could occur due to conduction blocks of the main trunk of the RBB, distal portion of the RBB, and conduction disturbance in the distal RV myocardium. However, the mechanism of CRBBB in BrS has not been well understood.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) — imaging and stress testing guidance — indicates that the threshold for further imaging or functional study is lower in LBBB, and echocardiogram, cardiac MR, and stress testing may be potentially useful; the presence of LBBB on ECG markedly increases the likelihood that left ventricular systolic dysfunction will be diagnosed by echocardiogram; the threshold to consider stress testing is lower in patients with LBBB and concern for ischemia, and if LBBB is present an imaging component is necessary; exercise induced LBBB, but not exercise induced RBBB, has been associated with increased risk of death and cardiac events.

### Primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block: should new onset right bundle branch block be added to future guidelines as an indication for reperfusion therapy? [^11553dXd]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Bundle branch block onset time

Patients with BBBs were further divided according to the BBB onset time (Table 3): new or presumably new BBB (as this is the currently accepted indication for reperfusion therapy in LBBB) vs. BBB known to be old. Group of patients with new or presumably new RBBB (despite having the lowest mean age from all BBB subgroups) had high Killip class on admission (15.4% presenting with cardiogenic shock). TIMI flow 0 in the infarct-related artery was found in significantly more patients with new or presumably new RBBB (55%) than in other three subgroups (old RBBB 34.9%, old LBBB 28%, new or presumably new LBBB 41.1%). Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 84.8% of patients with new or presumably new RBBB, more than in other three subgroups (old RBBB 66%, old LBBB 62.3%, new or presumably new LBBB 73%). The most striking are mortality differences between these four subgroups: in-hospital mortality was highest (18.8%) among patients presenting with new or presumably new RBBB, followed by new or presumably new LBBB (13.2%), old LBBB (10.1%), and old RBBB (6.4%).

Table 3
Bundle branch block onset time

Disappearence of bundle branch block during the hospital stay

In 87 patients, the BBB (present on the admission ECG) disappeared during the hospital stay. Almost all these patients had BBB of new or unknown onset and they mostly presented to hospital with acute heart failure (mean Killip class was 1.93, cardiogenic shock was present in 19%, 86% were treated by primary PCI, which was successful in 98%). Left bundle branch block disappeared in 32 patients and their mortality was 6.2%. Right bundle branch block disappeared in 55 patients and their mortality was 12.7%.

Bifascicular blocks

Patients, in whom RBBB was combined with either LAH or LPH tended to be older, had higher incidence of diabetes, had lower ejection fraction, more frequent occurrence of three-vessel disease and LAD as an infarct-related artery, and had slightly higher mortality (Table 4).

### Electrocardiographic and electrophysiological characteristics of ventricular arrhythmias from the right bundle branch of the moderator band [^111dFVrJ]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are little data on ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) originating from the right bundle branch (RBB) of the moderator band (MB) (MB-RBB VAs) in a cohort of patients.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological characteristics of MB-RBB VAs.

Methods

Sixteen patients with MB-RBB VAs and 5 patients with right ventricular (RV) anterior papillary muscle (APM) VAs (RV-APM VAs) were studied under the guidance of intracardiac echocardiography.

Results

The MB-RBB VAs group demonstrated a typical left bundle branch block pattern with left superior axis deviation and a narrower QRS complex during VAs (P < .001) as compared with the RV-APM VAs group. Furthermore, the MB-RBB VAs group had a shorter rS interval, a sharper slope of the S wave downstroke without notching in leads V 1 and V 2, and a shorter r wave duration in lead V 2. A leading RBB potential at the target during VAs was observed for all patients in the MB-RBB VAs group, which was also present during sinus rhythm for all patients, except for 2 with RBB block at baseline. Ablation of the leading RBB potential effectively eliminated the arrhythmia. In the RV-APM VAs group, no Purkinje potential at the target was identified in any patient during VAs.

Conclusion

QRS morphology of MB-RBB VAs is characterized by a typical left bundle branch block pattern with a relatively narrow QRS complex, short r wave and rS durations, and a sharp S wave downstroke without notching in leads V 1 and V 2. Mapping and ablation of the leading RBB potential are effective in eliminating VAs.

### The prognostic significance of electrocardiography findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective study [^115czmPS]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The main findings of our study are threefold: (a) Various abnormal ECG findings were common among patients with COVID‐19; (b) Proportions of many ECG abnormalities were significantly higher in non‐survivors; (c) Abnormal ECG was significantly associated with in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Furthermore, per one point of abnormal ECG increasing was associated with a 47.8% increase in the relative risk of in‐hospital mortality.

Abnormal ECGs were frequently encountered among COVID‐19 patients. A recent study from Italy including 324 patients with COVID‐19 had found that any abnormal finding on the ECG was found in 120 patients (37%) 9. The proportion of abnormal ECG was as high as 93% among critical ill COVID‐19 patients. 8 Nearly two third of patients in our study had at least one point of ECG abnormalities scoring. Although ECG data of patients with pneumonia caused by non‐SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogens was unavailable in our study, previous study had shown that ECG abnormalities prevalence were similar between COVID‐19 and acute infectious respiratory disease caused by other pathogens (37.0% vs 43.5%, p = 0.13) and no differences in ECG abnormalities were found between the COVID‐19 group and no‐COVID‐19 group. 12

Lanza GA et al had reported that atrial fibrillation, increasing heart rate, a QRS duration ≥ 110 ms (including patients with LBBB or RBBB) and ST‐segment depression were associated with short term mortality of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients in univariable Cox regression analysis. 9 The relation between abnormal ECG findings and in‐hospital death of our present study was consistent with Lanza GA's study. We speculated that both of atrial fibrillation and increasing heart rate might result from hypoxia, fever and hyperinflammatory and ST segment change might be due to myocardial ischemia or injury. Bundle branch block and QRS lengthening indicated a delay in ventricular depolarization which might be explained by myocardial injury. Prevalence of incomplete RBBB and complete RBBB was 9% and 11% respectively in a large series of critically ill COVID‐19 patients and the interpretation of such ECG abnormalities proposed by Matteo Bertini et al was right ventricular pressure overload. 8 Due to the limit data of echocardiography in the present study, we did not explore the pathophysiological insights of RBBB.

### Predictive effect of atypical right bundle-branch block on in-hospital sudden cardiac death and cardiac rupture and long-term prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [^116CdCAh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions

AMI was diagnosed according to the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines, incorporating ECG monitoring and serial measurement of high‐sensitivity troponin T at admission and 3 hours later. The ECG was recorded immediately upon admission, following current guidelines. LBBB and TRBBB were classified as new or presumably new onset by the treating physician, whereas all ARBBB cases in this study were considered newly acquired. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were defined by prior documentation by a physician or the use of antihypertensive or lipid‐lowering drugs. Diabetes was based on the use of antidiabetic drugs or insulin. The final diagnosis was adjudicated blindly by 2 physicians, with a third physician reviewing cases of disagreement. In this study, MACCEs included all‐cause death, cardiac death, nonfatal recurrent MI, nonfatal stroke, malignant arrhythmia.
SCD and CR: SCD is generally defined as unexpected death due to cardiovascular causes in an individual with or without preexisting heart disease within 1 hour of a change in clinical status. Most instances of SCD may involve CR, ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation, advanced atrioventricular block, severe heart failure, or cardiogenic shock, followed by asystole. CR encompasses any of the following 3 conditions: free wall rupture, ventricular septal rupture, or papillary muscle rupture. Free wall rupture is the most common form of CR, which is a catastrophic complication of AMI. The diagnosis of CR primarily relies on bedside color Doppler ultrasound, X‐ray, other imaging examinations, and clinical manifestations. In our study, in‐hospital SCD was identified in all CR cases, and all CR cases were confirmed by bedside color Doppler ultrasound.
TRBBB: RBBB was defined according to the Minnesota Code criteria as a QRS duration ≥ 0.12 seconds in the majority of beats in any of leads I, II, III, augmented unipolar limb lead (aVL), or augmented unipolar limb lead (aVF), plus any 1 of the following conditions: (a) an RSR′ pattern in V1 or V2 with R′ > R and an S‐wave ≥ 0.25 mm in most beats; (b) a predominantly positive QRS in V1 or V2 with an R peak duration ≥ 0.06 seconds in most beats; or (c) an S duration > R duration in all beats in either lead I or II (Figure 2A).
LBBB: The ECG characteristics of LBBB include (a) a wide R‐wave with a flat tip or notch in leads I and V5–V6, with a reduced or absent Q‐wave; (b) a wide, deep S‐wave in leads V1–V2, appearing as QS or rS type, with similar changes in leads II, III, and aVF; (c) secondary ST‐T wave changes, where the T‐wave direction is opposite to the main wave of the QRS; and (d) varying degrees of leftward deflection of the electrical axis, A QRS duration > 0.12 seconds was considered complete LBBB, whereas a QRS duration < 0.12 seconds was considered incomplete LBBB (Figure 2B).
ARBBB: ARBBB involves specific changes based on the RBBB that differ from typical RBBB. We defined ARBBB by 2 distinct ECG features. The first feature is a notch on the ascending segment of the R‐wave in lead V1, categorized into qR type, QR type, or M type based on the morphologies of the QRS wave in the lead V1 (Figure 2C through 2E, red arrow). The second feature is a single R‐wave upright deflection, characterized by an isolated upright R‐wave in lead V1 without prominent Q or S waves. This single R‐wave upright deflection lacks a notch on either the ascending or descending segment in the lead V1 (Figure 2F, red arrow). Additionally, ARBBB differs from TRBBB by the absence of an initial R‐wave on ECG.

Methods

Study design and population

This study was conducted as a post hoc analysis of the ILLUMINATE-CS (Illustration of the Management and Prognosis of Japanese Patients with Cardiac Sarcoidosis). The details of the ILLUMINATE-CS have been previously described. Briefly, patients with CS who were first diagnosed at 33 hospitals between 2001 and 2017 were included in the registry. Patients who refused to enroll after being informed of their inclusion in the registry were excluded. The diagnosis of CS was based on either the 2016 Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) criteria or the 2014 Heart Rhythm Society consensus statement.

A flow diagram of the patient selection process is shown in Figure 1. From the 512 patients enrolled in the ILLUMINATE-CS, cases lacking detailed QRS morphology information and cases with pacing rhythm at diagnosis were excluded. We divided the patients into 2 groups (non-RBBB and RBBB groups) according to the presence of RBBB on their electrocardiogram and compared their characteristics and clinical outcomes. We defined RBBB as the presence of an RSR' pattern (V 1 or V 2) and a wide-slurred S-wave in the lateral leads (I and V 6). Patients with an RBBB pattern with QRS duration ≥ 120 ms were diagnosed with complete RBBB, whereas those with an RBBB pattern with QRS duration < 120 ms were diagnosed with incomplete RBBB. In this study, we considered both complete and incomplete RBBB as the RBBB group.

A, TRBBB; B, LBBB. Performance of ARBBB on ECG: Notches were observed in the ascending segment of the R‐wave in the V1 lead, which can be classified into different types as qR (C, red arrow), QR (D, red arrow), and M (E, red arrow) according to the morphology of the QRS wave in the V1 lead. Additionally, a single R‐wave‐like change was also observed in the V1 lead without prominent Q and S waves, with no notch in either the rising or falling segment (F, red arrow). ARBBB indicates atypical right bundle‐branch block; BBB, bundle‐branch block; LBBB, left bundle‐branch block; NBBB, nonbundle‐branch block; and TRBBB, typical right bundle‐branch block.

In our study, only 4 (0.6%) cases had historical ECGs showing the presence of RBBB. RBBB in the healthy population predominantly presents as TRBBB, whereas ARBBB is almost absent. Therefore, we assumed that ARBBB cases were newly acquired in our study.

If I Perform an EKG and It Is Abnormal, Does That Mean I Should Not Initiate Lamotrigine?

Nonspecific EKG abnormalities (eg, nonspecific ST and T wave abnormalities) are not concerning, and should not preclude these individuals from being prescribed lamotrigine.

The highest risk cases are those with second-, third-degree heart block, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, and right bundle branch block with left anterior or posterior fascicular block. These patients require thorough cardiological investigation to determine whether lamotrigine can be administered safely. If there are concerns, consultation with a cardiologist before initiating lamotrigine may be warranted.

### The Brugada syndrome [^113x1aFF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome describes the syndrome of sudden cardiac death in the setting of the following electrocardiographic findings: right bundle branch block pattern with ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. The right bundle branch block may be incomplete while the ST segment elevation is minimal. The electrocardiographic findings are not constant. Patients suspected of having Brugada syndrome should be promptly referred for electrophysiological testing and treatment. Rapid referral and placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is associated with an excellent prognosis, whereas failure to diagnose this condition is associated with a high risk for sudden death. Therefore, it is imperative that all emergency physicians be familiar with the typical ECG manifestations of Brugada syndrome. Three illustrative cases are presented with a review of the syndrome.

### Right bundle branch block-type wide QRS complex tachycardia with a reversed R / S complex in lead V: development and validation of electrocardiographic differentiation criteria [^113iiktQ]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Differentiation of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern from ventricular tachycardia (VT) is difficult, particularly when the R/S ratio in lead V 6 is below 1.0.

Objective

We sought to investigate the electrocardiographic criteria for distinguishing between these arrhythmias.

Methods

We investigated electrocardiographic parameters from 111 consecutive patients who had RBBB pattern wide QRS complex tachycardia with a reversed R/S ratio in lead V 6 (72 VTs, 39 SVTs). Diagnostic criteria from the previous algorithms were compared with our new criterion, the RS/QRS ratio, which was defined as the ratio of the interval from the onset of the QRS complex to the nadir of the S wave, divided by the QRS width in lead V 6. The RS/QRS ratio was further tested in a prospective population (31 fascicular VTs, 29 SVTs).

Results

The diagnostic accuracy of previous criteria (Brugada algorithm, Vereckei algorithm, and R-wave peak time criterion) was only modest. However, the RS/QRS ratio in lead V 6 was significantly lower in SVT than in VT (0.36 ± 0.04 vs 0.50 ± 0.08; P < .001). A cutoff value of the RS/QRS ratio > 0.41 differentiated VT from SVT with a high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 97.2%; specificity 89.7%). When tested in a prospective population with fascicular VT, the diagnostic accuracy of the criteria was maintained (sensitivity 90.3%; specificity 86.2%).

Conclusion

The RS/QRS ratio > 0.41 in lead V 6 is a simple and reliable index for distinguishing VT from SVT in RBBB pattern wide QRS complex tachycardia with a reversed R/S complex in lead V 6. This criterion was particularly useful for the differential diagnosis of fascicular VT from RBBB pattern SVT.

### The characteristics of the electrocardiogram and the intracardiac electrogram in left bundle branch pacing [^111xTY84]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) has recently been reported to maintain left ventricular electrical synchrony with a low and stable threshold. However, the electrocardiogram (ECG) definitions of LBBP have not been well established. We report four cases to show the characteristics of the ECG and the intracardiac electrogram (EGM) in LBBP.

Methods and Results

Four patients, two with an atrioventricular block (AVB) and two with left bundle branch block (LBBB), were included in the study. LBBP was performed and the ECGs and EGMs were collected and compared at different pacing outputs. Selective LBBP (S-LBBP) was defined as only capturing the LBB with a typical RBBB morphology and a discrete component between the pacing stimulus and ventricular activation in the EGMs. While nonselective LBBP (NS-LBBP) captured both the LBB and the local myocardium, resulting in a narrow right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology without the discrete component. The left bundle branch (LBB) potential was recorded in two cases during narrow QRS complex or LBBB correction by selective His bundle pacing and SLBBP (n = 3) was achieved. A constant and shortest stimulus to left ventricular activation time (LVAT) in LBBP was obtained at different pacing outputs.

Conclusion

The ECG and EGM characteristics of LBBP can be summarized as: 1) RBBB pattern; 2) usually with the LBB potential; 3) SLBBP with specific ECG changes and a discrete component in EGM; and 4) with a constant and shortest stimulus to LVAT at different pacing outputs. Further studies are necessary to confirm these observations.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113tiDpV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Conduction disorders with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction — scope, definitions, pathophysiology, and presentation — are described as QRS abnormalities due to fascicular blocks and bundle branch blocks caused by delayed or blocked conduction within ≥ 1 of the branches of the His-Purkinje system; the combination of delayed or blocked conduction of the right bundle branch and 1 of the left bundle's fascicles is denoted bifascicular block, and first-degree atrioventricular block is more accurately a conduction disorder rather than atrioventricular block though discussed elsewhere. The normal conduction axis comprises the sinus node, atrial muscle, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, fascicles, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, and pathophysiology may be developmental, hereditary/genetic, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, infiltrative, traumatic, ischemic, malignant, or degenerative; in general, it may be helpful to characterize the process as static or progressive. Isolated fascicular and bundle branch blocks are rarely associated with symptoms on their own, their presence may be a marker for underlying structural heart disease, and cardiac dyssynchrony from left bundle-branch block (LBBB) may cause symptoms.

### QTc interval evaluation in patients with right bundle branch block or bifascicular blocks [^116hvzns]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The right bundle branch block (RBBB) and the bifascicular blocks affect QRS duration in the right precordial leads, which are usually used for QT interval determination. Up to now, there is no clear recommendation how to determine QT interval in patients with RBBB or bifascicular block.

Hypothesis

The hypothesis of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of a simple formula for RBBB and bifascicular block correction, thereby making it easier to determine the QTc interval.

Methods

In patients with intrinsic QRS duration < 120 ms, artificial RBBB with either left posterior (LPFB) or left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), created by left ventricular pacing maneuvers, were corrected using the Bogossian formula (QTm) and afterward were heart rate corrected (QTmc). Heart rate correction was performed using different heart rate formulas in comparison to each other. The QTmc intervals were compared in each patient with the QTc interval during intrinsic rhythm.

Results

A total of scheduled 71 patients were included in this prospective multicenter observational comparative study. Compared to intrinsic QTc interval, the mean ΔQTmc interval by combination of the Bogossian and the Hodge formulas was −3 ± 24 ms in RBBB + LPFB (P = 0.44) and −6 ± 25 ms in RBBB + LAFB (P = 0.15). The Bogossian formula showed a significant deviation from the actual QTc interval with both the Bazett and the Fridericia formulas.

Conclusion

In combination with the Hodge formula, the Boggosian formula delivered the best results in comparing the true QTc interval in narrow QRS with the QTmc interval in the presence of a bifascicular block.

### Right bundle-branch block in precordial leads with left bundle branch block in frontal plane leads… [^111Veco7]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

A patient in their 70s presented to the emergency department with a history of syncope that occurred 7 days before admission without preceding signs or symptoms. Since then, the patient had been experiencing fatigue, mainly from exertion. The patient had a history of hypertension, heart failure, and aortic valve replacement surgery in 2020, complicated on follow-up by prosthetic valve thrombosis. The patient had been taking warfarin, furosemide, metoprolol succinate, and spironolactone. Initial evaluation revealed a heart rate of 61 beats/min, blood pressure of 114/74 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 36. 6 °C. The physical examination was unremarkable, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained.

### A revised definition of left bundle branch block using time to notch in lead I… [^114cPwUz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In this diagnostic study of 75 patients, LBBB pattern on surface electrocardiography was categorized as being due to complete conduction block or intraventricular conduction delay based on assessment of intracardiac recordings. After correlation with surface ECGs, a time to notch in lead I longer than 75 milliseconds was proposed as a new ECG criterion for LBBB, and this criterion demonstrated improved specificity compared with conventional criteria in the derivation population as well as good performance in an independent validation population. Exposures Patients were classified as having LBBB or intraventricular conduction delay as assessed by intracardiac recording. Main Outcomes and Measures Sensitivity and specificity of the electrocardiography criteria assessed in patients with LBBB or IVCD. Results. A total of 75 patients with baseline LBBB on 12-lead ECG underwent intracardiac recording of the left ventricular septum: 48 demonstrated complete conduction block and 27 demonstrated intact Purkinje activation. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that time to notch longer than 75 milliseconds in lead I is a simple ECG criterion that, when used in conjunction with standard LBBB criteria, may improve specificity for identifying patients with LBBB from conduction block. This may help inform patient selection for cardiac resynchronization or conduction system pacing. This study proposes a modification to the standard ECG criteria for LBBB based on observations from LV septal recordings of human patients and validates the performance of the modified criteria in an independent dataset of patients with complete conduction block. The aim was to develop a more reproducible method to allow for more accurate patient selection for CRT and CSP.

To develop the new ECG criterion, surface ECGs of patients found to have CCB were compared with those found to have IPA. The aim of this study was to develop a simple new surface ECG criterion to allow for more accurate discrimination between LBBB and IVCD. To our knowledge, this is the first proposed modification to the traditional ECG criteria for LBBB based on direct electrophysiological observations in human patients. It was found that late notching or slurring in lead I was the most predictive feature of LBBB compared with IVCD and that a threshold of time to notch longer than 75 milliseconds provided the optimal criterion for LBBB.

### Right bundle-branch block… [^113eumxd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

RIGHT bundle-branch block is an unusual complication of non-penetrating trauma to the chest. Rankin and Patterson1 in 1952 and Parmley et al2 in 1958 described transient intraventricular conduction defects that they concluded were due to myocardial contusion. We report a case of transient RBBB that developed following nonpenetrating chest trauma without myocardial injury as evidenced by serial ECGs, technetium Tc 99m pyrophosphate scan, and cardiac enzyme values. Report of a Case A 55-year-old man who had been previously healthy was seen in the emergency room of the Houston Veterans Administration Hospital following an automobile accident in which he had sustained blunt trauma to the anterior chest wall. His only complaint was of nonradiating pleuritic chest pain. The patient was in mild distress. The cardiac apical impulse was in the sixth intercostal space of the midclavicular line. His pain increased following firm palpation of the anterior chest wall. Otherwise.

How Important Is Complete Right Bundle-Branch Block in Asymptomatic 60-Year-Old Man. Q An ECG finding of a complete right bundle-branch block was first noted six years ago in an otherwise asymptomatic man who is now 60 years of age. A normal QRS interval was noted on ECGs done in the next two years, but at his most recent examination, the RBBB pattern was again present. There has been no heart rate variation to suggest that the block is rate related. No other studies have been done in this patient because of his asymptomatic state. Does your consultant think coronary arteriography is indicated. What is the cause of this condition. Harry C.
