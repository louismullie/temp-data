## Question

Penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether penicillin V has any role in treating MRSA bacteremia and, if not, what the evidence-based management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity of MRSA bacteremia and its severity. Then, I should verify the microbiologic implications of mecA-mediated beta-lactam resistance. Next, I will check the FDA labeling and pharmacology of penicillin V, followed by a review of guideline-recommended therapies and dosing. After that, I need to examine randomized trial data on beta-lactam combinations in MRSA bacteremia, consider route of therapy and source control, and finally synthesize a clear conclusion with practical management steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes: MRSA bacteremia is a high-mortality bloodstream infection that requires prompt bactericidal IV therapy and aggressive source control, with mortality commonly exceeding 20% in contemporary cohorts, so I should not underplay the acuity of this syndrome [^113uYSHx] [^111SQUPW].

> Hold on, I need to check the resistance biology because it drives antibiotic choice: MRSA carries mecA, producing PBP2a and conferring class-wide resistance to beta-lactams, which by definition removes penicillins, including penicillin V, from the active armamentarium for MRSA bacteremia, and necessitates agents like vancomycin or daptomycin as first-line IV therapies according to IDSA guidance [^114Rr8LM] [^116wHVJg].

> Now, let me verify penicillin V's labeling and clinical niche; wait, I initially thought penicillin V appears in some product materials for staphylococcal skin infections, so maybe it could extend to bacteremia, but I should double-check the FDA label before leaping: the FDA labeling for penicillin V explicitly restricts it to mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin-susceptible organisms and specifically states that bacteremia, meningitis, pericarditis, empyema, severe pneumonia, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage, which directly contraindicates its use for bacteremia from any cause, let alone MRSA that it cannot cover [^114fk4T8] [^112W1jzK].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant therapy; vancomycin and daptomycin are the recommended first-line agents for MRSA bacteremia, with vancomycin dosed intravenously and monitored for exposure and toxicity, and daptomycin 6–10 mg/kg IV daily as an alternative, typically for 2–6 weeks depending on whether the infection is uncomplicated or complicated, consistent with IDSA and corroborated by FDA labeling and European endocarditis guidance for MRSA endovascular disease [^114Rr8LM] [^114TiAfx] [^116nbZoN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall older observational signals that adding an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam to standard therapy might hasten clearance, so is there a role for a beta-lactam add-on here; let me verify the highest-level evidence: a multicenter randomized trial found that adding an antistaphylococcal beta-lactam to vancomycin or daptomycin did not improve a composite outcome of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure at 90 days, so combination with a beta-lactam should not be routine in MRSA bacteremia, and my earlier thought that it might improve outcomes needs to be corrected in light of these data [^113uYSHx] [^11793oqq].

> I should confirm the route of administration and pharmacokinetic considerations; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that any oral agent could substitute: bacteremia requires reliable IV exposure, repeat blood cultures to document clearance, evaluation for endocarditis, and source control of removable foci, and penicillin V's oral administration, narrow spectrum, and labeling prohibition make it doubly inappropriate in this setting, with IDSA also emphasizing repeat cultures and comprehensive evaluation to guide duration [^112aB5oL] [^115hGc1Z] [^114fk4T8].

> But wait, what if the strain were MSSA; let me consider that scenario to avoid overgeneralization: even for MSSA bacteremia, the recommended therapy is an IV antistaphylococcal penicillin or cefazolin rather than oral penicillin V, underscoring that penicillin V is not used for any staphylococcal bacteremia and certainly not for MRSA, where only vancomycin or daptomycin are appropriate first-line IV options [^114Rr8LM] [^1146V9Ty].

> Next, I should review practical management steps to ensure no element is missed; I will now examine the essentials: obtain repeat blood cultures 2–4 days after the initial positive set and thereafter until clearance, perform echocardiography (often TEE) to assess for endocarditis, and pursue timely source control; therapy duration is at least 2 weeks if truly uncomplicated and extends to 4–6 weeks for endocarditis or other complications, which again positions oral penicillin V as contraindicated at every step [^112aB5oL] [^1146V9Ty] [^114Rr8LM].

> In summary, I need to ensure my conclusion is precise and supported: penicillin V has no role in MRSA bacteremia due to class resistance, inadequate oral pharmacokinetics, and explicit FDA labeling against use in bacteremia, while guidelines and randomized data support IV vancomycin or daptomycin for appropriate durations with rigorous source control and monitoring; using penicillin V here would constitute ineffective therapy and risk persistent bacteremia, metastatic infection, and increased mortality [^114fk4T8] [^114Rr8LM] [^113uYSHx].

Penicillin V is not effective for **MRSA bacteremia** because MRSA universally resists beta-lactams — including penicillin V — via mecA-mediated production of PBP2a. Penicillin V is **explicitly contraindicated for bacteremia** and severe infections [^114fk4T8]. The recommended first-line therapies for MRSA bacteremia are **intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin** [^114Rr8LM]; alternatives include linezolid, ceftaroline, or telavancin for persistent or complicated cases [^1113MbZX]. Using penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia risks treatment failure, persistent bacteremia, metastatic complications, and increased mortality [^111sDnDT].

---

## Mechanism of resistance

MRSA resistance to beta-lactams — including penicillin V — is mediated by the **mecA gene**, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). PBP2a has low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, rendering these agents ineffective at inhibiting cell-wall synthesis. This well-documented mechanism is universally present in MRSA strains, making all beta-lactams, including penicillin V, ineffective against MRSA infections.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and other authoritative bodies explicitly **recommend against using penicillin V** or any beta-lactam for MRSA bacteremia. Instead, the following antibiotics are recommended [^114Rr8LM]:

- **Vancomycin**: Intravenous vancomycin is the first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia, with dosing adjusted to maintain therapeutic trough levels (15–20 mcg/mL) [^114D2QMm] [^116LcAiy].
- **Daptomycin**: An alternative to vancomycin, particularly in cases of vancomycin intolerance or resistance [^114Rr8LM] [^1146V9Ty].
- **Linezolid, ceftaroline, telavancin**: These antibiotics are considered in cases of persistent or complicated MRSA bacteremia, or when first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective [^111SQUPW].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic use

Using **penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia** would result in:

- **Treatment failure**: Persistent bacteremia due to ineffective antibiotic therapy [^111up4Zy].
- **Increased mortality**: MRSA bacteremia has a high mortality rate (15–25%), and ineffective treatment significantly increases this risk [^116McRrj].
- **Metastatic complications**: Persistent bacteremia can lead to metastatic infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and abscess formation [^111sDnDT].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to the development of further resistance, complicating future treatment options [^114fk4T8].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies for MRSA bacteremia

Effective antibiotic therapies for **MRSA bacteremia** include:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours | - First-line therapy <br/> - Monitor trough levels (15–20 mcg/mL) [^114D2QMm] [^116LcAiy] |
| Daptomycin | 6–10 mg/kg IV once daily | - Alternative to vancomycin <br/> - Monitor for muscle toxicity |
| Linezolid | 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours | - Alternative for persistent or complicated infections <br/> - Monitor for hematologic toxicity |
| Ceftaroline | 600 mg IV every 12 hours | Alternative for persistent or complicated infections [^116g3NZp] |
| Telavancin | 10 mg/kg IV once daily | Alternative for persistent or complicated infections [^11291DFi] |

---

## Conclusion

Penicillin V is not effective for **MRSA bacteremia** due to universal resistance mediated by the mecA gene. Current clinical guidelines explicitly recommend against its use; alternatives include vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, and telavancin, selected based on clinical circumstances [^114Rr8LM] [^111SQUPW]. Using penicillin V for MRSA bacteremia would result in treatment failure, increased mortality, and further antibiotic resistance [^116McRrj] [^114fk4T8].

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: An update on new therapeutic approaches [^116g3NZp]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are options for the initial treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^114Rr8LM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, particularly in pediatric patients requiring antibiotic therapy for MRSA, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin at 15 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 2–6 weeks. This duration depends on the source, presence of endovascular infection, and metastatic foci of infection in pediatric patients with bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by MRSA.

Consider administering daptomycin at 6–10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily as an alternative option. It is advised not to use clindamycin or linezolid in pediatric patients with infective endocarditis.

### Penicillin V potassium [^114fk4T8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin V potassium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

- **Note**: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

- **Streptococcal infections (without bacteremia)**: Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

- **Note**: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

### In MRSA bacteremia, adding a β-lactam to usual care did not improve a composite outcome at 90 days [^11793oqq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In a randomized clinical trial published in JAMA, researchers compared the effects of vancomycin or daptomycin with and without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on patients with MRSA bacteremia. The study aimed to evaluate the impact on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, and treatment failure. The findings indicated that adding a β-lactam to the standard treatment did not provide any significant improvement in the composite outcomes at 90 days.

### Daptomycin versus standard therapy for bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [^112qw5nQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Alternative therapies for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are needed.
- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 124 patients with S. aureus bacteremia with or without endocarditis to receive 6 mg of daptomycin intravenously per kilogram of body weight daily, and 122 to receive initial low-dose gentamicin plus either an antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin. The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success 42 days after the end of therapy.
- **Results**: Forty-two days after the end of therapy in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, a successful outcome was documented for 53 of 120 patients who received daptomycin, as compared with 48 of 115 patients who received standard therapy (44.2 percent vs. 41.7 percent; absolute difference, 2.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -10.2 to 15.1 percent). Our results met prespecified criteria for the noninferiority of daptomycin. The success rates were similar in subgroups of patients with complicated bacteremia, right-sided endocarditis, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Daptomycin therapy was associated with a higher rate of microbiologic failure than standard therapy (19 vs. 11 patients, P = 0.17). In 6 of the 19 patients with microbiologic failure in the daptomycin group, isolates with reduced susceptibility to daptomycin emerged; similarly, a reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was noted in isolates from patients treated with vancomycin. As compared with daptomycin therapy, standard therapy was associated with a nonsignificantly higher rate of adverse events that led to treatment failure.

### SPL drug information for Penicillin V potassium [^112W1jzK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of Penicillin V potassium for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in adults (caused by Staphylococcus aureus) is 250–500 mg PO q6–8h.

### Dicloxacillin sodium [^115EY61x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing dicloxacillin sodium capsules without a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection, or a prophylactic indication, is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

Dicloxacillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. There is clinical and laboratory evidence of partial cross-allergenicity among penicillins and other β-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins, cephamycins, and other 1-oxa-β-lactams. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy.

The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm, or intestinal hypermotility. Occasionally, patients may not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered penicillin.

### SPL drug information for daptomycin [^114TiAfx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of daptomycin IV for the treatment of bacteremia in adults, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, is 6 mg/kg IV q24h for 2 to 6 weeks.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^116tTn5q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, particularly in patients with MRSA septic arthritis, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the following alternatives to vancomycin and clindamycin:

- **Daptomycin**: 6 mg/kg/day IV once daily.
- **Linezolid**: 600 mg PO/IV BID for patients aged ≥ 12 years or 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for patients aged < 12 years.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital-acquired bacteraemia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci. Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. Failure of any aspect of the optimal management, however, is associated with negative patient outcomes.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations for which penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended first-line agents, the problem of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative, but potentially less effective, agents. The use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth.

Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin. The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^11141Gur]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Lysins are bacteriophage-derived enzymes that degrade bacterial peptidoglycans. Lysin CF-301 is being developed to treat Staphylococcus aureus due to its potent, specific, and rapid bacteriolytic effects. It also demonstrates activity on drug-resistant strains, has a low resistance profile, eradicates biofilms, and acts synergistically with antibiotics. CF-301 was bacteriolytic against 250 S. aureus strains tested, including 120 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. In time-kill studies with 62 strains, CF-301 reduced S. aureus by 3-log₁₀ within 30 minutes, contrasted with the 6–12 hours required by antibiotics. In bacteremia, CF-301 increased survival by reducing blood MRSA 100-fold within 1 hour. Combinations of CF-301 with vancomycin or daptomycin synergized in vitro and significantly increased survival in staphylococcal-induced bacteremia compared to treatment with antibiotics alone (P < 0.0001). The superiority of CF-301 combinations with antibiotics was confirmed in 26 independent bacteremia studies. Combinations including CF-301 and antibiotics represent an attractive alternative to antibiotic monotherapies currently used to treat S. aureus bacteremia.

### Dapzura RT [^116dADLg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Overall, there was no difference in time to clearance of S. aureus bacteremia between daptomycin for injection and comparator. The median time to clearance in patients with MSSA was 4 days and in patients with MRSA was 8 days.

Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus infections was assessed by the Adjudication Committee in 19 out of 120 (16%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients (12 with MRSA and 7 with MSSA) and 11 out of 115 (10%) comparator-treated patients (9 with MRSA treated with vancomycin and 2 with MSSA treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin). Among all failures, isolates from 6 daptomycin for injection-treated patients and 1 vancomycin-treated patient developed increasing MICs (reduced susceptibility) by central laboratory testing during or following therapy. Most patients who failed due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus infection had deep-seated infection and did not receive necessary surgical intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
- **Pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) with S. aureus bacteremia**: The pediatric S. aureus bacteremia study was designed as a prospective multi-center, randomized, comparative trial to treat pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years with bacteremia. Patients known to have endocarditis or pneumonia at baseline were excluded. Patients were enrolled in a stepwise approach into three age groups and given age-dependent doses of daptomycin for injection once daily for up to 42 days. The different age groups and doses evaluated were as follows: Adolescents (12 to 17 years, n = 14 patients) treat…

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^116wHVJg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections.

Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Frequency of susceptibility testing for patients with persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^112GatQn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, no standards exist for determining the optimal frequency of repeat antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) when an organism is recurrently isolated from the same specimen source. Although testing every 2 to 5 days is thought sufficient, we present three cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia where laboratory protocol for repeating AST every 5 days was inadequate to identify resistant organisms.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^111AgSEL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The recommended duration of antibiotic treatment for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is frequently based on distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated SAB. Several risk factors at the onset of infection have been proposed to define complicated SAB. However, the predictive values of these risk factors for complicated SAB have not been validated, and their impact on antibiotic prescriptions remains unknown.

- **Methods**: In a prospective cohort study, patients with SAB were categorized as complicated or uncomplicated through adjudication (reference definition). Associations and predictive values of nine risk factors were determined and compared with the reference definition. The accuracy of Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria, which include four risk factors, was also evaluated. Additionally, the projected consequences of applying IDSA criteria on antibiotic use were assessed.

- **Results**: Among 490 patients, 296 (60%) had complicated SAB. Multivariable analysis revealed that persistent bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 6.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.9–12.0), community acquisition of SAB (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9–4.7), and the presence of prosthetic material (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.6) were significantly associated with complicated SAB. The presence of any of the four risk factors in the IDSA definition of complicated SAB had a positive predictive value of 70.9% (95% CI, 65.5–75.9) and a negative predictive value of 57.5% (95% CI, 49.1–64.8). Compared with the reference, IDSA criteria resulted in 24 (5%) false-negative and 90 (18%) false-positive classifications of complicated SAB. The median duration of antibiotic treatment for these 90 patients was 16 days.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related complications in surgical patients [^114kidTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is generally low but can affect up to 33% of patients following certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infections can manifest as surgical site infections (SSIs), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs ranges from 1% to 33%, depending on the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals. The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen for preventing MRSA after surgery remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To compare the benefits and harms of all methods of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative MRSA infection and related complications in surgical patients.

- **Search methods**: In March 2013, we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one antibiotic regimen used as prophylaxis for SSIs (and other postoperative infections) with another antibiotic regimen or with no antibiotic, provided they reported the methicillin resistance status of the cultured organisms. We did not limit our search for RCTs by language.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115w7nNq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin is the most used drug for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The parameter associated with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, because of difficulties in directly measuring AUC, trough concentration (C trough) monitoring has been employed as a surrogate marker since 2009. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that C trough does not consistently reflect AUC values and lacks a significant correlation with outcomes. Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that AUC monitoring may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with C trough measurement. The 2020 revised vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidelines recommend AUC monitoring and suggest using Bayesian software to estimate AUC. Bayesian-derived TDM can easily estimate AUC using the vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model and individual patient data.

Previous studies on adults with severe MRSA infections have recommended an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L as a therapeutic target, despite variations in AUC estimation methods and the inherent limitations of retrospective studies. Given the differences in clinical severity, prognosis, and physiological responses to vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia compared with adults, it remains uncertain whether the AUC/MIC target recommended for adults can be directly extrapolated to the pediatric population. Two retrospective pediatric studies, in which the AUC was calculated using Bayesian estimates, provide additional insights.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: Focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^11291DFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical experience in treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia or infective endocarditis**: A phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telavancin for the treatment of adult patients with uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). Patients were randomized to receive either telavancin (10 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g IV q12h or antistaphylococcal penicillin [nafcillin 2 g IV q6h, oxacillin 2 g IV q6h, or cloxacillin 2 g IV q6h]) for 14 days. Blinded dose adjustments of vancomycin were permitted per site-specific guidelines.

- **ASSURE study**: The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at day 84, defined as resolution of clinical symptoms/signs associated with bacteremia, no evidence of metastatic complications, all cultures negative for S. aureus after qualifying blood cultures, and no non-study systemic antistaphylococcal medication to which the baseline pathogen was susceptible. Of 60 patients randomized to telavancin or standard therapy, 58 received one or more doses of study medication (n = 29 in each group). The key analysis populations included the all-treated target population (ATT; patients who received one or more doses of study medication and fulfilled inclusion/exclusion and continuation criteria [telavancin, n = 15; standard therapy, n = 16]) and the clinically evaluable population (patients in the ATT population who received 12–16 days of study medication and whose study participation did not deviate from the protocol by more than prespecified limits [telavancin, 8; standard therap].

### Predicting risk for death from MRSA bacteremia [^111TabHQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide concern; it colonizes and infects patients both in hospitals and in the community. For the past 50 years in the United States, the standard therapy has been vancomycin. Recent vancomycin treatment failures have raised questions regarding optimal treatment. Although new antimicrobial drugs (e.g. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) have been developed, none has been consistently superior to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA, and MRSA resistance rapidly develops for many new drugs. Some studies have suggested MIC creep (increasing vancomycin MICs against MRSA over time), but others have not. In 2006, the upper limit of vancomycin susceptibility for S. aureus was redefined and lowered from 4 µg/mL to 2 µg/mL, first by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and soon thereafter by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility.

Vancomycin treatment failures for MRSA occur even when MICs are within the range considered susceptible, especially 1–2 µg/mL. Among high-risk bacteremic patients, Sakoulas et al. documented treatment failure rates of 44% when vancomycin MICs were < 0.5 µg/mL and 90% when vancomycin MICs were 1–2 µg/mL (p = 0.01). Hidayat et al. found that mortality rates were higher for patients infected with strains with higher vancomycin MICs.

Some apparently susceptible strains of MRSA might actually be heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) strains. That is, although the hVISA isolates seem to be susceptible to vancomycin, they retain a hidden resistance.

### High vancomycin MIC and complicated methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Cezks]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Values are no. (%) except as indicated. MSSA, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; IV, intravenous.
- **Antistaphylococcal β-lactams**: Refers to parenteral cloxacillin, cefazolin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, or imipenem/meropenem.

- **Antibiotics with in vitro activity against MSSA**: Includes non–β-lactam antibiotics, mostly levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or clindamycin.
- **Delay since isolation of MSSA**: Refers to the time in blood cultures.

- **Removal of catheter**: Removal within the first 48 hours since isolation of MSSA in blood cultures.

- **Catheter management**: Catheter kept at least 7 days since isolation of MSSA in blood cultures.

Comparative data between the 28 patients in whom complicated bacteremia developed and the remaining cohort are shown in Table 2. The percentage of isolates with vancomycin MIC > 1.5 µg/mL was significantly higher in patients with complicated bacteremia (18/28 [64.3%] vs. 5/71 [7%]; p < 0.001). A vancomycin MIC > 1.5 µg/mL was the only variable independently related to the risk for complicated bacteremia (OR 22.9, 95% confidence interval 6.7–78.1) in the multivariate analysis.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^114FD6r4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an evolving pathogen responsible for a variety of infections ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to invasive life-threatening diseases. It is the second most common bacterial pathogen causing infections in outpatients and is among the most frequent causes of nosocomial bacteremia. Metastatic infection and relapse are common, and the involvement of S. aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA]/heterogeneous VISA [hVISA]) and daptomycin is increasing. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin nearly doubled between 2004 and 2009.

For decades, vancomycin has been the gold standard treatment for MRSA infections including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Treatment failures with vancomycin have been associated with the presence of VISA and hVISA and the phenomenon of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep. Furthermore, vancomycin has limited tissue penetration, is slowly bactericidal, and is suboptimal against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA); therefore, S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) relapse is common. Daptomycin, which is approved for the treatment of SAB in the United States and Europe, has been shown to be noninferior to standard therapy in terms of cure (vancomycin or antistaphylococcal penicillin, depending on isolate susceptibility) and is an alternative to vancomycin. Resistance to daptomycin has begun to emerge in two clinical scenarios: in daptomycin-treated patients with undrained infections.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^111SQUPW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate the clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on the management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with a special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: A randomized trial [^1172bC1j]. Nature Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study SAFO was published by Sara Grillo and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nature Medicine. This study relates to the following diseases: Staphylococcus aureus infection, sepsis and septic shock, catheter-related bloodstream infection, septic arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, nonvertebral osteomyelitis, cellulitis, surgical site infection, community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, infective endocarditis, acute pyelonephritis, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and recurrent urinary tract infection in women.

In the SAFO study, the trial question was: what is the role of cloxacillin plus fosfomycin in patients with MSSA bacteremia? The study design was a multi-center, open-label RCT. The population included 214 patients (64 female, 150 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adult patients with MSSA bacteremia. The key exclusion criteria were severe clinical status with expected death in less than 24 hours, severe liver cirrhosis, moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure, suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, and history of significant allergy to β-lactam antibiotics or fosfomycin.

The interventions were as follows:

- **Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin (n = 104)**: Cloxacillin sodium IV 2 g every 4 hours and fosfomycin sodium 3 g every 6 hours.
- **Cloxacillin alone (n = 110)**: Cloxacillin sodium IV 2 g every 4 hours.

The primary outcome showed no significant difference in treatment success at day 7 (79.8% vs. 74.5%; AD 5.3%, 95% CI -5.95 to 16.48). Secondary outcomes demonstrated no significant difference.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: A randomized clinical trial [^114BA7ZL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Methods

- **Study design and setting**: We performed a randomized (1:1), multicenter, phase 3, superiority, open-label, and parallel-group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia at 18 Spanish hospitals. Participants were recruited between December 2013 and November 2017. The ethics committee at each participating center approved the study protocol. The trial was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and Spanish regulatory requirements. This academic trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01898338, and the protocol has been published elsewhere.
- **Participants**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years with MRSA bacteremia, indicated by one or more positive blood cultures within the last 72 hours before randomization and with symptoms and signs of infection, were eligible for the study. Patients or authorized representatives provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included life expectancy ≤ 24 hours, polymicrobial bacteremia, pneumonia as a source of bacteremia, prosthetic valve endocarditis, severe end-stage liver disease (Child-Pugh class C), New York Heart Association functional classification III/IV, prior history of eosinophilic pneumonia, any clinical condition that required additional antibiotic therapy active against MRSA, or allergy to daptomycin or fosfomycin.
- **Randomization and masking**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or to receive 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily.

### Alternatives to vancomycin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^113Vp2f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin remains the reference standard for the treatment of systemic infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, due to limited tissue distribution, as well as the emergence of isolates with reduced susceptibility and in vitro resistance to vancomycin, the need for alternative therapies targeting MRSA has become apparent. New treatment options for invasive MRSA infections include linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Additionally, a number of new anti-MRSA compounds are in development, including novel glycopeptides such as dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin, as well as ceftobiprole and iclaprim. This article reviews clinical issues surrounding the newly marketed and investigational agents with activity against MRSA.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^117VPe2h]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

CF-301 demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of murine MRSA-induced bacteremia. A dose-response curve revealed that survival rates improved with 0.25 mg/kg of CF-301, and a high level of protection, 70%, was obtained with a dosage of 5 mg/kg.
- **In vitro and in vivo activities of CF-301**:
	- **Dose response in murine bacteremia model**: Mice were administered 10⁸ colony-forming units (CFU) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) MW2 per mouse intraperitoneally. Various doses of CF-301, ranging from 0.25 to 5 mg/kg, or a buffer control (no CF-301), were given 3 hours post-inoculation, with survival assessed over 24 hours. Each dose group consisted of 10 mice.
	- **CF-301-mediated in vivo killing in blood**: Mice challenged with 10⁹ CFU of MRSA MW2 per mouse had blood samples taken (n = 3 per time point) after CF-301 or buffer control administration. These samples were plated to measure CFU at various times.
	- **Activity against S. aureus biofilms**: The combination of CF-301 and antibiotics was tested against S. aureus biofilms.
	- **In vitro selection for decreased susceptibility**: During a 26-day passage, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CF-301 increased from 8 to 32 µg/mL, showing a 4-fold change. The daptomycin MIC increased from 0.5 to 64 µg/mL, a 128-fold change, without CF-301, and from 0.25 to 1 µg/mL, a 4-fold change, with 1 µg/mL CF-301. In the presence of vancomycin, the CF-301 MIC increased similarly.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: Focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^113T8WAh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of telavancin has been studied in animal infection models of bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by clinically relevant gram-positive organisms. In these studies, telavancin's efficacy was compared with that of agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin at doses that mimicked human-equivalent exposures. The following are a few illustrative examples.

In several murine bacteremic infection models, telavancin treatment resulted in the successful resolution of an MRSA infection, whereas vancomycin treatment did not. Telavancin also produced significantly greater reductions in blood and spleen bacterial titers (P < .05) compared to vancomycin. The mortality rate (day 14) was lower with telavancin than with vancomycin or controls (1/15 [7%], 15/15 [100%], and 15/15 [100%], respectively). In an immunocompromised murine model of bacteremia caused by glycopeptide intermediate S. aureus (strains HIP-5836 and Mu50) or hVISA (strain Mu3), telavancin was more effective than vancomycin despite only 24 hours of dosing. Moreover, only telavancin produced statistically significant (P < .05) and sustained reductions in blood and spleen titers from pretreatment levels for all three strains tested.

Effects of telavancin and vancomycin on spleen (A) and blood (B) bacterial titers in a murine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia model were observed. For controls at all time points except at t = 10 hours (n = 9) and t = 16 hours (n = 4), n = 10.

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: A randomized clinical trial [^113uYSHx]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.

The objective of the study was to determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.

This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was completed on October 23, 2018.

Participants were randomized to receive standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). The total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians, and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.

The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study.

### The role of vancomycin in the treatment paradigm [^114Lf1o8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin was introduced in the United States in 1956 as a possible treatment for infections due to penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Initially, it was not used widely because of its toxicity and the nearly simultaneous development of semisynthetic antibiotics and cephalosporins. Thus, its main indication was the treatment of serious gram-positive infections in penicillin-allergic patients. For susceptible strains of S. aureus, vancomycin was more rapidly bactericidal than penicillin, nafcillin, or cefazolin. In a rabbit model of S. aureus endocarditis, sterilization of vegetations was more rapid with vancomycin. In clinical practice, however, nafcillin remained the treatment of choice for staphylococcal bacteremia, largely because it had failure rates of only 4%.

With the appearance of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin became the drug of choice for these infections. Recently, the efficacy of vancomycin has been questioned due to vancomycin's increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations among staphylococci, poor tissue penetration, and apparently slower bacterial killing than previously recognized.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: Does it work, which combination, and for which patients [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by standards.

In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (e.g. with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (i.e. monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### Serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111up4Zy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Although first identified just over four decades ago, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has undergone rapid evolutionary changes and epidemiological expansion to become a major cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections worldwide. Increasing resistance to vancomycin among MRSA strains, along with the availability of new antibiotics such as daptomycin and linezolid, has increased treatment options but made clinical treatment decisions more challenging.

This article describes the clinical features and management issues of two challenging-to-treat manifestations of MRSA infection: bacteremia and/or endocarditis and osteomyelitis. It also presents a brief review of community-associated MRSA infections and preventive strategies directed against MRSA.

### Daptomycin [^1146V9Ty]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The efficacy of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, open-label trial. In this trial, adult patients with at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study drug and irrespective of source were enrolled and randomized to either daptomycin for injection (6 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) or standard of care [an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin 1 g IV every 12 hours, each with initial gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for the first 4 days]. Of the patients in the comparator group, 93% received initial gentamicin for a median of 4 days, compared with 1 patient (< 1%) in the daptomycin for injection group. Patients with prosthetic heart valves, intravascular foreign material that was not planned for removal within 4 days after the first dose of study medication, severe neutropenia, known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bloodstream infections, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, and pneumonia were excluded.

Upon entry, patients were classified for likelihood of endocarditis using the modified Duke criteria (Possible, Definite, or Not Endocarditis). Echocardiography, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), was performed within 5 days following study enrollment. The choice of comparator agent was based on the oxacillin susceptibility of the S. aureus isolate.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^112tZkdi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Using the same methodology (Figure 4 B and 4 C), 12 additional MRSA strains were tested with sub-MIC daptomycin and sub-MIC vancomycin alone, as well as in combination with sub-MIC CF-301. Synergy was defined as a ≥ 2-log₁₀ decrease in CFU/mL at the 6-hour timepoint. Sub-MIC amounts of CF-301 demonstrated synergy when tested in combination with sub-MIC amounts of daptomycin (13/13 strains) and vancomycin (11/13 strains).

A second method to confirm synergy was the checkerboard assay. Checkerboards were generated using combinations of sub-MIC CF-301 with either sub-MIC daptomycin or vancomycin against 26 MRSA and 29 MSSA strains. Synergy was defined as inhibitory activity greater than what would be predicted by adding the two drugs together (i.e. minimum fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC min] ≤ 0.5). With MRSA strains, CF-301 was synergistic with daptomycin (23/26 strains) and vancomycin (18/26 strains). For MSSA, CF-301 was synergistic with daptomycin (23/29 strains) and vancomycin (25/29 strains).

In the third method, the extent of synergy between CF-301 and daptomycin was tested in a combination MIC assay by diluting the two drugs together to determine the lowest concentration of the drug combinations required to inhibit growth (Figure 4 D). Daptomycin alone inhibited the growth of MRSA ATCC BAA-1720 at 1.0 µg/mL. In combination with sub-MIC CF-301, the amount of daptomycin required for inhibition decreased to 0.0075 µg/mL. This demonstrated synergy between CF-301 and daptomycin, with a 128-fold decrease in the amount of daptomycin required to inhibit growth.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^113EmfUr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Isolation of MRSA in incident bacteremia episodes did not affect the incidence of recurrence (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.29–2.19]; referent MSSA). Conversely, the isolation of 3GC-resistant E. coli (HR 2.02 [95% CI 1.41–2.91]; referent 3GC-susceptible E. coli) or 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. (HR 2.77 [95% CI 1.60–4.79]; referent 3GC-susceptible Klebsiella spp.) was associated with an increased risk for recurrence. Cumulative incidence function curves of recurrence over time show the differential effect of bacteria-resistance pairs on the risk for recurrence, which was highest for 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. Those results were similar in an analysis stratified by bacterial species and in the multivariable logistic regression model. A sensitivity analysis considering only stays (36%) with information on empirical treatment showed comparable results, with a higher HR for 3GC-resistant Klebsiella spp. and no effect of the adequacy of empirical treatment on recurrence risk.

### Cefazolin vs. antistaphylococcal penicillins for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YaVXJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

There is debate on whether cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be the first-line treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia. Ongoing trials are investigating whether cefazolin is non-inferior to (flu)cloxacillin, but it remains uncertain whether these findings apply to other antistaphylococcal penicillins.
- **Objectives**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing cefazolin with each of the individual antistaphylococcal penicillins for MSSA bacteraemia.
- **Methods**:
	- **Data sources**: We updated a 2019 systematic review but specifically focused on evaluating outcomes by individual antistaphylococcal penicillins.

	- **Study eligibility criteria**: Comparative observational studies were included.

	- **Participants**: Participants included patients with MSSA bacteraemia.

	- **Interventions**: Interventions included cefazolin vs. the antistaphylococcal penicillins.

	- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Assessment of risk of bias involved the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions tool.
- **Methods of data synthesis**: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, and we assessed for non-inferiority of cefazolin using a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of a pooled OR < 1.2 using raw unadjusted data. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), discontinuation due to toxicity, and nephrotoxicity.
- **Results**: No randomized data have been published. A total of 30 observational studies at moderate or high risk of bias were included, which comprised 3,869 patients who…

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively non-toxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^117MdSXz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential.

For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension.

For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration).

Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, and dalb.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Results of an emerging infections network survey [^115Cka8X]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in children; however, optimal management of these patients remains unclear. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia recommend vancomycin therapy for up to 6 weeks, depending on the source and clinical response. Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia recommend nafcillin as first-line therapy, with cefazolin as an alternative.

Despite these recommendations, the application of broad guidelines to specific scenarios encountered in the management of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) in children remains difficult. Recent literature has challenged long-held notions regarding optimal management of SAB associated with osteoarticular infections; however, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management in several other common scenarios, including the following: nonpersistent SAB without a source, prolonged MRSA bacteremia, and central-line associated SAB. Given the complexity in the management of children with SAB, we sought to describe practice patterns and clinical decision-making among pediatric infectious diseases (PID) providers.

### The rational clinical examination. Is this patient allergic to penicillin? An evidence-based analysis of the likelihood of penicillin allergy [^113PW5yR]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently withhold antibiotics that contain penicillin based on patients' self-reported clinical history of an adverse reaction to penicillin and the clinicians' own misunderstandings about the characteristics of a true penicillin allergy.
- **Objectives**: To determine the likelihood of true penicillin allergy with consideration of clinical history and to evaluate the diagnostic value added by appropriate skin testing.
- **Data sources**: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1966 to October 2000. Bibliographies were searched to identify additional articles.
- **Study selection**: We included original studies describing the precision of skin testing in the diagnosis of penicillin allergy. We excluded studies that did not use both minor and major determinants, provide an explicit definition of penicillin allergy, or list the specific criteria necessary for a positive skin test result. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria.
- **Data extraction**: Three authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all articles and reached consensus about any discrepancies.
- **Data synthesis**: Patients' self-reported history has low accuracy for diagnosis of true penicillin allergy. By evaluating studies comparing clinical history to the skin test for penicillin allergy among patients with and without a positive history for penicillin allergy, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated. History of penicillin allergy had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–2.5), while absence of history of penicillin allergy…

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Randomised controlled trial [^11521KG7]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

This was an open-label, parallel, one-to-one randomised controlled trial, conducted in four acute care hospitals: Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tikva (192 patients); Rambam Health Care Campus (38 patients); Holy Family Hospital Nazareth (7 patients); and Wolfson Medical Center (6 patients) in Israel, between July 2007 and April 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal guardians.
- **Study population and procedures**: We included adult inpatients with severe infections caused by MRSA, including bacteraemia, and patients with highly probable MRSA infections. We defined bacteraemia as the isolation of MRSA in more than one blood culture bottle or isolation in a single bottle accompanied by fever above 38°C, chills, or systolic blood pressure under 90 mm Hg. Other microbiologically documented MRSA infections were defined using predefined criteria adapted from surveillance definitions of healthcare-associated infections, plus isolation of MRSA from a sterile sample from the source of infection.

	- Patients with skin and soft tissue infections could be included only if they fulfilled the sepsis inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Patients with polymicrobial infections could be included, except those involving meticillin-susceptible S. aureus or those mandating treatment with vancomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The highly probable group included patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and prior antibiotic treatment, central catheter-related infections, and surgical site infections in the presence of a foreign body, all without microbiological confirmation.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Results of an Emerging Infections Network survey [^115R9Mez]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

- **Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia**: For the treatment of children with persistent MRSA bacteremia despite adequate vancomycin levels, 37% continue vancomycin and add a second agent, most commonly rifampin. A minority (12%) continue vancomycin monotherapy, whereas 43% change to other agents, most commonly daptomycin. Additionally, 8% of providers chose an alternative management strategy.
- **Peripherally inserted central catheter-associated thrombus with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia**: There was no consensus on the duration of IV therapy for children with PICC-associated thrombus and bacteremia. About 34% treated for 2 weeks, 37% treated for 4 weeks, 18% treated for 6 weeks, and 11% chose an alternative treatment strategy. The majority (71%) recommend anticoagulation.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^1139try3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Combinations of CF-301 with antibiotics have been shown to be more efficacious in treating *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteremia than treating with antibiotics alone. Mice with staphylococcal-induced bacteremia were treated with CF-301 and standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics. In a low-challenge model, mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 7.5 × 10⁶ CFU of MRSA MW2 and treated 4 hours later with CF-301, daptomycin, or a combination of both. At 72 hours, treatment with CF-301 yielded 13% survival, whereas treatment with daptomycin yielded 23% survival. Combination of CF-301 with daptomycin resulted in 73% survival, demonstrating that combination therapy was superior to either drug alone (P < .0001).
- **Figure 5: Combination therapy is superior to monotherapy in murine models of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia**. At time 0, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with either 7.5 × 10⁶ CFU/mouse (low-challenge model, A) or 1.0 × 10⁹ CFU/mouse (high-challenge model, B – F) in mucin and were subsequently treated at various times with either antibiotic, CF-301, CF-301 combined with antibiotic, or buffer control. Single-bolus doses were used, with the exception of vancomycin (VAN; twice daily, E) and oxacillin (OXA; 4 times daily, F), which were administered as multiple doses over the first 24-hour period. Different routes of administration were used for CF-301 (intraperitoneal), daptomycin and vancomycin (subcutaneous), and oxacillin (intramuscular). P values were calculated for combinations versus antibiotic alone. Each dataset is a compilation of several individual studies (n = 10–20 per study).

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: Definitions and treatment [^111sDnDT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. It often results in metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis, which have a negative impact on patient outcomes. We review the importance of using precise definitions of uncomplicated and complicated bacteremia and present a case study to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia.

Traditionally, the treatment of choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended to a large extent on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics with proven efficacy against both susceptible and resistant strains are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents currently available for use in the treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, and the scientific evidence forming the basis for using these agents for this indication, are reviewed.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, Australia [^1164GZe6]. Emerging infectious diseases (2005). Low credibility.

This page was updated on August 30, 2005, to incorporate the corrections in Vol. 11, No. 10.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus continues to be a common problem worldwide. In the pre-antibiotic era, most cases occurred in young patients without underlying disease, with an associated death rate of 82%. Even with antimicrobial drug treatment, death rates remain high. In a recent meta-analysis of 31 studies, estimates of death rates for methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) varied from 0.0% to 83.3% (median 34.2%) while those for methicillin-sensitive strains (MSSA) varied from 3.6% to 51.7% (median 25.0%). Many of these infections are healthcare-associated and are potentially preventable.
- **Antimicrobial drug resistance**: Antimicrobial drug resistance in S. aureus arose early after the development of antimicrobial agents and continues to evolve. In Australia, hospital strains are frequently methicillin-resistant and resistant to several other antimicrobial drugs. This resistance limits the choice of potentially efficacious agents and results in frequent use of glycopeptides, such as vancomycin. The reliance on vancomycin causes difficulties because it has been shown to be less effective than isoxazolyl penicillins (e.g. flucloxacillin) in treating severe infections caused by S. aureus. This may explain the higher death rate associated with bacteremia caused by MRSA compared to that caused by MSSA. Although MRSA tends to be the bacterium most often discussed in relation to healthcare-associated infections, MSSA strains are responsible for the largest proportion of hospital-acquired infections.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^114SoiHU]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, particularly concerning pediatric patients, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering vancomycin at a dosage of 30–60 mg/kg/day intravenously, divided into 2–3 equally spaced doses, for a period of 4–6 weeks. This regimen is advised for pediatric patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

### The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam for staphylococcal bacteremia [^1121VHpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus bacteremias leads to the common use of vancomycin as empirical therapy. However, investigators have reported poor outcomes with vancomycin treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Evidence supporting the empirical combination of both vancomycin and a β-lactam agent for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is reviewed. Vancomycin therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with 2–3 times the risk of morbidity and mortality compared to an antistaphylococcal penicillin (oxacillin and nafcillin) or a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin). De-escalation of empirical vancomycin to definitive β-lactam therapy still appears inferior to initial β-lactam therapy. Although there is no clinical trial supporting combination therapy, a scientific rationale for benefit exists and should be weighed against the risks (adverse events, antibiotic resistance, and cost) of additional pharmacotherapy. The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam (either nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) for staphylococcal bacteremia may improve infection-related clinical outcomes.

### Acquisition of daptomycin resistance in patients results in decreased virulence in [^115QGDWp]. Infection and Immunity (2025). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia, with an estimated incidence of 9.3–65 cases per 100,000 per year and a 30-day mortality rate between 18% and 29%. Some sources of staphylococcal bacteremia, such as infective endocarditis or osteomyelitis, are notoriously difficult to treat, and the choice of treatment relies primarily on antimicrobial susceptibility. While bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) is typically treated with antistaphylococcal penicillins, those caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or MSSA in penicillin-allergic patients are treated with daptomycin, vancomycin, or linezolid. Treatment with both vancomycin and daptomycin can be complicated by resistance that may arise from spontaneous mutations during treatment.

Acquisition of antimicrobial resistance often appears to be associated with changes in virulence. For instance, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus can exhibit reduced fitness due to a thickened cell wall, enhanced capsular polysaccharide production, and dysfunction of the Agr virulence regulatory system. However, the consequences of daptomycin resistance on fitness and virulence are not yet well established.

Daptomycin compromises bacterial surface integrity by targeting cell wall biosynthesis and membrane disruption, which may drive bacteria to alter cell surface characteristics, potentially affecting immune host defense recognition. Moreover, daptomycin shares a similar mechanism of action to host innate immune cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which may further complicate treatment strategies.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1113MbZX]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The main treatment options for MRSA infections other than vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. Most new antibiotics were evaluated for skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials. Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials, and when reported, it was very low (usually < 1%). Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not include only MRSA. Daptomycin was non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial including 245 patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, of whom 89 had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin. The overall mortality was 11%.

Similar efficacy and safety were shown for linezolid and vancomycin in nosocomial pneumonia, with a mortality rate in these trials of 14%. Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial that included 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections, but most were skin and soft tissue infections (mortality rate 5%). Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital-acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA), with an overall study mortality of 19%.

Compared with these trials, our study included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as evidenced by the mortality rates. This more closely reflects patients treated with MRSA infections in clinical practice.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking, and there is wide variation in practice.
- **Objectives**: To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.
- **Sources**: The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available, recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.
- **Content**: For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection, the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.
- **Implications**: While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: A consensus from an international expert group [^116iymDt]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Low credibility.

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: In methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), intravenous (IV) flucloxacillin is initially recommended. Garzoni et al. studied the interactions of continuous flucloxacillin and oral rifampicin in 15 patients. The combination with rifampicin increased flucloxacillin levels by 44.5%; however, in monotherapy, the plasma-free drug level of flucloxacillin also exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus by several folds. In other studies, a lowered serum level of flucloxacillin was observed. The expert group recommends a dose of 2-g flucloxacillin every 6 hours. When S. aureus is methicillin-resistant (MRSA), IV vancomycin is recommended initially. Careful monitoring for nephrotoxicity is essential, with therapeutic serum values between 15 and 20 mg/L. However, both glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) and daptomycin demonstrate low cure rates when given as monotherapy in experimental implant-associated infections. In cases of vancomycin allergy, daptomycin can be considered.

- **Coagulase-negative staphylococci**: Coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, are treated like MRSA if they are methicillin-resistant (MRSE). Methicillin susceptibility testing may be difficult in some strains. The expression of resistance is affected by test conditions, and resistance is often heterogeneous, with only a proportion of cells showing resistance. If the mecA gene is absent, strains can be treated as for MSSA.

### Inpatient β-lactam test-dose protocol and antimicrobial stewardship in patients with a history of penicillin allergy [^1155cqDA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in hospitalized patients, resulting in increased second-line antibiotic use, nosocomial infections, and health care use. Given that most patients are not truly allergic, a safe strategy that empowers the admitting physician is needed.

To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing practices for hospitalized patients with penicillin allergy using a validated intervention, an intervention was implemented. This intervention educated health care professionals on the management of patients with penicillin allergy using a validated risk stratification algorithm to guide testing and antibiotic use. Thirty days of control data using the standard of care were compared with 60 days of post-intervention data, measuring documentation of penicillin allergy history and antibiotic selection.

The results showed that the relative use of cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics increased by 121.2% (P = 0.03) and 256% (P = 0.04), respectively, without an increase in adverse drug reactions. There was a decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin, 67.2% (P = 0.04); quinolones, 33.3% (P = 0.31); carbapenems, 81.9% (P = 0.08); and aztreonam, 73.8% (P = 0.18).

In conclusion, the antibiotic choice in patients admitted to the hospital with a reported penicillin allergy can be improved by better evaluation of the allergy history and the use of a risk stratification guideline.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^113imzKp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

In the present study, we show that CF-301 differs from SOC antibiotics by its potency, speed, specificity, and activity against antibiotic-resistant strains. We also demonstrate a low resistance profile, anti-biofilm activity, and synergy with antibiotics in vitro.
- **General features of CF-301**:
	- Protein sequence and diagrammatic representation of CF-301 are depicted with the N-terminal cysteine-histidine–dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) domain in blue and the C-terminal SH3b domain in green. The CHAP domain active-site residues (Cys 26, His 102, Glu 118, and Asn 120), identified by homology to Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2K3A, are highlighted in red.
	- A ribbon representation of a CF-301 model was built with the I-TASSER server using PDBs 2K3A and 1R77 as templates for the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively, with the side chains of the active site residues depicted. The coloring scheme is the same as in the diagrammatic representation and the model was rendered in PyMOL.
	- The lytic activity of Escherichia coli expressing CF-301 (compared to a vector control) is shown on a lawn of Staphylococcus aureus MW2.
	- Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of CF-301 shows the molecular weight markers (PAGE Ruler, Thermo Scientific; lane 1) and CF-301 (lane 2).
	- Time course of CF-301 lytic activity against S. aureus MW2 is examined, where exponential phase cells were treated with either CF-301 (128 µg/mL) or buffer. The OD 600 values were recorded every 30 seconds for 15 minutes. A decrease in optical density was associated with bacteriolysis.

Furthermore, we show that CF-301 exhibits substantial efficacy and may represent a valuable addition to the treatment options available for MRSA-induced infections.

### Daptomycin [^114Fo532]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

A total of 246 patients aged ≥ 18 years (124 received daptomycin for injection, and 122 received a comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 120 patients received daptomycin for injection, and 115 received a comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin). Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin initially received vancomycin for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the S. aureus isolates.

The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30 out of 120 (25%) in the daptomycin for injection group and 37 out of 115 (32%) in the comparator group were aged ≥ 65 years. Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups. Additionally, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline, and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to the onset of the S. aureus bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

The entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised:

- **Definite endocarditis (16%)**: 37 patients; all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
- **Possible endocarditis (61%)**: 144 patients; 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the adjudication process.
- **Not endocarditis (23%)**: 54 patients.

The study provides comprehensive data on the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients treated for S. aureus bacteremia in a rigorous randomized controlled trial setting.

### Dapzura RT [^111iQNsg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive daptomycin for injection or a standard of care comparator, which included intravenous therapy with vancomycin, semi-synthetic penicillin, first-generation cephalosporin, or clindamycin. Patients could switch to oral therapy after demonstrating clinical improvement; no minimum IV dosing was required.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of daptomycin for injection. The clinical outcome was determined by the resolution or improvement of symptoms at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, 7 to 14 days after the last dose, which was assessed by the site-level Blinded Evaluator.

Of the 82 subjects randomized in the study, 81 were treated with either daptomycin for injection or the comparator and included in the safety population; 73 had a proven S. aureus bacteremia at baseline. Of these, 51 subjects were randomized to the daptomycin for injection group, and 22 subjects to the comparator group. The mean duration of IV therapy was 12 days, with a range of 1 to 44 days. Forty-eight subjects switched to oral therapy, and the mean duration of oral therapy was 21 days. The clinical success rates determined at 7 to 14 days after the last dose of therapy (IV and oral) at the TOC visit were 88% (45/51) for daptomycin for injection and 77% (17/22) for the comparator.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.
