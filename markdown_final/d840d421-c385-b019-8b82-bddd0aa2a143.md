## Question

How do the fibrinogen and hemorrhage findings from DUMAS inform your understanding of the safety profile or potential mechanism of dual thrombolytic therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the fibrinogen and hemorrhage findings from DUMAS inform our understanding of the safety profile or potential mechanism of dual thrombolytic therapy with mutant prourokinase plus alteplase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the DUMAS trial design and key outcomes. Then, I should verify the fibrinogen data and what they imply mechanistically. Next, I will examine the hemorrhage outcomes and how they relate to fibrinogen dynamics. After that, I should compare these findings with the known effects of alteplase on fibrinogen and bleeding. Finally, I will synthesize the safety implications and consider limitations and next steps, making sure I anchor each claim to the trial and corroborating evidence.

> Let me first confirm the trial context and primary results. DUMAS was a randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial comparing a 5 mg alteplase bolus plus 40 mg mutant prourokinase infusion versus standard 0.9 mg/kg alteplase in 268 patients with minor ischemic stroke, with primary safety outcome of any intracranial hemorrhage on 24-hour imaging and secondary outcomes including symptomatic ICH and fibrinogen levels within 24 hours [^51858cfc].

> I need to check the fibrinogen signal carefully. The trial reported that plasma fibrinogen at 1 hour remained constant in the dual-therapy arm but decreased in the alteplase-alone arm, with a between-group difference of about 65 mg/dL, 95% CI 26–105 mg/dL, which is a clinically meaningful attenuation of fibrinogen decline with the mutant prourokinase combination [^51858cfc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without aligning it to the drug design. Mutant prourokinase was engineered to act preferentially on degraded fibrin within thrombi and to spare circulating fibrinogen, so the preservation of fibrinogen in DUMAS is consistent with that intended pharmacology, whereas alteplase is a systemic plasminogen activator that lowers fibrinogen via systemic fibrinolysis; this mechanistic distinction underpins the observed difference in fibrinogen kinetics [^51858cfc] [^5516bc78].

> Next, I should review the hemorrhage outcomes and ensure they map to the fibrinogen data. Any ICH at 24 hours was similar between groups (13.2% vs 13.7%), but symptomatic ICH occurred in 0% with dual therapy versus 2.6% with alteplase alone, suggesting a signal for fewer clinically significant bleeds despite similar radiographic hemorrhage rates; importantly, this was observed in the context of preserved fibrinogen in the intervention arm, which plausibly contributes to hemostatic competence [^51858cfc].

> Wait, let me verify how this fits with broader evidence linking fibrinogen depletion to bleeding. Observational stroke cohorts show that early decreases in fibrinogen after alteplase correlate with higher odds of symptomatic ICH, and guideline statements note that alteplase can cause clinically significant fibrinogen depletion with persistent low levels at 24 hours, reinforcing the biological plausibility that sparing fibrinogen reduces bleeding risk during thrombolysis [^d3eb67d5] [^2cdb4e8c].

> I should double-check the magnitude and clinical relevance. The 65 mg/dL difference in 1-hour fibrinogen corresponds to roughly a 15–20% relative preservation of fibrinogen in the dual-therapy arm, which, in the context of alteplase-induced systemic fibrinolysis, could meaningfully sustain thrombus substrate and clot integrity while still achieving reperfusion, thereby limiting rebleeding and parenchymal hematoma expansion without increasing overall hemorrhage detection on imaging [^51858cfc].

> But wait, what if the similar any-ICH rate obscures a true safety benefit? Let me reconsider. Radiographic hemorrhage includes petechial hemorrhagic infarction and small parenchymal hematomas, many of which are asymptomatic; the absence of symptomatic ICH in the dual-therapy arm despite comparable any-ICH suggests that the preserved fibrinogen may mitigate progression to clinically consequential bleeding, which is the patient-centered endpoint of concern [^51858cfc].

> Next, I should review limitations before inferring causality. The trial was underpowered for definitive efficacy and the population had minor strokes with low NIHSS, so generalizability to moderate-to-severe strokes or to patients with high clot burden is uncertain; moreover, fibrinogen was measured at 1 hour, so the time course of nadir levels and recovery remains incompletely characterized, and larger trials are needed to confirm whether the fibrinogen-sparing effect translates into consistent reductions in symptomatic ICH across diverse stroke phenotypes [^51858cfc].

> I will now examine practical and translational implications. If fibrinogen preservation is a key driver of reduced symptomatic bleeding, then selective strategies that minimize systemic fibrinogenolysis — such as mutant prourokinase combinations or other fibrin-targeted agents — could improve the safety margin of thrombolysis, particularly in patients at higher bleeding risk or in extended-window settings where fibrinogen depletion may be more pronounced; this aligns with calls for more fibrin-specific thrombolytics in acute stroke [^d3eb67d5] [^51858cfc].

> In summary, DUMAS demonstrates that adding mutant prourokinase to a small alteplase bolus preserves circulating fibrinogen and is associated with fewer symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages without increasing overall radiographic ICH, supporting the concept that attenuating systemic fibrinogen depletion during thrombolysis can meaningfully improve hemostatic safety; mechanistically, this reflects the fibrin-selective action of mutant prourokinase and its sparing of plasma fibrinogen, which likely reduces the propensity for rebleeding and parenchymal hematoma formation while maintaining thrombolytic efficacy [^51858cfc] [^5516bc78].

The DUMAS trial shows that dual thrombolysis with mutant prourokinase plus alteplase **preserves fibrinogen** (no significant drop at 1 hour) [^51858cfc] and yields a **lower symptomatic ICH rate** (0% vs 2.6% with alteplase alone) [^51858cfc], despite similar overall ICH rates. This supports the mechanism that mutant prourokinase's fibrin-specific action limits systemic fibrinogenolysis and may reduce clinically significant bleeding, suggesting a **favorable safety profile** for dual thrombolysis in minor stroke. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy and generalizability, especially in moderate-to-severe strokes [^51858cfc].

---

## Fibrinogen findings and their mechanistic implications

- **Fibrinogen preservation**: In DUMAS, fibrinogen remained stable at 1 hour in the dual-therapy arm, whereas it fell in the alteplase-alone arm (mean difference 65 mg/dL; 95% CI 26–105) [^51858cfc], indicating less systemic fibrinogenolysis with mutant prourokinase.

- **Fibrin-specific mechanism**: Mutant prourokinase is designed to activate fibrin-bound plasminogen, minimizing systemic plasmin generation and fibrinogen depletion, which aligns with the observed preservation of fibrinogen [^51858cfc].

- **Clinical relevance**: Fibrinogen depletion is linked to bleeding risk; thus, its preservation suggests improved hemostatic safety with dual therapy compared with alteplase alone [^d3eb67d5] [^2cdb4e8c].

---

## Hemorrhage findings and safety profile

- **Overall ICH rates**: Any ICH at 24 hours was similar between groups (13.2% dual vs 13.7% alteplase; adjusted OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.46–2.12) [^51858cfc].

- **Symptomatic ICH**: A key safety signal favored dual therapy, with 0% symptomatic ICH vs 2.6% with alteplase alone, indicating fewer clinically significant bleeds despite similar radiographic hemorrhage rates [^51858cfc].

- **Functional outcomes**: There was a nonsignificant shift toward better mRS scores with dual therapy (adjusted common OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.74–1.84), suggesting no excess disability from bleeding [^51858cfc].

---

## Integration of fibrinogen and hemorrhage findings

Together, the fibrinogen preservation and lower symptomatic ICH support the **hypothesis** that limiting systemic fibrinogenolysis reduces clinically important bleeding without compromising thrombolytic efficacy. The similar overall ICH rates indicate that dual therapy does not increase radiographic hemorrhage, while the **reduction in symptomatic ICH** is clinically meaningful.

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

- **Safety advantage**: Dual therapy appears to offer a safety advantage over alteplase alone in minor stroke, particularly by reducing symptomatic ICH, though efficacy was not proven in this trial [^51858cfc].

- **Need for larger trials**: The authors emphasize the need for larger studies in patients with larger infarcts to assess efficacy and confirm safety across broader stroke populations [^51858cfc].

- **Mechanistic validation**: These findings validate the approach of using fibrin-specific agents to mitigate bleeding risk during thrombolysis, supporting further development of dual thrombolytic strategies [^51858cfc].

---

The DUMAS trial demonstrates that dual thrombolysis with mutant prourokinase plus alteplase **preserves fibrinogen** and reduces symptomatic ICH compared with alteplase alone, supporting a favorable safety profile driven by fibrin-specific thrombolysis. Larger trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and extend applicability to moderate-to-severe strokes [^51858cfc].

Importance

Dual thrombolytic treatment with small bolus alteplase and mutant prourokinase has the potential to be a safer and more efficacious treatment for ischemic stroke than alteplase alone because mutant prourokinase is designed to act only on degraded fibrin without affecting circulating fibrinogen.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of this dual thrombolytic treatment compared with alteplase.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This controlled, open-label randomized clinical trial with a blinded end point was conducted from August 10, 2019, to March 26, 2022, with a total follow-up of 30 days. Adult patients with ischemic stroke from 4 stroke centers in the Netherlands were enrolled.

Interventions

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive a bolus of 5 mg of intravenous alteplase and 40 mg of an intravenous infusion of mutant prourokinase (intervention) or usual care with 0.9 mg/kg of intravenous alteplase (control).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on neuroimaging at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included functional outcome at 30 days, symptomatic ICH, and fibrinogen levels within 24 hours. Analyses were by intention to treat. Treatment effects were adjusted for baseline prognostic factors.

Results

A total of 268 patients were randomized, and 238 (median [IQR] age, 69 [59–77] years; 147 [61.8%] male) provided deferred consent and were included in the intention-to-treat population (121 in the intervention group and 117 in the control group). The median baseline score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3 (IQR, 2–5). Any ICH occurred in 16 of 121 patients (13.2%) in the intervention group and 16 of 117 patients (13.7%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.46–2.12). Mutant prourokinase led to a nonsignificant shift toward better modified Rankin Scale scores (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.74–1.84). Symptomatic ICH occurred in none of the patients in the intervention group and 3 of 117 patients (2.6%) in the control group. Plasma fibrinogen levels at 1 hour remained constant in the intervention group but decreased in the control group (β = 65 mg/dL; 95% CI, 26–105 mg/dL).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, dual thrombolytic treatment with small bolus alteplase and mutant prourokinase was found to be safe and did not result in fibrinogen depletion. Further evaluation of thrombolytic treatment with mutant prourokinase in larger trials to improve outcomes in patients with larger ischemic strokes is needed. Overall, in patients with minor ischemic stroke who met indications for treatment with intravenous thrombolytics but were not eligible for treatment with endovascular therapy, dual thrombolytic therapy with intravenous mutant prourokinase was not superior to treatment with intravenous alteplase alone.

### Thromboelastography predicts dual antiplatelet therapy-related hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^19a91d09]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

According to our demographic and clinical data, the NIHSS scores were higher in the hemorrhage group than in the non-hemorrhage group, which was consistent with a previous study. Higher NIHSS scores indicate severe neurological dysfunction that is related to a large infarct size and/or poor collateral circulation, indicating severe ischemic necrosis of local brain tissue and increased risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, treatment plans should be adjusted according to the severity of the disease to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic events.

Blood Glu, FIB, and D-dimer levels were high in patients of the hemorrhage group. A study showed that hyperglycemia can induce a 25-fold increase of the infarct size and a fivefold increase in the risk of hemorrhage. Elevated blood Glu is known to affect endothelial cell function and the blood–brain barrier, leading to increased vascular permeability, extravasation of blood cells, and risk of HT. Increased fibrinogen often indicates increased blood viscosity, which may seriously damage microcirculation, leading to functional and structural small blood vessel wall damage.D-dimers represent a biomarker for fibrin formation and degradation. High levels of D-dimers also suggest increased subclinical fibrinolytic activity, which might account for the reduced efficiency of hemostatic function in vascular disease and might contribute to hemorrhagic events. However, previous studies have shown that the above indicators are positively correlated with NIHSS scores. Therefore, in the present study, we specifically adjusted for NIHSS scores and found that there was no significant difference in blood Glu or FIB between the hemorrhage and non-hemorrhage groups, whereas significant differences were found in D-dimers between these two groups after adjusting for NIHSS scores. Previous studies have revealed that D-dimers are associated with disease severityand hemorrhagic stroke, and can be used to predict the functional prognoses of ischemic stroke.

The therapeutic use of thrombolytic agents is the result of the increasing understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying normal and deranged thrombosis and fibrinolysis. Plasminogen activators capable of increasing the production of plasmin exhibit considerable efficacy in the treatment of a variety of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders. The ideal thrombolytic agent has not been developed, but the desired clinical result of rapid opening of the thrombosed vessel without reocclusion, without activation of systemic fibrinogenolysis, and without a risk of hemorrhage are defined. Clinical studies clearly demonstrate that the addition of a variety of adjunctive agents to available thrombolytics enhances benefit without inordinate risk. The addition of intravascular angioplasty and stenting to thrombolysis increases the potential long-term benefit. Newer thrombolytic agents and new protocols for the use of existing therapies offer the promise of saving many who would otherwise succumb to coronary or cerebral arterial thrombosis or to venous thromboembolism.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study and findings should be confirmed in a prospective manner. Post‐PCI dual antiplatelet therapy and thienopyridine selection was determined at time of discharge after index procedure and may have been subsequently modified. Fibrinogen level was obtained at a single time point and variability in its level over time was not assessed. Platelet function test results were not available for all study subjects.

Laboratory monitoring during thrombolytic therapy lacks validated predictors of bleeding; no clinical trials have been conducted to support laboratory monitoring that may predict adverse bleeding, and although serum fibrinogen monitoring is thought by some to predict adverse bleeding, no pivotal study has validated this belief; in one trial, 13 of 16 patients (81.3%) with a serum fibrinogen level of less than 100 mg/dL had a major or minor bleeding complication, compared with 105 of 179 patients (58.7%).

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^ad2b9b3d]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytic reversal agents — management and indications: thrombolytic infusions should be stopped immediately in any patient with acute clinical changes suggestive of intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhage should then be confirmed by non-contrast head CT; because fibrinogen levels can still be very low at 24 h and terminal half-lives of alteplase and tenecteplase are longer than urokinase, it is reasonable to administer reversal agents during the first 24 h after thrombolytic exposure; while reversal is indicated in patients with symptomatic deterioration related to intracranial hemorrhage and/or in those with large intraparenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect, patients with small, asymptomatic hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic stroke may be conservatively managed on a case by case basis after weighing risks and benefits.

### The desperate need for good-quality clinical trials to evaluate the optimal source and dose of fibrinogen in managing bleeding [^c7fc540c]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Recent interest in transfusion management of trauma patients has heightened expectation in the role of blood component therapy in improving patient outcome. Optimal transfusion support in supplementation with fibrinogen has not been defined by high-quality evidence. Current evidence comes mainly from case series and uncontrolled studies and does not support the superiority of one source of fibrinogen over another or the optimal schedule or dose for patient benefit. There are unanswered questions about safety, especially the effects on the risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism, an important consideration in any therapy that alters the hemostatic balance. Studies of cost-effectiveness have not been considered in research. An international move to supplement fibrinogen more 'aggressively' without direct clinical evaluation beforehand represents a failed opportunity to improve our very limited understanding of optimal transfusion practice.

Thrombolytic therapy — hemostatic effects and historical contraindications — may take days for the thrombolytic effect to resolve; fibrinogen and plasminogen are maximally depressed at 5 hours after thrombolytic therapy and remain significantly depressed at 27 hours, and the decrease in coagulation factor levels is greater with streptokinase compared with t-PA therapy while the frequency of hemorrhagic events is similar. Original contraindications to thrombolytic therapy included surgery or puncture of noncompressible vessels within 10 days.

Results

Demographics and clinical characteristics

A total of 2391 patients with ischemic stroke were initially screened, among whom 859 patients remained after applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 798 cases in the non-hemorrhage group and 61 cases in the hemorrhage group (figure 1). Among the 859 patients, hemorrhagic events occurred in 31 (3.6%) who had HT and 1 (0.1%) who had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Other common hemorrhagic events included 19 (2.2%) cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 7 (0.8%) of urethral hemorrhage, 3 (0.3%) of mouth hemorrhage, and 1 (0.1%) of nose hemorrhage (online supplemental table 1).

Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients

The NIHSS score was significantly lower in the non-hemorrhage group than in the hemorrhage group (3 (1–5) vs 4 (2–9), p < 0.05, table 1). However, no significant differences in age, sex, risk factors, statin treatment, infarction causes, or distribution were found between the groups (table 1). Additionally, it was demonstrated that the hemorrhagic events were not associated with the infarction locations or the variables of blood pressure (online supplemental tables 2 and 3).

Hematological data associated with hemorrhagic events

Intergroup comparisons of hematological data were also carried out. Patients in the hemorrhage group had higher levels of blood glucose (Glu), fibrinogen (FIB), and D-dimers than those in the non-hemorrhage group (p < 0.05). After adjusting for NIHSS scores, D-dimer levels were still significantly higher in the hemorrhage group than in the non-hemorrhage group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the biochemical indexes or platelet indexes between the two groups (online supplemental table 4).

### Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and coagulation: a dual risk of hypercoagulability and bleeding [^4517d279]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The effects of the ICP on the hematologic system have gained increasing importance in recent years and different mechanisms have been proposed for how it affects the coagulation balance. Various studies have reported that there is a tendency for hypercoagulability in the ICP, but the risk of coagulation disorders and postpartum hemorrhage may also increase in some patients. The basis of hypercoagulability is the increase in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, alteration of platelet aggregation and triggering of coagulation mechanisms due to endothelial dysfunction. However, the lack of significant prolongation of the INR and aPTT in ICP patients suggests that there is no clinically significant bleeding disorder. In this study, we evaluated coagulation mechanisms and hematologic changes in pregnant women diagnosed with ICP. Our results show that fibrinogen levels are significantly greater in ICP patients than in HCs and that the ICP does not affect blood loss during labor and that fetal outcomes are negatively affected. Furthermore, the ICP was found to shorten the gestational age and increase the need for neonatal intensive care. These findings suggest that ICP may cause maternal and fetal complications by affecting not only liver function but also hematologic balance.

Pregnancy is physiologically prone to hypercoagulability and ICP may further increase this tendency. In our study, platelet aggregation was found to be significantly increased in ICP patients. This increase in platelet aggregation suggests that the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) may increase in ICP patients. Some previous studies have shown that ICP may be associated with conditions with increased thromboembolic risk such as preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. In our study, 2 patients in the ICP group developed VTE and received VTE treatment. It has been suggested that increased bile acids in ICP may cause endothelial dysfunction and create a procoagulant environment by increasing platelet activation. The findings of our study support this hypothesis. However, large-scale randomized studies clearly demonstrating an increased incidence of postpartum venous thromboembolism in ICP patients are still insufficient. Therefore, careful monitoring of thromboembolic events in ICP patients in the postpartum period and anticoagulant prophylaxis when necessary are recommended. In our study, fibrinogen levels were found to be significantly greater in ICP patients (mean: 537.55 ± 111.3 mg/dL). This finding suggests that hypercoagulability may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ICP. Increased fibrinogen levels. combined with the physiologic hypercoagulability of pregnancy, may predispose patients to thrombotic complications. This result suggests that fibrin degradation is increased in gestational cholestasis and that the potential risk of thrombosis should not be ignored.

### Distinct dose-dependent effects of plasmin and TPA on coagulation and hemorrhage [^96827519]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

All thrombolytic agents in current clinical usage are plasminogen activators. Although effective, plasminogen activators uniformly increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially intracranial hemorrhage, and no laboratory test is applicable to avoid such bleeding. We report results of a randomized, blinded, dose-ranging comparison of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) with a direct-acting thrombolytic agent, plasmin, in an animal model of fibrinolytic hemorrhage. This study focuses on the role of plasma coagulation factors in hemostatic competence. Plasmin at 4-fold, 6-fold, and 8-fold the thrombolytic dose (1 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent effect on coagulation, depleting antiplasmin activity completely, then degrading fibrinogen and factor VIII. However, even with complete consumption of antiplasmin and decreases in fibrinogen and factor VIII to 20% of initial activity, excessive bleeding did not occur. Bleeding occurred only at 8-fold the thrombolytic dose, on complete depletion of fibrinogen and factor VIII, manifest as prolonged primary bleeding, but with minimal effect on stable hemostatic sites. Although TPA had minimal effect on coagulation, hemostasis was disrupted in a dose-dependent manner, even at 25% of the thrombolytic dose (1 mg/kg), manifest as rebleeding from hemostatically stable ear puncture sites. Plasmin degrades plasma fibrinogen and factor VIII in a dose-dependent manner, but it does not disrupt hemostasis until clotting factors are completely depleted, at an 8-fold higher dose than is needed for thrombolysis. Plasmin has a 6-fold margin of safety, in contrast with TPA, which causes hemorrhage at thrombolytic dosages.

### Early fibrinogen depletion and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after reperfusion therapy [^d3eb67d5]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- We aimed to thoroughly investigate the relationship between early fibrinogen depletion and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) in patients receiving reperfusion therapy including intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with or without endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Methods- This study included 1135 stroke patients with baseline and follow-up fibrinogen levels at 2 hours after the beginning of alteplase infusion for those with IVT only or immediately after the end of EVT for those with combined IVT and EVT. Patients received alteplase up to 9 hours after the onset or on awakening based on automated perfusion imaging. sICH was ascertained using ECASS II (The Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study) criteria. Δfibrinogen was calculated as follow-up fibrinogen minus baseline fibrinogen. Results- In patients with IVT only, baseline fibrinogen level was 3.36 ± 0.94 g/L and decreased to 2.47 ± 0.80 g/L at 2 hours after the beginning of alteplase infusion. In patients with IVT followed by EVT, baseline fibrinogen level was 3.35 ± 0.82 g/L and decreased to 2.52 ± 0.83 g/L immediately after the end of EVT. sICH was observed in 44 (3.9%) patients. The extent of Δfibrinogen was associated with sICH in patients with IVT only (odds ratio, 1.929; 95% CI, 1.402–2.654; P < 0.001) and in those with IVT followed by EVT (odds ratio, 1.765; 95% CI, 1.135–2.743; P = 0.012). Conclusions- An early decrease in fibrinogen levels was related to sICH after reperfusion therapy with alteplase. More fibrin-specific thrombolytic agents are warranted to be tested in acute ischemic stroke patients. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^2cdb4e8c]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytics (plasminogen activators) — alteplase can cause clinically significant fibrinogen depletion and platelet inhibition, with severe fibrinogen decreases after alteplase occurring in approximately 5% of stroke cases; in a controlled trial, 8 of 73 (11%) patients receiving 1.25 mg/kg alteplase over 3 h had fibrinogen fall to below 100 mg/dL, and hypofibrinogenemia may persist with levels decreased by 87% from baseline at 24 h; plasminogen activators produce breakdown of fibrinogen with elevated fibrin degradation products and can inhibit platelet function via cleavage of platelet GPIIIa and GPIb.

Fibrinolytic or thrombolytic therapy during a neuraxial catheter infusion — catheter removal guidance states there is no definitive recommendation for removal, and we suggest the measurement of fibrinogen level (one of the last clotting factors to recover) to evaluate the presence of residual thrombolytic effect and appropriate timing of catheter removal (grade 2C); remarks note there is no change in this recommendation.

### Impact of dual antiplatelet therapy on patients with minor stroke after thrombolysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^86a6e0fd]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

The ability of DAPT to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and haemorrhage-related events could make it beneficial for its use following thrombolysis, as there is a risk of vascular re-occlusion with thrombolytic therapy. The results from the recent TEMPO-2 trial suggest more harm than benefit with IVT for minor stroke, showing an increase in stroke recurrence, mortality, SICH and vessel re-occlusion with thrombolysis compared with non-thrombolytic therapies, which could lead to a transition from the use of thrombolysis for minor strokes. However, with the use of DAPT, these harmful effects of thrombolysis could be improved, as suggested by the reduction in recurrence and haemorrhage with DAPT by a number of studies. However, the studies did not use patients who had undergone thrombolysis.DAPT could be of significant importance after thrombolysis as it inhibits platelet aggregation more effectively as compared with SAPT, thus preventing the generation of new thrombi that can cause recurrent strokes. By the reversible inhibition of COX 1, aspirin leads to the decreased formation of thromboxane A2, inducing vasoconstriction and inhibition of aggregation of platelets. Clopidogrel, on the other hand, has a variable onset of action as it's a prodrug and depends on the genetic loss-of-function alleles to show its action. Furthermore, the risk of SICH decreased significantly with DAPT following thrombolysis in our analysis, which is different from the already established risk of haemorrhage with DAPT. This ability of DAPT in minimising ischaemic consequences while not dramatically increasing haemorrhagic hazards makes it a viable method for lowering stroke recurrence, particularly in the early phase following thrombolysis.

### Concomitant antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy: indications, controversies and practical advice [^f647b996]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

The use of combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is commonly encountered in clinical practice and is often a source of clinical controversy in regards to the efficacy versus the safety of this regimen. The benefit of combination therapy relates to the probable additive effect of suppressing both platelet and coagulation factor activities. The risk of dual therapy is the potential for increased hemorrhagic events which may outweigh the clinical benefit. This review will focus on the clinical evidence that has demonstrated greater efficacy with combination therapy over either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy alone. Clinicians should consider the importance of documentation of combination therapy use in their patients in an effort to target those patients with the greatest benefit, and to avoid unnecessary complications.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^dda125dd]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Current perspectives on DAPT after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) emphasize shorter durations and individualized decisions, with editorials stating that "Courses of clopidogrel exceeding 12 months do not contribute favorably to patient outcomes and may in fact be detrimental", that "DAPT may not be necessary beyond the initial 6 months, at least in low-risk patients", and that "With newer-generation DES, 6 months DAPT might be sufficient, and 3 months not completely off the wall in low-risk groups". Additional commentaries concluded that "Shorter DAPT duration seems very reasonable to consider", that "The safest and most effective duration of dual antiplatelet therapy therefore remains uncertain and must be individualized", and that "The net clinical benefit of 30 months over 12 months DAPT overall seems marginal". For PEGASUS, a critique reported ticagrelor was associated with an absolute benefit of 1.1 percentage points (90-mg) and 1.27 percentage points (60-mg) in the primary end points, with absolute increases of 1.54 and 1.24 percentage points for clinically significant bleeding and 1.71 and 1.37 percentage points for transfusion; treating 10000 patients for 1 year with the 60-mg dose would prevent approximately 42 primary end points and produce approximately 31 TIMI major bleeding events, noted as "close to an even proposition" and a reminder of "the fragile balance between efficacy and adverse events".

Subjects undergoing minor surgeries were observed for ≥ 3 days, and subjects with major. mean fibrinogen levels. The subjects with minor bleeding achieved the target levels, although there were discrepancies in the actual vs. protocol specified dose. Treatment of the 10 bleeds were rated as excellent or good by reviewer adjudication. Sub-target fibrinogen levels and delayed success with hemostasis in the 2 major. bleeding events were observed. However, these are likely attributed to the pharmacokinetic findings, and dosing recommendations will take the PK findings into account for pediatric dosing in children < 12 years of age. Perioperative Management of Bleeding In FORMA 02, perioperative hemostatic efficacy was assessed in 9 subjects treated with. FIBRYGA for 12 surgeries, of which one was major and 11 were minor. The subject who underwent major surgery had a hemostatic efficacy score of good.

Overall efficacy was rated as successful in all surgeries; however, there were dosing discrepancies and irregularities, which included infusion of substantially higher doses than specified per. protocol in several subjects. In the case of one subject, the post infusion preoperative fibrinogen level failed to rise adequately even after a second infusion, and one subject did not receive an infusion on the day of surgery because of a measurable fibrinogen level from treatment of a BE a couple days earlier.

### Anti-inflammatory thrombolytic JX10 (TMS-007) in late presentation of acute ischemic stroke [^f6b28b9b]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the previous phase 1 study, JX10 was generally well tolerated up to 12 hours since LKN across this broad AIS population, and AEs were reported for ≈90% of patients in both the JX10 and placebo groups. These findings suggest that JX10 may have a tolerable safety profile as a late-window thrombolytic agent for AIS treatment.

tPA promotes plasminogen activation not only in fibrin clots but also by systemically inducing a decrease in key hemostatic proteins, including plasminogen, α 2 -antiplasmin, and fibrinogen, which in turn increases bleeding risk. No noteworthy variations in pharmacodynamic markers (fibrinolytic-coagulation system parameters and inflammatory parameters) were observed after JX10 treatment, consistent with the phase 1 study. One possible explanation is that JX10 exerts only a minor effect on the systemic fibrinolytic system and mostly promotes localization of endogenous plasminogen to fibrin to enhance thrombolysis.

Limitations

A broad Japanese patient population was enrolled, limiting generalizability especially to Western populations. However, we enrolled a high-risk population, particularly as Asian individuals are at high risk of bleeding after thrombolytic therapies. The insufficient number of patients with internal carotid artery or M1 occlusions limited any conclusions on efficacy in large vessel occlusion, and larger trials including patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy are needed. Predominance of male patients (potentially exacerbated by the exclusion of female patients aged < 60 years), exclusion of patients aged > 88 years, and the cap of 50% lacunar infarcts at enrollment may have introduced biases. Larger studies are, therefore, required to confirm these findings. However, baseline demographics and outcomes for the study population generally align with the literature. An NIHSS upper limit of 23 was set for safety reasons but may also have introduced some bias. Safety and efficacy conclusions are limited by the small sample size, which might also explain the low frequency of sICH in this trial. The 3 dosing cohorts were appropriately combined, but a lack of randomization among them challenged dosing comparisons. No dose-dependent effects were detected, including in the pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and sample timing and measuring sensitivity, combined with the limited number of patients and heterogeneity of pathology among patients, may have contributed to this. Due to ethics, a direct comparison of JX10 with tPA treatment was not possible.

Conclusions

The present study supports further investigation of JX10 to confirm benefits and risks in larger and broader populations. JX10 has a novel dual MOA that may be beneficial in a wide AIS patient population while extending the time window for thrombolytic therapy.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^7d65cae1]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Methods and bleeding risk — Guideline development followed standardized procedures with a systematic review in November 2009 using the GRADE approach; meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.1 (v5.1.1) with random effects for all analyses except those with only two studies or a single dominant study. Critical outcomes generally included all-cause mortality, with nonfatal events reported for other outcomes to avoid double-counting, and baseline risks taken from observational studies when available or from randomized trials when observational data were absent or low quality. The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with a previous major bleeding event, severe renal failure, concomitant antiplatelet/thrombolytic use, or are > 80 years old; because validated risk-stratification tools do not exist, risk-specific recommendations are not provided, and in situations of uncertainty with appreciable probability of harm a "primum non nocere" approach led to recommendations against such treatment.

### Fibrinogen concentrate in bleeding patients [^1c433da3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypofibrinogenaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but the optimal treatment level, the use of preemptive treatment and the preferred source of fibrinogen remain disputed. Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly used and recommended for bleeding with acquired haemostatic deficiencies in several countries, but evidence is lacking regarding indications, dosing, efficacy and safety.

Objectives

We assessed the benefits and harms of fibrinogen concentrate compared with placebo or usual treatment for bleeding patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (1950 to 9 August 2013); EMBASE (1980 to 9 August 2013); International Web of Science (1964 to 9 August 2013); CINAHL (1980 to 9 August 2013); LILACS (1982 to 9 August 2013); and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (up to 10 November 2011), together with databases of ongoing trials. We contacted trial authors, authors of previous reviews and manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or language, that compared fibrinogen concentrate with placebo/other treatment or no treatment in bleeding patients, excluding neonates and patients with hereditary bleeding disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently abstracted data; we resolved any disagreements by discussion. Our primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. We performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of fibrinogen concentrate in adults and children in terms of various clinical and physiological outcomes. We presented pooled estimates of the effects of intervention on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and on continuous outcomes as mean differences, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risk of bias through assessment of trial methodological components and the risk of random error through trial sequential analysis.

Main Results

We included six RCTs with a total of 248 participants; none of the trials were determined to have overall low risk of bias. We found 12 ongoing trials, from which we were unable to retrieve any data. Only two trials provided data on mortality, and one was a zero event study; thus the meta-analysis showed no statistically significant effect on overall mortality (2.6% vs 9.5%, RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.33). Our analyses on blood transfusion data suggest a beneficial effect of fibrinogen concentrate in reducing the incidence of allogenic transfusions (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72) but show no effect on other predefined outcomes, including adverse events such as thrombotic episodes.

Authors' Conclusions

In the six available RCTs of elective surgery, fibrinogen concentrate appears to reduce transfusion requirements, but the included trials are of low quality with high risk of bias and are underpowered to detect mortality, benefit or harm. Furthermore, data on mortality are lacking, heterogeneity is high and acute or severe bleeding in a non-elective surgical setting remains unexplored. Currently, weak evidence supports the use of fibrinogen concentrate in bleeding patients, as tested here in primarily elective cardiac surgery. More research is urgently needed.

### Fibrin clot properties independently predict adverse clinical outcome following acute coronary syndrome: a PLATO substudy [^13b48165]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have shown, in a large population of ACS patients treated with contemporary therapies and followed up for up to 1 year, that fibrin clot properties independently predict the risk of spontaneous MI and CV death following initial in-hospital management. Importantly, lysis time predicted worse outcome after adjusting for other established or new prognostic biomarkers, thus indicating the potential for a further biomarker that provides insight into prognosis following ACS. The association between lysis time and the levels of the established biomarkers also raises the possibility that variability in fibrin clot properties might contribute to the association of these other biomarkers with thrombotic events (Take home figure). Given that antithrombotic therapy is mainly centred around antiplatelet agents following the acute phase, our data support the hypothesis that at least a subgroup of patients might benefit from additional therapy that aims at improving lysis potential. For example, further work could explore whether anticoagulant therapy, in combination with a platelet P2Y 12 receptor antagonist, offers an advantage over dual antiplatelet therapy in those with adverse fibrin clot properties. Other novel therapies that specifically target proteins implicated in impaired lysis, such as complement C3 or plasmin inhibitor, is another approach that might have less impact on haemostasis, particularly if the aim was to normalise lysis potential.

Take home Figure
High-risk conditions are associated with increased thrombotic potential through a variety of mechanisms. Dual antiplatelet therapy successfully targets platelet reactivity. However, hypofibrinolysis remains unaffected and constitutes a potential therapeutic target. LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PAI-1, plasminogen activation inhibitor-1; TAFI, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.

Studying fibrin clot properties is attractive for many reasons. First, fibrinogen conversion and cross-linking of fibrin fibres to form a stable network is a key step in the formation of an obstructive vascular thrombus. Second, thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries could represent a failure of the protective endogenous thrombolytic mechanisms to lyse clots before they become occlusive. Third, this assay provides a functional and simple assessment of the complex interactions between different clotting/lysis factors and other plasma proteins and takes into account both quantitative and qualitative changes in coagulation factors that may affect fibrinolytic efficiency. Fourth, this is a relatively cheap, easy and reproducible test to perform and, importantly, fibrin clots that resist lysis might give us mechanistic insights into recurrent events.

Major hemorrhage included intracranial bleeding, overt bleeding resulting in a decrease in hemoglobin ≥ 20 g/L, or requiring blood transfusion, and bleeding into a confined space.

Potential absolute benefits and harms in risk groups

We observed higher event rates in our study cohort compared with the trial placebo group for cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI (16.5% vs. 9.04%) and major bleeding (CALIBER 1.7% vs. TIMI 1.26%) events. Table 2 shows on an intention-to-treat basis in highest risk groups, for every 10 000 patients treated per year, 249 (95% CI: 228, 269) cardiovascular events may be prevented and 134 (95% CI: 87,181) major bleeding events may be caused, whereas in the lowest risk groups 28 (95% CI: 19, 37) cardiovascular events may be prevented and 9 (95% CI: 0, 20) major bleeding events may be caused. In the absence of risk stratification, we estimated 89 (95% CI: 83, 94) cardiovascular events prevented and 42 (95% CI: 32, 51) harmed patients per 10,000 treated per year. Fatal or intracranial bleeding occurred in 2.2% of high-risk patients and fatal or hospitalised bleeding occurred in 10.5% of high-risk patients.

Desmoteplase — mechanism and phase 2 stroke trial results: Desmoteplase has > 70% homology to t-PA and lacks a second kringle domain, and because it is more fibrin-specific than t-PA, desmoteplase may produce less bleeding; in DIAS, 104 patients presenting within 3 to 9 h were randomized to IV desmoteplase (25, 37.5, or 50 mg) or placebo, but due to an excessive intracranial hemorrhage rate in the first 47 patients (26.7% compared with none with placebo) fixed doses were replaced by weight-adjusted doses (62, 90, or 120 μg/kg), with an overall intracranial hemorrhage rate of 2.2% and reperfusion rates up to 71.4% versus 19.2% with placebo; in DEDAS, IV desmoteplase (90 or 125 μg/kg) versus placebo in 37 patients within 3 to 9 h showed no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages, reperfusion in 18.2% at 90 μg/kg and 53.3% at 125 μg/kg versus 37.5% with placebo, and good clinical outcome at 90 days in 28.6% and 60.0% with 90 or 125 μg/kg, respectively, versus 25% with placebo.

### Preclinical efficacy of a hemostatic agent in overcoming dual antiplatelet therapy [^3a9d5372]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety is an important aspect of any therapy directed at reversing or overcoming the effects of antiplatelet agents. Importantly, 2 phase I trials have been conducted with no adverse events detected in participants upon infusion of FPH or during follow-up monitoring. As aforementioned, our data suggest that should thrombosis be suspected in response to treatment, a thrombin inhibitor such as heparin could prevent excessive clot formation. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo evidence that FPH can augment the hemostatic properties of platelets from patients on DAPT, warranting further evaluation for use in the treatment of severe bleeding in this patient population.

Study Limitations

A clinical trial will ultimately be required to determine the safety and efficacy of FPH in managing acute, severe bleeding in patients with cardiovascular disease on DAPT.

### Is endogenous fibrinolysis a major Player in occurrence of atherothrombotic events following acute myocardial infarction? [^58a691e5]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Attempts to prevent atherothrombotic events have mainly focused on diminishing the formation of a thrombus through control of platelet and coagulation activity. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor is a standard strategy to control the activated platelet reactivity in ACS patients, and the prognostic implication of high platelet reactivity measured by platelet function test has been suggested to introduce a potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor. The limited clinical benefit of this strategy has been observed according to the disease acuity and phase. In addition, maintained hypercoagulability and impaired endogenous fibrinolysis appeared to be unaffected by the current DAPT strategy. In addition, the inflammatory activity has been identified to increase the residual ischemic risk in patients presented with ACS. Therefore, both the inflammation and coagulation pathways may contribute to increase the risk of atherothrombotic events through the crossover interaction between the 2 pathways.

### Effect of fibrinogen concentrate on intraoperative blood loss during cardiac surgery… [^d65f2037]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The current study sought to determine whether fibrinogen concentrate infusion reduced ongoing blood loss in patients undergoing cardiac surgery if it was administered with the intent of achieving a post–infusion plasma fibrinogen level of at least 2. 5 g/L. To evaluate safety and tolerability of fibrinogen concentrate, adverse events were assessed as a secondary analysis. These included 30-day in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, renal insufficiency or failure, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, allergic or other systemic reaction to study medication, and sternal or wound infections and reoperative thoracotomy. Thrombosis in the lower extremity was diagnosed with compression ultrasound testing 1 day before surgery and at day 3 days after surgery. 24, 25.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine / critically appraised topic. thrombolytic therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism? [^462ad157]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this review was to determine the effectiveness of adding thrombolytics to standard heparin therapy for treatment of submassive pulmonary embolism. Patients with submassive pulmonary embolism were considered to be those with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction but without hemodynamic instability.

Methods

We searched for trials comparing thrombolytics to heparin in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We included only studies assessing the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy for submassive pulmonary embolism and reported the patient-important outcomes of mortality, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and major hemorrhage.

Results

Two randomized trials met the inclusion criteria; one with a total of 256 patients presenting with submassive pulmonary embolism and the other trial including a subgroup of 46 patients with submassive pulmonary embolism. In the larger study, the relative risk (RR) for mortality, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and major hemorrhage was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36 to 6.83), 1.17 (95% CI 0.30 to 4.57), and 0.23 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.97), respectively. Our post hoc subgroup analysis of the smaller trial identified 2 deaths and 5 patients with recurrent pulmonary embolism among 23 controls, whereas none of the 23 patients randomized to thrombolytics died or had recurrent pulmonary embolism. None of these findings were statistically significant.

Conclusion

Results of randomized trials comparing the addition of thrombolytic therapy to standard heparin therapy for treatment of submassive pulmonary embolism fail to show any significant differences in clinically important outcomes.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone (CHARISMA): Only one large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT), CHARISMA, has evaluated long-term efficacy; it followed 15,603 patients with established vascular disease or multiple risk factors for a mean period of 28 months, and results failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect of dual antiplatelet therapy relative to aspirin on total mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), while dual therapy was associated with a possible reduction in nonfatal stroke and a possible increase in nonfatal extracranial bleeding. The quality of evidence was considered moderate because of imprecise effect estimates, and the findings were judged directly applicable to patients with symptomatic PAD while subgroup analyses suggesting different effects in symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients were not deemed credible.

### A multitrait genetic study of hemostatic factors and hemorrhagic transformation after stroke treatment [^19351e14]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

The initiation of treatment within the first hours after suffering from an acute ischemic stroke (IS) is crucial in producing better health outcomes. Currently, the only available treatments in the acute phase are reperfusion therapies, such as thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Regardless of the benefits of thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) treatment, this is only offered to a low percentage of patients (15.6%) due to a narrow therapeutic window and potential severe side effects. The most serious side effect is hemorrhagic transformation (HT), which involves disruption of the blood-brain barrier and extravasation of blood into the brain tissue, increasing the risk of mortality and worsening stroke outcomes. HT is influenced by a wide range of factors, including blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. According to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study, HT can be classified as hemorrhagic infarction or parenchymal hematoma (PH).

Thrombolytic treatment presents a 6- to 7-fold increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients who develop PH have been shown to present a worse outcome and an increased risk of 3-month mortality. Despite this, the most recent guidelines recommend administrating r-tPA to all eligible patients, even those undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, or elderly patients, and clinical trials have assessed the viability of extending the time window to thrombolysis therapy, which requires increased knowledge of the putative adverse effects of this treatment.

Although r-tPA has been used for more than 20 years, the biological processes associated with the risk of HT are largely unknown. To date, a few biomarkers have been studied to predict the risk of HT after r-tPA treatment, including blood levels of circulating proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinases, cellular fibronectin, or vascular adhesion protein-1. Additionally, some genetic variants (rs669, rs1801020, rs79770152, and rs76484331) have been associated with the response after r-tPA treatment. A few studies have investigated the relationship between levels of various hemostatic factors and HT after r-tPA treatment. Monitorization of the plasmin inhibitor complex, von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, or fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products after r-tPA administration suggested that a test combining levels of these markers could aid in predicting intracerebral hemorrhages. Intravenous thrombolysis using r-tPA results in increased perfusion of microvessels and decreased infarct size, likely due to depletion of plasma fibrinogen. Additionally, recent clinical and experimental evidence suggests that ADAMTS-13 and VWF may be promising targets for thrombolysis of intracranial thrombi.

### Strategies for the design of novel thrombolytic and antithrombolytic agents [^450c61b5]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent advances in our understanding of thrombosis and thrombolysis have led to the design of new thrombolytic agents and regimens that may offer improved efficacy. In general, these new approaches specifically target pivotal steps in thrombus formation or lysis. The goal is to reduce adverse side effects (such as bleeding complications) that result from development of a lytic state or that result from a failure to maintain patency (as characterized by rethrombosis). The points in the coagulation cascade that are susceptible to inhibition, as well as the proposed agents for intervention, are discussed in this review.

Direct Oral FXa Inhibition

Direct FXa inhibitors are a class of anticoagulant drugs that act directly on factor X in the coagulation cascade and inhibit the action of FXa, namely, the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin (Figure 1).

The dose‐finding, phase II, ATLAS ACS‐TIMI 46 (Anti‐Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 46) 23 study assessed the safety and efficacy of the direct oral FXa inhibitor rivaroxaban (5, 10, 15, or 20 mg once or twice daily) in addition to DAPT (with clopidogrel) or single antiplatelet therapy with low‐dose aspirin in 3941 patients with recent ACS. Bleeding complications increased in a dose‐dependent manner in all TT groups (P < 0.0001). The subsequent ATLAS ACS 2‐TIMI 51 (Anti‐Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 51) study — a phase III, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial — compared the addition of 2.5 or 5 mg BID rivaroxaban to DAPT with clopidogrel in 15 526 patients with ACS. 21 The 1‐year primary efficacy end point, a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke, was significantly reduced by the combined doses of rivaroxaban (8.9% versus 10.7%, P = 0.008) and each dose alone (2.5 mg: 9.1% versus 10.7%, P = 0.02; 5 mg: 8.8% versus 10.7%, P = 0.03) compared with placebo (Figure 2). 18 Rivaroxaban at the 2.5‐mg dose significantly reduced cardiovascular death compared with placebo (2.7% versus 4.1%, P = 0.002). In contrast, this was not seen with the addition of 5 mg rivaroxaban compared with placebo (4% versus 4.1%, P = 0.63). In the comparison of the 2 doses of rivaroxaban (2.5 versus 5 mg), the rates of cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality were significantly different for both comparisons (P = 0.009). Subgroup analysis showed that rivaroxaban reduced the primary efficacy end point in STEMI patients (8.4% versus 10.6%, P = 0.019) 24 and reduced stent thrombosis compared with placebo (1.9% versus 1.5%, P = 0.017), 25 and the reduction in the primary efficacy end point in patients with STEMI appeared to become apparent as early as 30 days after the index event. 24 Rivaroxaban combined doses, compared with placebo, significantly increased the rate of non–coronary artery bypass grafting–related TIMI major bleeding (2.1% versus 0.6%, P < 0.001) and intracranial bleeding (0.6% versus 0.2%, P = 0.009) but not fatal bleeding (0.3% versus 0.2%, P = 0.66), 21 and the rates of non–coronary artery bypass grafting–related TIMI major bleeding were similar with the 2.5‐ and 5‐mg BID doses (1.8% versus 2.4%, P = 0.12).

### Genetically proxied inhibition of coagulation factors and risk of cardiovascular disease: a mendelian randomization study [^ef377f96]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This MR study strengthens the evidence of causal associations of fibrinogen and factors II and XI with VTE. More importantly, we observed robust evidence that inhibition of fibrinogen and factor XI reduces the risk of ischemic stroke, particularly cardioembolic stroke. Additionally, we found suggestive evidence that inhibition of factors V, VII, and X might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. These findings imply possible benefits of anticoagulant therapies targeting those coagulation factors in the prevention of ischemic stroke. We did not detect any significant associations of coagulation factors with other CVD outcomes, in contrast to evidence from clinical trials on factor Xa 22 and thrombin inhibitors. 23 A possible increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke could not be excluded for other anticoagulants and requires further study. Inhibition of factor VII, for example, may cause increased risk of severe intracranial hemorrhage. 24

Overall, our findings were consistent with previous studies on the role of different coagulation factors in venous thrombosis. 25, 26, 27 Identified protective effects of coagulant factor inhibition on ischemic stroke were also in agreement with meta‐analysis of clinical trials, 28 and recent MR studies on factor XI. 29, 30, 31 Notably, the present investigation went further to assess the effects of 9 coagulation factors on thrombosis and other CVD outcomes. Possible adverse effects of different anticoagulants should be considered further. As the CIs for the association with hemorrhagic stroke would still be compatible with clinically relevant risk increase, more evidence is needed to accurately estimate any potential impact of different coagulation factors on bleeding risk. This could be achieved by MR studies with greater statistical power (eg, larger number of hemorrhagic stroke cases) or other study designs.

### Early fibrinogen concentrate therapy for major haemorrhage in trauma (E-FIT 1): results from a UK multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial [^9dc24cdb]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the feasibility of administering the study intervention within 45 minutes of admission, defined by the proportion of all participants randomised who started their infusion within that time. For this trial to be successful, at least 90% of the participants were required to achieve this target. An additional primary outcome was to determine the proportion of participants whose fibrinogen level remained at 2 g/L or above during active haemorrhage.

Secondary outcome measures were clinical and laboratory measures of efficacy and safety. Clinical outcomes included mortality at 3, 6 and 24 hours, and 28 days from admission; transfusion requirements, in numbers of units, at 3, 6 and 24 hours; duration of organ support; in-patient stay, including the intensive care unit/high-dependency unit; and quality of life. Safety was measured by symptomatic thrombotic events and arterial (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke) and venous (e.g. pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis) events during hospital stay. Laboratory measures included Clauss fibrinogen level at 2 hours after admission and at day 7 from admission. Standard MHP protocols in the UK recommend frequent blood samples every 30–60 minutes during trauma haemorrhage and were taken as standard measurements.

Sample and data collection

Blood samples were drawn immediately upon admission to the resuscitation room. Clauss fibrinogen measures were analysed in the hospital coagulation laboratories, according to standard operating procedures. Patient characteristics, mechanism and severity of injury, and admission physiology were collected and scored using the Abbreviated Injury Scale, Injury Severity Score and Glasgow Coma Scale. Tranexamic acid and other haemostatic drug administrations were recorded. Organ support was defined using the composite time to complete organ failure resolution score. Organ failure was defined using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Data on timing of transfusions, clear fluids and mortality were collected in the first 24 hours. Measures to mitigate venous thromboembolic risk were recorded weekly to day 28. Symptomatic thromboembolic disease was categorised according to standard clinical and/or radiological measures. Quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires were completed upon discharge or day 28, whichever was the sooner. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive systems index value was calculated, allowing the five health dimensions to be converted into a single numeric measure.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary Artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^b99cea60]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Comparative effectiveness of INTERCEPT fibrinogen… [^8bbb5389]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of early IFC administration in patients with functional hypofibrinogenemia associated with hemorrhagic shock. This study will elucidate whether advancements in rapid testing for functional hypofibrinogenemia and provision of a shelf-stable fibrinogen complex results in a shorter time to administration of fibrinogen replacement, thus overcoming the limitations encountered by prior trials. This study aims to:

- Demonstrate the feasibility and response to early administration of pre-thawed IFC compared to CRYO-AHF when ordered during resuscitation of severely injured patients with HS and functional hypofibrinogenemia.
- Assess effectiveness of early administration of pre-thawed IFC vs CRYO-AHF in severely injured patients with HS and functional hypofibrinogenemia on proximate process measures of resuscitation.
- Assess clinical outcomes in severely injured patients with HS and functional hypofibrinogenemia receiving early administration of pre-thawed IFC vs CRYO-AHF product. This study is a multicenter, multi-period, by hospital cluster randomized, alternating treatment block crossover study comparing pre-thawed Pathogen Reduced Cryoprecipitated Fibrinogen Complex to Cryoprecipitate-AHF in patients with hemorrhagic shock and functional hypofibrinogenemia. This study will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of early IFC administration in trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock with functional hypofibrinogenemia. Specifically, it aims to determine whether IFC enables faster delivery of fibrinogen replacement compared to Cryo-AHF and equivalent correction of hypofibrinogenemia. Currently, the use of IFC vs Cryo-AHF varies by center and blood bank availability, and both are considered standard-of-care treatment options.

This study evaluates their performance in routine clinical use. The primary outcomes are the proportion of patients who receive fibrinogen replacement within 60 minutes of arrival; and the correction of functional hypofibrinogenemia. Secondary outcomes include proximate measures of resuscitation including time to hemostasis, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion burden, 3-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour and 30-day mortality and adverse event incidences including: adult respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction, venous thromboemboli, acute kidney injury, sepsis and transfusion related acute lung injury.

A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21).

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^2c38fe34]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimes are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions. The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included having undergone major surgery within the past 3 weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52), weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37), and having at least one of the following characteristics (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra‐aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting more than 10 min, bilirubin level greater than 3 mg/dL, or dementia.

The systemic thrombolytic therapy for acute intermediate PE did not show a significant impact on all‐cause or in‐hospital mortality compared to AC alone. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that while thrombolytic therapy can be beneficial in high‐risk PE, its advantages in intermediate‐risk PE are less clear. However, our analysis revealed a significant increase in minor bleeding incidents with systemic thrombolytic therapy, which corroborates the known bleeding risks associated with thrombolytics. Interestingly, the significant reduction in recurrent PE and clinical deterioration with systemic thrombolytic therapy suggests that it may offer protective benefits against PE recurrence and subsequent complications. These findings support the notion that systemic thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in preventing the progression and recurrence of PE, particularly in patients at higher risk for clinical deterioration.

### A multitrait genetic study of hemostatic factors and hemorrhagic transformation after stroke treatment [^9c8b25fe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) treatment is the only pharmacologic intervention available in the ischemic stroke acute phase. This treatment is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhages, known as hemorrhagic transformations (HTs), which worsen the patient's prognosis. Objectives: To investigate the association between genetically determined natural hemostatic factors' levels and increased risk of HT after r-tPA treatment.

Methods:

Using data from genome-wide association studies on the risk of HT after r-tPA treatment and data on 7 hemostatic factors (factor [F]VII, FVIII, von Willebrand factor [VWF], FXI, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue plasminogen activator), we performed local and global genetic correlation estimation multitrait analyses and colocalization and 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses between hemostatic factors and HT.

Results:

Local correlations identified a genomic region on chromosome 16 with shared covariance: fibrinogen-HT, P = 2.45 × 10 −11. Multitrait analysis between fibrinogen-HT revealed 3 loci that simultaneously regulate circulating levels of fibrinogen and risk of HT: rs56026866 (PLXND1), P = 8.80 × 10 −10; rs1421067 (CHD9), P = 1.81 × 10 −14; and rs34780449, near ROBO1 gene, P = 1.64 × 10 −8. Multitrait analysis between VWF-HT showed a novel common association regulating VWF and risk of HT after r-tPA at rs10942300 (ZNF366), P = 1.81 × 10 −14. Mendelian randomization analysis did not find significant causal associations, although a nominal association was observed for FXI-HT (inverse-variance weighted estimate [SE], 0.07 [−0.29 to 0.00]; odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.00; raw P = 0.05).

Conclusion:

We identified 4 shared loci between hemostatic factors and HT after r-tPA treatment, suggesting common regulatory mechanisms between fibrinogen and VWF levels and HT. Further research to determine a possible mediating effect of fibrinogen on HT risk is needed.

### Ticagrelor or clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy following a pharmacoinvasive strategy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^6a31a7dd]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In a large prospective STEMI registry, we found switching patients to ticagrelor compared with sustaining clopidogrel therapy following fibrinolysis pharmacoinvasive reperfusion was associated with reduced recurrent ischemic events at 1‐year. Additionally, switching was not associated with differences in major bleeding or ICH. These findings provide support for switching to ticagrelor in pharmacoinvasive reperfusion patients and add to randomized clinical trial results.

### Study protocol. TRAAP-TRAnexamic acid for preventing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^e3f31188]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid for the reduction of bleeding in medical contexts other than PPH

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic agent that exerts its effect by blocking lysine binding sites on plasminogen molecules and has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the patient's own hemostatic mechanisms. Consequently, clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) is inhibited and bleeding is reduced. Results from previous trials have shown that TXA in planned surgery reduces the risk of blood transfusion, mean transfused volume, and need for re-operation due to bleeding, without increasing thrombotic events. The CRASH-2 trial (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage) demonstrated that the administration of TXA reduced mortality in bleeding trauma patients in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Significant reductions in mean menstrual blood loss have been reported in women with menorrhagia treated with TXA, compared with control or placebo-treated women. This result is particularly significant since the efficacy of TXA in menorrhagia suggests that it can reduce uterine blood loss, even of low volume, and in a nonsurgical context.

Tranexamic acid for PPH

During delivery, when the placenta separates from the uterine wall, sequential physiologic and hemostatic changes occur and reduce bleeding, including strong myometrial contractions, increased platelet activity, and a massive release of coagulant factors; at the same time, however, fibrinolytic activity increases. While oxytocin administration enhances the first mechanism, TXA administration might be able to counter the latter and thus facilitate the hemostatic process. Finally, the close relation observed between reduced fibrinogen levels and outcome in cases of PPH further suggests that TXA might be effective in PPH.

Treatment of PPH

The only randomized controlled trial (multicenter open-label trial) to assess TXA for the treatment of PPH showed that a high dose of TXA reduces blood loss in women with PPH. Due to its limitations (small sample size, open design, issues regarding the harm-benefit ratio), and conflicting results from a before-and-after study using the same protocol, the use of TXA to treat PPH remains the object of debate. A pragmatic, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in women with a clinical diagnosis of PPH, the WOMAN trial, has been launched to rectify this clinical uncertainty. It is currently recruiting eligible women in hospitals in Africa and Europe, aiming to reach the target sample size of 15 000 women.

### Elevated baseline serum fibrinogen: effect on 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention [^4346a04d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of other clinically relevant factors including ACS presentation, greater total stent length, use of BMS, and use of small‐caliber stents were independently associated with 2‐year MACE and suggested roles for baseline disease burden and procedural details on subsequent events regardless of fibrinogen level. In particular, the use of BMS may represent the use of smallest‐diameter stents (2.0 mm) or presence of comorbidities warranting shorter dual antiplatelet therapy duration. Total stent length difference between groups was also clinically relevant, representing greater underlying disease burden requiring multiple stents and more complex PCI procedures in those with subsequent MACE. The presence of multiple factors together with elevated fibrinogen level was associated with the greatest 2‐year risk of MACE. An analysis of the GRAVITAS (Gauging Responsiveness With a VerifyNow P2Y12 Assay: Impact on Thrombosis and Safety) Trial also identified multiple significant covariates, notably ACS presentation and TSL, in predicting 6‐month combined death, MI, and stent thrombosis after PCI for stable coronary artery disease or ACS. 18 A post hoc analysis of the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study also identified multiple factors predicting late ischemic events, including MI at time of PCI and use of smaller‐diameter stents, similar to the current study. However, the ability of these factors to predict late ischemic events 12 to 30 months after PCI remained limited with a c‐statistic of 0.64 within a validation cohort. 19 Elevated serum fibrinogen was not measured in these previous studies and has been identified by the current study to be a unique independent predictor of MACE up to 2 years after PCI. Furthermore, the current study highlights how elevated fibrinogen level augments the association of ACS presentation, longer total stent length, and small‐diameter stent with 2‐year MACE. Integrating serum fibrinogen level may help improve the performance of this late ischemia prediction model as well. If validated, serum fibrinogen could play a role in determining which patients could benefit from prolonged dual‐antiplatelet therapy extended beyond 12 months after index PCI or potentially direct thrombin inhibitors.

Antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention — long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT): For long-term secondary stroke prevention, DAPT was not superior to SAPT for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke but was associated with a significantly increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major bleeding; the 2 long-duration trials enrolled either exclusively patients with lacunar stroke or patients with prior stroke or TIA who had at least 1 additional vascular risk factor, and results may not generalize to a broader stroke population.

### Impact of very low dose rivaroxaban in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy on endogenous fibrinolysis in acute coronary syndrome: the vaLiDate-R study [^c49ac9b8]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Impaired endogenous fibrinolysis is adverse cardiovascular risk factor in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Addition of very low dose rivaroxaban (VLDR) to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) reduces cardiovascular events but increases bleeding.

Objective

We aimed to assess whether addition of VLDR to DAPT can enhance endogenous fibrinolysis.

Methods

In a prospective, open-label trial, we assessed endogenous fibrinolysis in whole blood, in 549 patients with ACS using the Global Thrombosis Test (GTT) and Thromboelastography (TEG). Patients (n = 180) who demonstrated impaired endogenous fibrinolysis (lysis time [LT] > 2000s with the GTT) were randomised 1:1:1 to (i) clopidogrel 75 mg daily; (ii) clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily; or (iii) ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, for 30 days, in addition to aspirin. Fibrinolytic status was assessed at 0, 2, 4 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in LT from admission to week 4. We also measured thrombotic occlusion time (OT) at high shear, and rivaroxaban level.

Results

There was no difference between the groups with respect to LT or clot lysis with TEG, and no change in these parameters compared to baseline during study drug allocation. In the rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel group, OT was prolonged compared to the other groups, although rivaroxaban levels were low, suggesting non-compliance.

Conclusion

Addition of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily to DAPT does not affect endogenous fibrinolysis of thrombus formed at either high or low shear. Further studies are needed to determine whether higher doses of rivaroxaban can favourably modulate fibrinolysis.

Condensed Abstract

Impaired endogenous fibrinolysis is a strong risk factor in ACS. We aimed to assess whether adding very low dose rivaroxaban (VLDR) to DAPT can enhance fibrinolysis. Fibrin and clot lysis were assessed in whole blood. ACS patients with impaired fibrinolysis were randomised 1:1:1 to clopidogrel 75 mg daily; clopidogrel 75 mg plus VLDR; or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, in addition to aspirin. At 30-days, there was no difference in lysis time between the groups, nor change from baseline. VLDR does not improve fibrinolysis at high or low shear. Further studies are needed to determine whether alternative antithrombotic regimens can enhance endogenous fibrinolysis.

### Paired risk scores to predict ischaemic and bleeding risk twenty-eight days to one year after an acute coronary syndrome [^1cd20df9]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Most patients are recommended to receive dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) for at least a month, and up to a year, after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Guidelines recommend that estimated bleeding and recurrent ischaemic risk be used to guide the decision regarding DAPT duration. However, there are currently no risk scores which estimate these risks over this period.

### Role of fibrinogen levels and factor XIII V34L polymorphism in thrombolytic therapy in stroke patients [^852b9ab1]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The identification of genetic and environmental factors that could improve the benefit/risk ratio of thrombolytic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke is crucial.

Methods

We studied the role in the efficacy and side-adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy in stroke of 2 factors involved in the structure and stability of fibrin clot: fibrinogen levels and factor XIII (FXIII) V34L, a common and functional polymorphism. Our study enrolled 200 consecutive patients with stroke who received intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.

Results

Patients with FXIII V/V genotype and low fibrinogen (< 3.6 g/L) displayed the best clinical outcome. In contrast, carriers of the L34 variant and high fibrinogen levels showed almost no clinical response. Moreover, patients with high fibrinogen levels at admission displayed higher mortality than patients with lower fibrinogen levels (22.6% versus 9.7%, P = 0.027; OR = 2.72). The FXIII V34L polymorphism also associated with mortality: 20.0% of L34 carriers but 9.1% of patients with V/V genotype died after thrombolytic therapy (P = 0.034; OR = 2.50). The deleterious effect of this variant seemed to be exacerbated by high levels of fibrinogen, supporting the role of fibrinogen levels in determining the hemostatic consequences of the FXIII polymorphism.

Conclusions

Our study identifies 2 markers involved in fibrin formation associated with the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy and early mortality rates in patients with ischemic stroke. These markers could be useful to identify patients with stroke suitable for a safe thrombolytic therapy.

### Analysis of risk of bleeding complications after different doses of aspirin in 192, 036 patients enrolled in 31 randomized controlled trials [^c2108498]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to compare the risk of hemorrhage due to the low (< 100 mg), moderate (100 to 200 mg), and high (> 200 mg) doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) in 192,036 patients enrolled in 31 clinical trials. Despite substantial differences in the reporting patterns of bleeding complications, low-dose ASA was associated with the lowest risk, and moderate doses caused a relatively high hemorrhagic event rate, especially with regard to minor, gastrointestinal, and total bleeding, and stroke. These findings should be considered when using combination antiplatelets, anticoagulant therapy, or both, with ASA, especially with the daily dose of > 100 mg.

Thrombolytic therapy — neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral block management: Guidelines detailing original contraindications for thrombolytic drugs "suggest avoidance of these drugs for 10 days following puncture of non-compressible vessels (grade IA)". In patients who have received fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy, "we recommend against needle placement for at least 48 hours. Documentation of normalization of clotting studies (including fibrinogen) is suggested (grade IA)". For those who had neuraxial blocks at or near the time of fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy, "we recommend that frequent neurological monitoring (eg, every 2 hours) should be continued for at least 48 hours after the dose", and if combined with ongoing epidural infusion, "we recommend the infusion should be limited to drugs minimizing sensory and motor block to facilitate assessment of neurological function (grade IC)". When neuraxial catheters were in place during unexpected fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy, "There is no definitive recommendation for removal… We suggest the measurement of fibrinogen level… to evaluate the presence of residual thrombolytic effect and appropriate timing of catheter removal". After catheter removal, "Patients should have frequent neurological monitoring for at least 48 hours… (grade IIC)". As pharmacologic context, "Fibrinogen and plasminogen are maximally depressed at 5 hours after thrombolytic therapy and remain significantly depressed at 27 hours".

### Thromboelastography predicts dual antiplatelet therapy-related hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^e0bd61ab]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for patients presenting with a minor stroke or a high risk of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and for those with ischemic stroke attributable to severe vascular stenosis. However, DAPT is accompanied by an increased risk for hemorrhage. A multicenter study showed that DAPT-related hemorrhage in patients with cerebral infarction within 1 year was 5.02%. Standard DAPT therapy is associated with the highest rates of bleeding in the early ischemic stage. The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) within 1 month was found to be 12% while that of major hemorrhagic events was 5.8%, which was significantly higher than that at 31–90 days. Hemorrhagic events after cerebral infarction affect antiplatelet therapy compliance and also increase the incidence of poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to predict and identify populations at high risk of hemorrhage and to provide timely interventions.

Thromboelastography (TEG) can be used to reflect the coagulation function of a whole-blood sample dynamically. By measuring the viscoelastic changes that occur during the hemostatic process, TEG gives a real-time functional evaluation of the coagulation cascades, beginning with initial platelet–fibrin interaction, through platelet aggregation, clot strengthening, fibrin cross-linkage, and eventually, clot lysis. In recent years, TEG has been shown to be a useful tool for detecting abnormal hemorrhage and vascular occlusion. Compared with the properties of traditional coagulation function tests, TEG can directly respond to changes in platelet functionand can detect the efficacies of antiplatelet drugs, thereby guiding individualized antiplatelet therapy for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. Studies have found that TEG can detect coagulopathy after acute cerebral infarction, which can be used to predict the risk of recurrent ischemic events. However, the value of TEG in predicting hemorrhagic events during the treatment of ischemic stroke remains unclear.

The aims of our study were to investigate the value of TEG in predicting the risk of hemorrhage in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving DAPT and to establish an effective hemorrhage prediction model, which might provide new monitoring tools for decision-making and risk assessments during clinical antiplatelet treatments.

Placenta accreta spectrum — fibrinogen and clotting factor therapy notes that the historical fibrinogen goal of 100 mg/dL or greater may be too low in pregnancy, and levels less than 200 mg/dL are associated with severe postpartum hemorrhage. Although cryoprecipitate can be used to increase fibrinogen, fibrinogen concentrates may be preferred to reduce the risk of transmitting viral pathogens, and efficacy of fibrinogen transfusion in obstetric hemorrhage or placenta accreta spectrum is unknown. Recombinant activated factor VIIa has been used for severe and refractory postpartum hemorrhage, with downsides including a risk of thrombosis.

Thrombolytic therapy — agent characteristics: All clinically available thrombolytic agents are plasminogen activators that do not directly degrade fibrinogen and act by converting plasminogen to plasmin. Streptokinase (SK) and urokinase (UK) are described as non-fibrin-specific plasminogen activators, whereas tissue plasminogen activators (tPAs) are fibrin-specific and preferentially activate fibrin-bound plasminogen. Although higher fibrin specificity was hoped to reduce systemic bleeding complications, large trials have shown no significant difference in bleeding rates. SK is produced by β-hemolytic streptococci and has a biphasic half-life with the initial component due to complexing with SK antibodies.

Table 1
Randomized Controlled Trials Examining Extended Duration of Dual‐Antiplatelet Therapy

As noted above, 2 of these 4 trials showed an improved primary efficacy end point of > 24 months DAPT compared with standard 12‐month DAPT, whereas the other 2 showed no difference. The 2 studies showing a decrease in the primary end point were both larger trials, and both were driven primarily by a decrease in MI. 2, 5 These 2 trials that showed a decrease in the primary efficacy end point also showed an increase in the bleeding risk. Given these differing findings, it is important to highlight some of the key differences between the trials. First, the PEGASUS trial, the largest of the randomized controlled trials, was the only extended DAPT trial to use ticagrelor. 2 The 2 smaller trials, DES‐LATE and OPTIDUAL trials, used solely clopidogrel as the P2Y 12 inhibitor, whereas the DAPT trial used either clopidogrel or prasugrel. 3, 4, 5 In patients with ACS, both ticagrelor and prasugrel provide better cardiovascular outcomes compared with clopidogrel 6, 7; hence, it is possible that the differing results may be, in part, because of the particular P2Y 12 inhibitor used.

### A multitrait genetic study of hemostatic factors and hemorrhagic transformation after stroke treatment [^d7c2196d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) treatment is the only pharmacologic intervention available in the ischemic stroke acute phase. This treatment is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhages, known as hemorrhagic transformations (HTs), which worsen the patient's prognosis.

Objectives

To investigate the association between genetically determined natural hemostatic factors' levels and increased risk of HT after r-tPA treatment.

Methods

Using data from genome-wide association studies on the risk of HT after r-tPA treatment and data on 7 hemostatic factors (factor [F]VII, FVIII, von Willebrand factor [VWF], FXI, fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue plasminogen activator), we performed local and global genetic correlation estimation multitrait analyses and colocalization and 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses between hemostatic factors and HT.

Results

Local correlations identified a genomic region on chromosome 16 with shared covariance: fibrinogen-HT, P = 2.45 × 10–11. Multitrait analysis between fibrinogen-HT revealed 3 loci that simultaneously regulate circulating levels of fibrinogen and risk of HT: rs56026866 (PLXND1), P = 8.80 × 10–10; rs1421067 (CHD9), P = 1.81 × 10–14; and rs34780449, near ROBO1 gene, P = 1.64 × 10–8. Multitrait analysis between VWF-HT showed a novel common association regulating VWF and risk of HT after r-tPA at rs10942300 (ZNF366), P = 1.81 × 10–14. Mendelian randomization analysis did not find significant causal associations, although a nominal association was observed for FXI-HT (inverse-variance weighted estimate [SE], 0.07 [-0.29 to 0.00]; odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.00; raw P = 0.05).

Conclusion

We identified 4 shared loci between hemostatic factors and HT after r-tPA treatment, suggesting common regulatory mechanisms between fibrinogen and VWF levels and HT. Further research to determine a possible mediating effect of fibrinogen on HT risk is needed.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^95701488]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — post-ICH antithrombotic management: In patients with a history of a symptomatic primary ICH, we suggest against the long-term use of antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of ischemic stroke (Grade 2C). Only in patients with deep hemorrhages who are at very high risk of cardiac embolism without antithrombotic therapy (> 7% per year) should anticoagulation be considered, generally those with mechanical heart valves or AF and high CHADS2 scores (≥ 4 points). In deep ICH with intermediate risk (5%-7% per year), antiplatelet therapy with aspirin may be preferred over no antithrombotic therapy or anticoagulation, whereas for patients whose only indication is antiplatelet therapy and the thromboembolic risk is generally low (< 5% per year), the benefit is unlikely to outweigh potential harm. A referenced decision analysis favored no antithrombotic therapy, reporting a lifetime gain of 0.3 QALY for deep hemorrhages and 1.9 QALY for lobar hemorrhages.

### Antithrombotic agents [^91f5f842]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in our understanding of the contribution of thrombin generation to arterial thrombosis and the role of platelets in venous thrombosis have prompted new treatment paradigms. Nonetheless, bleeding remains the major side effect of such treatments spurring the quest for new antithrombotic regimens with better benefit-risk profiles and for safer anticoagulants for existing and new indications. The aims of this article are to review the results of recent trials aimed at enhancing the benefit-risk profile of antithrombotic therapy and explain how these findings are changing our approach to the management of arterial and venous thrombosis. Focusing on these 2 aspects of thrombosis management, this article discusses 4 advances: (1) the observation that in some indications, lowering the dose of some direct oral anticoagulants reduces the risk of bleeding without compromising efficacy, (2) the recognition that aspirin is not only effective for secondary prevention of atherothrombosis but also for prevention of venous thromboembolism, (3) the finding that dual pathway inhibition with the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban to attenuate thrombin generation plus aspirin to reduce thromboxane A2-mediated platelet activation is superior to aspirin or rivaroxaban alone for prevention of atherothrombosis in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease, and (4) the development of inhibitors of factor XI or XII as potentially safer anticoagulants.

### A practical guide on how to handle patients with bleeding events while on oral antithrombotic treatment [^30d610c0]. Netherlands Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bleeding in patients on antithrombotics:

- **Definition**: Bleeding in patients on antithrombotics is a common complication in patients treated with both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.
- **Pathophysiology**: Bleeding in patients on antithrombotics is caused by a complex biological interaction between blood and tissue factors and extensive anticoagulation effect.
- **Disease course**: The complex biological interaction of blood and tissue factors, in addition to the extensive anticoagulation effect, activates bleeding cascade causing bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, which may be categorized as minor or major bleeding that may increase morbidity and mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Major bleeding is associated with a mortality rate of 11%.

### Effectiveness of prothrombin complex concentrate for the treatment of bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d9d6c30e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding safety, the use of PCC did not result in an increase in TE events when compared with patients not receiving PCC. Of note, the CIs of the ORs were very wide, suggesting differential results across studies. However, the large number of patients included in this analysis is a strength. Taken together, PCCs do not seem to come at a cost of increased venous thromboembolic events.

This review has certain limitations because a small number of eligible studies were available with substantial heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is caused by a number of reasons. First, most studies had a retrospective study design, in which PCC was administered based on clinical judgment. This may introduce confounding and bias because PCC may potentially be administered to more severely ill and hemodynamically unstable patients, resulting in underrepresentation of the actual effect. Second, because there is no optimal dose for PCC, there is considerable variety in the type and dose of PCC, as well as the trigger for administration. This could lead to both an under‐ or overrepresentation of the actual effects as certain PCCs might have better effectiveness and safety profiles compared with others. Third, not all included studies had strict inclusion or exclusion criteria of their study population, leading to a heterogeneous study population. Furthermore, we only included articles published in English, which might lead to language bias.

Of interest, our search also yielded multiple studies, including a randomized controlled trial, 40 that used a point‐of‐care coagulation testing‐based protocol in which both PCC and fibrinogen concentrate as were administered as an adjunct to FFP in comparison to a FFP‐based protocol. 15, 40, 41, 42, 43 Unfortunately, these studies were not included because outcome data from patients receiving PCC could not be separated from those not receiving PCC. Innerhofer et al found that patients receiving PCC and fibrinogen had a decreased need for massive transfusion and rescue therapy when compared with the FFP group. 40 Schöchl et al and Nienaber et al also showed reduced exposure of trauma patients to blood products in the PCC/fibrinogen group when compared with the FFP group. 41, 43 Görlinger et al also showed reduced blood product utilization after implementing the PCC/fibrinogen based protocol in cardiac surgery patients. 44, 45 Inclusion of these studies probably would have strengthened the suggestion that a PCC and/or fibrinogen‐based approach may be a reasonable strategy to treat bleeding patients.

### Pediatric traumatic brain injury and microvascular blood-brain… [^39c4c335]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Data Sharing Statement A, Moderate to extensive perivascular fibrinogen immunoreactivity was observed in a similar proportion of both adult and pediatric material after acute TBI. B, Typically, this was diffuse and multifocal, involving 2 or more anatomical regions in most of the adult and pediatric material. For the assessments of vessel diameter, adjacent sections from the cingulate gyrus where abnormal, moderate, or extensive perivascular fibrinogen immunoreactivity was observed in any layer of the cingulate gyrus were used. These sections were subject to blinded, unbiased assessment of the diameter of all vessels and of vessels showing BBB disruption. Abnormal moderate or extensive perivascular fibrinogen immunoreactivity was present in a similar proportion of pediatric and adult cases.

Typically, this abnormal fibrinogen immunoreactivity was observed as multifocal, diffuse immunoreactive profiles across 2 or more regions in pediatric and adult cases. Consistent with this observation, although in material stained for CD34 a similar proportion of cortical vessels in adult and pediatric material was 10 μm or less in diameter, evidence of abnormal fibrinogen immunoreactivity appeared disproportionately distributed to these smallest-diameter vessels in pediatric TBI sections. Despite DBS being considerably more common among pediatric cases, the prevalence of BBB disruption was similar in both pediatric and adult case material. In keeping with previous work, in adult case material, histologic evidence of BBB disruption was present as fibrinogen immunoreactivity around small to medium vessels and extending into the surrounding brain parenchyma.

15 Typically, these vessels were 10 μm in diameter or greater in adults, consistent with vessels of arteriole or venule size and larger. However, in pediatric case material, the vessels involved were overwhelmingly capillary level. This striking and distinctive microvascular BBB disruption associated with pediatric TBI might, at least in part, contribute to the more catastrophic association between BBB and DBS in this population.

### Thrombolysis of occluded peripheral arteries and veins with tenecteplase: a pilot study [^88291fd1]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To prospectively assess the feasibility, risk profile, and effect on fibrinogen levels of tenecteplase in transcatheter thrombolysis for peripheral arterial and venous occlusive disease.

Materials and Methods

Between March 2001 and January 2002, 18 consecutive patients (14 men, four women) with arterial (n = 13) or venous (n = 5) occlusive disease were treated with tenecteplase infusions of 0.25 mg/h. Technical success was defined as restoration of antegrade flow and removal of more than 95% of thrombus. Clinical success was defined in arterial cases as immediate limb salvage and relief of ischemic rest pain and in venous cases as resolution or improvement in extremity pain and swelling. Major bleeding was defined as an intracranial bleeding episode, bleeding that resulted in death, or bleeding that required transfusion, surgery, or cessation of thrombolytic therapy.

Results

Technical success was achieved in all 18 patients (100%). Clinical success was achieved in 11 of 13 arterial cases (85%) and in four of five (80%) venous cases. The mean duration of thrombolysis treatment was 21.5 hours ± 6.2 (range, 7–35 h), with total tenecteplase doses of 7.1 mg ± 4.3 (range, 1.75–18.75 mg). Major bleeding occurred in one patient (5.5%) because of slow oozing from bilateral femoral groin access sites, which caused a 25% decrease in hematocrit level. There were no deaths, intracranial hemorrhages, remote sites of bleeding, or minor bleeding complications. The serum fibrinogen level dropped to a mean of 77.4% ± 19.2% of baseline.

Conclusion

In this initial study, tenecteplase was shown to be a feasible treatment for peripheral arterial and venous thrombolysis with only moderate effect on fibrinogen levels.

CDT. Usual adult initial dosing of t-PA for DVT is in the range of 0.5 mg/h to 1 mg/h. For children, weight-based dosing of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per hour has been reported with a maximum of 2 mg/h. In case series of pediatric patients with PE treated with CDT, weight-based dosing of 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg per hour up to a maximum dose of 2 mg/h was used.

CONCOMITANT ANTICOAGULATION WITH THROMBOLYSIS. There is no consensus for the concomitant use of heparin with thrombolysis. With standard-dose infusions of t-PA, the bleeding risk may be increased with the use of anticoagulation and there is limited experience for its safety. However, in published regimens with low-dose systemic thrombolysis or CDT, UFH is commonly used. Both low-dose UFH (5–10 U/kg per hour) and therapeutic UFH have been reported. Less commonly, LMWH has also been used with thrombolysis but is not usually recommended because of safety concerns, given that LMWH has a longer half-life and is less readily reversible compared with UFH.

Monitoring

There is no therapeutic range for thrombolytic agents; however, fibrinogen levels, aPTT, and prothrombin time are commonly monitored during thrombolytic infusions. t-PA binds to clot-bound fibrin; however, systemic depletion of fibrinogen may be observed. Fibrinogen values of < 150 mg/dL have been associated with increased bleeding.

AEs

Between 10% and 40% of patients treated with t-PA will experience major AEs. The most common AE is bleeding, and bleeding is more likely in patients who weighed less, had a longer duration of therapy, a greater decrease in fibrinogen levels, and who failed to have resolution of their clot. Hypersensitivity reactions are among the less common AEs described with t-PA use. Allergic reactions have been reported and resolve with conventional treatment methods.

Periprocedural management

Although it has a very short half-life (5 minutes), fibrinolytic effects of t-PA may continue for up to 1 hour after discontinuation. Thus, the infusion should be discontinued accordingly in preparation for any procedure(s).

Warfarin

The addition of standard‐dose warfarin to DAPT with clopidogrel after ACS has been assessed only in small registries that showed unacceptable increases in bleeding. Warfarin is the most commonly used vitamin K antagonist, which inhibits the production of vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and, to a lesser extent, proteins C and S. This leads to a dose‐ and time‐dependent anticoagulation effect that requires close monitoring. 12 A registry of 40 812 ACS patients treated with multiple different regimens revealed a 3‐fold increase in bleeding with TT comprising warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin compared with DAPT. 13

The WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) open‐label randomized controlled trial compared dual antithrombotic therapy (warfarin and clopidogrel) with TT (warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) in patients undergoing PCI with an indication for anticoagulation, mainly atrial fibrillation. 14 A third of patients had ACS. TT significantly increased bleeding compared with dual therapy (44.4% versus 19.4%; 95% CI, 0.26–0.50; P < 0.0001) and increased the risk of the composite of all‐cause death, MI, stroke, TVR, and stent thrombosis, driven by an increase in all‐cause mortality (6.3% versus 2.5%, P = 0.027). Consequently, the ESC guidelines on myocardial revascularization and the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend reserving TT with warfarin and DAPT to a short period after PCI in those with an indication for anticoagulation. 9, 15

### Timing of major postoperative bleeding among patients undergoing surgery [^c4a26ac2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the timing of major bleeding events occurring after surgery?

Findings

In this cohort study of 39 813 patients, of all major bleeding events that occurred within the first 30 days after surgery, 42.7% occurred within 24 hours of surgery, 77.7% by postoperative day 7, 88.3% by postoperative day 14, and 94.6% by postoperative day 21.

Meaning

These findings suggest that of all major bleeding events within 30 days after surgery, most occur within 1 week after surgery; these findings could aid clinicians in preventing bleeding-related surgical complications and in decision-making regarding the start of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after surgery.

### Treatment effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 12 Hours of acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^ded68cbe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussions

From this subgroup analysis of the CHANCE trial, we have found that among those patients who started antiplatelet therapy within 12 hours of their initial acute minor stroke or TIA, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke during the 3‐month follow‐up period, with a 2.7% absolute risk reduction rate (the number needed to treat is 34). The dual‐antiplatelet therapy was more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke but not progressive ischemic stroke. From the safety point of view, dual‐antiplatelet therapy initiated within 12 hours of symptom onset was not associated with an increased incidence of hemorrhage.

CHANCE was a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial, and randomization was stratified according to the interval between symptom onset and enrollment (< 12 hours versus 12–24 hours) and participating center. The prevalence or level of potential prognostic factors between the treatment groups was balanced and reliable for this subgroup analysis so that systematic bias in allocation and attrition were avoided. Consequentially, our study identified a statistically significant positive effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 12 hours of symptom onset compared with aspirin alone.

Similar to the previous findings, > 50% of such risk occurs in the first 2 days after the initial acute minor stroke or TIA. 1, 5, 12 These data suggested that the highest risk period for ischemic stroke event is during the early hours and days following the initial ischemic event. In the multivariable analysis, the randomization within 12 hours after the symptom onset is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke event, besides age, history of hypertension, and diabetes, as mentioned in previous studies. 2, 16 This high risk of developing new ischemic stroke events might be attributed to a patient's unstable atherosclerotic plaque and accelerated platelet aggregation in the early phase of the disease. 17, 18, 19 We observed that the curves for cumulative rate of stroke event were particularly steep within the first few days, during which the different treatment groups' curve diverged significantly. After that, the rates of ischemic stroke were similar. This suggests that the main benefit of the early combination therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin was to prevent the early stroke occurrence. Even without a demonstrated relative benefit for early treatment, this finding implies that patients with acute minor stroke or TIA should be given dual‐antiplatelet treatment as early as possible.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 7: placenta accreta spectrum [^cd3181e3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Placenta accreta spectrum — targets for fibrinogen replacement and use of recombinant activated factor VIIa are qualified. In the past, the goal of fibrinogen therapy was to achieve levels of 100 mg/dL or greater, but this may be too low in pregnancy, and levels less than 200 mg/dL are associated with severe postpartum hemorrhage. Although cryoprecipitate can be used to increase fibrinogen, fibrinogen concentrations may be preferred to reduce the risk of transmitting viral pathogens, yet efficacy of fibrinogen transfusion in obstetric hemorrhage or placenta accreta spectrum is unknown. Recombinant activated factor VIIa has been used in severe and refractory postpartum hemorrhage, but downsides are a risk of thrombosis and considerable cost; two large case series that included some placenta accreta spectrum patients noted positive responses in 76 — 86% of cases, with six thromboses in fewer than 200 patients, so use in placenta accreta spectrum should be limited to posthysterectomy bleeding with failed standard therapy.

### More, more, more: reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^1c449c7b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The duration of the preferred antithrombotic regimen is another important aspect of choosing the right regimen for the right patient, for whom prolonged treatment with DAPT reduces ischemic end points at the cost of increased bleeding, as exhibited in the PEGASUS TIMI‐54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) 51 study. The 2017 ESC guideline states that prolonged duration of DAPT may be considered for patients at high thrombotic risk, such as those undergoing complex PCI or those implanted with a bioresorbable vascular scaffold, 38 and particularly for those who have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding complication. 38

The ongoing open‐label trial GLOBAL LEADERS (Comparative Effectiveness of 1 Month of Ticagrelor Plus Aspirin Followed by Ticagrelor Monotherapy Versus a Current‐Day Intensive Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in All‐Comers Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Bivalirudin and BioMatrix Family Drug‐Eluting Stent Use) aims to assess the role of ticagrelor as a single antiplatelet agent for 2 years after a 1‐month course of DAPT (comprising ticagrelor and aspirin) for the long‐term prevention of cardiac adverse events. The study (n > 16 000) recruited all‐comers undergoing PCI, both for elective and ACS indications, who all received bivalirudin and a biomatrix stent. 52

Patients were then randomized to ticagrelor 90 mg BID for 24 months plus aspirin for 1 month versus DAPT with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel for 12 months plus aspirin for 24 months. The primary outcome is a composite of all‐cause mortality or nonfatal MI, and the safety end point is major bleeding.

Finally, edoxaban, another FXa inhibitor, is being evaluated in a phase II trial, together with aspirin and clopidogrel, in ACS. 53

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^247016d8]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

### More, more, more: reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^910a63cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

TT combinations comprising the addition of an oral anticoagulant — in particular, low‐dose rivaroxaban or PAR‐1 antagonist to DAPT, predominantly aspirin and clopidogrel — generally increase bleeding with, at best, a modest effect reducing ischemic end points in ACS patients (Figure 2).

However, there was a lack of uniformity in the definition of bleeding among the reported trials, making indirect comparisons of relative bleeding with different agents challenging. The definition of bleeding events has variably included laboratory parameters, such as decrease in hemoglobin, and clinical events, including the need for transfusion, surgery, cardiac tamponade, and hematoma. Standardization of bleeding reports using the BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) system would have been highly desirable but was not available at the time of some of these studies. 33 Although it remains clear, regardless of the definitions used, that TT significantly increases the risk of bleeding compared with DAPT, the lack of uniformity in bleeding definition coupled with the lack of direct head‐to‐head comparisons of TT combinations makes it impossible to compare bleeding risk with different strategies.

There has also been heterogeneity in the definition of primary efficacy outcomes. Although some studies included only "hard" clinical end points of major adverse cardiovascular events, others included more "soft" end points such as revascularization or hospitalization. Some included ischemic strokes only, and others included all strokes.

Overall, the risk–benefit ratio suggests that it may be reasonable to justify the use of rivaroxaban in TT combination for high‐risk ACS patients who are at low bleeding risk, and vorapaxar could be considered for patients with prior MI but not in the acute or subacute phase of ACS, with some restrictions. 20 Rivaroxaban and vorapaxar should not be considered as add‐on therapy in combination with P2Y 12 inhibitors other than clopidogrel because data are lacking and bleeding would be expected to increase disproportionately. However, adding warfarin to DAPT appears not to be justified, as the WOEST study not only demonstrated a higher risk of bleeding with TT but also ischemic end points occurred less frequently with oral anticoagulation combined with a single antiplatelet agent. 14

### Towards patient-specific management of trauma hemorrhage: the effect of resuscitation therapy on parameters of thromboelastometry [^8a75febb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 309 patients for whom ROTEM profiles were available were transfused with ≥ 4 RBC units (their characteristics are shown in Table 1). Most patients had sustained a blunt trauma, were in shock, and were coagulopathic, as reflected by a prolonged mean INR and decreased levels of fibrinogen. The mean baseline ROTEM variables were mostly within the reference values as provided by the manufacturer (Table 2). All measurements together yielded 426 time intervals in which the effect of transfusion strategy on the ROTEM profiles could be determined, although the amount of intervals available for analysis varied per treatment and per test.

ROTEM response to treatment with fibrinogen

Of the 309 patients, 119 (39%) received fibrinogen products, containing a mean of 3.8 g (SD 1.2 g) of fibrinogen. Patients given fibrinogen products were more severely injured, as reflected by a higher ISS, and more acidotic than those not receiving fibrinogen (Table S1). Also, baseline fibrinogen levels were lower in patients receiving fibrinogen. Despite this, in the whole group of patients receiving fibrinogen, administration of fibrinogen products resulted in a greater increase in FIBTEM parameters than in patients not receiving fibrinogen (Table 3). In patients with a ROTEM profile known to correspond with a low fibrinogen level (FIBTEM CA5 < 10 mm) 26, the response to therapy was the same as in the whole cohort receiving fibrinogen.

ROTEM response to treatment with platelets

Of the 309 patients, 212 (69%) received PLTs. Patients given PLTs had lower baseline platelet counts than those not receiving PLTs, although the PLT count was normal in most patients (Table S2). In all patients, EXTEM parameters of clot formation worsened during the course of bleeding and treatment (Table 4). In the whole group of patients receiving PLTs, EXTEM values were higher during management than in those not receiving PLTs, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. In patients with a ROTEM profile known to correspond to low PLT levels 26, the decrease in EXTEM ca5 was significantly less than in those not receiving therapy.

### Effect of dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy on recurrent stroke modulated by activated partial thromboplastin time [^ea795671]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The efficacy of dual antiplatelet treatment may be modified by many factors. The aim was to assess whether the effect of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone on recurrent stroke would be affected by admission activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Methods

Data were derived from the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. A total of 5074 patients were categorized into three groups based on the aPTT distribution according to the 15th and 85th percentile. The primary outcome was any stroke within 90 days. The interaction of aPTT with antiplatelet therapy on stroke risk was assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for covariates.

Results

In the high aPTT group (defined as ≥ 35.9 s), stroke occurred in 6.7% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin arm and 11.9% in the aspirin arm [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29–0.85]. In the medium aPTT group (24.6–35.8 s), stroke occurred in 7.7% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin arm and 11.8% in the aspirin arm (adjusted HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.50–0.75). Furthermore, in the low aPTT group (≤ 24.5 s), stroke occurred in 11.2% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin arm and 9.9% in the aspirin arm (adjusted HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.65–1.62). The interaction P value of antiplatelet therapy with aPTT level at the cut-point of approximately 25 s or below was significant (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Dual antiplatelet therapy was superior to single antiplatelet therapy in the high or medium aPTT group but not in the low aPTT group.
