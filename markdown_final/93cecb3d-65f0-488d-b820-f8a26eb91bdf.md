## Question

how soon can restart apixaban after minor surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon apixaban can be restarted after a minor surgical procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "minor surgery" is defined in guideline frameworks and what that implies for bleeding risk. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics of apixaban and how that influences timing. Next, I will review high-quality guideline recommendations for post-procedural resumption, especially the ACCP and ACC/AHA guidance and the PAUSE protocol. After that, I should consider patient-specific modifiers such as renal function, thrombotic risk, and concomitant medications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and confirm it aligns with the best available evidence and labeling language.

> Let me first confirm the procedural risk categories, because the timing hinges on this. Minor or minimal bleeding risk procedures typically include superficial skin procedures, minor dental work, cataract surgery, and some endoscopies without intervention, whereas low to moderate risk includes inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and similar operations; high risk includes major orthopedic, abdominal, thoracic, neurosurgery, and complex cancer surgery, and this categorization is consistently used across ACCP, ACC/AHA, and ESC guidance as well as the PAUSE study framework [^112z1Zru] [^116iKzzm] [^114e6YYt] [^1147ND3V].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics next. Apixaban has a half-life of roughly 8–15 hours, reaches peak effect about 1–3 hours after ingestion, and is cleared about 25% renally, which means that after 24 hours most patients have minimal residual effect and after 48 hours the effect is essentially negligible in normal renal function; importantly, apixaban's rapid onset means that once restarted, therapeutic anticoagulation returns within hours, so I should be cautious not to restart too early if hemostasis is uncertain [^1147od5Y] [^116Voo6A].

> Now, I will examine the highest-quality guidance for post-procedural resumption. The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2024 AF guideline advises resuming anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk procedures and between the evening of day 2 and the evening of day 3 after high bleeding risk procedures, provided hemostasis is secured; ACCP 2022 similarly suggests resuming DOACs more than 24 hours after surgery, with implementation notes aligning to about 24 hours after low-to-moderate risk and 48–72 hours after high risk; the PAUSE protocol operationalized 1 day off before and 1 day after low-to-moderate risk procedures and 2 days off before and 2–3 days after high risk procedures, achieving very low 30-day rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism across thousands of patients on apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban [^113TTFf6] [^111LgQxA] [^116Voo6A] [^1147ND3V].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether even earlier resumption is acceptable in truly minimal-risk scenarios. The PERIXa prospective cohort in patients with AF undergoing minimal-to-low risk procedures (endoscopy, dental, ocular) used a standardized protocol with the last dose 24 hours pre-procedure and resumption the next morning, yielding 0.1% major bleeding and 0% thromboembolism at 30 days; some expert reviews note that for very low risk cases with assured hemostasis, resumption 6–8 hours after the procedure may be reasonable, but that is extrapolated and less certain than the 24-hour standard, so I should be cautious and anchor to 24 hours unless the team is confident in hemostasis and the procedure is truly minimal risk [^114QBnGC] [^117RfkEm] [^116Povvu].

> Wait, let me verify patient-specific modifiers that could shift the timing. Renal impairment can prolong apixaban exposure; although apixaban is less renally cleared than dabigatran, severe CKD may warrant extending the pre- and post-procedural interruption by an extra day in some protocols, and observational CKD data show longer interruptions and resumptions tailored to bleeding risk; high thrombotic risk (e.g., recent VTE, mechanical valve, very high CHA2DS2-VASc) may justify earlier resumption once hemostasis is secure, whereas concomitant strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors would increase apixaban levels and could argue for a more conservative restart; neuraxial or deep plexus procedures require more conservative timing due to hematoma risk, consistent with ASRA's intent for near-complete drug effect resolution before such blocks [^116gK48s] [^11619KHx] [^116W3hkD] [^115SV9wF].

> I should double-check the practical clinical triggers for restarting. The universal prerequisite is adequate hemostasis: no active oozing, stable wound, and no concerning procedural bleeding; if hemostasis is uncertain, it is reasonable to delay to 48 hours or even longer depending on risk, and if the patient is high thrombotic risk and the DOAC must be delayed, short-term pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis with LMWH can be considered while monitoring closely; conversely, if hemostasis is clearly achieved and the patient is low thrombotic risk, sticking to 24 hours is both safe and efficient [^117RfkEm] [^114wTwfE] [^116Povvu].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is as follows: for a minor or minimal bleeding risk procedure with confirmed hemostasis, apixaban can generally be restarted 24 hours post-procedure; for a low-to-moderate risk procedure, 24–48 hours is prudent; for a high bleeding risk procedure, 48–72 hours is appropriate; and in select truly minimal-risk cases with excellent hemostasis, some clinicians may resume as early as 6–8 hours, but that is off-label and should be reserved for carefully selected patients and teams comfortable with close monitoring; I should confirm that this aligns with ACC/AHA and ACCP guidance and the PAUSE operational data, which it does [^113TTFf6] [^111LgQxA] [^1147ND3V] [^1174nzyV].

> Final answer: For most minor procedures with assured hemostasis, restart apixaban 24 hours after the procedure; if hemostasis is uncertain or the procedural risk is borderline, extend to 48 hours; earlier resumption at 6–8 hours may be considered only in truly minimal-risk procedures with impeccable hemostasis and careful monitoring, recognizing this is extrapolated and not standard of care; always reassess renal function, thrombotic risk, and interacting medications before finalizing the timing [^1174nzyV] [^113TTFf6] [^114QBnGC].

---

For minor surgery, **restart apixaban 24 hours after the procedure** once adequate hemostasis is confirmed [^116Povvu] [^113TTFf6]. This timing balances bleeding and thrombotic risks because apixaban has a rapid onset and short half-life [^116Voo6A]. If hemostasis is uncertain or bleeding risk is higher, **delay to 48 hours** [^114wTwfE]. Bridging anticoagulation is not needed [^114yW3p7] [^1147ND3V].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

- **Half-life**: Apixaban's half-life is ~8–15 hours, allowing rapid clearance and a short interruption window [^1147od5Y].
- **Onset of action**: Peak effect occurs 3–4 hours after dosing, so restarting too early increases bleeding risk [^112CpLiu] [^1174nzyV].
- **Renal clearance**: ~27% renal; moderate renal impairment may warrant longer interruption, though this is less critical for apixaban than for dabigatran [^117FwtsZ].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACCP 2022**: Resume DOACs > 24 hours after low-to-moderate bleeding risk procedures; 48–72 hours after high-risk procedures [^111LgQxA] [^116Voo6A].
- **ACC/AHA 2024**: Resume anticoagulation the day after low-risk procedures; between day 2 and 3 after high-risk procedures once hemostasis is achieved [^113TTFf6].
- **PAUSE study**: Standardized interruption/resumption without bridging resulted in low major bleeding (1.35%) and thromboembolism (0.16%) in AF patients undergoing elective procedures [^1147ND3V] [^111vkUs8].

---

## Factors influencing timing of resumption

| **Factor** | **Impact on timing** |
|-|-|
| Hemostasis | - Resume only when adequate hemostasis is confirmed [^113TTFf6] <br/> - Delay if uncertain |
| Bleeding risk | - Higher risk: delay to 48–72 hours [^114wTwfE] <br/> - Lower risk: 24 hours is acceptable [^113TTFf6] |
| Thrombotic risk | - High risk: consider earlier resumption if hemostasis is secure [^1122fZyw] <br/> - Low risk: standard 24-hour interval is acceptable |
| Renal function | - Moderate impairment: consider longer interruption [^115T2MQf] <br/> - Severe impairment: extend to 48–72 hours |

---

## Risks associated with early or delayed resumption

Early resumption increases **postoperative bleeding**, whereas delayed resumption increases **thromboembolic risk** (stroke, VTE) [^1174nzyV]. The 24-hour interval balances these risks in minor procedures [^1147ND3V].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

- **Dental procedures**: Resume 24 hours after hemostasis is confirmed.
- **Minor skin procedures**: Resume 24 hours post-procedure.
- **Cataract surgery**: Resume 24 hours after confirmed hemostasis.
- **Colonoscopy without polypectomy**: Resume 24 hours post-procedure.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Consider longer interruption in moderate-to-severe impairment [^116iKzzm].
- **High thrombotic risk**: If hemostasis is secure, earlier resumption may be justified [^11619KHx].
- **Bridging anticoagulation**: Not recommended for DOACs due to increased bleeding risk [^114yW3p7] [^117RfkEm].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Procedure risk** | **Recommended timing for resumption** |
|-|-|
| Low-to-moderate risk | 24 hours after procedure |
| High risk | 48–72 hours after procedure |

---

For minor surgery, **restart apixaban 24 hours after the procedure** once hemostasis is confirmed; delay to 48 hours if bleeding risk is higher or hemostasis is uncertain [^113TTFf6].

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^116W3hkD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^116nqRDb]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism.

Observations

For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal (eg, minor dental or skin procedures), low to moderate (eg, cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia repair), or high risk (eg, major cancer or joint replacement procedures). For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure. Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism (0.2%-0.4%) and major bleeding (1%-2%) are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent (< 6 hours after presentation) or urgent surgical procedures (6–24 hours after presentation) experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent (eg, prothrombin complex concentrates, idarucizumab, or andexanet-α) prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

Apixaban — elective surgery/procedure perioperative interruption: In patients receiving apixaban who require an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest stopping apixaban for 1 to 2 days before the surgery/procedure over apixaban continuation (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), with the number of interruption days depending on procedural bleed risk — 1 day off before low-to-moderate-bleed-risk and 2 days off before high-bleed-risk; this management may be applied irrespective of atrial fibrillation or VTE indication.

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^1178Szfi]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1122fZyw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Postprocedural anticoagulation management in patients on oral anticoagulants specifies that once adequate postprocedural hemostasis is achieved, anticoagulation should likely be restarted expeditiously. For procedures with low postprocedural bleeding risk, anticoagulation can likely be restarted 24 hours after the procedure, whereas if postprocedural bleeding risk is higher, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours. For patients at high thrombotic risk who will be restarting VKA therapy, bridging anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulants may be considered once hemostasis is achieved, but such bridging is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and no decrease in thrombotic events in nonvalvular AF; if a DOAC is used postprocedurally, bridging anticoagulation should not be used. When surgeries or procedures are performed to control bleeding, restarting anticoagulation after the procedure may carry a higher bleeding risk; if the source of bleeding is identified and completely corrected with adequate hemostasis, restarting anticoagulation may be reasonable, and individualized strategies with close clinical monitoring apply when bleeding was not successfully controlled by surgical/procedural management.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1147od5Y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Timing of anticoagulant interruption and restart for surgery is outlined as follows: Recommendations state aspirin is continued for all types of surgeries, and Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), and Edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are stopped for 24 h before minor surgery and 48 h before major surgery, while clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta) are held for 5–7 days. Table-based examples specify drug-specific withholding and restart intervals: Warfarin (Coumadin) half-life 20–60 h, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin) and 48–72 h after major surgery (overlapping therapy with heparin); Apixaban (Eliquis) half-life 8–15 h, withhold 24 h for minor and 48 h for major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h uses creatinine clearance (CrCl) to guide withholding (CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 24 h for minor, 72 h for major; CrCl < 50 mL: 75 h for minor, 120 h for major) and restart 24 h after minor or 24–48 h after major surgery; Aspirin half-life 7–10 days is "usually continued" and "usually continued" for restart; Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days, withhold 5–7 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery; Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days, withhold 3–5 days for minor or major surgery, restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major surgery. In case of impaired renal function, withholding intervals for several agents should be prolonged and/or drug levels evaluated.

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^1174nzyV]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative anticoagulation

Postoperative management of NOACs should be considered as restarting any anticoagulation agent in this setting. With appropriate hemostasis, NOACs potentially can be resumed 6 to 8 hours after minor procedures. However, restarting full dose anticoagulation shortly after a procedure may increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. If this risk outweighs the risk of thromboembolic complication, full dose anticoagulation might be resumed 48 or 72 hours after the procedure. In case of immobilization and increased risk of thromboembolic complication, thromboprophylaxis using low molecular weight heparins or unfractionated heparin should be started within 6 to 8 postoperative hours, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation with NOACs should be delayed for 48 to 72 hours after the procedure (Figure 1). Following major orthopedic surgery it may be appropriate to use prophylactic doses of NOACs until the patient can resume full dose anticoagulation.

ACC 2020 oral anticoagulant bleeding — decision to stop or restart anticoagulation after stabilization directs clinicians to first ask, "Once patient is stable, is there a clinical indication for continued OAC?" If no, the pathway states "Suggest discontinuing anticoagulation". If yes, assess "DOES ≥ 1 OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS APPLY?" including critical‑site bleeding, high risk of rebleeding or of death/disability with rebleeding, unidentified source, planned surgical/invasive procedures, or patient preference not to restart; if yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation", and if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation".

### What surgeons should know about non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants: a review [^112CpLiu]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly prescribed for patients to treat or prevent arterial or venous thromboembolism. The following 4 NOAC agents are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: dabigatran etexilate, apixaban, edoxaban tosylate, and rivaroxaban. A good understanding of these agents' pharmacologic properties is important for surgeons given their marked differences compared with warfarin sodium. This review highlights key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting.

Observations

The PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language studies from May 1, 2009, until May 1, 2017, for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical guidelines. From a systematic review of the published literature that included 70 articles and 166 404 patients, this study identified 5 key practical issues surrounding the use of NOACs in the perioperative setting. These include patient populations for which NOAC use is indicated and contraindicated, the timing of NOAC treatment cessation before invasive interventions, management of NOAC-treated patients requiring urgent interventions, the need for "bridging", and the timing of NOAC treatment's reinitiation after invasive interventions. Important findings are as follows: NOAC agents are not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves or advanced kidney disease (creatinine clearance, < 15 mL/min); minimal to no anticoagulant effect remains when therapy with a NOAC is withheld for 48 to 72 hours before surgery in the context of normal kidney function; a reversal agent is clinically available for dabigatran, while reversal agents for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are under regulatory review; and laboratory testing of the anticoagulant effects of NOACs are not routinely available. There is a paucity of high-quality data on the optimal timing of NOAC cessation and resumption in the perioperative period, particularly for patients who undergo procedures with high bleeding risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

The anticoagulant effect of NOAC agents is predictable but not readily measurable in routine clinical practice. A number of uncertainties remain surrounding the use of these agents in the perioperative setting. Ongoing prospective studies and randomized clinical trials will provide greater clarity on these management issues in the near future.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116v9ZUs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Figure 2 — management of major bleeding on OACs (including direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs] and vitamin K antagonists [VKAs]) first asks, "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC and antiplatelet agent(s); if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide local therapy/ manual compression; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no (major but not critical/life threatening), actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. After initial measures, the pathway asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and if not, it states, "Suggest administering reversal/hemostatic agents* (see Figure 3)"; once the patient is stable, it advises, "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)". Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).

### Perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation receiving a direct oral anticoagulant [^1147ND3V]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who use a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and request elective surgery or procedure present a common clinical situation yet perioperative management is uncertain.

Objective

To investigate the safety of a standardized perioperative DOAC management strategy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) cohort study conducted at 23 clinical centers in Canada, the United States, and Europe enrolled and screened patients from August 1, 2014, through July 31, 2018. Participants (n = 3007) had AF; were 18 years of age or older; were long-term users of apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, or rivaroxaban; were scheduled for an elective surgery or procedure; and could adhere to the DOAC therapy interruption protocol.

Interventions

A simple standardized perioperative DOAC therapy interruption and resumption strategy based on DOAC pharmacokinetic properties, procedure-associated bleeding risk, and creatinine clearance levels. The DOAC regimens were omitted for 1 day before a low-bleeding-risk procedure and 2 days before a high-bleeding-risk procedure. The DOAC regimens were resumed 1 day after a low-bleeding-risk procedure and 2 to 3 days after a high-bleeding-risk procedure. Follow-up of patients occurred for 30 days after the operation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major bleeding and arterial thromboembolism (ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and transient ischemic attack) and the proportion of patients with an undetectable or minimal residual anticoagulant level (< 50 ng/mL) at the time of the procedure.

Results

The 3007 patients with AF (mean [SD] age of 72.5 [9.39] years; 1988 men [66.1%]) comprised 1257 (41.8%) in the apixaban cohort, 668 (22.2%) in the dabigatran cohort, and 1082 (36.0%) in the rivaroxaban cohort; 1007 patients (33.5%) had a high-bleeding-risk procedure. The 30-day postoperative rate of major bleeding was 1.35% (95% CI, 0%-2.00%) in the apixaban cohort, 0.90% (95% CI, 0%-1.73%) in the dabigatran cohort, and 1.85% (95% CI, 0%-2.65%) in the rivaroxaban cohort. The rate of arterial thromboembolism was 0.16% (95% CI, 0%-0.48%) in the apixaban cohort, 0.60% (95% CI, 0%-1.33%) in the dabigatran cohort, and 0.37% (95% CI, 0%-0.82%) in the rivaroxaban cohort. In patients with a high-bleeding-risk procedure, the rates of major bleeding were 2.96% (95% CI, 0%-4.68%) in the apixaban cohort and 2.95% (95% CI, 0%-4.76%) in the rivaroxaban cohort.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, patients with AF who had DOAC therapy interruption for elective surgery or procedure, a perioperative management strategy without heparin bridging or coagulation function testing was associated with low rates of major bleeding and arterial thromboembolism.

Dabigatran (Pradaxa) half-life 12–17 h: for minor, CrCl (creatinine clearance) ≥ 50 mL: 24 h and CrCl < 50 mL: 72 h; for major, CrCl ≥ 50 mL: 72 h and CrCl < 50 mL: 120 h; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Aspirin half-life 7–10 days: usually continued for both withholding and restart. Clopidogrel (Plavix) half-life 7–10 days: withhold 5–7 days before minor and 5–7 days before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Ticagrelor (Brilinta) half-life 5–7 days: withhold 3–5 days before minor and 3–5 days before major; restart 24 h after minor and 24–48 h after major. Footnotes qualify that "In some cases, continued drug administration is feasible" and "In case of impaired renal function, withholding interval should be prolonged and/or drug level should be evaluated by laboratory tests", and the table defines "CrCl: creatinine clearance".

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^115YnoZD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective, multicenter cohort study of patients with AF who were receiving factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulation treatment and undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, the PERIXa protocol for factor Xa inhibitor interruption and resumption was associated with a low 30-day major bleeding event rate (0.1%) and no thromboembolic events (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Among 1902 patients included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set, there were 2 (0.1%) major bleeding events, 8 (0.4%) CRNMB, 43 (2.3%) minor bleeding, and 50 (2.6%) all bleeding events that occurred.

Dental procedures had the highest incidence of bleeding events among the 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Bleeding event rates were not significantly different across various types of DOACs (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) or dosing regimens (once or twice daily). Periprocedural protocol adherence was 84.9%. The per-protocol analysis corroborated the main findings.

The EHRA practical guidelines advise against discontinuing OACs for scheduled procedures with minor bleeding risk, recommending that they be performed 12 to 24 hours after the last DOAC dose. However, a more practical clinical approach may involve administering the final DOAC dose 18 to 24 hours before the procedure and resuming it 6 hours after. An inconsistency exists between this general guideline and specific practical guidelines that suggest single-dose discontinuation based on the DOAC type, such as apixaban or dabigatran. Furthermore, there is a lack of prospective evidence supporting this recommendation. The American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline for perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy published in 2022recommended continuing anticoagulation treatment for procedures with minimal bleeding risk with no or only minimal interruption (ie, on the day of the procedure). For procedures with low to moderate bleeding risk, they advise pausing 1 day before the operation and resuming DOACs at least 24 hours after the procedure. However, this guideline did not offer unified recommendations for endoscopy, dental, or ocular procedures, categorized as interventions with minor bleeding risk in the EHRA guideline. While there is limited research supporting recommendations for procedures with minimal bleeding risk, our PERIXa study provides substantial observational evidence supporting the perioperative discontinuation of factor Xa inhibitors in a large prospective cohort.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^1138CPtm]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Discontinuation of oral anticoagulant treatment is common in clinical practice due to concerns about bleeding, even for procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Objective

To explore whether perioperative discontinuation of factor Xa inhibitors is associated with major bleeding and thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, multicenter, single-arm cohort study conducted in Korea included patients with AF who planned to undergo a procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk between September 25, 2020, and April 5, 2024.

Exposure

The PERIXa (Perioperative Factor Xa Inhibitor Discontinuation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Minimal to Low Bleed Risk Procedures) protocol recommending giving the last dose of factor Xa inhibitor (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) 24 hours before the procedure (ie, endoscopy, dental procedure, or ocular surgery) and restarting treatment with the inhibitor the next day.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was major bleeding, and the secondary outcome included a composite of thromboembolic events 30 days after the index procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Results

In total, 1902 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis set encompassing all patients who underwent the intended procedure (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [8.8] years; 1135 [59.7%] male; mean [SD] CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex; range, 0–9, with higher scores indicating higher risk of stroke] score, 2.8 [1.3]; mean [SD] HAS-BLED [hypertension, kidney or liver disease, stroke history, prior bleeding, unstable international normalized ratio, age > 65 years, and drug or alcohol use; range, 0–9, with higher scores indicating higher risk of bleeding] score, 1.6 [0.7]). Among them, 921 (48.4%) were receiving apixaban, 616 (32.4%) were receiving edoxaban, and 365 (19.2%) were receiving rivaroxaban. Of the total procedures, 948 (49.8%) were endoscopy, 820 (43.1%) were dental procedures, and 120 (6.3%) were ocular surgery. The 30-day event rate of major bleeding was 0.1% (n = 2), and there were no composite thromboembolic events. The results were consistent in the per-protocol analysis, and no differences were observed by procedure category or factor Xa inhibitor type.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, patients with AF receiving a factor Xa inhibitor and undergoing a procedure with minimal to low bleeding risk had low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism when following the standardized PERIXa protocol for perioperative management of oral anticoagulant treatment, suggesting that this may be a safe and reasonable option for this patient population.

2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and other Interventions

If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, XARELTO should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of XARELTO, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. XARELTO should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant.

2.5 Missed Dose

Adults

For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg XARELTO dose as recommended at the next scheduled time.
For patients receiving 15 mg twice daily: The patient should take XARELTO immediately to ensure intake of 30 mg XARELTO per day. Two 15 mg tablets may be taken at once.
For patients receiving 20 mg, 15 mg or 10 mg once daily: The patient should take the missed XARELTO dose immediately. The dose should not be doubled within the same day to make up for a missed dose.

Pediatric Patients

If XARELTO is taken once a day, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible once it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed. The patient should not take two doses to make up for a missed dose.
If XARELTO is taken two times a day, the patient should take the missed morning dose as soon as possible once it is noticed. A missed morning dose may be taken together with the evening dose. A missed evening dose can only be taken in the same evening.
If XARELTO is taken three times a day, if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule at the usual time without compensating for the missed dose.

On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen.

Study Population and Procedure

Between September 25, 2020, and April 5, 2024, eligible participants included adults with AF receiving a factor Xa inhibitor (ie, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) who were scheduled to undergo procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, including endoscopy, dental procedures, and ocular surgery. Full eligibility criteria are provided in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2.

Patients who were referred by the operator to cardiologists for preprocedural consultations regarding DOAC discontinuation before procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk were screened by the cardiologist. eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2 provides the list of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. After providing written informed consent, eligible patients were enrolled. Once enrolled, patients were informed of the preprocedure and postprocedure drug discontinuation protocols, and operators of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk were also informed of study enrollment and the factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation protocol in a protocolized document.

The PERIXa discontinuation protocol is provided in eFigure 1A in Supplement 2. The PERIXa protocol was largely based on the EHRA protocol, with modifications to make it more user-friendly and clearer for each factor Xa inhibitor application. For apixaban, taken twice daily, the protocol was to discontinue the evening dose a day before the procedure and the morning dose on the procedure day. If the procedure was performed in the morning, the evening dose could be restarted after hemostasis was achieved. The usual protocol was to resume the regular schedule the next morning. For once-daily edoxaban and rivaroxaban, the protocol was to discontinue on the morning of the procedure and resume the next morning.

For patients who underwent the planned procedure, we examined the actual procedure details, the duration of drug discontinuation, and the clinical outcomes immediately after the procedure, as well as at 7 and 30 days after the procedure (eFigure 1B in Supplement 2). Additionally, the operator who performed the procedure was asked to provide details about the actual procedure and the level of bleeding and hemostasis observed during the operation. The survey questions are available in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2.

Delaying restart of anticoagulation — algorithm for post-bleed management in patients on oral anticoagulants details sequential decision points and actions. If the answer to "Is the patient willing to restart anticoagulation at this time?" is no, proceed to "Initiate clinician/patient discussion (see Table 7)". If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111vkUs8]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) — standardized interruption schedules and outcomes are reported as follows: A prospective management study of 541 dabigatran-treated patients adopted 24- and 48-hour interruption intervals for low- and high-bleed-risk surgeries/procedures, respectively, with low 30-day post-operative rates of ATE 0.2% and major bleeding 1.8%. In the PAUSE prospective management study of 3,007 atrial fibrillation patients taking apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban, those with severe renal insufficiency were excluded (CrCl < 25 mL/min for apixaban; CrCl < 30 mL/min for dabigatran or rivaroxaban); DOACs were interrupted for 1 day before and 1 day after low-to-moderate-bleed-risk procedures and for 2 days before and 2 days after high-bleed-risk procedures, with an exception for 2.7% [80 of 3,007] of dabigatran patients with CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min whose interruption was extended by 1 or 2 days; 30-day postoperative incidences of ATE and major bleeding were 0.16% and 1.35% in apixaban (n = 1,257), 0.60% and 0.9% in dabigatran (n = 668), and 0.37% and 1.85% in rivaroxaban (n = 1,082).

### Re-initiation of dabigatran and direct factor Xa antagonists after a major bleed [^116JrQHw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a relatively recent addition to the oral anticoagulant armamentarium, and provide an alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Regardless of the type of agent used, bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant therapy. The decision to restart oral anticoagulation following a major hemorrhage in a previously anticoagulated patient is supported largely by retrospective studies rather than randomized clinical trials (mostly with vitamin K antagonists), and remains an issue of individualized clinical assessment: the patient's risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding. This review provides guidance for clinicians regarding if and when a patient should be re-initiated on DOAC therapy following a major hemorrhage, based on the existing evidence.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117FwtsZ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — pre-operative DOAC level testing and circumstances for longer interruption are outlined: Measurement of DOAC levels before the surgery/procedure may be considered in patients who require an urgent (ie, within 24 hours) surgery, because routine coagulation tests such as the INR or aPTT may be insensitive; testing options include DOAC-calibrated anti-factor Xa levels for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, and dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time for dabigatran, though questions remain as to their clinical utility. There may be selected patients in whom a longer duration of pre-operative DOAC interruption may be required due to the longer time required for drug clearance as 75% to 80% of dabigatran clearance is by the kidney and in those with severely impaired renal function (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or hepatic dysfunction or taking drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein pathways.

### Edoxaban management in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (EMIT-AF / VTE)-trial design [^116vQEvL]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation) study (NCT02228798) includes AF patients who receive either dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Edoxaban was not included in the study, since it became available in Canada after the study had started enrolling. The objective of this study is to establish a safe and standardized perioperative management approach for NOAC in AF patients undergoing elective surgeries/procedures. The perioperative protocol of each NOAC is adjusted based on patients' renal function and procedure‐related bleeding risk.

In addition to postmarketing registries of NOAC, the BRIDGE (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients Who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery) trial randomized NVAF patients after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy to receive bridging therapy with dalteparin or matching placebo. 20 Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before procedure and dalteparin (100 IU/kg administered subcutaneously twice daily) was started 3 days before procedure. Outcomes were observed for 30 days after the procedure. The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism and major bleeding as defined by the ISTH criteria 14 (see Table S1). The limitations of this study encompass the need for a full therapeutic dose of dalteparin starting early after surgery, the overlap with the restart of warfarin, and the small percentage of patients undergoing high‐risk procedures. Moreover, the definition of high‐risk surgeries per se is questionable since these included procedures that usually do not have a high risk of bleeding (eg, pacemaker or internal defibrillator insertion, biopsy of kidney or prostate, and any other procedure lasting ≥ 1 hour).

### Timing the first postoperative dose of anticoagulants: lessons learned from clinical trials [^112ZjWx5]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, have been shown in phase 3 trials to be effective for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty. Results from prior studies suggested that the safety of anticoagulants in such patients was improved if the first postoperative dose was delayed for at least 6 h after surgery. The timing of the first postoperative dose of the NOACs tested in phase 2 studies differed among the three NOACs: dabigatran was started 1 to 4 h postoperatively, whereas rivaroxaban and apixaban were started at least 6 and 12 h, postoperatively, respectively. Our review of the timing of initiation of thromboprophylaxis in randomized trials provides three related lessons. First, clinical trials performed before the NOACs were evaluated demonstrated that delaying the first dose of prophylactic anticoagulation until after major surgery is effective and safe. Second, the optimal timing of the first dose of prophylactic anticoagulation after surgery depends on the dose that is selected. Third, the results of the phase 3 trials with NOACs for thromboprophylaxis support the concept that acceptable efficacy and safety can be achieved when the appropriate first postoperative dose of anticoagulant is delayed for at least 6 h after surgery.

Procedural Management

Past guidelines on perioperative and postoperative management for patients on DOACs have been primarily based on surgical risk (both thrombotic and bleeding), the DOAC's pharmacokinetic profile, concurrent medications, and patient characteristics (ie, comorbid diseases, history of bleeding complications, renal function, and age). 92, 93 Because of DOACs' fast onset and offset, periprocedural bridging is generally not required; however, it is important to note the length of time to hold regimens before and after procedures. Providers may find it useful to obtain specific coagulation measurements before procedures, especially in high‐risk interventions, to determine the level of hemostasis. However, for the majority of patients undergoing elective procedures, the interruption of DOAC therapy can be substantiated on a time‐based approach that takes into consideration bleeding risk of the procedure and renal function (see Table 8). 38, 93 Furthermore, the results of the ongoing PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation; NCT02228798) will help to further define a more conclusive standard‐of‐care approach for perioperative management. 94

### Non-major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113eVggX]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with non-major bleeding who were treated with apixaban were slightly more likely to require medical or surgical consultation (78.8%) compared with those treated with warfarin (70.1%). The reasons for this may include the play of chance, unblinding of treatment, excessive concern about the use of a novel anticoagulant like apixaban and lack of knowledge about the management of bleeding with the new oral anticoagulants. It is important to note that the rates of bleeding events are low and that there were fewer patients with bleeding, regardless of location, in the apixaban-treated group (figure 3).

As seen in patients with major bleeding in ARISTOTLE, warfarin treatment was more often associated with surgical intervention and/or change in antithrombotic therapy, as well as more hospitalisations than apixaban. These findings reinforce the safer profile of apixaban compared with warfarin.

The key findings of the present study are that (a) the incidence of non-major bleeding is high in this population; (b) apixaban caused significantly less non-major bleeding than warfarin; and (c) there is an independent increased risk of death and subsequent major bleeding associated with clinically relevant non-major bleeding, suggesting that physicians should chose the most efficacious antithrombotic strategy for stroke prevention, but also balance the risk of bleeding, even if minor.

Limitations

Patients included in ARISTOTLE represent a selected patient population that likely has a lower risk of bleeding than unselected patients in clinical practice. Thus, rates of non-major bleeding events may have been underestimated. Many of the analyses in this manuscript are observational and unmeasured confounders limit our ability to conclude a cause and effect relationship between non-major bleeding and clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

In the ARISTOTLE trial, non-major bleeding was common, associated with adverse outcomes including mortality and subsequent major bleeding and was less frequent with apixaban than warfarin. When non-major bleeding occurred, apixaban was less frequently discontinued than warfarin. These findings reinforce the safer profile of apixaban versus warfarin for patients with AF, and highlight the importance of any severity of bleeding in patients with AF treated with anticoagulation therapy, suggesting that non-major bleeding, including minor bleeding, might not be minor.

4. Conclusions

In summary, the decision to restart OAC therapy in a patient receiving chronic OAC who has suffered from a major bleed is a highly individualized assessment. The risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding in that individual, while taking into account the morbidity and case-fatality of a thrombotic/bleed outcome, in addition to the optimal time frame of when to restart OAC. It is also dependent upon the original indication for OAC, and the type of major bleed from which the patient suffered. Many patients with OAC-associated ICHs can restart OAC at some point between 1 and 30 weeks, but careful risk stratification must be performed. Most patients with OAC-associated clinically stable GI hemorrhages can restart OAC at 1 week post index bleed. Currently, there are few data on how DOACs might change the risk–benefit analysis of when to restart therapy after a major bleed event, particularly in ICH. However, the available data are reassuring in that practitioners would expect approximately 50% fewer of these events vs VKA-treated patients, which has major implications from a public health perspective. A larger number of well-designed studies are needed in this area for both VKA and, especially, for DOAC-treated patient groups.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111cBg6Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the decision to restart OAC therapy in a patient receiving chronic OAC who has suffered from a major bleed is a highly individualized assessment. The risk of thromboembolism must be balanced with the risk of recurrent major bleeding in that individual, while taking into account the morbidity and case-fatality of a thrombotic/bleed outcome, in addition to the optimal time frame of when to restart OAC. It is also dependent upon the original indication for OAC, and the type of major bleed from which the patient suffered. Many patients with OAC-associated ICHs can restart OAC at some point between 1 and 30 weeks, but careful risk stratification must be performed. Most patients with OAC-associated clinically stable GI hemorrhages can restart OAC at 1 week post index bleed. Currently, there are few data on how DOACs might change the risk–benefit analysis of when to restart therapy after a major bleed event, particularly in ICH. However, the available data are reassuring in that practitioners would expect approximately 50% fewer of these events vs VKA-treated patients, which has major implications from a public health perspective. A larger number of well-designed studies are needed in this area for both VKA and, especially, for DOAC-treated patient groups.

Other observational studies have also addressed, or are planning to address, the periprocedural management of patients with the indication for oral anticoagulation therapy. The Dresden NOAC registry reported efficacy and safety data on NVAF, DVT, or PE patients treated with NOAC prospectively. 5 Relevant efficacy and safety data and information on the periprocedural management of anticoagulant therapy — including interruption of NOAC treatment, possible bridging, and restart of NOAC administration — were collected from 5 days before to 30 days after the procedure. According to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines ninth edition 14 and the European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide, 19 the categories of minimal, minor, and major procedures were created. Major procedures are procedures with relevant tissue trauma and high bleeding risk such as open pelvic, abdominal, thoracic, brain, major orthopedic, or vascular surgery. Similarly, a Canadian prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the safety of periprocedural management of dabigatran. 7 The protocol specified the time points as the last dose before the procedure, the first dose after the procedure, and the time of the procedure. This specification was based on patients' creatinine clearance with the corresponding estimated half‐life of dabigatran and procedure‐related bleeding risk. The timing and dosing resumption of dabigatran after procedure was recommended according to patients' bleeding risk, which was classified as "high" or "standard". The study demonstrated that perioperative dabigatran administration was safe, as reflected by the low rate of major bleeding. However, it is not possible to extrapolate these results to any other NOAC since they have different pharmacokinetic profiles.

New direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) — timing for procedures and resumption: For preprocedure holding, "the ASRA guidelines for both regional anesthesia and pain recommended an interval of 5 half-lives of the drug before a regional or a pain intervention". For resuming therapy after a neuraxial procedure, "the ASRA regional guidelines recommended 6 hours, whereas the pain guidelines recommended 24 hours", with the longer pain guideline interval intended "to provide a longer observation period after procedures that involve surgical dissection (ie, intrathecal pump placements, permanent spinal cord stimulator implantations)". For postoperative thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients, "initiation of thromboprophylaxis with the new oral anticoagulants is recommended a minimum of 24 hours, and perhaps as long as 72 hours, depending on bleeding risk". The text concludes that "Hence, ASRA regional and pain guidelines are functionally the same".

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — perioperative management based on procedure bleed risk is outlined, including timing for resumption and optional post-procedure prophylaxis. DOAC can be resumed ~24 hours after low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures, and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk procedures; in selected patients at high risk for VTE, low-dose anticoagulants such as enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin, 5,000 IU daily can be given for the first 48–72 hours post-procedure. This figure pertains to patients receiving a DOAC and provides guidance on whether to interrupt DOAC therapy perioperatively and how to interrupt based on surgical/procedural bleed risk in the pre- and postoperative period.

Atrial fibrillation — timing of anticoagulant interruption before invasive procedures (Table 18): Apixaban is held 1 d before low bleeding risk procedures and 2 d before high bleeding risk procedures. Dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk, and with CrCl 30–50 mL/min is held 2 d for low risk and 4 d for high risk. Edoxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. Rivaroxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. For warfarin, hold 5 d or for a target INR < 1.5; an alternative is 2–3 d for a target INR < 2.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^114fUYjd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

A strength of the PERIXa study lies in its prospective enrollment of 1902 patients undergoing planned procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, along with its inclusion of valuable edoxaban periprocedural data (n = 616 [32.4%]), which is limited in this research field. This study demonstrated a simplified DOAC interruption protocol before and after these interventions, making communicating with patients and health care professionals easier. This protocol resulted in a very low major bleeding event rate and no thromboembolic events at 30 days. A recent reviewproposes a slightly shorter, near noninterruption protocol than the PERIXa study. Their protocol suggests omitting twice daily DOACs only on the morning of the procedure and delaying once daily DOACs slightly beyond their usual ingestion time. However, this recommendation lacks support from evidence encompassing a wide range of large-scale procedures or 3 categories of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. Moreover, the absence of a defined discontinuation protocol can raise patient and health care professionals' concerns about postprocedure hemostasis difficulties, potentially leading to unnecessary and prolonged DOAC discontinuation.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^114QvcTb]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

With the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, no strong evidence to support bridging exists currently. These anticoagulants have a shorter half-life and faster onset making the benefits of bridging less obvious. A study from the European Dresden registry from 2014 demonstrated that in patients taking nonvitamin K antagonists, heparin bridging did not reduce cardiovascular events, and major bleeding again was more frequent with bridging than without. Additionally, the HASBLED scoring system used to gauge the risk of hemorrhage can also be used to estimate risk of hemorrhage heparin bridging during warfarin cessation. Recommendations are unclear regarding the efficacy and need for bridging with DOACs.

Re-initiation of oral anticoagulation: The decision to restart anticoagulation after a procedure is again determined by weighing the risks for thromboembolism against that of hemorrhage. If hemostasis is assured after the procedure, vitamin K antagonists can be restarted 6–24 hours after surgery as therapeutic levels will take several days to reach. If periprocedural bridging is being used, patients at low risk of bleeding can resume bridging at 24 hours and those at higher bleed risk at 48–72 hours for all high-risk patients. Non-vitamin K antagonists could potentially be resumed after 6–24 hours in patients with low bleeding risk if hemostasis is assured, bearing in mind that these agents have a much faster time of onset. Those with higher bleeding risk should wait 48–72 hours prior to restarting and could be considered for bridging with heparin if the risk of thromboembolism is also high.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — timing of DOAC resumption after interruption: In patients who had DOAC interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming DOACs > 24 hours after a surgery/procedure over resuming DOACs within 24 hours (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Implementation notes specify that resumption depends on procedural bleed risk, with at least 24 hours after low-to-moderate-bleed-risk and 48–72 hours after high-bleed-risk, and that DOACs have a rapid onset with a peak effect occurring 1 to 3 hours after intake requiring cautious post-operative administration. Supporting evidence includes a randomized trial of 662 patients undergoing pacemaker/ICD implantation showing no significant difference in pocket hematomas with interruption versus continuation (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.36–2.87), and the PAUSE protocol standardizing resumption at approximately 24 hours for low-to-moderate-bleed-risk and 48 to 72 hours for high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure.

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) perioperative testing — For elective surgery after DOAC interruption, we suggest against routine DOAC coagulation function testing to guide perioperative DOAC management (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). Supporting data include a registry of 422 patients with interruption intervals ranging from 1 to 218 hours; in the 49- to 72-hour interval only 5% had a residual DOAC level > 30 ng/mL and none had a level > 50 ng/mL, and receiver-operator analysis identified 54 hours to best predict a residual anticoagulant level ≤ 30 ng/mL. In PAUSE, 85% (n = 2,541) had preprocedure levels measured, and the proportions with a pre-operative level < 50 ng/mL were 90.5%, 95.1%, and 96.8% for apixaban (n = 1,129), dabigatran (n = 563), and rivaroxaban (n = 965). In a high-bleed-risk/neuraxial subgroup with approximately 60 to 68 hours off drug (including 4 days off for dabigatran and CrCl < 50 mL/min), proportions with a DOAC level < 50 ng/mL were 97.9%, 99.4%, and 99.3% and with < 30 ng/mL were 93.1%, 98.9%, and 85.3%, respectively. Implementation notes state DOAC-level testing may be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in nonelective perioperative clinical situations, such as urgent/ emergency surgery/procedure, to inform the need for active reversal with blood products or DOAC-specific reversal agents.

### Association of atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulant use with perioperative outcomes after major noncardiac surgery [^115tBNMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since their approval for stroke prevention, prescription rates for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have risen steadily among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in North America. At present, they represent over 60% of new prescriptions and over one fifth of all oral anticoagulant prescriptions for such patients. 1, 2, 3, 4 Many of these patients will eventually require surgical intervention, as it is estimated that over 50 million surgical procedures are performed yearly in the United States. 5 Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in prospective cohort registries, ≈7% have preexisting AF. 6

While DOACs are being increasingly used, there is a paucity of information on the outcomes of patients with AF who are treated with anticoagulants who subsequently undergo major noncardiac surgery. Subgroup analysis of the RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial 7 suggested that the risks of major bleeding did not differ between those prescribed dabigatran or warfarin, occurring in ≈3% of elective and 20% of urgent surgeries. More recently, an analysis of procedures performed during the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) trial 8 reported a 30‐day major bleeding risk of only 1.6%, with more than one third of patients undergoing procedures without interrupting apixaban. Nonetheless, it is important to note that ≈90% of these surgeries were considered minor.

Outside of the clinical trial arena, there are limited data on perioperative outcomes of patients with AF who are treated with DOAC or warfarin. Accordingly, we examined the postoperative outcomes of patients with and without AF in Ontario, the most populous province of Canada, who subsequently underwent major noncardiac surgery of varying acuity — either elective or urgent procedures. Specifically, we examined the association between prescription of warfarin, a DOAC, or no anticoagulation in patients undergoing major surgery, with the rate of death or bleeding within 30 days. We hypothesized that outcomes among patients with AF would be influenced by the presence or absence of anticoagulation, as well as the specific type of anticoagulant prescribed. Furthermore, we hypothesized that there would be an association between the presence of preoperative AF and outcomes after urgent or elective major noncardiac surgical procedures.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism [^114FRCm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The appropriate duration of anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients who have a transient provoking factor (e.g., surgery, trauma, or immobility) and concomitant enduring risk factors is uncertain.

Methods

In this single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, adults with VTE after the occurrence of a transient provoking factor who had at least one enduring risk factor and had completed at least 3 months of anticoagulation were assigned to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the first symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the first episode of major bleeding according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.

Results

A total of 600 patients underwent randomization (mean age, 59.5 years; female sex, 57.0%; non-White race, 19.2%). The trial population had a broad range of provoking factors and enduring risk factors. Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 4 of the 300 patients (1.3%) in the apixaban group and in 30 of the 300 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in 1 patient in the apixaban group and none in the placebo group. Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in 14 of 294 patients (4.8%) in the apixaban group and in 5 of 294 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96 to 7.43; P = 0.06). One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no deaths attributed to cardiovascular or hemorrhagic causes. Nonhemorrhagic, nonfatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients (2.0%) in each group.

Conclusions

Among patients with provoked VTE and enduring risk factors, low-intensity therapy with apixaban for 12 months resulted in a lower risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE than placebo, with a low risk of major bleeding.

Table 1.
Perioperative management, kidney function and dialysis status

Figure 1.
Perioperative apixaban management in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Apixaban interruption and resumption intervals in hours, stratified according to procedural bleed risk. Intervals represent the time between last dose of apixaban before the procedure and the procedure itself, approximated to the nearest 12 hours. Apixaban was not resumed after the procedure for 1 patient undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure and 4 patients undergoing high-bleed-risk procedures. The median interruption and resumption intervals for patients undergoing low/moderate-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 24 hours (IQR 24–48), respectively. The median interruption and resumption intervals for high-bleed-risk procedures was 84 hours (IQR 60–84) and 48 hours (IQR 24–72), respectively. Interruption intervals were not significantly different according to procedural bleed risk (P = 0.38), but patients who had undergone a high-bleed-risk procedure had significantly longer resumption intervals (P = 0.0037).

We present novel data on apixaban-treated patients with advanced CKD who underwent a planned invasive procedure. Interruptions were over twice as long for patients undergoing a low-bleed-risk procedure as compared with a recent perioperative DOAC management study (84 hours vs ∼39 hours, PAUSE study), and longer than guideline-recommended intervals. This could have been due to perceived delayed apixaban clearance in patients with kidney dysfunction. As expected, patients with CKD were at risk of bleeding complications on anticoagulation. On the other hand, we observed only 2 MB events felt to be directly related to surgery (3.3%), corresponding to a risk of MB similar to that observed among warfarin- or DOAC-treated patients when best practices are followed (∼ 1%-3%). We did not observe any postoperative ATE or VTE. The interruption intervals observed in this study equate to holding apixaban for 1 to 2 additional days before a procedure compared to guideline-recommended practice. Our results, although preliminary, are reassuring and seem to indicate that planned procedures can be undertaken in this patient population without undue risk of bleeding or thrombosis, provided anticoagulation is managed carefully.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: unique properties and practical approaches to management [^111jGyq5]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Since 2009, four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. While they are currently first-line therapy for a majority of patients, there are a number of clinical situations where warfarin is preferable. In both randomised trials and real-world populations, use of DOACs significantly reduces the risk of intracranial haemorrhage as compared with warfarin. While drug-specific reversal agents are currently only available for dabigatran, andexanet alpha is pending approval for reversal of factor Xa inhibitors, reducing concerns about major bleeding for many patients and providers. DOACs can be held for 2–4 days prior to a procedure, depending on a patient's renal function, but should not be restarted too rapidly post-procedurally given their fast time to peak activity (∼2 hours). The anticoagulation clinic should play an important role in managing patients on all oral anticoagulation, both warfarin and DOACs.

### How I treat pediatric venous thromboembolism in the DOAC era [^1121zYzm]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: what safety concerns require a priori attention before initiating a DOAC?

Because this patient is a neonate, the risk of bleeding or ICH progression deserves careful discussion. In the DOAC clinical trials, the risk of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was from 1% to 2% (Table 1). In the Diversity trial, fewer children from birth to age < 2 years experienced serious adverse events in the dabigatran arm (9%) than those aged 12 to < 18 years (14%). In the same age group, 6 of 22 children (27%) receiving dabigatran experienced bleeding, of which 1 was a major ICH in an infant aged 1 month with meningitis. Most of the bleeding events reported were minor gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (5%), epistaxis (5%), and bruising (3%). In the Einstein Jr trial, none of the children in the rivaroxaban arm (n = 329) experienced major bleeding. Nevertheless, it is prudent to consider initial treatment with SOC agent and monitor ICH before considering a DOAC. The second step is to carefully review treatment of other comorbidities that could contribute to the risk of bleeding. For instance, this infant is being treated for sepsis; therefore, drug-drug interactions must be reviewed, specifically whether there is coadministration of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Table 2). Additionally, critically ill infants frequently undergo invasive procedures; therefore, clinicians must provide specific recommendations about periprocedure management (Figure 3). The DOAC can be restarted after the risk of bleeding is low and the patient is able to tolerate oral intake.

### Clinicians' adherence to guidelines for the preoperative management of direct oral anticoagulants in a tertiary hospital: a retrospective study [^1159SFvX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the recent ACCP guidelines, DOACs can be continued in cases of minimal bleeding risk or according to the clinician's judgment. However, only about 6% of the patients had not had their anticoagulant interrupted when a continuation was not recommended, suggesting a minimal influence on the final result.

These results contrasted with the 94% adherence observed in the PAUSE study. However, our study reflected a real-life setting that cannot be compared with the adherence to a study protocol. Premature interruption and heparin bridging (when not recommended) were responsible for more than half of the observed management failures by clinicians. Fear of bleeding or thromboembolic events could have driven this approach by clinicians despite data from the PAUSE study showing low rates of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications associated with this preoperative management of DOACs. It is possible that clinicians still lack knowledge about our institutional recommendations, although they have been widely distributed as a pocket guide since 2015. Our findings could reflect a lack of confidence in these guidelines as some clinicians argue that the PAUSE study did not include enough patients with a high bleeding risk. Indeed, only a third of the patients it included underwent high-bleeding-risk surgery, with most being cardiac surgery. Clinicians could thus be less prone to following the ACCP guidelines when dealing with high-bleeding-risk surgeries; therefore, they increased the delay between the last DOAC dose and the surgery and/or the prescription of heparin bridging. However, the fact that our study's adherence rates were low for all bleeding risk categories argues against this. Local anaesthesia was associated with a 70% reduction in adherence to our institution's recommendations. Although the 2022 ACCP guidelines do not suggest specific strategies for local anaesthesia, this lack of adherence is not surprising because the European Society of Anaesthesia (ESA) guidelines for regional anaesthesia do not propose discontinuation of anticoagulants for superficial nerve blocks, only for deep nerve blocks. Thus, some clinicians probably decided to maintain DOAC therapy during the intervention, as the ESA guidelines recommend. Interestingly, apixaban treatment was also associated with less adherence than rivaroxaban treatment, even after multivariate analysis. Therefore, patient morbidity or procedure risk in patients under apixaban cannot be claimed as causes of poor adherence. Although a complete explanation of this observation remains elusive, we can hypothesise that the twice-daily administration of apixaban may have appeared more confusing for clinicians attempting to manage the preoperative interruption of the drug.

Characteristics and circumstances of first non-major bleeding event

Of the patients with non-major bleeding, in general, medical or surgical consultations and interventions were similar among those treated with apixaban versus warfarin (table 2).

Table 2
Characteristics and circumstances of the first clinically relevant non-major or minor bleeding event according by study drug

Hospitalisations for non-major bleeding events were slightly more frequent in patients treated with warfarin versus apixaban (13.8% (178) vs 12.9% (118)). Of those who suffered non-major bleeding, change in antithrombotic therapy (58.6% (754) vs 50.0% (459), p < 0.0001) and permanent study drug discontinuation (5.1% (61) vs 3.6% (30), p = 0.10) were also numerically higher with warfarin than apixaban.

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption for elective surgery/procedure: The interruption can follow a pharmacokinetic-based approach whereby the pre-operative interruption interval corresponds to four to five elimination half-lives; given DOAC half-lives of 9 to 14 hours, withholding DOACs for 2 full days before surgery/procedure (a 60- to 68-hour interval from the last dose) should result in minimal to no residual anticoagulant effect for high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure, whereas for low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure withholding DOACs for 1 full day (a 30- to 36-hour interruption interval, approximately three DOAC half-lives) can be used, and in all patients no DOAC is taken on the day of the surgery/procedure; in dabigatran-treated patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min), interruption for 3 to 4 full days is required.

One randomized trial of 98 patients compared post-operative resumption of warfarin at patients' usual dose vs doubling the warfarin dose for the first 2 post-operative days, finding by the fifth post-operative day an INR ≥ 2.0 in 13% of the usual-dose group and 50% of the doubling dose group (RR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60) and by the tenth post-operative day 68% and 87% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.00). A 40-patient randomized trial reported median days to reach an INR ≥ 2.0 of 7.8 vs 9.0 days (95% CI: −3.1 to 4.9), and observational studies reported mean durations to attain an INR ≥ 2.0 of 4.6 and 5.1 days, respectively. Implementation notes caution that although doubling for 1 to 2 days may lead to a more rapid attainment of an INR ≥ 2.0 in some patients, there are concerns in applying this approach in practice, including in patients expected to be hospitalized for > 1 day.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^116zVe5i]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulants and platelet function inhibitors

Long-term antiplatelet and anticoagulation use is increasingly common in many populations, and their management in emergency surgery is complex. Patients undergoing emergency laparotomy are at high risk of perioperative hemorrhage and thrombosis, given both the nature of their procedure and the underlying coagulopathy of sepsis and systemic inflammation. Hemorrhage following surgery is highly-associated with end-organ dysfunction and mortality in emergency general surgical patients. Reversal of these agents or their effects prior to emergent surgery, when possible, may reduce the risk of perioperative hemorrhage. Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin are common, although newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used. Guidance on reversal of specific antithrombotic medications and platelet function inhibitors has been published by various societies and is beyond the scope of this article. To guide management decisions, coagulation tests including international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) among others should be obtained preoperatively where appropriate, although conventional clotting studies do not help with low molecular weight heparin or DOACs. A variety of platelet function tests are available and should be considered for patients taking antiplatelet therapy. The decision to reverse antithrombotic medication should be based on the patient's immediate need for surgery, the risk of associated bleeding, and the risk of thromboembolism.

Anticoagulants (Warfarin, DOACs, Heparin/Enoxaparin)

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma may be administered and titrated to the required effect in these cases. Specific reversal agents exist for DOAC medications and can be used if available. Dabigatran has a reversal agent idarucizumab and recombinant factor Xa functions to reverse apixaban and rivaroxaban.

Recommendation:
Strongly consider reversal of home anticoagulation medications when major surgical intervention is planned. This decision should be based on both the patient's risk of procedure-related bleeding and the risk of thromboembolism.

Level of evidence: Moderate.
Recommendation grade: Strong.

2.7 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

If possible, discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. For pediatric patients, PRADAXA Oral Pellets should be stopped 24 hours before an elective surgery (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 2 days before an elective surgery (eGFR 50–80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Pediatric patients with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2have not been studied, avoid use of PRADAXA Oral Pellets in these patients.

Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. Efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information. Restart PRADAXA Oral Pellets as soon as medically appropriate.

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after knee replacement (ADVANCE-2): a randomised double-blind trial [^112FUEec]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin are preferred for prevention of venous thromboembolism after major joint replacement. Apixaban, an orally active factor Xa inhibitor, might be as effective, have lower bleeding risk, and be easier to use than is enoxaparin. We assessed efficacy and safety of these drugs after elective total knee replacement.

Methods

In ADVANCE-2, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind phase 3 study, patients undergoing elective unilateral or bilateral total knee replacement were randomly allocated through an interactive central telephone system to receive oral apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily (n = 1528) or subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (1529). The randomisation schedule was generated by the Bristol-Myers Squibb randomisation centre and stratified by study site and by unilateral or bilateral surgery with a block size of four. Investigators, patients, statisticians, adjudicators, and steering committee were masked to allocation. Apixaban was started 12–24 h after wound closure and enoxaparin 12 h before surgery; both drugs were continued for 10–14 days, when bilateral ascending venography was scheduled. Primary outcome was the composite of asymptomatic and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and all-cause death during treatment. The statistical plan required non-inferiority of apixaban before testing for superiority; analysis was by intention to treat for non-inferiority testing. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452530.

Findings

1973 of 3057 patients allocated to treatment (1528 apixaban, 1529 enoxaparin) were eligible for primary efficacy analysis. The primary outcome was reported in 147 (15%) of 976 apixaban patients and 243 (24%) of 997 enoxaparin patients (relative risk 0.62 [95% CI 0.51–0.74]; p < 0.0001; absolute risk reduction 9.3% [5.8–12.7]). Major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 53 (4%) of 1501 patients receiving apixaban and 72 (5%) of 1508 treated with enoxaparin (p = 0.09).

Interpretation

Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, starting on the morning after total knee replacement, offers a convenient and more effective orally administered alternative to 40 mg per day enoxaparin, without increased bleeding.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption and reversal guidance indicates that a DOAC interruption protocol tested in 3007 patients with AF resulted in low rates of major bleeding or thromboembolism, and that time reversal of OAC is always preferred but may not be feasible for urgent or emergency procedures with moderate or high bleeding risk; measurement of coagulation parameters or drug levels may identify ongoing drug effects, and in the absence of adequate laboratory parameters or detectable drug levels, OAC reversal agents may not be necessary, whereas otherwise rapid reversal can be achieved with prothrombin complex concentrates, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban), or idarucizumab for dabigatran, and procedures with higher bleeding risks (eg, neuraxial anesthesia) should be performed with complete interruption of OAC.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^113TxacP]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Smaller studies suggest reduced bleeding risk when anticoagulation is discontinued rather than continued without significantly increasing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. Subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials — comparing the efficacy and safety of 4 DOACs to warfarin — provided insights into periprocedural management strategies for DOACs, reaching similar conclusions. These subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials had limitations: few patients underwent scheduled procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, and there were no standardized protocols for DOAC discontinuation. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that temporarily stopping DOAC administration during the periprocedural period may lower the risk of major bleeding without substantially increasing thromboembolic events.,

Prospective studies have evaluated periprocedural management of DOACs, including a meta-analysis comparing DOACs with warfarin in elective procedures under a noninterruption or short interruption strategy. This analysis demonstrated a 38% lower risk of major bleeding with DOAC treatment under a noninterruption strategy, with no differences observed under an interrupted strategy while maintaining comparable efficacy in stroke prevention and overall mortality. However, no prospective studies have focused on procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. The PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation) trial was the largest multicenter, multinational clinical study using a 1-arm design with a well-defined periprocedural DOAC management protocol for 3007 patients with AF undergoing procedures with high and low to moderate bleeding risk. The PAUSE trial found endoscopic procedures comprised 20.9% of total procedures, with ocular and dental procedures at 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Other studies, and a registryreported that endoscopic procedures comprised 19.9% to 34.9% of the total procedures, while ocular or dental procedures accounted for only 3.9% to 13.4%. Although the PAUSE trialfound very low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism (major bleeding rates of 0.9%-1.9% and stroke or thromboembolism rates of 0.2%-0.6% at 30 days after the procedure), with other studies reporting similar event rates, there was a small proportion of procedures with minimal bleeding risk included. The PERIXa study aligns with and expands on the findings of the PAUSE study in periprocedural DOAC management. The present study used data from a large multicenter study with a well-defined interruption protocol for factor Xa inhibitors in patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the risk of bleeding with apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists [^112UNLxK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Apixaban is one of the new oral anticoagulants, which is prescribed as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Concerns regarding its bleeding profile persist and require further evaluation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the risks of bleeding and all-cause mortality between apixaban and VKAs. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library of Clinical Trials databases were systematically searched for RCTs comparing the risks of bleeding and all-cause mortality of apixaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) with those of VKAs. We included RCTs conducted in adults and published in English or French. Data were pooled across RCTs using random-effects meta-analytical models. Our systematic search identified 5 RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria (n = 24,435). They included patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 18,358), total knee replacement surgery (n = 458), and venous thromboembolism (n = 5,619). Data pooled across RCTs revealed that apixaban was associated with reduced risks of any bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.90) and a composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.88). Apixaban was also associated with a lower risk of intracranial bleeding (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.58) whereas analyses of major and minor bleeding were inconclusive. Moreover, apixaban was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99) although this finding was driven by the results of the ARISTOTLE trial. In conclusion, our meta-analysis found that apixaban is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than VKAs, providing some reassurance regarding its safety.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^112ZvkJ5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy — post-procedure anticoagulation and antiplatelet resumption — unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be restarted as soon as bleeding stability allows and continued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic; UFH may be restarted 2 to 6 hours after a therapeutic procedure; the 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend delaying reinitiation of LMWH 48 to 72 hours after surgery in patients believed to be at high risk for bleeding adverse events; there are no data to inform optimal timing for resuming non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), and if a NOAC cannot be restarted within 24 hours after a high-risk procedure because of hemostasis concerns, thromboprophylaxis (ie, a UFH bridge) should be considered for patients at high risk for thromboembolism; cardiac acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should not be discontinued in most cases, and other antiplatelet agents should be resumed once hemostasis has been achieved.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anticoagulation management — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption, bridging, and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) resumption — is summarized as follows: In atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on VKA, the BRIDGE trial randomized 1844 patients to low-molecular-weight heparin bridging or placebo starting 3 days preoperatively and continued 5 days postoperatively, with warfarin held from preoperative day 5 through postoperative day 1, and bridging anticoagulation was noninferior for prevention of thromboembolism but increased the risk of major bleeding; a simple DOAC interruption strategy without heparin bridging resulted in minimal time off DOAC with low bleeding and low thromboembolic risk, and among approximately 11% of DOAC-treated patients who received heparin bridging bleeding risk increased without reduction in thromboembolic risk, so most patients with AF will not benefit from bridging anticoagulation. For resumption after interruption, once hemostasis is achieved after a low or moderate bleeding risk procedure it is reasonable to restart VKA as early as 12 to 24 hours and it is suggested to resume VKA at the previous therapeutic dose, whereas DOACs should be resumed when full anticoagulation is clinically appropriate, which may be as early as 6 hours postoperatively if hemostasis has occurred; in the PAUSE trial, DOACs were resumed 48 to 72 hours after high bleeding risk procedures.

### Efficacy and safety considerations with dose-reduced direct oral anticoagulants: a review [^114pb5s3]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Dose-reduced regimens of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used for 2 main purposes: dose-adjusted treatment intended as full-intensity anticoagulation (eg, for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients requiring dose reduction) or low-intensity treatment (eg, extended-duration treatment of venous thromboembolism [VTE]). We reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to understand the scenarios in which dose-adjusted or low-intensity DOACs were tested and reviewed the labeled indications by regulatory authorities, using data from large registries to assess whether the use of dose-reduced DOACs in routine practice aligned with the findings of RCTs.

Observations

Among 4191 screened publications, 35 RCTs that used dose-adjusted DOACs were identified for dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban. Of these 35 RCTs, 29 were related to stroke prevention in AF. Efficacy and safety results for dose-adjusted DOACs in large RCTs of AF were similar to those found for full-dose DOACs. To our knowledge, dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have not been studied as dose-adjusted therapy for acute VTE treatment. Low-intensity DOACs were identified in 37 RCTs. Low-intensity DOACs may be used for extended-duration treatment of VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in orthopedic surgeries (dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban), primary prevention in ambulatory high-risk cancer patients (apixaban and rivaroxaban) or (postdischarge) high-risk medical patients (rivaroxaban), in stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, or after a recent revascularization for peripheral artery disease in conjunction with aspirin (rivaroxaban). Minor variations exist between regulatory authorities in different regions regarding criteria for dose adjustment of DOACs. Data from large registries indicated that dose-reduced DOACs were used occasionally with doses or for clinical scenarios different from those studied in RCTs or recommended by regulatory authorities.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dose adjustment and low-intensity treatment are 2 different forms of dose-reduced DOACs. Dose adjustment is mostly relevant for AF and should be done based on the approved criteria. Dose adjustment of DOACs should not be used for acute VTE treatment in most cases. In contrast, low-intensity DOACs may be used for primary or secondary VTE prevention for studied and approved indications. Attention should be given to routine practice patterns to align the daily clinical practice with existing evidence of safety and efficacy.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to management of anticoagulants, DOACs, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider interrupting apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban for 1–2 days before surgery/procedure in patients receiving any of these agents requiring elective surgery/procedure.

### Peri-procedural management of patients taking oral anticoagulants [^116Ywy1q]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The use of oral anticoagulants is becoming increasingly common. For many years warfarin was the main oral anticoagulant available, but therapeutic options have expanded with the introduction of oral direct thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). Management of patients taking any oral anticoagulant in the peri-procedural period poses a challenge to medical and surgical providers because of the competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Bridging therapy has been used to minimize time without anticoagulation when warfarin is interrupted for invasive procedures, but validated strategies based on high quality data are lacking. Existing data suggest that the use of bridging therapy may increase the risk of bleeding for some patients without reducing the risk of thrombosis. Clinical trials are currently under way to answer these questions. Because the half lives and time to anticoagulant activity of newer oral anticoagulants are shorter than for warfarin, bridging therapy is not thought to be necessary with these agents. Peri-procedural management of patients taking these agents is complicated by the lack of demonstrated reversal agents in emergency situations, although specific antidotes are being developed and tested. Existing guidelines for peri-procedural management of patients on oral anticoagulants highlight the importance of individualized patient decision making and suggest strategies to minimize complications. From a patient's perspective, given the uncertainties surrounding optimal management, explicit discussions regarding risks and benefits of treatment options and demonstration of effective communication among medical and surgical providers are essential.

### NOAC monitoring, reversal agents, and post-approval safety and effectiveness evaluation: a cardiac safety research consortium think tank [^1166M9bE]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) have been approved in the United States for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolic disease. They have been as or more effective than the prior standards of care, with less fatal or intracranial bleeding, fewer drug and dietary interactions, and greater patient convenience. Nonetheless, the absence of the ability for clinicians to assess compliance or washout with a simple laboratory test (or to adjust dosing with a similar assessment) and the absence of an antidote to rapidly stop major hemorrhage or to enhance safety in the setting of emergent or urgent surgery/procedures have been limitations to greater non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant usage and better thromboembolic prevention. Accordingly, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "think tank" meeting was held in February 2015 to address these concerns. This manuscript reports on the discussions held and the conclusions reached at that meeting.

### Perioperative management of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xsBwQ]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving chronic oral anticoagulation therapy and require an elective surgery or an invasive procedure is a common clinical scenario.

Research Question

What is the best available evidence to support the development of American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term vitamin K agonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and require elective surgery or procedures?

Study Design and Methods

A literature search including multiple databases from database inception through July 16, 2020, was performed. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.

Results

In patients receiving VKA (warfarin) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, shorter (< 3 days) VKA interruption is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In patients who required VKA interruption, heparin bridging (mostly with low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of major bleed, representing a very low certainty of evidence (COE). Compared with DOAC interruption 1 to 4 days before surgery, continuing DOACs may be associated with higher risk of bleeding demonstrated in some, but not all studies. In patients who needed DOAC interruption, bridging with LMWH may be associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding, representing a low COE.

Interpretation

The certainty in the evidence supporting the perioperative management of anticoagulants remains limited. No high-quality evidence exists to support the practice of heparin bridging during the interruption of VKA or DOAC therapy for an elective surgery or procedure, or for the practice of interrupting VKA therapy for minor procedures, including cardiac device implantation, or continuation of a DOAC vs short-term interruption of a DOAC in the perioperative period.

### Association of atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulant use with perioperative outcomes after major noncardiac surgery [^113j4L8D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Presently, expert/consensus guidelines recommend that DOAC agents be withheld for 24 to 48 hours before performance of invasive procedures. 21, 22 Notably, these recommendations are based on the largely predictable (but not readily measurable) pharmacokinetic profile of DOAC agents. To date, however, there are no published randomized trial data on the optimal timing of DOAC cessation before invasive procedures or surgeries. Although stopping DOACs for patients at 24 to 48 hours before elective surgery is logistically feasible, it is likely much more difficult to implement such recommendations when patients require urgent, unplanned, major noncardiac surgery. In our study, we observed, on average, a 24‐hour delay from hospital admission to urgent surgery between patients with AF who were treated with and without oral anticoagulation, which may have been driven by physicians' decision to wait for the effect of anticoagulants to be attenuated between proceeding with surgery. In spite of this time delay, the 30‐day mortality and bleeding rates were similar between patients with anticoagulated and nonanticoagulated AF undergoing urgent surgery. Accordingly, our study provided pertinent data on perioperative outcomes of this high‐risk cohort during a time when reversal agents for DOAC were not clinically available. 23, 24

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^113YEN2U]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Following resolution of the bleeding, the decision as to whether and when to restart anticoagulation can be challenging and is often complicated by the presence of extensive comorbidities, the degree of stroke risk, circumstances around the initial bleed and patient preference. Generally, it is reasonable to restart DOAC therapy 1–2 weeks after most mild to moderate gastrointestinal bleeding. The American Stroke Association recommends an interval of at least 4 weeks before restarting treatment after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, but no definitive guidelines have currently been agreed for situations such as the one discussed here. Given the potential for life-threatening complications with both under- and over-treatment, the decision is often difficult.

With the expanding role of DOAC therapy in modern practice, clinicians should be cognisant of the potential risks that accompany what is often a prolonged course of anticoagulation, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities. Reversal agents are licensed and effective but are also costly and may be prothrombotic. Prompt recognition and early intervention can sometimes greatly improve outcomes. Supportive care only is indicated if a bleed is minor. Finally, whether and when it is appropriate to restart anticoagulation is a challenging decision with the potential for profound consequences. Further research is needed in order to construct substantive guidelines.

Learning points

The incidence of adverse effects is lower with DOAC therapy than with vitamin K antagonists. However, the increased risk of haemorrhage — both provoked and spontaneous — is still present.
While reversal agents are licensed for DOAC therapy, a supportive approach may be appropriate.
The decision as to whether anticoagulation is appropriate should be reviewed on a regular basis as the patient's clinical condition changes.

### Clinical guideline on reversal of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with life threatening bleeding [^1127MrCP]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation is essential for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Current guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists in DOAC-eligible patients. The major complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening haemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt haemostatic intervention. Reversal of DOACs may also be required for patients in need of urgent invasive procedures. This guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) aims to provide evidence-based recommendations and suggestions on how to manage patients on DOACs undergoing urgent or emergency procedures including the treatment of DOAC-induced bleeding.

Design

A systematic literature search was performed, examining four drug comparators (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and clinical scenarios ranging from planned to emergency surgery with the outcomes of mortality, haematoma growth and thromboembolic complications. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Consensus on the wording of the recommendations was achieved by a Delphi process.

Results

So far, no results from prospective randomised trials comparing two active comparators (e.g. a direct reversal agent and an unspecific haemostatic agent such as prothrombin complex concentrate: PCC) have been published yet and the majority of publications were uncontrolled and observational studies. Thus, the certainty of evidence was assessed to be either low or very low (GRADE C). Thirty-five recommendations and clinical practice statements were developed. During the Delphi process, strong consensus (> 90% agreement) was achieved in 97.1% of recommendations and consensus (75 to 90% agreement) in 2.9%.

Discussion

DOAC-specific coagulation monitoring may help in patients at risk for elevated DOAC levels, whereas global coagulation tests are not recommended to exclude clinically relevant DOAC levels. In urgent clinical situations, haemostatic treatment using either the direct reversal or nonspecific haemostatic agents should be started without waiting for DOAC level monitoring. DOAC levels above 50ngml-1 may be considered clinically relevant necessitating haemostatic treatment before urgent or emergency procedures. Before cardiac surgery under activated factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, the use of andexanet alfa is not recommended because of inhibition of unfractionated heparin, which is needed for extracorporeal circulation. In the situation of DOAC overdose without bleeding, no haemostatic intervention is suggested, instead measures to eliminate the DOACs should be taken. Due to the lack of published results from comparative prospective, randomised studies, the superiority of reversal treatment strategy vs. a nonspecific haemostatic treatment is unclear for most urgent and emergency procedures and bleeding. Due to the paucity of clinical data, no recommendations for the use of recombinant activated factor VII as a nonspecific haemostatic agent can be given.

Conclusion

In the clinical scenarios of DOAC intake before urgent procedures and DOAC-induced bleeding, practitioners should evaluate the risk of bleeding of the procedure and the severity of the DOAC-induced bleeding before initiating treatment. Optimal reversal strategy remains to be determined in future trials for most clinical settings.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^117JSePC]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative anticoagulants — elective cardiac surgery interruption and laboratory assessment notes that, given the predictable and rather short half-life to NOACs, in the elective setting, discontinuation for at least 2 days before surgery is recommended, with renal impairment requiring extending this discontinuation for additional days in select situations. Literature cites 2 recent retrospective studies confirming increased bleeding complications with preoperative NOAC therapy, with 1 study advocating consideration of longer discontinuation periods before elective cardiac surgery. For emergent care, point-of-care thrombin clotting time for dabigatran and anti-factor Xa assays for apixaban and rivaroxaban can aid in determining the anticoagulant effect, and the use of these laboratory tests is recommended if readily available.

### Timing of surgery for hip fracture in patients on direct oral anti-coagulants: a population-based cohort study [^117JtMWw]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study has been reported in accordance to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement using the STROBE checklist.

Population

Single-centre, retrospective, population-based cohort study of patients on DOAC therapy or standard care involving low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) undergoing surgery for hip fracture from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019. Patients with any of the following were excluded: missing data, age < 65 years, warfarin use, previous major haemorrhage or inherited disorder of coagulation. All patients were followed up for 30 days post-operatively.

Clinical Parameters

The following data was obtained: patient demographics, fracture classification, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classification, time to surgery, procedure performed, type of DOAC, timing of last DOAC dose, use of reversal agents or pro-coagulants and length of stay. The outcomes assessed were pre- and post-operative haemoglobin levels, incidence of blood transfusion, major haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and death within 30 days of surgery. Major haemorrhage was defined in accordance to the International Association of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scientific Committee and included haemorrhage from the gastrointestinal, urinary and cerebrovascular systems. In the event of death, the coroner's report, hospital and general practice records were reviewed to establish the cause of death.

Peri-Operative Anti-coagulation Regime

The administration regime for all medications was based on guidelines from the British National Formulary. All DOACs were stopped on admission and restarted as described subsequently. Apixaban was administered 2.5 mg twice daily to be started 12–24 hours after surgery. Rivaroxaban was administered 10 mg once daily to be started 6–10 hours after surgery. Dabigatran was administered at 75 mg, to be taken 1–4 hours after surgery, followed by 150 mg once daily for 10 days, to be taken on the first day after surgery. Dalteparin was administered initially at 5000 units for 1 dose, to be given on the evening before surgery, followed by 5000 units after 24 hours, then 5000 units every 24 hours.

### Regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy: American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine evidence-based guidelines (fifth edition) [^115SV9wF]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative antithrombotic management for regional anesthesia — ACCP labeling contrasts and conservative intent are highlighted as follows: The ACCP recommends that ticagrelor be discontinued 3–5 days prior to non-cardiac surgery, whereas labeling states, "when possible, interrupt therapy for 5 days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding". ACCP recommendations "have become increasingly more 'antithrombotic' — with shorter time intervals between discontinuation and procedures and earlier reinstitution of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy", while ASRA PM aims for "near-complete resolution of the antithrombotic effect at the time of regional blockade for high-risk (neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral) procedures". As a result, "there are several instances where the ACCP and ASRA PM recommendations differ (eg, antiplatelet medications and apixaban)", and "the intent of these guidelines is to prevent hemorrhagic complications and are therefore conservative compared with guidelines developed to reduce surgical bleeding".

Methods

Patients and Design

The PAUSE methodology has been published. 11 The authors do not wish additional data and methods used to conduct the analyses to be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results and conducting additional analyses.

In brief, adults age ≥ 18 years, chronically anticoagulated patients with AF on dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban were recruited into 3 cohorts. Patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (< 25 mL/min for apixaban), based on the Cockcroft‐Gault formula, were excluded. Patients with cognitive impairment or psychiatric illness that could impair their ability to provide informed consent were also excluded. All included patients signed an informed consent form and patients were only allowed to be entered in the trial once. The study was managed by the McMaster Centre for Transfusion Research, and the institutional review board of each of the 23 participating clinical centers in Canada, the United States, and Europe approved PAUSE.

In the absence of a comparable interruption strategy, the 3 cohorts were managed according to a standardized interruption scheme based on estimated procedural bleeding risk and renal function for dabigatran. The procedure bleeding risk classification was similar to that which was used in the BRIDGE (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery) trial, 6 and is concordant with the guidance by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 1 A complete list of procedures considered to be high bleed risk is shown in Table 1. Procedures with high bleeding risk had a longer interruption and resumption interval (2 days) versus those who underwent a low bleeding risk procedure (1 day). DOAC interruption was longer for patients on dabigatran if the CrCl was 30 to 50 mL/min: 2 days in patients having a low bleeding risk procedure; and 4 days in patients having a high bleeding risk procedure (Figure 1). The use of low‐molecular‐weight heparin bridging perioperatively was not adopted in PAUSE, given potentially worse outcomes on post hoc analyses of large AF trials. 14 Low‐dose low‐molecular‐weight heparin prophylaxis was permitted postoperatively in patients at risk for venous thromboembolism until the DOAC was resumed.

### Edoxaban management in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (EMIT-AF / VTE)-trial design [^112RT59m]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non‐vitamin K dependent oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are increasingly used in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) for stroke prevention and in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) for the treatment and secondary prevention of the disease. NOAC administration is a long‐term treatment for the majority of these patients. 1, 2

Annually, at least 10% of patients receiving anticoagulation therapy undergo diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. 3 The bleeding risks of these procedures vary from minimal (eg, colonoscopy) and minor (eg, phacoemulsification) to high (eg, major surgery). Given the wide range in bleeding risk and the plethora of therapeutic options for anticoagulation, including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), heparin, and NOAC, different treatment recommendations will inevitably emerge. 1, 4

Bridging with low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) could benefit patients receiving VKAs due to the late onset of action of VKAs and its long‐lasting anticoagulation effect following discontinuation; however, in patients receiving NOAC, bridging with LMWH may be associated with higher risks of bleeding. 4 The short half‐lives of NOAC of 5 to 15 hours and their rapid onset of action with maximum plasma concentrations achieved in 1 to 4 hours after administration may allow for brief periods of treatment interruption without the need for heparin bridging. 5, 6, 7 Current evidence suggests that if the bleeding risk is low to intermediate, interruption of anticoagulation therapy may not be necessary. 8 On the other hand, in patients receiving NOAC undergoing procedures with intermediate to high bleeding risk, data on safety and management of anticoagulation therapy are still limited. 5, 7, 8 Secondary analyses of the safety and efficacy of NOAC in patients enrolled in the phase 3 studies who underwent procedures have been reported on several thousands of patients and events (Table 1). However, these secondary analyses are limited by the paucity of detailed information on management of patients who undergo invasive diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and are retrospective and do not allow for any causality to be established between drug management and endpoint. 8, 9, 10 On the other hand, the advantages of prospective studies specifically addressing this question are typically hampered by smaller patient numbers. 5, 7

### Breakthroughs in anticoagulation: advent of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors [^112nKVpw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The oral direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxaban and apixaban that recently have been evaluated comprehensively in multiple randomized clinical trials. Based on the efficacy and safety data from these trials, these novel anticoagulants are disseminating throughout clinical practice for thromboprophylaxis in major lower-extremity joint replacement, acute medical illness, atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndromes. The advantages of the xabans over vitamin K antagonists include no requirement for routine anticoagulation monitoring as well as a fast and reliable onset of action. The first perioperative limitation of the xabans is the lack of a routine coagulation test for monitoring their anticoagulant effect in scenarios, such as the timing of surgical procedures, the reversal of xaban-related bleeding, and the conduct of regional anesthesia. A second perioperative limitation is the lack of fully validated clinical reversal agents although prothrombin complex concentrate, recombinant factor VIIa, and factor X concentrate are options for xaban reversal in life-threatening bleeding scenarios. Given their clinical efficacy and advantages, further xabans are in clinical development, with edoxaban already in phase III clinical trials. Although the xabans have ushered in a new paradigm for clinical anticoagulation, further clinical trials are indicated to refine their clinical indications even further, such as anticoagulation for patients with mechanical heart valves.

ACC 2020 oral anticoagulant bleeding — initial assessment and control of bleeding begins by determining whether ≥ 1 of the following factors apply: bleeding at a critical site, hemodynamic instability, or clinically overt bleeding with hemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or administration of ≥ 2 units RBCs; if yes, the bleed is considered major, if no, the bleed is considered non‑major. For major bleeding, the pathway poses "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" and directs actions to "Stop OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding", with an option to "Administer suggested reversal/hemostatic agent* to control bleeding and stabilize patient". For non‑major bleeding, assess "Does the bleed require hospitalization, surgical/procedural intervention, or transfusion?"; if yes, the actions are "Stop OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding", and if no, "Continue OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding". Reversal options and abbreviations are specified: "Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban)", and "DOAC = direct‑acting oral anticoagulant; OAC = oral anticoagulant, including DOACs and VKAs; PCC = prothrombin complex concentrate; RBC = red blood cell; VKA = vitamin K antagonist".

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^112VPNtG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis — perioperative in patients with cancer: All patients with malignant disease undergoing major surgical intervention should be offered pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with either UFH or LMWH unless contraindicated because of active bleeding, high bleeding risk, or other contraindications, and prophylaxis with UFH or LMWH should be commenced preoperatively. Mechanical methods may be added to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis but should not be used as monotherapy for VTE prevention unless pharmacologic methods are contraindicated because of active bleeding or high bleeding risk; a combined regimen of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis may improve efficacy, especially in the highest-risk patients. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing major surgery for cancer should be continued for at least 7–10 days, and extended pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for up to 4 weeks postoperatively should be offered to patients undergoing major open or laparoscopic abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer who have high-risk features, such as restricted mobility, obesity, history of VTE, or with additional risk factors, with duration in lower-risk surgical settings made on a case-by-case basis. Patients who are candidates for extended pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after surgery may be offered prophylactic doses of LMWH; alternatively, patients may be offered prophylactic doses of rivaroxaban or apixaban after an initial period of LMWH or UFH thromboprophylaxis. Qualifying statement: Evidence for rivaroxaban and apixaban in this setting remains limited.

### Acute management of bleeding in patients on novel oral anticoagulants [^116XBArE]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban) are currently available for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after orthopaedic surgery, treatment of acute VTE, and prevention of arterial thromboembolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. These agents offer advantages over VKAs, including rapid onset, shorter half-lives, fewer drug interactions, and lack of need for routine monitoring. However, there are no established agents to reverse their anticoagulant effect. We review the risk of bleeding with the novel oral anticoagulants and the limitations of conventional coagulation assays for measuring anticoagulant effect. We provide an approach to the management of patients with bleeding complications with evidence for various interventions for reversal, where available.

Study implications for research and practice

Our work has identified the limitations of the existing evidence. Notwithstanding the gain in precision, some of our estimates were based on evidence of moderate or low certainty, partly because of the methodological limitations of the included studies. In particular, our sensitivity analysis with placebo and no treatment as two separate network options found that active agents tended to be more effective and less safe compared with no treatment than when compared with placebo. This finding suggests that lack of blinding might bias outcome ascertainment and adjudication. Only a minority of trials including a comparison with no active thromboprophylaxis used placebo, especially in non-orthopaedic surgeries. Our review identified the need for large trials, especially in those non-cardiac surgeries where the risk-benefit of thromboprophylaxis might be more controversial. There is the need for trials that adopt high methodological standards (including blinding) and outcome definitions for venous thromboembolism and bleeding that are clinically relevant and objective. The ARTS (Avoiding Risks of Thrombosis and Bleeding in Surgery) trial will compare thromboprophylaxis with a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban) versus no anticoagulation (placebo) in patients undergoing intra-abdominal, gynaecological, or urological surgery on symptomatic venous thromboembolism and major bleeding. ARTS will help fill the gaps that our review identified.

We believe our work summarises the current knowledge and can inform decision making, in developing guidelines and in clinical practice. Decision makers can use our network relative treatment effects and combine them with trustful (and ideally up-to-date) baseline risk estimates specific to their population and surgery, to obtain absolute treatment effects for benefits and harms. In the supplementary material (table S13), we have provided examples of these calculations of baseline risks for symptomatic venous thromboembolism specific to the surgery or procedure; most were obtained from an ongoing systematic review of observational studies.

### Direct oral anticoagulants and digestive bleeding: therapeutic management and preventive measures [^114f1i5U]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was an important step forward in the management of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). The DOACs, anti-IIa for dabigatran and anti-Xa for rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, all have a rapid onset of action and a short half life. There is no need for routine hemostasis testing for treatment monitoring of a DOAC. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), DOACs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk 1.25). Withholding the DOAC treatment, evaluating the time of the last intake and estimating the patient's renal function are the first steps in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients without impaired renal function, achieving low coagulation takes around 24 h after the last intake of a DOAC. The use of DOAC antagonists will be helpful in controlling bleeding in the most severe and urgent situations. Idarucizumab is available for clinical use for dabigatran and andexanet is currently being reviewed by drug agencies for rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. It is important to assess the bleeding risk associated with the planned procedure, and the patient's renal function before withholding DOAC therapy for a scheduled intervention. It is mandatory to strengthen the local hemostasis strategies in DOAC-treated patients undergoing a therapeutic endoscopic procedure. Resuming or not resuming anticoagulation with a DOAC after bleeding or a risky procedure depends on the thrombotic and bleeding risk as well as the procedure involved. This discussion should always involve the cardiologist and decisions should be taken by a pluridisciplinary team.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on DOACs, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider resuming DOACs > 24 hours after the surgery/procedure in patients having DOACs interrupted for an elective surgery/procedure.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^114QBnGC]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of PERIXa, the standardized protocol for perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation and resumption, associated with rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 1902 patients with AF who were receiving factor Xa inhibitors and planned to undergo procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, including endoscopy, dental procedures, or ocular surgery, the 30-day postprocedural event rates were 0.1% for major bleeding and 0% for thromboembolism.

Meaning

The findings of this cohort study suggest that the standardized perioperative anticoagulation strategy in the PERIXa protocol may be a safe and reasonable option for patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic medications… [^1136WZW8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Warfarin should be stopped at least five days before the procedure and restarted 12 to 24 hours after the procedure if hemostasis has been obtained. Heparin bridging can occur with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. If intravenous unfractionated heparin is used, heparin should be stopped at least four hours before the procedure and restarted at least 24 hours after the procedure. If low-molecular-weight heparin is used, give one-half the daily dosage 24 hours before the procedure, and wait at least 24 hours after surgery to give the first postoperative dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. If the surgery has a high bleeding risk, wait 48 to 72 hours before restarting heparin to ensure hemostasis. Management of Antiplatelet Medications Continuing aspirin is recommended for all noncardiac surgery. If stopping aspirin, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends stopping within seven days of surgery. P2Y.

12 platelet receptor inhibitors should be stopped before surgery. Stop clopidogrel five days before surgery, ticagrelor three to five days before surgery, and prasugrel seven to 10 days before surgery. All P2Y 12 inhibitors can be restarted within 24 hours of surgery if hemostasis has been obtained. For dual-antiplatelet therapy post stent placement, management depends on the time since stent placement. If the patient is within 12 weeks postcoronary stenting, either delaying elective surgery or continuing both medications is recommended because of the high risk of stent thrombosis. For patients who are more than three months after coronary stent placement, the recommendation is to stop the P2Y. 12 inhibitor and continue aspirin therapy. Bridging these gaps with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications does not improve outcomes.

Because these medications can be held one to two days before surgery and restarted one to two days after surgery, bridging with heparin is not recommended, unlike with warfarin. The other interesting recommendation is to continue aspirin through the surgery because of little, if any, increase in bleeding. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Assistant Medical Editor.

### Perioperative management of patients taking direct oral anticoagulants… [^116Povvu]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Direct oral anticoagulants, comprising apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, are commonly used medications to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Decisions about how to manage DOACs in patients undergoing a surgical or nonsurgical procedure are important to decrease the risks of bleeding and thromboembolism. Observations For elective surgical or nonsurgical procedures, a standardized approach to perioperative DOAC management involves classifying the risk of procedure-related bleeding as minimal, low to moderate, or high risk. For patients undergoing minimal bleeding risk procedures, DOACs may be continued, or if there is concern about excessive bleeding, DOACs may be discontinued on the day of the procedure.

Patients undergoing a low to moderate bleeding risk procedure should typically discontinue DOACs 1 day before the operation and restart DOACs 1 day after. Patients undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure should stop DOACs 2 days prior to the operation and restart DOACs 2 days after. With this perioperative DOAC management strategy, rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding are low and delays or cancellations of surgical and nonsurgical procedures are infrequent. Patients taking DOACs who need emergent or urgent surgical procedures experience bleeding rates up to 23% and thromboembolism as high as 11%. Laboratory testing to measure preoperative DOAC levels may be useful to determine whether patients should receive a DOAC reversal agent prior to an emergent or urgent procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance When patients who are taking a DOAC require an elective surgical or nonsurgical procedure, standardized management protocols can be applied that do not require testing DOAC levels or heparin bridging. When patients taking a DOAC require an emergent, urgent, or semiurgent surgical procedure, anticoagulant reversal agents may be appropriate when DOAC levels are elevated or not available.
