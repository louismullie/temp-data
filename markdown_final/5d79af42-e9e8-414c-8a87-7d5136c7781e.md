## Question

What do you think of this assessment and plan:

1. Left post-auricular abscess.
Patient presents with a progressively enlarging post-auricular mass. Because the mass is fluctuant and mobile, there is greater suspicion for an abscess versus lymphadenopathy. Low concern for deep space infection or mastoiditis, as the patient denies systemic symptoms, trismus, dysphagia, odynophagia, and neck swelling, and there is no auricular displacement.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the assessment and plan for a suspected left post-auricular abscess are appropriate and how to optimize evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about validating the diagnostic reasoning and documenting key exam elements. Then, I should verify risk stratification for deep space infection, including mastoid involvement. Next, I will determine definitive therapy with incision and drainage and consider technique. After that, I need to resolve the antibiotic decision using guideline synthesis and shared decision-making. Then, I should address adjunctive measures, safety netting, and follow-up. Finally, I will assess strengths and weaknesses of the current assessment and conclude with a clear, prioritized plan aligned with high-credibility guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic reasoning: the presence of a mobile, fluctuant mass in the post-auricular area supports a cutaneous abscess rather than lymphadenopathy, which is typically firm and nonfluctuant; that pattern is consistent with standard SSTI teaching and aligns with guidelines that treat fluctuant lesions with drainage as primary therapy, but wait, I should verify that the ear and mastoid are not the source, so I need to document an otoscopic exam of the canal and tympanic membrane to exclude otitis media or externa that would alter management and prognostic risk, as contiguous infection from the middle ear or mastoid changes the calculus significantly; I also need to ensure we record exact lesion size, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, plus objective vitals to corroborate the absence of systemic inflammatory response, because IDSA uses SIRS criteria to guide adjunctive antibiotics [^114AQV9v] [^116isWLf] [^111tWNDR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about low risk without explicitly checking for mastoiditis and deep neck space spread; I should palpate the mastoid for tenderness and look carefully for anterior-inferior displacement of the pinna, which is classic for mastoid involvement, and I must screen for trismus and dysphagia that would suggest parapharyngeal or masticator space infection, while confirming no neck swelling or focal neurologic deficits, including facial nerve function; if there is any diagnostic uncertainty or evolving systemic signs, I need to check a WBC, since IDSA uses WBC thresholds > 12,000 or < 400 cells/mcL among systemic criteria, and absence of fever and toxicity would support low risk but should be documented rather than assumed [^116isWLf] [^116tm9nj] [^111tWNDR].

> I will now examine the definitive treatment decision, and I should double-check that the plan explicitly states incision and drainage as first-line therapy because guidelines consistently support I&D for abscesses; wait, I almost omitted technique selection, but I need to consider loop drainage, which randomized data suggest is noninferior to traditional I&D with fewer complications and fewer return visits, and I should also decide whether to obtain a culture — while uncomplicated first-time abscesses may not require cultures per IDSA, the proximity to the mastoid and auricular cartilage nudges me toward sending purulent material for Gram stain and culture to inform care if the course is atypical or if recurrence occurs [^114AQV9v] [^115TXQa7] [^111tWNDR] [^11537E23].

> Next, I should review the antibiotic dilemma carefully; initially, I thought no antibiotics were needed given no systemic signs, and that is strictly consistent with IDSA 2014, which recommends adjunctive antibiotics only with systemic features or markedly impaired host defenses, but wait, let me verify the nuance because the BMJ 2018 rapid recommendation supports considering TMP-SMX or clindamycin as an adjunct to I&D to modestly improve short-term outcomes, emphasizing shared decision-making; in this post-auricular location, the anatomic proximity to the mastoid and cartilage, any rapid progression, or comorbidities such as diabetes or immunosuppression would tilt me toward antibiotics, whereas an immunocompetent, afebrile patient with reassuring exam can reasonably pursue I&D alone with very close follow-up; if antibiotics are chosen, I should confirm dosing such as TMP-SMX double strength 1–2 tablets twice daily or clindamycin 300–450 mg four times daily for 5–7 days targeting MRSA, with counseling on risks and the small absolute benefit [^111tWNDR] [^111VtADd].

> I need to ensure adjunctive measures are addressed; let me think about analgesia, local anesthesia for the procedure, copious saline irrigation, and wound care instructions; but wait, I should double-check the evidence on routine packing after I&D, and current guidance suggests insufficient evidence to support routine packing in some abscess contexts, so I will individualize packing based on cavity size, loculations, and patient tolerance; I should also provide clear return precautions and observation parameters for new fever, worsening erythema, increased pain, auricular displacement, trismus, dysphagia, otorrhea, or hearing changes, given the proximity to the mastoid and ear structures [^116EywRD] [^111tWNDR] [^116isWLf].

> Let me reconsider follow-up and surveillance because timing is critical here; I should confirm a wound check within 24–48 hours to ensure decompression is adequate, pain is improving, and erythema is not spreading, then reassess at 7–14 days for healing trajectory; if there is recurrence or poor response, I need to obtain cultures and tailor a 5–10 day antibiotic course to the isolated pathogen per IDSA guidance, and I should re-examine the ear and mastoid at each visit for evolving complications [^111LRskt] [^111tWNDR].

> I will now examine the strengths and weaknesses of the current assessment to make sure nothing is missed; strengths include accurate anatomical localization, correct emphasis on fluctuance as a key diagnostic feature, and appropriate initial screening for complicated infection with attention to auricular displacement and trismus; however, I should confirm that the plan explicitly states I&D as required therapy, clarifies the antibiotic decision framework using IDSA and BMJ guidance, documents risk factors such as diabetes or immunosuppression, includes concrete follow-up intervals and wound care, and considers obtaining a culture given the anatomic location and potential for atypical pathogens or recurrence [^114AQV9v] [^111tWNDR] [^111VtADd].

> Finally, I need to ensure the recommended plan is specific and actionable: perform incision and drainage with consideration of loop drainage under local anesthesia, irrigate thoroughly, and consider avoiding routine packing unless indicated; obtain purulent material for Gram stain and culture in this post-auricular site to inform management if the course is atypical or recurrent; for an immunocompetent patient without systemic signs, use shared decision-making regarding antibiotics with I&D alone as acceptable per IDSA and adjunctive TMP-SMX or clindamycin reasonable per BMJ, but if diabetes, immunosuppression, rapid progression, or surrounding cellulitis are present, prescribe 5–7 days of MRSA-active therapy; provide analgesia, detailed wound care instructions, and explicit red flags; and arrange follow-up in 24–48 hours and again at 7–14 days, with culture-directed therapy and further evaluation if recurrence or deterioration occurs [^115TXQa7] [^111tWNDR] [^111VtADd] [^11537E23] [^111LRskt] [^116EywRD].

---

The assessment and plan are appropriate for a left post-auricular abscess, with a clear distinction from lymphadenopathy and low suspicion for deep space infection or mastoiditis based on the absence of systemic symptoms, trismus, dysphagia, odynophagia, neck swelling, and auricular displacement [^notfound]. Management should include **incision and drainage with culture** [^114AQV9v] as first-line therapy, and **empiric antibiotics for MRSA** [^111VtADd] if systemic signs or immunocompromise are present [^111tWNDR], with close follow-up to monitor for complications or recurrence [^111LRskt].

---

## Assessment

The clinical presentation is a **progressive, fluctuant, mobile post-auricular mass consistent with an abscess** [^115BjVXo], making lymphadenopathy less likely. Low suspicion for **deep space infection or mastoiditis** is supported by the absence of systemic symptoms, trismus, dysphagia, odynophagia, neck swelling, or auricular displacement [^113oE8sD].

---

## Plan

### Diagnostic evaluation

Use **ultrasound** [^113xp2b5] [^114qpDDt] if the diagnosis is uncertain or to guide drainage, reserving **CT** for suspected deep infection [^113oE8sD]. Obtain a **pus culture** at drainage [^111LRskt], with blood cultures only if there is systemic illness or immunocompromise.

---

### Therapeutic interventions

- **Incision and drainage**: Primary treatment; send pus for culture and sensitivity [^114AQV9v] [^115TXQa7].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: TMP/SMX or clindamycin [^111VtADd] for MRSA coverage if systemic signs or immunocompromise; adjust to culture results [^111tWNDR] [^111LRskt].

- **Pain management**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs as needed [^115Fetqo].

---

### Follow-up and monitoring

- **Clinical reassessment**: Re-evaluate in 48–72 hours for resolution or complications [^111tWNDR].

- **Patient education**: Signs of recurrence or complications (fever, increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage) [^111LRskt].

- **Specialist referral**: ENT if deep infection, mastoiditis, or recurrent abscess suspected [^112uGYYA].

---

## Conclusion

The assessment and plan are appropriate, with clear differentiation from lymphadenopathy and low suspicion for deep infection. Management should include **incision and drainage with culture** [^114AQV9v], **empiric antibiotics for MRSA** [^111VtADd] when indicated, and close follow-up to monitor for complications or recurrence [^111tWNDR].

### Septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint: Case reports and review of the literature [^116tm9nj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis of the temporomandibular (TM) joint is rare but is associated with a high risk of significant morbidity. We reviewed the available literature regarding the presentation, evaluation, treatment, and clinical course of TM joint septic arthritis, focusing on elements relevant to emergency physicians.

- **Case reports**: In the first case, a healthy 6-year-old boy presented with fever and trismus; computed tomography with contrast revealed a TM joint effusion. After empiric intravenous antibiotics, intraoperative arthrocentesis of the TM joint returned 1 mL of flocculent fluid, which was cultured and grew pan-sensitive Streptococcus pyogenes. He was discharged home with amoxicillin/clavulanate and experienced complete resolution of his symptoms.

	- In the second case, more than three weeks after the extraction of her third molars, an 18-year-old woman presented with facial pain, swelling, and trismus. She was found to have a loculated abscess involving the left masseteric and pterygomandibular spaces with extension to the left deep temporal region and the skull base. She experienced a complicated postoperative course and required multiple procedures and intravenous antibiotics for the growth of multiple bacteria. More than a month later, she underwent TM joint arthrotomy for TM joint septic arthritis and was found to have acute osteomyelitis. She continued to require multiple treatment modalities; 20 months after her initial presentation, she underwent left total TM joint arthroplasty for fibrous ankylosis of the TM joint.

### Ofloxacin [^111MLkBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists following a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of otorrhea occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as cholesteatoma, foreign body, or a tumor.

The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than those given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. Young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.

No signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.

- **Information for patients**: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the fingers or other sources. This precaution is necessary if the sterility of the drops is to be preserved.

### Out of the silos: Identifying cross-cutting features of health-related stigma to advance measurement and intervention [^113bRsJm]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The cross-cutting nature of stigma is evidenced by the measurement methods used and the interventions that have been shown to be effective in reducing stigma or mitigating its impact across conditions. In many disciplines dealing with stigmatized conditions, the problem has been recognized and is addressed to some extent, but often only in a condition-specific manner. One challenge is that funding, research, assessment tools, and interventions often address stigma related to only one particular condition. If measurement tools and interventions that assess and address common dimensions of stigma were possible, the scarce resources to address stigma could be used more efficiently, and healthcare providers could use the same tools and approaches across conditions. Several theoretical models describing common elements of stigma have been proposed, including those by Scambler, Link and Phelan, Pescosolido et al, and Weiss.

### Mavenclad [^117QcJBn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Risk of teratogenicity**: Mavenclad may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Malformations and embryolethality occurred in animals [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus during Mavenclad dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course.

	- In females of reproductive potential, pregnancy should be excluded before the initiation of each Mavenclad treatment course and prevented by the use of effective contraception during Mavenclad dosing and for at least 6 months after the last dose of each treatment course. Women who become pregnant during treatment with Mavenclad should discontinue treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. Mavenclad is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception.

- **Lymphopenia**: Mavenclad causes a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count. In clinical studies, 87% of Mavenclad-treated patients experienced lymphopenia. The lowest absolute lymphocyte counts occurred approximately 2 to 3 months after the start of each treatment course and were lower with each additional treatment course. In patients treated with a cumulative dose of Mavenclad 3.5 mg per kg over 2 courses as monotherapy, 26% and 1% had nadir absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 and less than 200 cells per microliter, respectively. At the end of the second treatment course, 2% of clinical study patients had lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells per microliter; median time to recovery to at least 800.

### Role of thyroid hormones in craniofacial development [^111NKdYS]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2020). Low credibility.

The development of the craniofacial skeleton relies on complex temporospatial organization of diverse cell types by key signaling molecules. Even minor disruptions to these processes can result in deleterious consequences for the structure and function of the skull. Thyroid hormone deficiency causes delayed craniofacial and tooth development, dysplastic facial features, and delayed development of the ossicles in the middle ear. In contrast, thyroid hormone excess accelerates the development of the skull and, in severe cases, might lead to craniosynostosis with neurological sequelae and facial hypoplasia. The pathogenesis of these important abnormalities remains poorly understood and underinvestigated.

- **Craniofacial development and regulation**: The orchestration of craniofacial development and the regulation of suture and synchondrosis growth depend on several critical signaling pathways. The underlying mechanisms by which these key pathways regulate craniofacial growth and maturation are largely unclear, but studies of single-gene disorders resulting in craniofacial malformations have identified a number of critical signaling molecules and receptors. The craniofacial consequences resulting from gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations affecting insulin-like growth factor 1, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and WNT signaling are similar to the effects of altered thyroid status and mutations affecting thyroid hormone action, suggesting that these critical pathways interact in the regulation of craniofacial development.

### Engaging white parents to address their white children's racial biases in the black-white context [^113AZEm1]. Child Development (2023). Low credibility.

We first evaluated the mediation of article type on each dependent variable by bias likelihood ratings for one's own child. Consistent with our hypothesis, bias likelihood mediated the effect of article type on concern about children's biases and on regulatory motivation, suggesting that increasing white parents' awareness that their white child is likely to express racial biases elicits worry and is motivating. However, increasing awareness of children's bias likelihood did not mediate the effect of condition on the other motivational indicators (i.e. interest, compensation). The 95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 5, and full models are available on OSF and in Appendix S1.

TABLE 5
Study 3 mediation analyses through bias likelihood for one's own child

We anticipated that increasing white parents' awareness of their child's racial biases would affect parents' interest in learning how to address children's biases (i.e. participation in a bias reduction study), but it did not. We suggest that awareness may be necessary but not sufficient for taking specific steps to learn how to address children's biases (Monteith, Plant & Devine). In particular, awareness may need to be combined with concern about racial biases to trigger actions to address biases (Devine et al.). As such, we considered the possibility that concern about one's child expressing racial biases may be a more proximal predictor of taking action to address biases in one's child. To test this possibility, we added concern about racial biases in one's own child to the mediation models to test the extent…

### Management of subcutaneous abscesses: prospective cross-sectional study (MAGIC) [^117UV3sc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the management of subcutaneous abscesses through a prospective cross-sectional study status as of the study's execution. The results indicate variations in practice that suggest a need for standardized care protocols.

The collaborative effort for this study involved multiple institutions across the UK. Key findings were contributed by principal collaborators from institutions such as Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, among others. This collaboration leveraged diverse expertise and patient populations to provide comprehensive insights into current practices and outcomes.

The study underscores significant variations in treatment approaches, emphasizing the necessity for standardized guidelines to improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. Continued research and collaboration are recommended to establish evidence-based protocols for optimal care management.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one microorganism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction, it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM.

### Auricular cartilage resection for treatment-refractory idiopathic chronic chondritis: a case series [^114EqpHo]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this case series was to describe a series of cases of idiopathic chronic auricular chondritis refractory to antibiotics and steroids treated successfully with surgery.

- **Study design**: Case series.

- **Setting**: Two tertiary academic medical centers.

- **Patients**: We analyzed four patients diagnosed with chronic auricular deformity, pain, and drainage for a period of 1 to 5 years who had failed prolonged treatment consisting of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and incision and drainage. All four patients were smokers, three were diabetic, and two had a history of bariatric surgery.

- **Interventions**: Operative subcutaneous partial auriculectomy (removal of diseased cartilage and excess skin) was performed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Resolution of pain and drainage, need for additional procedures, and reduction in narcotics required for pain control were analyzed.

Results indicated that two of the four patients were given an immediate postoperative course of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. With a minimum of six weeks' follow-up, all four patients had complete resolution of pain and reduced drainage postoperatively. One patient requiring daily narcotic medication for pain and benzodiazepine for sleep preoperatively no longer required prescription medication. All specimens revealed chronic dermal and cartilage inflammation. Three of four cases had polymicrobial infection, while one case had only skin contaminant growth on culture following multiple oral and parenteral antibiotic regimens.

In conclusion, surgical excision of diseased cartilage as a result of idiopathic chronic chondritis is an effective treatment in these cases.

### Differential effects of salient visual events on memory-guided attention in adults and children [^114FXoAB]. Child Development (2019). Low credibility.

We next turned to our main question of interest: How do memories influence attention across children and adults? To address this question, we analyzed orienting accuracy and reaction times across memory cue conditions and age groups. To determine how memory condition influenced orienting accuracy across age groups, we constructed a logistic mixed-effects model. Our final model included our fixed effects of interest: memory condition with two levels (cued and uncued), age group with two levels (adults and children), random intercepts for subject and scene, and allowed for different slopes for age groups across scenes. A likelihood-ratio test indicated that including age group improved model fit, χ² (1) = 37.6, p. 25.

### Greater auricular neuropathy in Hansen's disease [^117S752b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old Indian man presented with painless and progressive swelling on the right side of his neck for the past two years. He denied a history of neck injury, prolonged fever, loss of appetite or weight, skin rashes, or diabetes mellitus.

Examination revealed a cord-like, nontender swelling on the right neck (Figure 1A), which could be moved side-to-side. Systemic examination was unremarkable.

- **Clinical and ultrasound findings**:
	- **Greater auricular neuropathy (GAN) in Hansen's disease**: Cord-like enlargement of the right GAN was observed. Thickening of the right GAN was confirmed on B-mode high-resolution ultrasonography (Figure 1B). Color Doppler ultrasonography revealed increased perineural vascularity. For reference, the normal ultrasonographic appearance of the left GAN is shown in panel C.

Blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood sugar, and chest X-ray were normal. The Mantoux test was negative. A slit skin smear from the right earlobe showed a large number of acid-fast bacilli in the nerves. The patient refused fine needle aspiration cytology or punch biopsy of the nerve.

High-resolution ultrasound revealed diffuse thickening of the right greater auricular nerve (GAN) with diffuse fascicular enlargement (Figure 1B, diameter 4.6 cm; normal 0.14 ± 0.03 cm). Imaging of the left GAN was normal (Figure 1C). Nerve ultrasound and electrophysiological studies of other peripheral nerves (including ulnar nerves) were unremarkable.

With multidrug treatment for leprosy, the patient remained asymptomatic at a three-month outpatient visit. He did not return for further follow-up.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-E/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^115BjVXo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs, including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles, and they required antibiotics or surgical incision to drain the abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses, which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided into four classes:

- **Class 1**: Patients with SSTI but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or comorbidities.
- **Class 2**: Patients are either systemically unwell with stable comorbidities or systemically well but with a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
- **Class 3**: Patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or hypotension).
- **Class 4**: Patients have a sepsis syndrome and life-threatening conditions.

### Empiric treatment for peritonsillar abscess: A single-center experience with medical therapy alone [^1146d9xE]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the use of medical therapy alone (MTA) with surgical therapy (ST) for the empiric treatment of peritonsillar abscess (PTA).

A consecutive cohort of patients treated for PTA at our institution from May 2013 to February 2019 was analyzed. Demographics, disease characteristics, management strategies, and treatment outcomes were compared between treatment groups. Primary outcomes included treatment failure, defined as the need for follow-up surgical intervention, and complications within two weeks of empiric treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 421 patients, 306 (72.7%) received MTA, while 115 (27.3%) underwent ST. There was no significant difference in the rate of treatment failure between the MTA (7.2%) and ST (6.1%) groups (p = 0.879). Complications were rare in both groups (1.6% with MTA versus 0.9% with ST, p = 0.898). Dysphagia (p = 0.011), trismus (p = 0.045), larger abscesses (p < 0.001), and hospital admission (p < 0.001) were more common in the ST group. Corticosteroid prescriptions were a common component of MTA (53.3%) and less often used with ST (33.9%, p = 0.001). After adjusting for abscess size, there remained no significant difference in the rate of treatment failure between the groups. Univariate analyses demonstrated no significant independent predictors of treatment failure, including age, sex, race, tonsillitis history, smoking history, presenting signs and symptoms, abscess size, hospital admission, and corticosteroid prescriptions.

In conclusion, medical therapy alone may be a safe and effective alternative to surgical drainage for the empiric treatment of PTA.

### Utility of routine blood cultures for upper extremity abscesses [^116DDHkw]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are often admitted by the emergency department for intravenous antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage of abscesses if necessary. As part of the initial diagnostic workup, blood cultures are routinely drawn at our institution in patients with SSTIs. This study seeks to identify the utility of performing blood cultures in patients with upper extremity abscesses as it relates to the number of incision and drainage (I&D) procedures performed, patient readmission rates, and length of hospital stay.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of 314 patients aged 18 to 89 years who underwent one or more I&D procedures for upper extremity abscesses was included in the study. Patient demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory values, wound and blood culture results, number of I&D procedures performed, length of stay, and readmission rates were evaluated.

- **Results**: Increasing age and white blood count were associated with an increased number of I&Ds performed. Obtaining blood cultures, whether positive or negative, was associated with increased length of stay. There was no association between obtaining blood cultures and the number of procedures performed on multivariable analysis. Positive blood cultures were associated with increased readmission rates.

- **Conclusions**: Routinely obtaining blood cultures in patients with upper extremity abscesses may not be beneficial. Obtaining blood cultures is not associated with an increased number of I&D procedures or readmission rates. Furthermore, obtaining blood cultures, regardless of…

### Bumetanide [^115nCATc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Warning**: Bumetanide is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and the dose and dosage schedule have to be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (see dosage and administration).

### Initial yields of DNA double-strand breaks and DNA fragmentation patterns depend on linear energy transfer in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts irradiated with helium, carbon and neon ions [^1145N2QS]. Radiation Research (2007). Low credibility.

The ability of ion beams to kill or mutate plant cells is known to depend on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the ions, although the mechanism of damage is poorly understood. In this study, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were quantified by a DNA fragment-size analysis in tobacco protoplasts irradiated with high-LET ions. Tobacco BY-2 protoplasts, as a model of single plant cells, were irradiated with helium, carbon, and neon ions having different LETs and with gamma rays. After irradiation, DNA fragments were separated into sizes between 1600 and 6.6 kbp by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Information on DNA fragmentation was obtained by staining the gels with SYBR Green I. Initial DSB yields were found to depend on LET, and the highest relative biological effectiveness (about 1.6) was obtained at 124 and 241 keV/microm carbon ions. High-LET carbon and neon ions induced short DNA fragments more efficiently than gamma rays. These results partially explain the large biological effects caused by high-LET ions in plants.

### Intra-auricular sinus: First description of a variant of the pre-auricular cyst [^116gUs6a]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe a rare intra-auricular sinus. An otherwise healthy 15-year-old girl presented with recurrent infections in her right pinna from early infancy. Physical examination revealed a draining sinus which opened to the descending helical limb, while its cystic component was entrapped within the cartilaginous antitragus. Comprehensive surgical excision was performed after the tract and the more distal cyst were delineated. Surgical pathology revealed a true sinus, measuring 2 cm. Follow-up was unremarkable.

In addition to the two previously described variants of pre-auricular cysts — the classic variant (the pit is anterior to the external auditory canal) and the postauricular variant (the pit is behind the ascending limb of the helix) — we suggest a third variant which opens to the descending helical rim.

### Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome [^112Rm7Qj]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Most diseases disrupt multiple proteins, and drugs treat such diseases by restoring the functions of the disrupted proteins. How drugs restore these functions, however, is often unknown as a drug's therapeutic effects are not limited to the proteins that the drug directly targets. Here, we develop the multiscale interactome, a powerful approach to explain disease treatment. We integrate disease-perturbed proteins, drug targets, and biological functions into a multiscale interactome network. We then develop a random walk-based method that captures how drug effects propagate through a hierarchy of biological functions and physical protein-protein interactions. On three key pharmacological tasks, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment's efficacy and adverse reactions. Our results indicate that physical interactions between proteins alone cannot explain treatment since many drugs treat diseases by affecting the biological functions disrupted by the disease rather than directly targeting disease proteins or their regulators. We provide a general framework for explaining treatment, even when drugs seem unrelated to the diseases they are recommended for.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum with complications of severe trigeminal neuralgia [^117U5NaV]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Upon admission, the patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum of the auricle and retro-auricular area, characterized by pustular ulceration under serosanguineous crust at the right auricle and proximal neck along the mandibular jawline. A biopsy from the back of the right ear revealed brisk granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation without vasculitis.

The patient received empiric treatment for neuropathic pain with methylprednisolone, amitriptyline, and carbamazepine. A secondary pseudomonas infection was identified in the wound culture from the underlying purulence, which was managed with gentle debridement, intravenous cefepime, and topical silver sulfadiazine cream.

The previous biopsy results, obtained from an outpatient dermatology office, were reviewed by a pathologist informed of the patient's clinical history. The clinical presentation, chronicity of the ulceration, presence of a ruptured cyst with secondary granulomatous inflammation, and a history of two traumatic procedures before significant clinical exacerbation provided sufficient clinicopathologic evidence to support a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).

- **Diagnosis and treatment**:
	- The work-up for systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as QuantiFERON and hepatitis serologies, returned negative results. With a confirmed diagnosis of PG and secondary severe trigeminal neuralgia, treatment with adalimumab was initiated. Within one month, there was near-complete re-epithelialization of the PG, and as the wound began to heal, there was a prompt improvement in the patient's condition.

### Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome [^111Fzs72]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Complex diseases, like cancer, disrupt dozens of proteins that interact in underlying biological networks. Treating such diseases requires practical means to control the networks that underlie the disease. By targeting even a single protein, a drug can affect hundreds of proteins in the underlying biological network. To achieve this effect, the drug relies on physical interactions between proteins. The drug binds a target protein, which physically interacts with dozens of other proteins, which in turn interact with dozens more, eventually reaching the proteins disrupted by the disease. Networks capture such interactions and are a powerful paradigm to investigate the intricate effects of disease treatments and how these treatments translate into therapeutic benefits, revealing insights into drug efficacy, side effects, and effective combinatorial therapies for treating the most dreadful diseases, including cancers and infectious diseases.

However, existing systematic approaches assume that, for a drug to treat a disease, the proteins targeted by the drug need to be close to or even coincide with the disease-perturbed proteins (Fig. 1). As such, approaches fail to capture biological functions through which target proteins can restore the functions of disease-perturbed proteins and thus treat a disease (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, systematic approaches are black boxes: they predict treatment relationships but provide little biological insight into how treatment occurs. This suggests an opportunity for a systematic, exploratory approach.

### Alzheimer's disease [^114s3VcE]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Alzheimer's disease:

- **Definition**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment.

- **Pathophysiology**: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two primary pathophysiological mechanisms: the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, neuroinflammation, characterized by alterations in the functional responses of microglia and astrocytes and dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease worldwide is estimated at 598.97 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include advancing age, a family history of the disease, and a genetic predisposition, particularly the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, Alzheimer's disease presents with progressive memory decline as well as cognitive deficits with executive dysfunction, language, visual-perceptual difficulties, apraxia, and agnosia. Emotional and behavioral symptoms may also emerge in the moderate-to-severe stages of the disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition with no known cure. The prognosis is typically poor as the disease progressively worsens over time. The life expectancy following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can vary between 3 to 10 years, with age being a significant factor.

### Homeobox transcription factors are required for conidiation and appressorium development in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae [^113Tmrws]. PLOS Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

MoHOX7 is essential for appressorium formation. The deletion of MoHOX7 completely abolished the ability to form appressoria while other phenotypes were not affected. Microscopic examination revealed that wild-type conidia formed appressoria on the tip ends of germ tubes 6 hours after incubation on a hydrophobic surface. In contrast, the ΔMohox7 mutant failed to develop appressoria; instead, the germ tubes in ΔMohox7 elongated abnormally and appeared to have several rounds of swellings and hooking until 12 hours. During prolonged incubation (24 hours) of the ΔMohox7 mutant, its germ tubes grew like vegetative hyphae, with branches rather than repeating recognition steps. Nile red staining of germ tubes of the ΔMohox7 mutant revealed a large accumulation of lipid droplets until swelling and hooking occurred, before switching to vegetative hyphal growth. These defects in the ΔMohox7 mutant were repaired in the complemented transformant Mohox7c, suggesting that MoHOX7 plays a critical role in appressorium development rather than the recognition of cues that induce appressorium formation.

- **Microscopic observation of appressorium development on germ tubes**: Appressorium formation was examined at 6, 12, and 24 hours after incubation of the conidial suspension on hydrophobic cover slips. Black arrowheads in ΔMohox7 indicate the occurrence of swellings and hooks in a germ tube. Upon prolonged incubation of ΔMohox7, its germ tube initiated vegetative growth.

### Ultrasound-guided simultaneous irrigation and drainage of facial abscess [^114qpDDt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The establishment of drainage and the elimination of the origin of infection are essential procedures for the successful management of odontogenic infections. Irrigation and aspiration are considered the two main procedures for the treatment of facial space infections. We invented a new method named simultaneous irrigation and aspiration. The simultaneous irrigation and aspiration method is significantly less painful and less invasive compared with the standard surgical incision and drainage. This method was thought to be useful for managing facial infections if proper patient selection is performed.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium [^112b8vci]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical assessments were conducted within the per protocol population at two distinct intervals: 2 to 4 days post-therapy and 15 to 18 days post-therapy. Patients demonstrating a response to therapy in the initial 2 to 4 days were subsequently observed for an additional 15 to 18 days to evaluate for acute otitis media. Conversely, those identified as non-responders within the first 2 to 4 days were classified as failures at the subsequent timepoint. The detailed results of these clinical assessments within the per protocol population are outlined in Table 6.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, the overall clinical outcomes for patients with S. pneumoniae exhibiting penicillin MIC values of 2 mcg/mL and 4 mcg/mL were reported as 29/41 (71%) at 2 to 4 days and 17/41 (42%) at 15 to 18 days post-treatment, respectively.

### Heterogeneity in VEGFR3 levels drives lymphatic vessel hyperplasia through cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms [^117T6iMY]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The excessive dermal lymphangiogenic growth and branching observed upon early post-natal deletion of Vegfr3 closely resembled the angiogenic hypersprouting phenotype in the retinal vasculature resulting from endothelial Vegfr3 deletion. Blood vessel hyperplasia was linked to increased VEGFR2 protein expression and signaling, thus implicating VEGFR3 as a negative regulator of the VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway. To test if increased VEGFR2 signaling also contributes to Vegfr3 loss-induced lymphatic vessel hyperplasia, we genetically deleted Vegfr2 in combination with Vegfr3 using the Prox1-CreER T2. Loss of Vegfr2 did not cause an apparent phenotype (Fig. 2d–f, Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). In addition, Vegfr2 deletion, using a 3-day (Fig. 2d–f) or an extended 10-day Tamoxifen administration protocol (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c), did not rescue, but rather exacerbated the Vegfr3 mutant phenotype. These results suggest that in the lymphatic vasculature, cell-autonomous regulation of VEGFR2 by VEGFR3 does not explain vessel hyperplasia induced by the loss of Vegfr3. This was further supported by unchanged VEGFR2 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in Vegfr3-deleted LECs isolated from the mutant ears (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. 5) and in Vegfr3-deficient vessels in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 4f).

VEGF-C drives lymphatic hyperplasia in Vegfr3-deleted ears: Detailed characterization of the lymphatic phenotype in the Vegfr3 flox; R26-mTmG; Prox1-CreER T2 ears revealed that the number of blunt-ended lymphatic capillaries was significantly reduced in the central region.

Inform patients switching from a previous oral mesalamine therapy to mesalamine delayed-release capsules to discontinue their previous oral therapy and follow the dosing instructions for mesalamine delayed-release capsules. Patients should not substitute two mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg capsules for one 800 mg tablet. Mesalamine delayed-release capsules can be taken with or without food. Patients should swallow the capsules whole and not cut, break, crush, or chew them.

- **Patients unable to swallow capsules**: Carefully open the capsules and swallow the contents, which consist of four 100 mg tablets per capsule. Ensure all tablets are swallowed whole, without cutting, breaking, crushing, or chewing them.

Encourage patients to drink an adequate amount of fluids. Inform them that intact, partially intact, and/or tablet shells may be reported in the stool. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if this occurs repeatedly. Additionally, inform patients that urine may become discolored reddish-brown while taking mesalamine delayed-release capsules when it comes into contact with surfaces or water treated with hypochlorite-containing bleach. If discolored urine is observed, advise patients to monitor their urine flow and report to their healthcare provider if necessary.

### Changes in clinical and microbiological characteristics of acute mastoiditis in children: A comparative study between 2001–2008 and 2021–2024 [^116f7GrF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

To analyze the changes over the last two decades in clinical presentation, initial management, bacterial etiology, and rates of complications of acute mastoiditis (AM) in children, we conducted a retrospective study including all children diagnosed with AM between 2021 and 2024 in a French tertiary care center. Age at diagnosis, first-line surgical and medical treatment modalities, complications, and bacteriological findings were collected. These data were compared with those of a previously published cohort of AM between 2001 and 2008 from the same facility.

During the three-year study period, 223 cases of AM were included (42 cases in 2021–2022; 104 in 2022–2023; and 77 in 2023–2024). Among the 223 cases, 211 (95%) had a subperiosteal abscess, 65 (29%) an extradural empyema, and 55 (25%) a lateral sinus thrombosis. The main pathogens identified were Streptococcus pyogenes (37%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (23%), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (19%). In cases of AM with intracranial complications, S. pyogenes and F. necrophorum were causative in over 70% compared with 46% in noncomplicated cases (P < .001).

Comparing the 2021–2024 cohort with the 2001–2008 cohort, we observed an increase in the number of cases (74 cases/year vs. 27 cases/year), a rise in the rate of intracranial complications (39% vs. 4%; P < .001), an increase in performance of mastoidectomy (54% vs. 33%; P < .001), and a shift in etiologic agents, with an increase in the proportion of S. pyogenes (P < .001) and F. necrophorum (P = 0.02) and concomitant decline in S. pneumoniae.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurring abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), along with several other bacteria originating from the skin flora. MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

### Ultrasound-guided drainage of submasseteric space abscesses [^113xp2b5]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The oral approach for incision and drainage (I and D) in patients presenting with submasseteric space (SMS) abscesses and marked trismus is more difficult and requires a general anesthetic, necessitating an anesthetist experienced in fiberoptic-guided nasal intubation. In such patients, ultrasound-guided drainage (USGD) has been attempted to obviate this need. The purpose of this trial was to report our experience with the surgical management of 11 SMS abscesses, with special reference to USGD.

Seven men and four women ranging in age from 18 to 41 years (average age, 25 years) participated in this trial. They were initially examined with ultrasound, and their abscesses were subsequently drained under ultrasound guidance using a 16-gauge intravenous catheter. An antibiotic regimen was prescribed, and arrangements were made to see the patients daily for five days. Ultrasound-guided drainage was repeated after 24 hours, and 24 hours later the infection course was monitored in each patient. Patients with nonresolving infection had their abscesses formally incised and drained extraorally. The source of infection was removed as soon as the acute phase of infection passed and the interincisal opening (IIO) allowed. The catheter or corrugated drain was removed when the discharge ceased or became minimal. Patients were then instructed to continue a three-day course of an antibiotic and to return after one week and then after one month.

Resolution of infection was successfully achieved by ultrasound-guided drainage with no need for incision and drainage in eight of the 11 patients (73%).

### Validity of cultures of fluid collected through drainage catheters versus those obtained by direct aspiration [^114XjviW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

To examine the validity of cultures of fluid collected through drainage catheters, we retrospectively reviewed fluid specimens collected through catheters in place for at least 2 days. These specimens were taken from patients at a large tertiary-care hospital. A total of 974 specimens representing 620 patient episodes were received. For 554 (89%) episodes, there was no reliable imaging evidence for localized infection, rendering the results uninterpretable. The remaining 66 (11%) episodes were followed within 2 days by radiologically guided or open aspiration of one or more fluid collections (predominantly in the abdomen or pelvis) near the drainage catheter, allowing comparison of culture results of 59 direct aspirates with those of prior catheter drainage. In 33 (56%) of these 59 cases, matched culture results were equivalent for therapeutic decision making. However, relying on results of catheter drainage cultures would have led to inadequate antimicrobial therapy in 13 (22%) cases, to excessive therapy in 11 (19%) cases, and to both in 2 cases (3%). We conclude that radiological imaging should be standard practice in the assessment of deep-tissue infections in patients with drainage catheters and that direct aspiration of potentially infected fluid collections is the most reliable method of obtaining specimens for culture that should be used to guide therapy.

### Loop drainage is noninferior to traditional incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses in the emergency department [^115TXQa7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

There is limited research on loop drainage (LD) compared to incision and drainage (I&D) for the treatment of cutaneous abscesses. We investigated whether LD was noninferior to I&D for abscess resolution and whether there was any difference in repeat ED visits or complication rates between these techniques.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial, using a convenience sample at an urban academic emergency department (ED). Subjects over 18 years who presented for first-time management of an abscess were eligible. Patients requiring specialist drainage, hospital admission, or those who had previous treatment for the abscess were excluded. Enrolled subjects were seen two weeks after treatment for blinded reevaluation of abscess resolution, and the electronic medical record was reviewed for return ED visits or abscess complications.

- **Results**: Of 2,889 patients screened, 238 subjects consented and were randomized to LD or I&D. Abscess resolution was achieved in 53/65 (81.5%) of patients in the I&D arm, compared to 66/75 (88%) in the LD arm. Fewer patients in the LD group compared to the I&D group returned to the ED for abscess-related management during the following 14 days (37.3% vs. 67.1%, p = 0.002). Among returning subjects, there was a significant difference in mean visits per subject between the LD and I&D groups (0.5 vs. 1.2, p = 0.001). There were fewer complications among LD than I&D subjects (9.3% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Our study provides evidence that LD is noninferior to I&D in achieving complete abscess resolution at 14 days and is associated with fewer return ED visits and complications.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^112j5bxh]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the most appropriate next step in management?

	- A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
	- B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
	- C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
	- D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
	- E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

- **Answers**:

	- A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.

	- B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.

	- C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.

	- D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect.

### What can improve chronic disease care [^115jqsKo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic disease care is a central part of geriatrics. The rise in chronic disease draws attention to the need to find better ways to deliver effective care. This essay examines the effectiveness of several strategies for providing better chronic disease care, reviewing the literature and relying on extant reviews whenever possible. The evidence of effectiveness is mixed; a few areas show promise. The case for cost-effectiveness is even less strong. New strategies may be indicated, including more proactive monitoring of clinical courses and assessing patients' readiness to participate actively in their own care.

### Peritonsillar abscess [^114YnPGN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is the most common deep infection of the head and neck, occurring primarily in young adults. Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of clinical presentation and examination. Symptoms and findings generally include fever, sore throat, dysphagia, trismus, and a "hot potato" voice. Drainage of the abscess, antibiotic therapy, and supportive therapy for maintaining hydration and pain control are the cornerstones of treatment. Most patients can be managed in the outpatient setting.

Peritonsillar abscesses are polymicrobial infections, and antibiotics effective against group A streptococcus and oral anaerobes should be first-line therapy. Corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing symptoms and speeding recovery. Promptly recognizing the infection and initiating therapy are important to avoid potentially serious complications, such as airway obstruction, aspiration, or extension of infection into deep neck tissues. Patients with peritonsillar abscess are usually first encountered in the primary care outpatient setting or in the emergency department. Family physicians with appropriate training and experience can diagnose and treat most patients with a peritonsillar abscess.

### Peritonsillar abscess: Diagnosis and treatment [^112RRDst]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess, the most common deep infection of the head and neck that occurs in adults, is typically formed by a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The presenting symptoms include fever, throat pain, and trismus. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic scanning are useful in confirming a diagnosis. Needle aspiration remains the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of peritonsillar abscess. After performing aspiration, appropriate antibiotic therapy, including penicillin, clindamycin, cephalosporins, or metronidazole, must be initiated. In advanced cases, incision and drainage or immediate tonsillectomy may be required.

Although the incidence of acute mastoiditis has been substantially reduced since the introduction of antibiotic therapy, mastoiditis complications are still commonly seen in the pediatric population. Many of these cases require lengthy hospitalizations and extensive medical and surgical interventions. Accordingly, a safe, effective, and resourceful diagnostic and therapeutic plan must be executed for the workup and treatment of each patient suspected of having acute mastoiditis. With thorough clinical evaluations, early diagnosis, and close follow-up, a large proportion of children with severe acute otitis media or early-stage mastoiditis can be managed in the primary care setting without immediate surgical specialty involvement. This review presents an overview of the anatomical and pathophysiological considerations in acute mastoiditis and offers pediatricians a practical, evidence-based algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this disease.

### Variable relative biological effectiveness of protons in the rat spinal cord: Measurements and comparison with model calculations [^114EX3pm]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides RBE values of protons in the rat spinal cord as a function of LET and dose. The results clearly demonstrate LET- and dose-dependent RBE, and extrapolation down to 1.8 Gy provides estimates of the RBE at clinically applied fraction sizes. Comparison with several variable RBE models provides relevant information on the potential future implementation of a variable RBE model in clinical practice.

### Monodox [^114ov4yZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

As with other antibacterial preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, MONODOX should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial therapy when indicated. Prescribing MONODOX in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Information for patients**: All patients taking doxycycline should be advised:

- **Sunlight exposure**: Avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and discontinue therapy if phototoxicity occurs (e.g. skin eruptions). Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered.
- **Fluid intake**: Drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.
- **Food interactions**: The absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those containing calcium; however, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.
- **Bismuth subsalicylate interaction**: The absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate.
- **Medication storage**: Do not use outdated or poorly stored doxycycline.
- **Vaginal candidiasis**: The use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics.

### Nocebo vs placebo effects: Their clinical relevance [^114C5yJ9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The placebo effect can be defined as any improvement of illnesses or reduction of subjective symptoms that result from interventions possessing no known physical effects. By contrast, the nocebo effect refers to undesirable symptoms or illnesses that follow interventions also lacking known physical effects. It may also play a role in chronic illnesses that lack objective confirmation. Both placebo and nocebo effects can be potent and must be understood by both practitioners and researchers for proper application in clinical medicine. Individual caregivers can apply these principles to modify results in the daily care of patients.

### Understanding the lung abscess microbiome: Outcomes of percutaneous lung parenchymal abscess drainage with microbiologic correlation [^117AX92N]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Lung parenchymal abscesses represent an uncommon pathology with high mortality if untreated. Although most respond well to antibiotics, the optimal therapy for persistent abscesses is unknown. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of percutaneous lung parenchymal abscess catheter drainage after broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy failure and correlate with patient microbiologic samples.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review of patients who underwent percutaneous lung abscess drainage at a tertiary hospital system from 2005 to 2015 was performed. In total, 19 procedures were identified on 16 different patients: six females and ten males. The mean patient age was 55 years (range 22–81). Median follow-up time was 7 months (range < 1–78).

- **Results**: Technical success was 100%. There was one major complication, a pneumothorax. Follow-up continued until tube removal or death in 100% of patients. Catheters were removed with resolution of the abscess cavity in 58% (11/19) or with non-draining abscess cavities in 21% (4/19), yielding a clinical success rate of 79%. Blood cultures demonstrated no growth in all cases, while 21% (4/19) of sputum or bronchoscopic cultures demonstrated growth. In comparison, the specimens from initial catheter placement isolated a causative organism in 95% (18/19) of cases (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: In cases of persistent lung abscess after broad-spectrum antibiotics, percutaneous abscess drainage is highly sensitive for microbiologic sampling compared to sputum/bronchoscopic or blood cultures.

### Notes from the field: Nontuberculous mycobacteria infections after cosmetic surgery procedures in Florida - nine states, 2022–2023 [^117KX8yo]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Low credibility.

Investigation and outcomes:

A case was defined as the isolation of M. abscessus from a wound culture obtained from a patient who underwent a cosmetic procedure at clinic A during August–December 2022. Among 19 reported infections, a total of 15 patients (including the index patient) from nine U.S. states met the case definition. The other four patients experienced signs and symptoms of postsurgical infection but lacked confirmatory laboratory results and were not included in the analysis. This activity was reviewed by the CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

- **Characteristics of cases**: All patients were women, with a median age of 33 years (range = 24–51 years). The median interval from the procedure to symptom onset was 69 days (range = 33–119 days). Patients reported swelling, purulent drainage, redness, or pain at surgical sites. Pharmaceutical treatments for M. abscessus included oral and intravenous antibiotics with prolonged courses up to completion.

### Bilateral external ear canal duplication: A case report [^117K2xWE]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Herein described is an eight-year-old female patient presenting with bilateral external ear canal duplication and a history of postauricular abscesses, otorrhea, and moderate left-sided conductive hearing loss. Previous incision and drainage of the postauricular abscesses yielded little long-term success. Medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a cystic mass in the right ear and postauricular fibrosis, likely a result of previous surgical interventions.

An audiogram revealed asymmetric hearing function, with mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss in the left ear contrasting normal hearing in the right ear, while tympanometry confirmed an intact right tympanic membrane but was precluded on the left due to purulent otorrhea. A head CT scan revealed postauricular soft tissue swelling and well-pneumatized mastoid air cells.

Both ears were explored intraoperatively via postauricular incisions. Surgical excision included removal of a cyst, cartilaginous remnants, and fibrotic tissue. The patient was followed up to assess for postsurgical complications. The surgical site healed uneventfully; no new symptoms or recurrences of past symptoms of otorrhea, cyst formation, or abscesses had developed within the twelve weeks post-surgery.

Although external ear canal duplications are rare, it is imperative that early, accurate diagnoses be made to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. The update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the clinical resolution of AOE.

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is necessary due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. It is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

### Post-auricular teratoma in an HIV-exposed newborn [^112V3WPQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A woman in her early 30s, Para 2, was HIV positive before conception and reported having good adherence to antiretroviral drugs, including tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir. A prenatal screening ultrasound at seven months of pregnancy revealed a cystic mass involving the right post-auricular area, and a plan for delivery at a peripheral hospital was made.

A baby girl was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term, cried immediately, and had APGAR scores of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. She weighed 2.5 kg. Soon after delivery, a swelling was noted at the posterior aspect of the right ear, which was slightly tender. The swelling was a variegated mass that gradually increased in size and produced a foul-smelling pus-like discharge. It was not associated with fever or convulsions, and the infant was breastfeeding normally.

She was referred to our facility at the age of 15 days. Local examination revealed a mass on the right post-auricular region measuring 12 cm × 18 cm at the greatest dimensions, lobulated, cystic superiorly, and firm inferiorly (figure 1A, B). The lesion was not ulcerative or tender. It was mobile with hyperpigmentation of the surrounding skin, and the pinna, ear canal, and tympanic membrane were unaffected. There was no fever.

### Nextstellis [^116WmHcB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Start the first pack of pills on the first day (Day 1) of your natural menstrual period (Day 1 start). Choose a time of day that will be easy to remember.

- **Day 1 start**: Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label strip on the pill dispenser over the area that says: "Place enclosed day label here". Take the first active pink pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. Take 1 pill every day in the order of the blister pack, at the same time each day, for 28 days. The day after taking the last pill on Day 28 from the blister pack, start taking the first pill from the new pack, on the same day of the week as the first pack. Take the first pill in the new pack whether or not you are having your period.

- **What should I do if I miss any Nextstellis pills?** If you miss 1 pink active pill in Weeks 1, 2 or 3, follow these steps: Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take 2 pills in 1 day. Then continue taking 1 pill every day until you finish the pack. You do not need to use a backup non-hormonal birth control method if you have sex.

### Identification of the first ATRIP-deficient patient and novel mutations in ATR define a clinical spectrum for ATR-ATRIP Seckel syndrome [^113nZ8iz]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Additionally, we identify two further SS patients with ATR mutations in two unrelated families native to the UK. Interestingly, despite being unrelated, 27–4BI and 19–8BI carry the same compound heterozygous mutations, possibly representing founder mutations in the UK population.

All four ATR/ATRIP patients displayed severe microcephaly and growth delay. All patients also displayed micrognathia, receding forehead, dental crowding, and microtia with small or absent lobes. Interestingly, an MRI scan of the ATRIP–SS patient revealed an abnormally small pituitary with absent fossa, which could contribute to the delayed growth observed. In distinction to the original ATR–SS patient (DK0064), patients 27–4BI and 19–8BI showed more marked skeletal abnormalities, including digital features and aberrant patellae, suggesting that ATR deficiency can have a detrimental impact on bone development.

Interestingly, aberrant patellae is a clinical feature commonly exhibited by MGS patients, suggestive of a biological overlap between the ATR checkpoint pathway and the replication machinery during skeletal development and maintenance. In keeping with this, characterization of a mouse model harboring the same mutational change identified in the original ATR–SS patient (DK0064) revealed marked bone abnormalities, including kyphosis and osteoporosis. Our findings suggest that ATR–ATRIP SS shows more overlap with MGS than previously recognized. However, whereas ATR–ATRIP SS patients tend to have very marked microcephaly and growth delay.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^112R32bb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In 2014, a 22-year-old Hispanic man from Bakersfield, California, located in the Coccidioides epicenter of San Joaquin Valley, with a medical history of uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed with pulmonary and osteoarticular coccidioidomycosis. However, he was nonadherent to therapy with fluconazole, which was later substituted with posaconazole due to liver injury. The peak CF titer was 1:256. After a year of nonadherence, he sought medical care for left ear pain and purulent drainage lasting 5 days. The symptom onset was gradual, constant, aching, and sharp, with radiation to the left jaw and eye. He was diagnosed with left otitis externa and treated with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin, polymyxin B sulfates, and hydrocortisone otic solutions.

He remained unavailable for follow-up for another 6 months, at which point he sought care for progressive left-sided hearing loss of 1 week's duration and a diffuse pounding headache, nausea, and vomiting for 1 month. A neurologic examination suggested left conductive hearing loss, while results for other cranial nerves were unremarkable. An otoscopic examination revealed that the left tympanic membrane was erythematous and bulging with a middle ear effusion. Results of a lumbar puncture were unremarkable. At this time, the Coccidioides CF level was 1:64. A CT scan showed complete opacification of the mastoid air cell system on the left side, with fluid in the middle ear (Figure 1, panel A). An MRI showed left mastoiditis with an extradural collection of fluid. The patient underwent a left myringotomy with the insertion of a tympanostomy tube.

Ten days postoperatively, he remained symptomat…

### Clinical practice guideline: Otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This update of a 2004 guideline co-developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of consumer advocates to the update group, evidence from four new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials. There is an enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits of medical therapy (e.g. steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and the management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental concerns.

### Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative results of bacterial culture from patients with chronic suppurative otitis media [^114out7W]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Cultures obtained from preoperative middle ear swabs from patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) have traditionally been used to guide antibiotic selection. However, little is known about changes in the bacterial flora during surgery.

- **Objective**: To analyze preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative bacterial cultures of CSOM patients who underwent tympanomastoidectomy.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 244 patients (113 male and 131 female subjects; 252 ears) diagnosed with CSOM between January 2006 and December 2008. Middle ear swabs and mastoid granulation tissue were collected preoperatively and intraoperatively, respectively. We also cultured middle ear swabs from patients with postoperative otorrhea.

- **Results**: The most commonly identified preoperative pathogenic bacterial species was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There were no statistical differences in the prevalence of preoperative bacterial pathogens between patients with and without cholesteatoma. No bacteria were observed in 34.1% of preoperative or 76.6% of intraoperative cultures. Patients preoperatively positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained positive intraoperatively. Of the patients preoperatively negative for bacteria and those positive for fungi, 6.9% and 20.0%, respectively, were positive for bacteria, including MRSA, intraoperatively. Of the patients that were preoperatively positive for bacteria, 16.7% to 50.0% were intraoperatively positive for different pathogens.
