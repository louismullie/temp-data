## Question

How to discharge a pt with malignant effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to discharge a patient with malignant pleural effusion, seeking a step-by-step plan that embeds discharge criteria, education, community nursing, follow-up, complication pathways, and multidisciplinary coordination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-discharge assessment to confirm the initial intervention is appropriate and effective. Then, I should verify objective discharge criteria and immediate safety checks. Next, I will set the community nursing plan and drainage regimen. After that, I need to ensure patient/caregiver education, follow-up timing, and escalation pathways. Finally, I should coordinate oncology/primary care, address special circumstances, and complete documentation, cross-checking each step against ATS/STS/STR and BTS guidance and the ASAP trial evidence for drainage strategy.

> Let me first confirm the foundational inpatient assessments that drive the discharge pathway. I need to check lung expandability and confirm the rationale for the chosen modality: pleurodesis if the lung is expandable or IPC if the lung is non-expandable, failed prior pleurodesis, or loculated, with patient preference and performance status explicitly documented. Wait, let me verify the physiologic predictors: pleural elastance greater than 14.5 cm H2O/L suggests a non-expandable lung and predicts pleurodesis failure at higher thresholds, and ultrasound M-mode basal movement less than 0.94 cm supports non-expandable lung, which would favor IPC over pleurodesis. I should also confirm ECOG performance status and, when useful for planning, a prognostic tool such as LENT, because prognosis and functional status influence the intensity of interventions and the discharge support required, while shared decision-making remains central throughout this process [^111CLoca] [^114spNKD] [^1154FR3r] [^114QgbD3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modality selection without confirming lung expansion after large-volume thoracentesis when expansion is uncertain. I should double-check guideline-aligned choices: in symptomatic MPE with likely expandable lung, either IPC or talc pleurodesis is reasonable; in non-expandable lung, IPC is preferred over pleurodesis; and when pleurodesis has failed or effusions are loculated, IPC is recommended. Let me also remember to document that large-volume thoracentesis may clarify symptom attribution and expansion before committing to pleurodesis, which avoids ineffective procedures. But wait, what if there are only a few septations? In that subset, pleurodesis may still be reasonable, so I need to individualize decisions and record the trade-offs discussed with the patient [^11253BBL] [^114spNKD] [^1118BRxy] [^116Tg58S] [^111aZP8k].

> Next, I will examine immediate post-procedure stabilization milestones before discharge. For IPC, I should confirm the catheter is patent with satisfactory initial drainage, the tunneling site is intact, and there are no early signs of infection or bleeding. For pleurodesis, I need to verify successful lung re-expansion on imaging and that drainage has fallen to a level compatible with safe tube removal according to local protocol, recognizing that strict numeric thresholds vary and that early removal is not necessarily harmful when other criteria are met. I should confirm symptom relief, adequate analgesia — especially after talc — and obtain a chest radiograph or ultrasound as appropriate to document expansion or device position. Finally, I need to ensure a palliative care referral is in place to support dyspnea, pain, and advance care planning given the prognostic context of MPE [^113g8rWT] [^113Cwq3Q] [^115McX1r].

> I will now define explicit discharge criteria. The patient should be hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and on acceptable oxygen therapy with dyspnea improved from baseline and pain controlled. The procedural site must be clean and dry; after IPC, the patient or caregiver should demonstrate safe access and drainage under supervision, or I need to confirm community nursing support is arranged. Drainage volumes should be manageable at home with clear instructions, and there should be no complications needing inpatient care, such as empyema, persistent air leak, or significant hemothorax. Hold on, I should verify IPC risk profiles to set expectations: empyema occurs in roughly 2–3% and cellulitis in about 3–4%, which underscores the importance of surveillance and prompt escalation if red flags appear [^1139pRDB] [^114TLyzE] [^112Z7V2B].

> Now I need to arrange community nursing and support services, because safe IPC management hinges on trained home support. The BTS guidance explicitly recommends referral to community nursing at discharge for early wound assessment, assistance with drainage technique, symptom control, and suture removal if needed. Let me ensure the community team has the pleural service's direct contact for troubleshooting and receives the drainage plan and escalation criteria. I should also confirm that drainage kits, sterile dressings, and supplies (e.g., vacuum bottles compatible with the catheter system) are secured before discharge so there is no gap in home care [^111JT1bK] [^112Z7V2B] [^112oygLZ].

> Next, I should review and prescribe the drainage strategy. If achieving autopleurodesis and earlier catheter removal is a priority, daily IPC drainage increases pleurodesis rates and shortens time to catheter freedom, as shown in the ASAP trial and reflected in BTS recommendations. Wait, I should verify that patient-centered breathlessness control does not always require daily drainage; symptom-guided drainage can be used when the goal is comfort rather than expeditious pleurodesis, and this should be tailored to patient preference. I need to document the frequency, maximum volume per session, and red flags for pausing or escalating care during drainage at home [^notfound] [^116Ff15x] [^112UrKC7] [^116qoiec] [^115Egzdx].

> I need to ensure comprehensive education for the patient and caregiver. Let me think about what must be covered: sterile technique for accessing and draining the IPC, goals of drainage aligned with either symptom relief or autopleurodesis, keeping a diary of dyspnea scores and daily outputs, and recognizing complications such as fever, redness, purulent or cloudy fluid, new leakage, blocked drainage, or sudden worsening of breathlessness. I should confirm that written instructions and emergency contact numbers are provided and that teach-back competency is documented before discharge, because infection and blockage are uncommon but meaningful risks and often manageable without catheter removal if identified early [^115P1A8E] [^1139pRDB] [^112Z7V2B].

> Let me set a follow-up cadence that is practical and safe. Early review with the pleural service at 1–2 weeks helps check wound healing, drainage technique, volumes, and symptom control, and allows early intervention for blockage or loculation if outputs drop or dyspnea recurs. Subsequent reviews every 4–6 weeks are reasonable, with flexibility for clinical changes, to assess for low output consistent with autopleurodesis and to plan catheter removal or adjuncts such as talc via IPC when appropriate. I should also not forget to schedule a palliative care check-in within 2–4 weeks because symptom trajectories often evolve rapidly in MPE [^11567Cb5] [^notfound] [^115McX1r].

> I should double-check that an escalation and complication management plan is crystal clear. Minor site cellulitis can usually be managed with oral antibiotics per local protocols, whereas suspected empyema warrants urgent reassessment, IV antibiotics, and consideration of catheter management. If drainage becomes difficult, I need to verify that simple flushing steps are taught and that there is a pathway for intrapleural fibrinolytics through the IPC when septations impede drainage. But wait, what if breathlessness worsens and drainage is minimal? I should arrange prompt ultrasound to evaluate for loculations or non-expandable lung and route the patient back to the pleural team directly, bypassing generic emergency pathways when appropriate [^1139pRDB] [^1139cUvg] [^112Z7V2B].

> Coordination with oncology and primary care is the next pillar. I need to inform the oncology team of the pleural intervention and the home plan and, importantly, I should not delay MPE palliation while awaiting systemic therapy, as contemporary guidance advises early pleural intervention regardless of intended anticancer treatment. The discharge summary to the GP should specify the procedure performed, the drainage schedule and supplies, the community nursing referral, the palliative care status, and clear instructions for managing common issues, along with medication reconciliation for analgesia and adjuncts [^114qS4wE] [^116q8RDT].

> Special circumstances require tailored planning. For radiologically significant non-expandable lung, I should emphasize that pleurodesis is unlikely and that an IPC is the pragmatic long-term strategy, with counseling about goals and expectations. If the effusion is loculated, IPC remains preferred, sometimes with multiple catheters or adjunct fibrinolytics, while acknowledging that a subset with limited septations may still benefit from pleurodesis. In patients with ECOG 3–4 or a very limited life expectancy, I need to check that our focus is on symptom relief with simple, low-burden drainage strategies, including therapeutic thoracentesis if IPC is not feasible. I almost said surgery is commonly indicated here, but wait, I should correct that: surgery is reserved for selected patients with good performance status, such as minimally invasive decortication or surgical pleurodesis in specific contexts, and is not routine in frail patients with advanced disease [^116Tg58S] [^111aZP8k] [^113mUmqa] [^114Cr9Kd] [^112y17fB].

> I need to ensure the final documentation closes the loop. The record should include the procedure details and initial drainage volumes, imaging confirmation of expansion or device position, a signed education and competency note, scheduled pleural and palliative follow-ups, the community nursing referral with contact information, a written escalation plan for complications, prescriptions for analgesia and any antibiotics if indicated, and communication sent to oncology, primary care, and the community nursing team, with the pleural service's direct contact listed for rapid access if problems arise [^111JT1bK] [^112Z7V2B] [^116q8RDT].

> Stepping back, let me reconsider whether this plan aligns with high-quality guidance and trial data. The approach matches ATS/STS/STR and BTS recommendations on selecting IPC versus pleurodesis based on lung expandability and patient-centered goals, integrates daily IPC drainage when pleurodesis is a priority per ASAP, and embeds BTS-mandated community nursing and rapid escalation pathways, all of which should improve safety and reduce unplanned admissions after discharge [^114spNKD] [^11253BBL] [^11567Cb5] [^111JT1bK].

Discharge planning for malignant effusion centers on **symptom control** and **patient preference** [^11253BBL]. For expandable lung, offer talc pleurodesis or an **indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)** [^1121QxK2] [^114Umwrc]; for non-expandable lung, **IPC is preferred** [^114spNKD] [^116Tg58S]. Provide clear **home care instructions**, arrange community nursing for IPC support, and ensure **early follow-up** with the pleural team [^111JT1bK] [^112Z7V2B]. Educate on signs of infection, blockage, or rapid reaccumulation, and give a 24-hour contact [^114TLyzE]. Coordinate with oncology and palliative care, and document the plan and patient understanding [^115McX1r] [^116q8RDT].

---

## Pre-discharge clinical assessment

- **Confirm diagnosis and symptom burden**: Ensure malignant effusion is confirmed and symptoms are controlled [^114PK7iX] [^116UapwE].

- **Assess lung expandability**: Use imaging or pleural manometry to guide intervention choice [^117PZSRi] [^1118BRxy] [^111CLoca].

- **Evaluate performance status**: Use ECOG to tailor interventions and follow-up [^113mUmqa] [^1154FR3r].

---

## Definitive interventions prior to discharge

- **Expandable lung**: Talc pleurodesis or IPC based on patient preference and clinical factors [^1121QxK2] [^11253BBL] [^115Km6uA].

- **Non-expandable lung**: IPC is preferred; consider pleural aspiration first to assess response [^114spNKD] [^113nJ4qm] [^1118BRxy] [^116Tg58S].

- **Loculated effusions**: Consider intrapleural fibrinolytics if IPC drainage is inadequate [^1139cUvg].

---

## Patient and caregiver education

Patient and caregiver education should include **IPC care** (aseptic technique, appropriate drainage frequency, and basic troubleshooting) [^115Egzdx] [^11567Cb5] [^112UrKC7]. It should also cover **symptom monitoring** for signs of infection, blockage, or rapid reaccumulation, and include an emergency plan with a 24-hour contact for urgent issues [^114TLyzE] [^115P1A8E].

---

## Home care and community support

Arrange **community nursing** for early assessment, wound care, symptom control, and IPC support [^111JT1bK], and coordinate **palliative care** for ongoing symptom management and support [^112oygLZ] [^115McX1r].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **early follow-up** with the pleural team to assess symptom control and complications, and maintain **regular monitoring** to track symptom control, IPC function, and complications [^112Z7V2B] [^112UrKC7].

---

## Documentation and communication

The **discharge summary** should record diagnosis, interventions, home care, and follow-up, and ensure **multidisciplinary communication** with oncology, palliative care, and community teams [^116q8RDT] [^115McX1r].

---

## Special considerations

- **Non-expandable lung**: IPC preferred; avoid pleurodesis [^114spNKD] [^116Tg58S] [^113nJ4qm].

- **Loculated effusions**: Consider fibrinolytics if drainage is inadequate [^1139cUvg].

- **Poor performance status**: Prioritize symptom control and palliative care [^113mUmqa] [^115McX1r].

---

Discharge planning for malignant effusion should be **individualized**, emphasizing symptom control, patient preference, and coordinated care [^11253BBL] [^114J63UL].

### Randomized trial of pleural fluid drainage frequency in patients with malignant pleural effusions. The ASAP trial [^11567Cb5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Patients with malignant pleural effusions often experience significant dyspnea and shortened life expectancy. Indwelling pleural catheters enable patients to drain pleural fluid at home and can lead to autopleurodesis. However, the optimal drainage frequency required to achieve autopleurodesis and freedom from the catheter has not been established.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether an aggressive daily drainage strategy is superior to the standard every-other-day drainage of pleural fluid in achieving autopleurodesis.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomized to either an aggressive drainage (daily drainage; n = 73) or standard drainage (every other day drainage; n = 76) of pleural fluid via a tunneled pleural catheter.

- **Measurements and main results**: The primary outcome was the incidence of autopleurodesis following the placement of the indwelling pleural catheters. The rate of autopleurodesis, defined as complete or partial response based on symptomatic and radiographic changes, was greater in the aggressive drainage arm than the standard drainage arm (47% vs. 24%, respectively; P = 0.003). Median time to autopleurodesis was shorter in the aggressive arm (54 days; 95% confidence interval, 34–83) compared to the standard arm (90 days; 95% confidence interval, 70 to nonestimable). Rate of adverse events, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were not significantly different between the two arms.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, daily drainage of pleural fluid via an indwelling pleural catheter led to a higher rate of autopleurodesis and faster time to liberty from the catheter.

### Diagnosis and treatment of malignant pleural effusion: A systematic literature review and new approaches [^111hpNUH]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a frequent complication in many types of tumors, and its presence indicates a short expected survival. This review updates the knowledge about the diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion. In recent years, progress has been made in diagnosis through the use of new pathologic and radiologic approaches, such as the introduction of positron emission tomography-computed tomography, immunohistochemical marker combinations, and genetic studies to identify malignant cells. Treatment is always palliative. New promising drugs have been tested, but, awaiting randomized studies, talc pleurodesis is still the treatment of choice, although doubts remain about its safety. A long-term indwelling pleural catheter could be a valid alternative to talc pleurodesis in selected patients with trapped lung syndrome (a lung that fails to re-expand after drainage of pleural effusion) and short life expectancy. However, the correct treatment depends on several factors such as performance status, expected survival, presence of lung re-expansion following pleural drainage, and comorbidities.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions [^111MZ4dC]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common cause of breathlessness, indicative of advanced disease. Treatment approaches focus on the relief of breathlessness and optimizing quality of life. A number of recent, high-impact publications provide further insight into the advantages of different treatment options. This article offers a summary of the most up-to-date evidence in this area.

Recent publications have demonstrated comparable pleurodesis outcomes of talc slurry to talc poudrage and explore strategies to combine the advantages of indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) with a chemical pleurodesis. A daily IPC drainage regime improves the chances of pleurodesis success and early IPC removal in patients without a significant trapped lung.

MPE is a diverse condition, with no single strategy representing the 'best' approach for all. Management decisions should be made in conjunction with the patient, taking their views and preferences into consideration.

### To drain or not to drain: An evidence-based approach to palliative procedures for the management of malignant pleural effusions [^114Q2abT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and diagnosed late in the course of cancer. The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients who may have limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits.

We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform the decision-making of patients and families in collaboration with their healthcare practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions.

### Management of malignant pleural effusion in Italian clinical practice: A nationwide survey [^112DMwTf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Pleural disease (PD) includes a wide spectrum of pathological entities with different etiology, prognosis, and treatment options. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is one of the most prevalent causes of PD, and its relative burden is expected to steadily increase worldwide over the next few years. So far, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for MPE management usually require hospitalization, leading to considerable costs for healthcare systems. In this context, a personalized, cost-effective management strategy would be essential to optimize healthcare resources. There is growing evidence that dedicated outpatient pleural services may represent a valuable alternative to hospitalization in a significant proportion of cases, allowing for proper and timely management with a more favorable cost-benefit ratio.

Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic options have significantly contributed to simplifying MPE management. In particular, the widespread adoption of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) has made interventions such as pleural biopsy, tube placement, and thoracoscopy feasible in an outpatient setting with a personalized approach. Moreover, in the pandemic era, outpatient services offer the advantage of easier and safer access to healthcare systems for more vulnerable patients, such as those with MPE, many of whom are immunocompromised and at greater risk for infections.

The main aims of pleural services are to promote hospital admission avoidance and to provide universally accessible and valuable care.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: a systematic review [^112p2BLq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods
- **Data sources and searches**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases for all relevant articles published through October 2009. The search strategy was created together with a research librarian and designed to capture all terms that may be used to describe malignant pleural effusions and pleural catheters. Complete search terms for each database are included in Table 1. We also manually searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies not detected by the electronic literature searches.

- **Study selection**: Studies with and without a control group were eligible if they included at least eight consecutive adult patients with an effusion in the setting of malignancy who received an indwelling, tunneled pleural catheter. Criteria for exclusion were studies of non-malignant effusions, empyema, or chylothorax; studies of large bore chest tubes or non-tunneled catheters; studies in which all patients underwent thoracoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), or pleurodesis; studies not published in the English language; and studies without primary data. If data appeared to be duplicated in multiple publications, only the study with the most complete data set was included, and studies excluded for this reason are explicitly noted.

### British Thoracic Society guideline for pleural disease [^112cDkLw]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

For patients with malignant pleural effusion, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2023 guidelines recommend performing talc pleurodesis, or another method, rather than repeated aspiration. This approach is preferred for the management of malignant pleural effusion, particularly in patients with a better prognosis. It is important to discuss the relative risks and benefits with the patient.

### Pleural effusion: Diagnostic approach in adults [^113g8rWT]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e. infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels.

### The rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for the timing of chest tube removal: theoretical and practical considerations [^113Cwq3Q]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Each year in the United States, clinicians place chest tubes approximately 1 million times, yet there is limited guidance on their management. Specifically, the use of the rate of pleural fluid drainage as a criterion for tube removal is not standardized. Without chest tubes, pleural fluid primarily drains through parietal pleural lymphatics at rates approaching 500 mL or more per day for each hemithorax. It appears that early removal of these tubes is not harmful. A noninferiority randomized trial currently in progress compares removal without considering the drainage rate to a conservative threshold of 2 mL/kg body weight in 24 hours, which may provide better insight into tube management.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^1112o75r]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical practice varies between hospitals. Guidelines should be used to aid treatment decisions, and treatment should be dictated by patient factors rather than by the preferences of individual teams. Patients should be made aware of the benefits and risks of each treatment option so that they can make informed treatment choices. Referral pathways differ by center setup; a sample referral pathway is illustrated in Figure 1.

- **Figure 1**: Example referral pathway.

We unanimously recommend that patients with malignant, symptomatic pleural effusions be referred from oncology teams to pleural services as early as possible to enable patients to obtain maximal QOL benefits from MPE treatment. Where treatment involves an IPC, pleural services can also coordinate home visits for IPC drainage. Patients do not have to be referred by oncology teams; they can also be referred to pleural services directly from primary care. It has often been suggested that early intervention reduces the risk of later nonexpandable lung development. To our knowledge, this benefit has yet to be validated empirically. At the very least, early intervention will provide earlier symptom relief for patients, as will early referral to palliative care services when other symptoms affect their QOL, such as pain.

Ideally, every hospital should have a pleural service or a dedicated MPE unit. For hospitals without such services, the Expert Committee recommends that clinicians map the availability of local specialist units/services to identify gaps in patient care pathways.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: a systematic review [^115S3eKU]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a frequent cause of dyspnea and discomfort at the end of cancer patients' lives. The tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC) was approved by the FDA in 1997 and has been investigated as a treatment for MPE.

- **Objective**: To systematically review published data on the efficacy and safety of the TIPC for treatment of MPE.

- **Design**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases to identify studies published through October 2009 that reported outcomes in adult patients with MPE treated with a TIPC. Data were aggregated using summary statistics when outcomes were described in the same way among multiple primary studies.

- **Main measures**: Symptomatic improvement and complications associated with use of the TIPC.

- **Key results**: Nineteen studies, with a total of 1,370 patients, met criteria for inclusion in the review. Only one randomized study directly compared the TIPC with the gold standard treatment, pleurodesis. All other studies were case series. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 628 out of 657 patients (95.6%). Quality of life measurements were infrequently reported. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 430 out of 943 patients (45.6%). Serious complications were rare and included empyema in 33 out of 1,168 patients (2.8%), pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in 3 out of 51 (5.9%), and unspecified pneumothorax in 17 out of 439 (3.9%). Minor complications included cellulitis in 32 out of 935 (3.4%), obstruction/clogging in 33 out of 895 (3.7%), and unspecified malfunction of the catheter in 11 out of 121 (9.1%). The use of the TIPC was without complication.

### British Thoracic Society guideline for pleural disease [^114Cr9Kd]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, particularly in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend considering decortication surgery to improve pleurodesis success in patients with a non-expandable lung. It is essential to discuss the risks and benefits of indwelling pleural catheter and surgical treatment with the patient and tailor the treatment according to individual circumstances, such as the patient's fitness to undergo thoracic surgery.

### Emerging paradigms in the management of malignant pleural effusions [^116HPoT3]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a common clinical problem in patients with neoplastic disease. The development of MPEs in advanced malignancies can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Predominant symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort are usually debilitating. Given the poor prognosis for the majority of these patients, palliation is more desirable than the cure of an individual complication. Despite multiple new therapies, the placement of a chest tube with sclerotherapy remains the standard of care. The purpose of this article is to review the emerging therapeutic options for MPE management.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS/STS/STR clinical practice guideline [^11253BBL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

This guideline, a collaborative effort from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide contemporary management of patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel developed seven questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) format. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach and the Evidence to Decision framework were applied to each question. Recommendations were formulated, discussed, and approved by the entire panel.

- **Results**: The panel made weak recommendations in favor of:
	1. Using ultrasound to guide pleural interventions.
	2. Not performing pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with MPE.
	3. Using either an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE and suspected expandable lung.
	4. Performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion.

### Malignant pleural effusion: tumor-host interactions unleashed [^115UiJQd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) poses a significant clinical problem. Nonetiologic management is suboptimal in terms of efficacy and safety. In light of recent research progress, we propose herein a new view of MPE development, which may rapidly translate into meaningful changes in therapeutics. In addition to tumor-induced impairment of pleural fluid drainage, pertinent findings point toward another pathway to MPE formation: a vicious loop of interactions between pleural-based tumor cells and the host vasculature and immune system that results in increased net fluid production via enhanced plasma extravasation into the pleural space. The ability of tumor cells to trigger this cascade likely rests on a specific and distinct transcriptional repertoire, which results in important vasoactive events in the pleural space. Although the characterization of tumor-derived factors responsible for MPE development is in the making, an additional, indirect path to MPE was recently demonstrated. Tumor cells recruit and co-opt host cells and mediators, which, in turn, amplify tumor cell-primed fluid leakage and impact tumor cell functions. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that the biologic events that culminate in clinical MPE are likely amenable to therapeutic inhibition and even prevention. In this perspective, the scientific basis for an update of concepts of MPE formation is highlighted. Key questions for future research are posed. Finally, a vision for novel, effective, safe, and convenient treatment modalities that can be offered to outpatients with MPE is set.

### Malignant pleural effusion: Presentation, diagnosis, and management [^114XqEt3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions result from metastases to the pleura, often originating from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, it upstages the cancer to stage 4. Typically presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained, typically via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.

### Malignant pleural effusions: Management options with consideration of coding, billing, and a decision approach [^116e28CW]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a troublesome and debilitating complication of advanced malignancies, with more than 150,000 cases in the United States each year. The standard management approach begins with a diagnostic and/or therapeutic thoracentesis. If the MPE recurs, a more definitive management strategy is often undertaken with several approaches available to the chest physician or surgeon.

These options include repeat thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy with chemical pleurodesis, placement of an indwelling cuffed, tunneled pleural catheter with or without pleurodesis, or medical pleuroscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with pleurodesis. Each approach has unique advantages, disadvantages, and a likelihood of successful symptom relief and pleurodesis. This article provides a general review of MPE management strategies, including information concerning coding, billing, documentation, and a decision approach among these various methods.

### Management of malignant pleural effusion [^111zPbMC]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) often presents in patients with cancer at an advanced stage and thus carries a poor prognosis. This review updates the knowledge on the management of MPE, focusing on recent literature about the efficacy and safety of the most common methods, including pleurodesis by either thoracoscopy with talc insufflation or thoracostomy with talc slurry, use of an indwelling pleural catheter, and intrapleural chemotherapy. Talc remains the agent of choice in pleurodesis, although the use of alternative agents continues to be explored. The choice of procedure to achieve pleurodesis depends on careful patient selection based on predictive factors and individual characteristics. Talc pleurodesis is relatively well tolerated and safe, as is an indwelling pleural catheter, in an appropriate patient population. Because MPE is a common problem in cancer patients, future research with more randomized, prospective designs and innovative interventions is needed.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111ng8mq]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Some patients prefer IPCs over talc pleurodesis because of reduced hospital visits, fewer pleural interventions, and flexible at-home drainage. In contrast, talc pleurodesis may suit patients who prioritize a shorter, intensive regimen or pursue pleurodesis as an important treatment goal. IPC drainage frequency can be symptom-guided or fixed and adapted depending on the treatment goal. The ASAP, AMPLE2, and OPTIMUM trials demonstrated that daily drainage schedules are tolerated by many patients and enhance pleurodesis rates compared with symptom-guided or every-other-day drainage.

There is alternatively the middle-ground option of combined IPC-talc pleurodesis treatment via instillation of talc slurry through the IPC. Combined approaches may maximize the advantages of both treatments, thereby minimizing the time required to achieve pleurodesis. Another major driver of treatment choice is the potential effect of treatment on QOL. In a randomized controlled trial in which patients were allowed to choose their preferred management strategy for MPE, those who selected IPCs were significantly more likely to report improvements in QOL than those who chose talc pleurodesis. However, no significant differences in QOL outcomes were found in the large TIME2 and AMPLE randomized controlled trials comparing IPCs and talc pleurodesis. Similar findings were observed in the OPTIMUM trial, with no significant difference reported in self-reported overall QOL after 30 days; however, QOL scores improved significantly in both groups.

The effect of each treatment on QOL varies from patient to…

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^112s7rkf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation and application of these results must be done with caution given the limitations of our study. Most importantly, the data come almost exclusively from uncontrolled, often retrospective, case series. In the widely used GRADE system, case series are categorized as very low-quality evidence. These studies were not blinded, patients were not randomized to treatment, and outcomes were inconsistently reported. Even among the outcomes that were reported with some regularity, the degree or severity was often not delineated. There is also potential for publication bias, especially at less-experienced centers that have used the TIPC without as much success.

Furthermore, although most of the largest studies in this review explicitly stated that they included consecutive patients who received the TIPC, 9 of the 19 studies did not state this, thus raising the possibility that some patients may have not been included in their series. Potential confounding factors, such as concurrent treatment with opioids or chemotherapy, were not reported. Finally, there is potential for bias in the way our systematic review was conducted. We attempted to minimize this by using a protocol for study inclusion and exclusion and by having two authors separately abstract the data.

While this study provides a suggestion that the TIPC may be useful in the treatment of patients with MPE, there is little evidence comparing the TIPC to traditional pleurodesis, and the patient population in which the TIPC could be best utilized remains undefined. For example, it is possible that patients with a longer…

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice; however, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course.

Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, particularly for patients with malignant pleural effusion, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend administering talc via an indwelling pleural catheter. This procedure is suggested for patients with an expandable lung where either the clinician or patient considers achieving pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter removal to be important.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114oc9Nw]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects up to 15% of patients with cancer, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing. Most cases are symptomatic; the most common symptoms are dyspnea due to compression of the lung parenchyma, impaired chest wall movement, and particularly, diaphragmatic dysfunction. MPE usually represents advanced or metastatic disease, with a median survival of 3–12 months depending on the primary cancer site and other prognostic factors.

The most common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief are therapeutic thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis (talc slurry), or insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) at the bedside. Chemical pleurodesis (e.g. talc poudrage, tetracycline, doxycycline, or bleomycin) or mechanical pleurodesis can also be performed during surgery. Pleurectomy or abrasion pleurodesis is still performed in rare cases.

Therapeutic thoracentesis involves ultrasound-guided insertion of a catheter-over-needle into the pleural space to extract as much pleural fluid as possible. Following thoracentesis, fluid reaccumulates in more than 50% of patients, necessitating multiple thoracentesis procedures. Therefore, thoracentesis is not considered a long-term treatment option. In contrast, talc pleurodesis and IPCs are considered definitive therapies. Talc pleurodesis is typically conducted as an inpatient procedure and involves the delivery of graded talc into the pleural cavity via thoracoscopy (poudrage) or chest tube (slurry) following complete drainage of the MPE and lung re-expansion. Talc pleurodesis is successful in achieving the desired outcome in many cases.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113gjwK7]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

The guidance is more nuanced for cases of symptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) with a known or likely expandable lung. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) or talc pleurodesis (slurry or poudrage) when no previous definitive therapy has been administered. As a second-line treatment for patients with failed pleurodesis, ATS recommends IPCs over talc pleurodesis. Combined treatment with IPCs and talc slurry pleurodesis may also be considered.

Patients with good performance status and a low LENT score (a score of 0–1 based on criteria including pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and tumor type) indicative of a relatively good survival prognosis in MPE may be considered for minimally invasive decortication. Any decision to use IPCs should be based on patient-specific considerations and the support network available for IPC drainage.

The European Respiratory Society (ERS) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) consider both talc pleurodesis (slurry or poudrage) and IPCs to be highly effective but make no recommendations for combined treatment. In the United Kingdom, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) advises offering patients with a known or likely expandable lung a choice between IPCs, talc pleurodesis, or combined treatment as a first-line intervention. The guideline explicitly states that relative risks and benefits should be discussed with patients to choose an optimal treatment strategy, taking into account inpatient versus ambulatory management and the need for further interventions. Patients preferring inpatient strategies are offered talc pleurodesis, whereas those preferring ambulatory strategies may consider other options.

### Pleural effusions as markers of mortality and disease severity: A state-of-the-art review [^115W9y8F]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pleural effusions are common and result from various etiologies. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is known for its high mortality, but increasing evidence suggests that patients with benign pleural effusions also face a poor prognosis. This review discusses recent literature on mortality and prognostication in patients with pleural effusion.

- **Recent findings**: Survival in patients with MPE is influenced by factors such as the underlying tumor type, performance score, and markers of systemic inflammation. Prognostic models have been developed for patients with MPE and those with pleural infections to aid in treatment decision-making and patient counseling. Additionally, patients with benign pleural effusions may benefit more from definitive treatments of their pleural effusion rather than repeated thoracentesis.

Both benign and malignant pleural effusions are associated with high mortality. Prognostic models and studies comparing the effects of different treatment modalities on survival will continue to guide the management of these complex conditions.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^1139pRDB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) occur in up to 15% of patients with advanced malignancies and contribute significantly to dyspnea and discomfort at the end of cancer patients' lives. The standard of care for MPEs that reaccumulate after percutaneous drainage is pleurodesis. Pleurodesis, using chemical and physical agents, has been the mainstay of treatment for decades, but questions have been raised about its safety. Talc, the most effective and commonly used pleurodesis agent, has been shown to have multiple complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, and treatment-related death. There is evidence that these serious risks are reduced through the use of more carefully regulated talc particles. However, pleurodesis is also associated with fever, pain, and often necessitates general anesthesia and a several-day hospitalization.

Since its approval by the FDA in 1997, the tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC) has increasingly been used as an alternative therapy. The indwelling catheter is inserted percutaneously and allows for intermittent drainage at home through an easily managed tube. Shortly after FDA approval, Putnam and colleagues published the only randomized trial at the time of writing comparing pleurodesis to TIPC for MPE. They found that TIPC patients experienced fewer in-hospital complications and a similar improvement in quality of life when compared with pleurodesis, but a lower rate of spontaneous pleurodesis and higher rates of late complications. Since Putnam's publication, the use of these drainage systems has become more widespread.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111aZP8k]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Loculated malignant pleural effusion (MPE) involves multiple fluid collections in separate pockets, often requiring a chest tube in each pocket to achieve successful drainage. Loculations can prevent complete drainage of the pleural space and limit lung re-expansion, often contraindicating talc pleurodesis or resulting in insufficient symptomatic relief from indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Loculations and septations may coexist. Up to 14% of patients with MPE develop symptomatic loculations, and septated effusions may progress to loculated forms.

- **Guideline recommendations**: The guidelines differ in terms of loculated MPE treatment recommendations. ATS recommends IPC over talc pleurodesis because IPC may enable further drainage of fluid, alleviation of symptoms, avoidance of admission, and fewer subsequent procedures. The guideline also emphasizes the heterogeneity within the loculated effusion group, such that patients with few loculations may still benefit from talc pleurodesis. Minimally invasive decortication may be considered in patients with a good performance status and low LENT score.

- **ERS/EATC and SECT guidelines**: The ERS/EATC and SECT guidelines lack strong recommendations, noting that a nonexpandable lung contraindicates pleurodesis and that IPCs may fail to completely drain the pleural space, limiting symptom improvement. Both guidelines suggest intrapleural fibrinolytics, acknowledging their limited effects on dyspnea or pleurodesis success. The ERS/EATC guideline adds that thoracic surgery may be needed for multiple loculations, particularly near the mediastinum, with limited options for surgically ineligible patients. BTS guidelines provide no specific recommendations.

In circumstances involving pleural effusion, particularly in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend daily indwelling pleural catheter drainage. This approach is advisable if the removal of the indwelling pleural catheter is a priority, as it offers increased rates of pleurodesis compared to less frequent drainage methods, such as symptom-guided or alternate drainage regimes.

### Assessing factors that may impact physician-based decisions for placing indwelling pleural catheters [^111JJ2ps]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2024). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a common finding in patients with advanced cancer and is a frequent cause of dyspnea. Guidelines indicate thoracentesis for symptomatic patients, while indwelling pleural catheters (IPC) are recommended for patients who develop pleural fluid re-accumulation. IPC maintenance, however, requires a significant level of financial and social support. This study aims to analyze potential influencing factors that may play a role in the decision for placing IPCs in patients with malignant pleural effusions.

- **Methods**: This study retrospectively collected baseline sociodemographic and laboratory data in patients who underwent thoracentesis for malignant pleural effusion from August 2016 to October 2021. It selected patients who presented with re-accumulation of pleural fluid within 30 days or had a pulmonary physician's note documenting that IPC is a potential management option. Of these selected patients (IPC candidates), we stratified patients who underwent IPC placement and those who did not, and performed statistical analysis between these two groups.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-six patients who underwent thoracentesis were regarded as IPC candidates. Almost all baseline sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity (P = 0.637), sex (P = 0.655), and marital status (P = 0.773), were similar between the two groups; however, significantly higher ECOG scores (P = 0.049) were noted in the IPC group. No statistically significant differences were noted in age, body mass index, platelet count, PTT, or international normalized ratio.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^115wP29N]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

As detailed in Figure 1, the literature search identified 1,011 potentially eligible reports. After reviewing the title, abstract, or complete manuscript, 986 reports were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only two studies that appeared to meet other criteria were excluded due to the non-English language. One of these was later published in English, and this study is included. Of the remaining 25 eligible reports, 6 were excluded due to overlap with patients reported in other studies.

- **Article selection process**: The 19 included reports (Table 2) were all consecutive case series of patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) who received a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC), except for one randomized controlled trial of doxycycline pleurodesis versus TIPC. Only the group receiving the TIPC is included in this analysis. Three meeting abstracts and one letter were eligible and presented sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Eight studies were conducted outside the United States. All except one study employed the Pleurx® tunneled pleural catheter system initially manufactured by Denver Biomedical (Golden, Colorado), a company acquired by Cardinal Health (Dublin, Ohio) in 2006. The oldest study, published in 1994, used a tube known as the Tenckhoff catheter, also a small-bore flexible catheter that was tunneled into the pleural space. One study employed a reusable plastic pump to drain pleural fluid instead of the standard vacuum drainage bottles designed for use with the Pleurx® system.

### Malignant pleural disease: A pragmatic guide to diagnosis [^111Vybmc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of malignant pleural disease is crucial in the care of patients with cancer. A one-size-fits-all approach to diagnosis may lead to delays in care, as the sensitivity of each biopsy modality varies and can depend on the tumor type. This review examines literature on pleural biopsy techniques and proposes a diagnostic algorithm for suspected malignant pleural disease.

Recent literature indicates that the sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology varies with tumor type, highlighting the limited value of repeated thoracenteses in many cases. Additionally, the ability to test for molecular biomarkers on pleural fluid samples has led to recommendations for sending large volumes of pleural fluid for analysis. Studies also support considering medical thoracoscopy earlier in the diagnostic work-up of malignant pleural disease.

The decision to repeat a diagnostic thoracentesis when suspecting malignant pleural effusions should consider the primary tumor type. Open pleural biopsy with medical thoracoscopy has been shown to be a relatively safe diagnostic modality with high sensitivity and should be contemplated in patients with a nondiagnostic thoracentesis.

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^1139cUvg]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

In regard to specific circumstances of pleural effusion, particularly for patients with malignant pleural effusion (intrapleural fibrinolytics), the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of intrapleural fibrinolytics in patients with malignant pleural effusion and septated effusion who have an indwelling pleural catheter. This measure aims to improve drainage when flushing the indwelling pleural catheter with normal saline or heparin saline fails to achieve the desired drainage.

### Pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusions: Current controversies and variations in practices [^113iWQ6R]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common, and pleurodesis remains the best method to control re-accumulation of the pleural fluid. There are few randomized controlled trials studying the optimal management of malignant pleural effusions. A recent international survey of pleurodesis practice has highlighted variations in how pleurodesis is performed worldwide. Future research should target these areas of variation to determine the best practice protocols.

- **Recent findings**: The selection of pleurodesing agents remains controversial. Talc is more effective, but is associated with more adverse effects. Talc pleurodesis is followed by systemic and pulmonary inflammation, which is probably related to systemic embolization of talc following its intrapleural administration, though there are other potential causes that may also play a role.

- **Summary**: The practice of pleurodesis varies considerably among individual pulmonologists and among different countries, in most technical aspects. This review serves to highlight some of these variations in practice, as well as reviewing the literature on pleurodesis practice.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^116q8RDT]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Optimal communication involves a clear, written referral from the oncology team to the pleural services/pulmonology team. The referral should encourage two-way communication by including an invitation to contact the referrer if the receiving department has any queries. Proactive collaboration and communication between referring and recipient services are crucial for ensuring that guidelines are followed and any deviations from the guidelines are appropriate. Subsequent interactions can be via phone, email, or in-person and should focus on addressing treatment issues. The referring clinician must also ensure that the recipient team is adequately trained. Identification of knowledge gaps should prompt clinicians to organize training initiatives led by healthcare professionals experienced in the treatment of MPE.

The pulmonologist placing the IPC should report the details of the procedure, including the amount of fluid drained, followed by specific recommendations on drainage frequency and volume at home.

Unanswered questions:

- **Are there biomarkers that may help predict which treatment a patient will benefit the most from?**
- **Are there drugs that may suppress pleural fluid production?**

Treatments for MPE have seen little evolution for decades. Talc pleurodesis was first described in 1935, and IPCs were released onto the market in 1997. In the coming decade, we hope for progress on several key unanswered research questions, which could be transformative for the management of MPE and patient outcomes.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, has been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease processes.

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^114TLyzE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Although the results are limited by the low quality of the available evidence, our systematic review suggests that tunneled indwelling pleural catheters (TIPC) may improve symptoms for patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) and do not appear to be associated with major complications. Symptom relief was variably defined in the studies, and only one study used validated scales. Overall, 628 out of 657 patients (95.6%) experienced some degree of improvement in their symptoms, although the magnitude of improvement cannot be determined. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 430 out of 943 cases (45.6%); while this is not the primary goal of TIPC placement, it allows for the removal of the catheter and may contribute to symptom relief.

Complications of TIPC use were also not reported uniformly, preventing summary statistics for each outcome. For combined outcomes described in a consistent manner in primary studies, we found that serious complications (those that may require an additional invasive procedure or hospital admission) were rare. Empyema occurred in 33 out of 1168 patients (2.8%), and unspecified infections were reported in 7 out of 346 patients (2.0%). Pneumothorax requiring a chest tube was reported in 3 out of 51 patients (5.9%), and unspecified pneumothorax occurred in 17 out of 439 patients (3.9%). The most common minor complications included cellulitis (32 out of 935, 3.4%), obstruction or clogging (33 out of 895, 3.7%), or unspecified malfunction of the catheter (11 out of 121, 9.1%). More catheters were removed due to achieving spontaneous pleurodesis (381 out of 808, 47.1%) than due to complications (54 out of 633, 8.5%).

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^115P1A8E]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis entail adverse events. A meta-analysis found no significant overall differences in the frequency of adverse events between treatments; however, distinct adverse event profiles exist for each. IPCs pose a higher risk of infection due to prolonged foreign body insertion, with skin or pleural fluid infections occurring in approximately 8% of cases. Although IPC-related infections have attracted attention, they typically respond to treatment without IPC removal. Antibiotics, guided by local sensitivities, can be used to manage infections with case-specific escalation (intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and IPC removal) if the infection worsens. Pleural infections can sometimes result in autopleurodesis. Other minor IPC-related complications include catheter obstruction (approximately 5%) and septa development (< 15%).

Adverse events associated with graded talc pleurodesis include pain, dyspnea, infection, postprocedural fever, tube blockage, and tube displacement. These adverse events occur in < 10% of patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a feared complication due to small talc particles. This complication is avoided by using graded talc.

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis necessitate close monitoring and management of adverse events to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111CLoca]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Treatment decisions for malignant pleural effusion hinge on clinical factors, such as nonexpandable lungs. With pleurodesis contraindicated in nonexpandable lung cases, an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) is the sole therapeutic option, emphasizing the need for accurate prediction. Pleural manometry aids in predicting whether the lung will expand, based on elastance (change in pleural space pressure in cm H2O/L of fluid removed). Elastance over 14.5 cm H2O/L suggests a nonexpandable lung, whereas elastance over 19 cm H2O/L indicates an increased risk of pleurodesis failure. Similarly, thoracic ultrasound is an established noninvasive technique in pleural medicine, and the M-mode measure can assess lung movement. A recent study found that M-mode movement at the lung bases of less than 0.94 cm was indicative of a nonexpandable lung.

Other patient characteristics that can determine treatment choice include:

- **Extensive malignant skin lesions**: These can prevent safe insertion and maintenance of an IPC.

- **Thrombosis treated with anticoagulants**: Anticoagulants may prevent IPC insertion unless they are temporarily discontinued to allow IPC installation.

- **Confusion (e.g. due to dementia)**: This can exclude patients from having IPCs due to the risk of pulling on the catheter.

Conversely, the absolute contraindications for talc pleurodesis include empyema, pregnancy, and uncorrectable bleeding. Pleural infection is a relative contraindication, and talc pleurodesis may be performed in rare cases, such as in patients with a short expected survival.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^112baGcT]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

- **Clinical considerations**: Pleural biopsy may be required to confirm the diagnosis of unilateral pleural effusion with pleural malignancy. The BTS guidelines recommend that patients with MPE undergoing thoracoscopic biopsy should receive talc poudrage during the biopsy procedure. The Spanish guidelines also highlight (though do not explicitly recommend) that pleurodesis or IPC insertion can be performed during video thoracoscopic biopsy. Given the difficulties in distinguishing between MPE and pleural tuberculosis on thoracoscopy in areas with high tuberculosis prevalence, we recommend initiation of treatment for MPE only after definitive confirmation of the diagnosis.

- **Treatment goals**: Life expectancy guides treatment goals; for patients with a very short prognosis, treatment goals may shift from long-term control to palliative care. ATS emphasizes that predicting the prognosis of a patient is challenging for clinicians. Consequently, life expectancy serves only as a rough guide, and care should be individualized on a case-by-case basis.

In most cases, treatment choice is driven by patient preference and suitability for an ambulatory home-based strategy (IPC) or a shorter, more intensive inpatient strategy (talc pleurodesis). In the AMPLE trial, participants randomly assigned to IPC spent fewer days in hospital than those randomly assigned to talc slurry pleurodesis (median, 10.0 vs. 12.0 days; p = 0.03), and fewer patients in the IPC group required further invasive pleural drainage (4.1% vs. 22.5%).

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: A systematic review [^115nPiq3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are a frequent cause of dyspnea and discomfort at the end of cancer patients' lives. The tunneled indwelling pleural catheter (TIPC) was approved by the FDA in 1997 and has been investigated as a treatment for MPE.

- **Objective**: To systematically review published data on the efficacy and safety of the TIPC for treatment of MPE.

- **Design**: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases to identify studies published through October 2009 that reported outcomes in adult patients with MPE treated with a TIPC. Data were aggregated using summary statistics when outcomes were described in the same way among multiple primary studies.

- **Main measures**: Symptomatic improvement and complications associated with use of the TIPC.

- **Key results**: Nineteen studies with a total of 1,370 patients met criteria for inclusion in the review. Only one randomized study directly compared the TIPC with the gold standard treatment, pleurodesis. All other studies were case series. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 628/657 patients (95.6%). Quality of life measurements were infrequently reported. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 430/943 patients (45.6%). Serious complications were rare and included empyema in 33/1168 patients (2.8%), pneumothorax requiring a chest tube in 3/51 (5.9%), and unspecified pneumothorax in 17/439 (3.9%). Minor complications included cellulitis in 32/935 (3.4%), obstruction/clogging in 33/895 (3.7%), and unspecified malfunction of the catheter in 11/121 (9.1%). The use of the TIPC was without complication.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113qmtyJ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain severely affecting the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. Common treatments that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs).

- **Comparison of treatments**: Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstay of treatment but represent very different strategies. Talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by factors such as the patient's clinical characteristics, treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care.

- **Guideline comparison**: We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment.

- **Challenging treatment scenarios and recommendations**: We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients.

There are barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefit.

### British Thoracic Society guideline for pleural disease [^116Tg58S]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding pleural effusion, especially for patients with malignant pleural effusion, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the placement of an indwelling pleural catheter over talc pleurodesis. This recommendation applies to patients with a radiologically significant (> 25%) non-expandable lung that requires intervention for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS/STS/STR clinical practice guideline [^1118BRxy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pleural effusion, particularly in patients with malignant pleural effusion, the ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines recommend considering large-volume thoracentesis. This procedure is advised for patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion if there is uncertainty about whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion, and/or if the lung is expandable. The latter consideration is important if pleurodesis is contemplated, as it helps assess lung expansion.

### Treatment options for malignant pleural effusion [^114R2BKo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Thirty percent of lung cancers eventually result in malignant pleural effusion (MPE). The devastating consequences of MPE, such as dyspnea and cough, severely deteriorate the quality of life of these patients. Malignant pleural effusion portends a dismal prognosis of less than 6-month longevity, with the exception of breast and ovarian cancer. Given the poor prognosis of the majority of these patients, palliation, rather than cure, should be the goal of therapy.

- **Recent findings**: Chest tube insertion and sclerotherapy remain the standard of care. Emerging therapeutic options such as medical pleuroscopy and indwelling pleural catheters offer cost-effective and outpatient treatments for MPE.

- **Summary**: The medical, economic, and social aspects of different options for the management of MPE are discussed.

### Malignant pleural effusions: Treatment with tunneled long-term drainage catheters [^114hiA9y]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a significant cause of morbidity and a poor prognostic indicator. Traditional treatments have variable success and significant drawbacks, including a prolonged hospital stay. Alternatively, a tunneled pleural catheter permits long-term drainage as an outpatient, cost-effectively controlling the effusion and related symptoms in over 80 to 90% of patients. Other advantages include the ability to treat trapped lungs and large locules. Spontaneous pleurodesis may occur in over 40% of patients, and the catheter can be used to administer sclerosant or antineoplastic agents. Complications tend to be minor and easily managed. A tunneled pleural catheter should be considered for all patients with malignant pleural effusions who have a reasonable expectancy of being an outpatient.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113mUmqa]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Spanish guidelines systematically consider the ECOG performance status in treatment decisions. For patients with severe impairment (ECOG 3–4), IPCs are recommended as a first-line option, with or without talc slurry pleurodesis. If IPC placement is not feasible, therapeutic thoracentesis is recommended. For patients with mild to moderate impairment (ECOG 0–2), talc slurry pleurodesis (provided that the lung is expandable) or IPC is recommended as the first-line treatment. If talc slurry pleurodesis fails, IPC is advised instead of repeated pleurodesis. When IPC placement is not feasible, talc poudrage pleurodesis is recommended.

All four guidelines mention that performance status can be helpful in planning treatment. Although Spanish guidelines systematically apply performance status to guide decisions, in other regions it is considered as additional information to assess patient prognosis. Under all four guidelines, if a patient has a very poor performance status and therefore poor prognosis, they will likely not benefit from definitive treatments (chemical pleurodesis, IPC, or surgery) and will be offered best supportive care, including thoracentesis.

- **Shared decision making**: Patient involvement in the decision-making process is crucial to ensure the best treatment option for a particular person. Patients should be provided with clear information in their preferred format (e.g. spoken, written, via a translator, website links) about each treatment so that they can make informed choices based on their own preferences, treatment goals, and the risk-benefit profile of the options available.

Anticancer treatment

Controversy surrounds the effect of chemotherapy on malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Although some oncologists believe that targeted therapies or chemotherapy can resolve MPE, no randomized controlled trials have compared them with treatments (indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and/or talc pleurodesis). Clinical observations and case reports have suggested that chemotherapy may reduce pleural effusion. However, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), Spanish Society of Thoracic Surgery (SECT), and British Thoracic Society (BTS) all recommend not to delay treatment for MPE until after systemic anticancer treatment because there is no strong evidence that systemic anticancer treatments improve MPE and treatments for MPE are safe and effective. Studies highlight the need for early pleural intervention regardless of tumor type or intended treatment; therefore, treatment for MPE should be initiated as early as possible.

Some oncologists are concerned that the risk of infection is increased when IPCs are used simultaneously with chemotherapy, whereas others are concerned about unknown interactions between anticancer treatments and IPCs. However, evidence does not support these concerns. IPCs do not increase the risk of infection in most cases; therefore, chemotherapy should not be withheld from patients with an IPC. Furthermore, the infection rate is similar in patients with or without neutropenia receiving chemotherapy; therefore, neutropenia should not contraindicate simultaneous treatment with chemotherapy and IPC. Drugs can cause adverse pulmonary effects, including pulmonary damage or pleural effusion, but these are rare and can be monitored for early identification and management.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^112oygLZ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Installation of an IPC is usually an ambulatory procedure involving the insertion of a tube attached to a one-way valve into the pleural space, allowing fluid to be drained from the pleural cavity as needed. Community nurses and caregivers are typically assigned to undertake regular fluid drainage at the patient's home. Approximately 50% of patients achieve autopleurodesis after 3 months of treatment with daily drainage using an IPC.

Surgical interventions have similar efficacy to talc pleurodesis but are much more invasive. Therefore, surgery is typically reserved for unusual cases in which talc pleurodesis or IPC placement is not possible.

The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life (QOL), prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. There are no differences in the mean efficacy between talc pleurodesis and IPCs in reducing breathlessness. In the TIME2 trial, Davies et al. randomly assigned patients to receive IPC or inpatient talc slurry pleurodesis and found no significant difference in the primary outcome of dyspnea scores at 6 weeks. Similarly, the AMPLE randomized controlled trial found that IPC or talc slurry resulted in sustained improvements in breathlessness and QOL scores, with no difference between the two treatment arms. Furthermore, the OPTIMUM trial found no significant differences in patient-reported global health status (measured by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30) at 1 month between IPC and talc slurry pleurodesis.

### Impact of a pleural care program on the management of patients with malignant pleural effusions [^112M2GRT]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are common and associated with a poor prognosis. Yet, many patients face suboptimal management characterized by repeated, nondefinitive therapeutic procedures and potentially avoidable hospital admissions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective comparison of patients who underwent a definitive palliative intervention for MPE (indwelling pleural catheter or pleurodesis) at our center, before and after the implementation of a pleural care program. Targeted interventions included staff education, establishment of formal pleural drainage policies, a pleural clinic with weekday walk-in capacity, and a rapid access pathway for oncology patients. Outcomes assessed were the proportion of emergency room (ER) presentations, hospitalizations, number of nondefinitive pleural procedures, and time-to-definitive palliative procedure.

- **Results**: A total of 144 patients were included: 69 in the preintervention group and 75 in the postintervention group. Although there was no difference in the proportion of ER presentations before and after interventions (43.5% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.56), hospital admissions declined significantly (47.8% vs. 24.0%, P = 0.003). The proportion of patients undergoing chest drain insertion decreased significantly (46.4% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.001), with a stable low number of nondefinitive procedures per patient (1.6 ± 1.1 vs. 1.3 ± 0.9, P = 0.32). A 7-day decrease in median time from presentation to definitive palliative procedure (P = 0.05) was observed.

- **Conclusion**: A targeted pleural care program improved MPE palliation through reduced unnecessary procedures and hospital admissions.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusions [^114PK7iX]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Roughly 150,000 malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are diagnosed in the United States each year. The majority of cases are caused by lung and breast cancer, and since MPE represents advanced disease, the prognosis is generally poor.

In this article, we review the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and prognosis of MPE. We then discuss the approach to diagnosis of MPE, including the role of imaging, pleural fluid analysis, and medical thoracoscopy. Management strategies for symptomatic MPE include repeated thoracentesis for patients with very limited life expectancy, as well as more definitive procedures such as chemical pleurodesis, tunneled indwelling pleural catheters, and novel combined approaches. The choice of intervention is guided by the efficacy, local expertise, and risk, as well as patient factors and preferences.

### Efficacy and safety of tunneled pleural catheters in adults with malignant pleural effusions: a systematic review [^1114kfJi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The presence of a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) portends a poor prognosis for cancer patients, with a median survival of 4.0 months. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for lung cancer has recently been revised to reflect this. Given the limited life expectancy, treatment for MPE is often individualized to each patient's clinical characteristics and goals of care. While repeated therapeutic thoracentesis may provide sufficient symptomatic relief in some patients, others have a pleural effusion that is so large and rapidly accumulating that a more permanent intervention is required.

Due to his high operative risk, the patient with metastatic lung cancer described in the case presentation was not a good candidate for chemical or mechanical pleurodesis, the traditional standard of care for MPE. Data on the use of the tunneled intrapleural catheter (TIPC) for the treatment of MPE have been accumulating over the past 15 years. Prior reviews of the TIPC have included only a few select articles and focus on data from the largest centers. To our knowledge, this report, which draws studies from multiple databases and includes a total of 1,370 patients, is the most rigorous and complete review published on this topic.
