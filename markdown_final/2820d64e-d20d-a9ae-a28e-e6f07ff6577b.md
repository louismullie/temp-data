## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of scarlet fever in adults (mild-to-moderate + streptococcal)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating mild-to-moderate scarlet fever in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the pathogen. Then, I should verify first-line therapy choices and why they are preferred. Next, I will extract adult dosing regimens for penicillin V and amoxicillin, including frequency and duration. After that, I should consider alternatives for penicillin allergy and their dosing. Finally, I will double-check special situations, adherence and follow-up, and reconcile any conflicting sources before concluding with a concise, practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and the causative organism. Scarlet fever is a toxin-mediated manifestation of group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) pharyngitis, so the treatment principles mirror those for GAS pharyngitis, with the goals of shortening illness, reducing transmission, and preventing complications such as rheumatic fever and invasive disease, which is why antibiotics are indicated once GAS is confirmed or strongly suspected in the right clinical context [^17a37ccc] [^34150006].

> I need to verify first-line therapy. Penicillin or amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for scarlet fever because GAS has never demonstrated clinically relevant resistance to beta-lactams, and these agents are effective, safe, and cost-efficient. Guidelines consistently prioritize penicillin or amoxicillin over alternatives unless there is a compelling reason to choose otherwise [^17a37ccc] [^34150006] [^cf7c7652].

> Now, let me extract the adult dosing for penicillin V. Multiple FDA labels consistently recommend penicillin V potassium 125–250 mg orally every 6–8 hours for 10 days for mild-to-moderate streptococcal infections, including scarlet fever. This aligns with CDC guidance for adults using 250 mg four times daily or 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, which are equivalent total daily exposures and acceptable alternatives [^3b6d39e3] [^5eab3508] [^17a37ccc] [^34150006].

> Wait, let me verify the amoxicillin options for adults. The FDA labeling for GAS pharyngitis supports amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg three times daily for 10 days, with the caveat to continue at least 48–72 hours after symptom resolution; CDC pediatric-focused guidance also emphasizes 10-day total therapy for GAS, which is extrapolated to adults for scarlet fever given the same pathogen and objectives [^06dea832] [^17a37ccc] [^34150006].

> Hold on, I should verify duration. I initially thought a 5-day penicillin V regimen might suffice based on randomized data in GAS tonsillopharyngitis, but wait, let me reconsider — those 5-day regimens used higher-frequency dosing and were studied in specific populations; for scarlet fever, current U.S. guidance still recommends 10 days to ensure eradication and prevent rheumatic sequelae, so I should adhere to the 10-day course for adults unless following a protocolized shorter-course strategy with close follow-up [^2e9eaee5] [^17a37ccc] [^34150006].

> Next, I should review alternatives for penicillin allergy. For non-anaphylactic reactions, first-generation cephalosporins such as cephalexin are reasonable. For anaphylaxis, avoid beta-lactams and consider clindamycin or a macrolide, but I need to check local resistance patterns because macrolide resistance in GAS can be substantial in some regions, which can limit effectiveness and should guide empiric choices [^17a37ccc] [^34150006] [^388f7fa0].

> I will now examine special situations. If adherence is a concern, a single intramuscular dose of benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units is an effective alternative that ensures completion; however, I should confirm that this is appropriate for mild-to-moderate disease without systemic toxicity or bacteremia, and reserve parenteral therapy for selected cases or when oral therapy is not feasible [^62cdc7ba] [^d8f476e4] [^17a37ccc].

> Let me think about supportive care and public health steps. Patients are generally considered noncontagious after 24 hours of appropriate antibiotics; I should advise isolation until that threshold and ensure close contacts are educated about signs of invasive GAS, especially in households with high-risk individuals, given the small but real increased risk of secondary invasive disease among contacts of scarlet fever cases [^17a37ccc] [^765dfde5].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or worsen despite therapy. I should double-check for adherence, consider alternative diagnoses such as Arcanobacterium haemolyticum or viral pharyngitis, and reassess for complications like peritonsillar abscess; if GAS is still suspected, repeating testing or switching to an alternative agent with different pharmacokinetics may be reasonable, guided by culture if available [^e88f4e9a] [^6d22da7c].

> Finalizing the recommendation, I should confirm the practical choices. For an adult with mild-to-moderate scarlet fever, use penicillin V 250 mg four times daily for 10 days or 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, or amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days or 250 mg three times daily for 10 days, ensuring a total of 10 days of therapy and at least 48–72 hours of treatment after symptom resolution; if adherence is problematic, consider benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units IM once, and tailor alternatives to allergy phenotype and local resistance data [^3b6d39e3] [^5eab3508] [^17a37ccc] [^34150006] [^62cdc7ba].

The recommended treatment for mild-to-moderate scarlet fever in adults is **penicillin V 500 mg orally twice daily or 250 mg four times daily for 10 days** [^3b6d39e3] [^17a37ccc]. Alternatively, **amoxicillin 500 mg orally twice daily or 250 mg three times daily for 10 days** is acceptable [^06dea832] [^17a37ccc]. For penicillin-allergic patients, use azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 5 days [^notfound], clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, or clindamycin 300 mg three times daily for 10 days [^notfound]. Treatment should be continued for a full 10 days to prevent complications such as rheumatic fever [^e617af44].

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | 500 mg orally twice daily or 250 mg four times daily | 10 days [^3b6d39e3] [^17a37ccc] |
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally twice daily or 250 mg three times daily | 10 days [^06dea832] [^17a37ccc] |
| Azithromycin (for penicillin allergy) | 500 mg orally once daily | 5 days [^notfound] |
| Clarithromycin (for penicillin allergy) | 500 mg orally twice daily | 10 days [^notfound] |
| Clindamycin (for penicillin allergy) | 300 mg orally three times daily | 10 days [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Penicillin allergy**: For patients with a true penicillin allergy, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) or clindamycin are appropriate alternatives [^17a37ccc].
- **Adherence**: Once-daily regimens (e.g. azithromycin) may improve adherence, but penicillin V and amoxicillin remain first-line due to efficacy and safety [^cf7c7652].
- **Complications**: Untreated or inadequately treated scarlet fever can lead to rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, and invasive infections [^74f1de0e].

---

## Conclusion

Penicillin V or amoxicillin for 10 days is **first-line therapy** for mild-to-moderate scarlet fever in adults [^17a37ccc]. Macrolides or clindamycin are alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients [^dcca719b]. Completing the full 10-day course is essential to prevent complications [^e617af44].

Scarlet fever, an infection caused by toxin-producing strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, was associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality when epidemics were common in the 18 th and 19 th centuries throughout Europe and the USA. 1 Although this disease nearly disappeared during the 20 th century, several countries, including the UK, have recently experienced a re-emergence of scarlet fever. 1–3 However, the reason for these new outbreaks remains unclear. 1,4 Despite a general move to reduce the use of antibiotics for many mild self-limiting infections (e.g. tonsillitis, sinusitis), national guidance recommends treating people with scarlet fever with antibiotics regardless of severity of illness to speed recovery, to reduce the length of time the infection is contagious and to reduce the risk of complications. 5,6 Here, we discuss the management of scarlet fever in the UK.

### Penicillin V potassium [^cbefbe1b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin V potassium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

NOTE: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

The following infections will usually respond to adequate dosage of penicillin V.

Streptococcal Infections (without bacteremia)

Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

NOTE: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^4272cc05]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes [group A streptococcus, (GAS)] is a gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide variety of diseases. In children, mild to moderate infections such as tonsillopharyngitis, scarlet fever, or impetigo are common. However, in rare cases, GAS can be invasive and cause life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, meningitis, or necrotizing fasciitis, which require immediate antibacterial treatment and sometimes surgery.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline in several infectious diseases, including GAS infections, was observed. In the 2022/2023 winter season, WHO reported a resurgence of local and invasive GAS diseases in several European countries, with children under 10 years of age being the most affected age group. This increase raised general concern because of the severity of many cases and related fatalities.

Recently, before the pandemic, the previous paradigm of treating all patients with a sore throat and suspected GAS infections, such as tonsillopharyngitis, with an antibiotic had been abandoned in many countries including Germanyand Switzerland. With this background, the resurgence of invasive GAS infections raised the question of whether every suspected GAS tonsillopharyngitis should be treated with an antibiotic to prevent invasive GAS disease in these patients. Professional societies, however, discouraged a change of recommendations.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether there is retrospective evidence that invasive GAS disease could have been prevented if the respective patients had been presented to a physician before and if those with suspected GAS disease, such as tonsillopharyngitis had been treated with antibiotics. Therefore, we set out to investigate if patients with invasive GAS disease had presented to the health care system with GAS infections shortly before developing invasive disease and if these visits were missed opportunities for antibiotic treatment.

### Penicillin g benzathine and penicillin g procaine (Bicillin cr) [^3ba487c1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bicillin C-R and other antibacterial drugs, Bicillin C-R should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

This drug is indicated in the treatment of moderately severe infections due to penicillin-G-susceptible microorganisms that are susceptible to serum levels common to this particular dosage form. Therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including susceptibility testing) and by clinical response.

Bicillin C-R is indicated in the treatment of the following in adults and pediatric patients:

Moderately severe to severe infections of the upper-respiratory tract, scarlet fever, erysipelas, and skin and soft-tissue infections due to susceptible streptococci.

NOTE: Streptococci in Groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin G. Other groups, including Group D (enterococci), are resistant. Penicillin G sodium or potassium is recommended for streptococcal infections with bacteremia.

Moderately severe pneumonia and otitis media due to susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

NOTE: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, peritonitis, and arthritis of pneumococcal etiology are better treated with penicillin G sodium or potassium during the acute stage.

When high, sustained serum levels are required, penicillin G sodium or potassium, either IM or IV, should be used. This drug should not be used in the treatment of venereal diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, yaws, bejel, and pinta.

### Incidence and treatment of group A streptococcal infections during COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 outbreak: retrospective cohort study in england using openSAFELY-TPP [^a6662427]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

During the covid-19 pandemic, a substantial change occurred in the pattern of circulating viruses and bacteria that cause illnesses. On 2 December 2022, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued an alert of higher than normal events of scarlet fever and other group A streptococcal infections. On 5 December 2022, UKHSA issued an urgent public health message to health care professionals advising a lower threshold for prescribing antibiotics to children presenting with symptoms of group A streptococcal infection. Group A streptococcal infections are normally mild, often causing non-specific symptoms such as sore throator, with scarlet fever, more specific symptoms (eg, strawberry tongue and a distinctive rash). On rare occasions, these bacteria can enter the bloodstream or deep tissues, causing invasive group A streptococcal infections, a serious infection that can cause death. Between 19 September 2022 and 7 May 2023, 426 deaths were associated with invasive group A streptococcal infections in England, including 48 children aged < 18 years.UKHSA indicated that the increase likely reflected increased susceptibility to these infections in children because of the low numbers of group A streptococcal infections during the covid-19 pandemic, along with increased circulation of respiratory viruses. Before the covid-19 pandemic, 2017–18 was the last time substantially high numbers of group A streptococcal infections were reported, with a peak in notifications of scarlet fever in March 2018.

Figure 2
Monthly numbers of patients with an antibiotic prescription and a record of scarlet fever, sore throat or tonsillitis, or invasive group A streptococcal infection, up to 14 days before or seven days after the prescribing event. Antibiotics were categorised into three groups: phenoxymethylpenicillin (group 1), the first line antibiotic for group A streptococcal infection; macrolides, amoxicillin, and flucloxacillin (group 2), antibiotics recommended if group 1 antibiotics were not available or if patients were allergic to penicillin; and cefalexin and co-amoxiclav (group 3), reserved broad spectrum antibiotics. Vertical lines represent the start of the covid-19 restriction (April 2020) and recovery (April 2021) periods. Maximum values of each season (September to August) are indicated (x)

Comparing the 2017–18 peak with the 2022 peak for individual antibiotics with an indication of streptococcal infection (online supplemental table S5), azithromycin had the largest increase in rate (rate ratio 7.37, 95% CI 6.22 to 8.74), followed by cefalexin (3.81, 3.33 to 4.35), amoxicillin (2.53, 2.47 to 2.59), clarithromycin (2.16, 2.10 to 2.22), co-amoxiclav (1.85, 1.69 to 2.04), erythromycin (1.71, 1.65 to 1.78), flucloxacillin (1.49, 1.30 to 1.70), and phenoxymethylpenicillin (1.37, 1.35 to 1.38).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension may be administered without regard to meals.

Children:

Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. In mild to moderate infections, the usual dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate for children is 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 hours. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

The following dosage schedule is suggested for mild to moderate infections:

Adults:

400 mg erythromycin ethylsuccinate every 6 hours is the usual dose. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

For adult dosage calculation, use a ratio of 400 mg of erythromycin activity as the ethylsuccinate to 250 mg of erythromycin activity as the stearate, base or estolate.

In the treatment of streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be administered for at least 10 days. In continuous prophylaxis against recurrences of streptococcal infections in persons with a history of rheumatic heart disease, the usual dosage is 400 mg twice a day.

For treatment of urethritis due to C. trachomatis or U. urealyticum: 800 mg three times a day for 7 days.

For treatment of primary syphilis: Adults: 48 g to 64 g given in divided doses over a period of 10 days to 15 days.

For intestinal amebiasis: Adults: 400 mg four times daily for 10 days to 14 days. Children: 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 10 days to 14 days.

For use in pertussis: Although optimal dosage and duration have not been established, doses of erythromycin utilized in reported clinical studies were 40 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day, given in divided doses for 5 days to 14 days.

For treatment of Legionnaires' Disease: Although optimal doses have not been established, doses utilized in reported clinical data were 1.6 g to 4 g daily in divided doses.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^56413fe8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^14eb53a1]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary non-inferiority outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment at the test of cure visit for the per protocol population. Clinical cure was defined as complete recovery without major residual symptoms or clinical findings of pharyngotonsillitis or symptomatic relapse. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication according to the culture taken at test of cure; frequency of relapses one month after first diagnosis (given clinical cure at test of cure); frequency of complications and new pharyngotonsillitis during the three month study period; and patterns of adverse events. In addition, we used patient diaries to assess time to relief of fever and throat symptoms graded on a Likert scale (no symptoms, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms). We evaluated patients' adherence to the study drugs in terms of number of doses, and intake of analgesics according to patient diaries as exploratory outcomes.

Changes of outcomes

We performed an additional sensitivity analysis to evaluate the outcome at fixed time points after randomisation. Because the physicians assessed clinical cure only at the test of cure visit, this sensitivity analysis was based on the patient answering "yes" to the question "Do you consider yourself or your child cured from the current infection?" in the patient diary. We performed this analysis at five, seven, and nine days after randomisation.

In June 2017, we also introduced an exploratory outcome at the one month telephone follow-up to examine patients' preferences about the study medication regimen.

Sample size calculation

We assumed 90% clinical recovery in both groups, a power of 85%, a level of significance of 5%, two sidedness, and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, which gave a sample size of 324 patients. Assuming that the primary outcome could not be evaluated in 25% of patients, 432 needed to be included in the study.

### Penicillin g (Penicillin g potassium) [^239709b1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Penicillin G Potassium Injection, USP should be administered by intravenous infusion. The usual dose recommendations are as follows:

Adult patients

(*) Because of its short half-life, Penicillin G is administered in divided doses, usually

every 4–6 hours with the exception of meningococcal meningitis/septicemia, i.e., every 2 hours.

Pediatric patients

This product should not be administered to patients requiring less than one million units per dose

(see PRECAUTIONS -Pediatric Use).

Renal Impairment: Penicillin G is relatively nontoxic, and dosage adjustments are generally required only in cases of severe renal impairment. The recommended dosage regimens are as follows:

Creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min/1.73m2; administer a full loading dose (see recommended dosages in the tables above) followed by one-half of the loading dose every 8–10 hours.

Uremic patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 10 mL/min/1.73m2; administer a full loading dose (see recommended dosages in the tables above) followed by one-half of the loading dose every 4–5 hours. Additional dosage modifications should be made in patients with hepatic disease and renal impairment.

For most acute infections, treatment should be continued for at least 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic. Antibiotic therapy for Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to reduce the risk of rheumatic fever. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

BURDEN OF DISEASE AND CLINICAL DIVERSITY

GAS is a leading cause of infectious disease burden worldwide. The spectrum of GAS disease extends from superficial infections (eg, pharyngitis, impetigo), to invasive disease (eg, abscesses, cellulitis, sepsis), toxin-mediated disease (eg, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis) and autoimmune sequelae (eg, acute rheumatic fever [ARF], poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD). The most frequent manifestations are pharyngitis, with > 616 million incident cases per year, and skin infections, with an estimated 162 million prevalent cases of impetigo. At least 18 million new cases of severe GAS diseases (RHD, ARF, glomerulonephritis, and invasive infections) are estimated to occur annually. RHD alone is responsible for a very large burden of chronic disability and deaths, mostly in adolescents and young adults, particularly pregnant women. The global prevalence of RHD cases was estimated to be 33 million in 2015.

Globally, GAS disease and its complications have been reported to cause 500 000 annual deaths, of which 319 000 are due to RHD. Populations from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are at greatest risk. Global mortality due to RHD has somewhat declined since 1990, but no significant decline has been observed in the regions that carry the highest disease burden. Gaps in data availability hinder the accuracy of global burden estimates. The scarcity of disease registries in most LMICs, reliance on passive surveillance systems, and underreporting of cases continue to be challenging.

Timely and targeted antibiotic treatment of GAS infections constitutes the backbone of prevention of complications. The delivery of preventive interventions has been difficult in settings with fragile health systems and limited access to care, and insufficient to show major impacts. While high-income countries (HICs) have managed to massively reduce the RHD burden, other manifestations of GAS infection — sepsis, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome — remain prevalent. The United Kingdom is witnessing a surge in scarlet fever outbreaks as well as increasing incidence of invasive GAS infections, also reported in the United States and Canada. Among invasive disease cases, there is a specific maternal and early life disease burden in both LMICs and HICs. Contributors to adverse outcomes include delay in recognizing severity and initiating treatment, and restrictions in availability of first-line injectable antibiotics.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^7bd28471]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Strep A: challenges, opportunities, vaccine-based solutions, and economics [^36504142]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes (also referred to herein as Strep A or S. pyogenes) is estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally, behind the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (although the advent of SARS-CoV-2 has likely pushed it to sixth place). Infections from Strep A occur across the entire age spectrum and result in perhaps the most diverse range of acute and chronic clinical manifestations of any known pathogen –. These include pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, maternal sepsis, scarlet fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD).

While Strep A infections are common globally, the burden of Strep A diseases varies widely according to country income level, socioeconomic and demographic composition of the local population, health system quality, and other factors. In high-income settings, for example, Strep A infection commonly manifests as pharyngitis (sore throat), which is typically treated with antibiotics quite effectively. Successful treatment of pharyngitis at this early stage can prevent rheumatic fever and may reduce the risk of invasive disease transmission to household contacts, although evidence that it can prevent other serious Strep A diseases is lacking. Recent major upsurges in invasive Strep A infections have shown that penicillin alone will not control major outbreaks, and real-life experience in New Zealand shows that intensive antibiotic treatment of Strep A sore throat can reduce, at best, only about one-quarter of ARF episodes, at a cost that is unaffordable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition, the proliferation of antibiotics used to treat pharyngitis presumed to be caused by Strep A introduces the real risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) both in the target Strep A organism but also in bystander pathogens where AMR is an even greater concern. Worse still, severe Strep A manifestations, such as RHD, disproportionately affect populations in low-resource settings and, consequently, perpetuate social inequities. During 2015–2017 in Australia, for example, the incidence rate of new first diagnosis of RHD among Indigenous people younger than 45 years of age was roughly 50 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people (45.5 vs. 0.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively). Overall, the incidence of invasive Strep A infection has increased in several regions of the world during the past two decades –, and the health burden of Strep A is similar to, or higher than, that of other pathogens for which vaccines have recently been developed and successfully implemented (e.g. meningococcus).

Methods

We conducted a scoping review of the literature for all studies evaluating Strep A treatment or prevention strategies from an economic perspective. A review protocol was developed but not registered at the start of the study and is described here, along with the main findings by following the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

We included all studies published between Jan 1, 2000 and Oct 12, 2022, that measured and valued, in monetary terms, the resources used to treat or prevent Strep A infections or clinical manifestations. We did not include studies on nosocomial infections and on diseases caused by a pathogen other than Strep A (e.g. bacteraemia or toxic shock syndrome due exclusively to Staphylococcus aureus). There were no restrictions on study language or country; however, the search terms were in English only. Clinical manifestations arising from Strep A infection included pharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess (quinsy), impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, necrotising fasciitis, bacteraemia, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis (including maternal sepsis), septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, meningitis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).

Relevant economic study designs included cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, budget-impact, and return-on-investment studies. Studies that did not calculate the intervention cost and compare it to the intervention benefits (clinical or economic) were excluded from the analysis. We did not attempt to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios because any number of measures of effectiveness could be chosen (e.g. cost per disease averted, cost per surgery averted, cost per anaphylaxis reaction averted, cost per days of illness reduced, etc) and interpretation of the ratio is subjective.

Search strategy

A literature search was conducted using Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WoS) search platform, which includes multiple databases such as the WoS core collection and Medline, and Elsevier's Embase search platform. Search strings for each database are provided in Supplemental Material 1.

General economic terms and disease terms were restricted to a title search to increase the sensitivity of the search strategy. However, to maximize that chance of identifying all relevant data, references lists of each eligible study were evaluated and hand-searched for studies not identified by the search string.

### An outbreak of scarlet fever in a primary school [^3ed6462b]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Scarlet fever, due to infection with an erythrogenic toxin-producing Group A streptococcus, is an uncommon and generally mild illness, although serious sequelae do occur. In March 2009, 57 of the 126 (45%) pupils in a primary school in Lancashire, UK developed scarlet fever over a 4-week period. Infection was transmitted via direct contact between pupils, particularly among the youngest pupils. A significant degree of transmission also occurred between siblings. The median number of days absent from school was 3 (range 1–10 days). No children were hospitalised. Control measures, including hygiene advice to the school and exclusion of pupils for 24h while initiating penicillin treatment, were ineffective. The outbreak occurred against a background of an unusually high incidence of invasive Group A streptococcal infection. While there are national guidelines for the control of invasive disease, none exist for the control of scarlet fever outbreaks. This prolonged outbreak of scarlet fever highlights the need for an evidence based approach to outbreak management.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^f6e792b4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

Treatment:

Adults:

The usual adult dosage range is 1 gram to 2 grams every 6 to 8 hours. Dosage should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of infection, and the condition of the patient (see Table 1 for dosage guidelines).

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments:

In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 2) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: Weight (kg) x (140-age)

72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)

Females: 0.85 x above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 2.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.

In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients:

The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. At this time no recommendation is made for pediatric patients from birth to 3 months of age (see PRECAUTIONS).

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage and frequency of dosage should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults (see Table 2).

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough? [^64def40c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^6b844acc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^7b50994c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^c073cd76]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published to date. In 2007, IDSA / ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 h and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials involving adults with mild-to-moderate CAP comparing the same types of antibiotic, short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics were compared to 7 to 10 day regimens. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens, observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates in both groups. When evaluating only the most severe patients, mortality was 2.2% in the group with a shorter regimen compared to 4.7% in the long regimen group.

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^77d114f8]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^742332b1]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Infection by group A Streptococcus (Strep A) results in a diverse range of clinical conditions, including pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotising fasciitis, and rheumatic heart disease. In this article, we outline the recommended strategies for Strep A treatment and prevention and review the literature for economic evaluations of competing treatment and prevention strategies. We find that most economic evaluations focus on reducing the duration of illness or risk of rheumatic fever among people presenting with sore throat through diagnostic and/or treatment strategies. Few studies have evaluated strategies to reduce the burden of Strep A infection among the general population, nor have they considered the local capacity to finance and implement strategies. Evaluation of validated costs and consequences for a more diverse range of Strep A interventions are needed to ensure policies maximise patient outcomes under budget constraints. This should include attention to basic public health strategies and emerging strategies such as vaccination.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^3cb1f7bb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^388f7fa0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis. Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens.

First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages. Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days. 1st generation cephalosporins Cephalexin: 25–50 mg/kg/day in 2–4 divided doses for 10 days. Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported.

Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^2e9eaee5]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Update on the development of group A Streptococcus vaccines [^890d70b0]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of human diseases. These include mild conditions such as tonsillitis and impetigo (with over 600 million cases p.a.), to scarlet fever and more severe invasive GAS diseases such as sepsis, toxic shock, and necrotising fasciitis. Invasive GAS (iGAS) affects more than 600,000 patients globally p.a. with a mortality rate of 25%. Untreated or insufficiently treated, GAS infections can also trigger serious immune-related sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and inflammatory glomerulonephritis. The IHME Global Burden of Disease estimates that globally there are more than 40 million cases of RHDwith the majority of cases occurring in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). Rheumatic fever is most common in children aged 5 to 15 years, and approximately 460,000 new cases occur each year. RHD contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in LMIC, with over 300,000 deaths annually and over 10 million disability-adjusted life years. Globally, GAS continues to be among the top ten infectious diseases responsible for causing mortality, highlighting the need to develop a GAS vaccine. The WHO has taken the lead in this effort by publishing in 2018 a roadmap for the development of the first GAS vaccine.

More than 250 GAS serotypes have been identified and annotated based on their emm -type genomic sequence that determines the serotype-specific M-protein (emm). Despite this serotype diversity, different geographical regions experience dissimilar emm -types. In the absence of a GAS vaccine, antibiotics are relied upon for the effective treatment and prevention of transmission. However, there are stark discrepancies in treatment and diagnosis between high-income countries (HIC) and LMIC, where vaccines would have an even greater impact. Although no cases of GAS resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics have been reported, there have been reports of reduced susceptibility. Importantly, GAS laboratory surveillance has revealed no antibiotic resistance in the new clusters responsible for recent outbreaks and no newly-emerged emm types. Over the past two decades, general antimicrobial resistance has increased, and certain GAS serotypes associated with severe infections have shown increased resistance to clindamycin and macrolides. However, the excessive use of antibiotics for treating GAS pharyngitis and impetigo has played a major role in driving resistance in bystander pathogens.

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval -9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### A strep A vaccine global demand and return on investment forecast to inform industry research and development prioritization [^bfc926a3]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus or "Strep A") is a gram-positive bacterium that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in humans. The most common Strep A disease is pharyngitis, which results in over 600 million new global cases per year, predominantly in children. Strep A infection can also lead to serious invasive (e.g. sepsis) and toxin-mediated (e.g. scarlet fever) diseases, as well as necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Of Strep A diseases, RHD has the greatest morbidity and mortality, with global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 10.5 million, mostly from premature deaths, and a global age-standardized prevalence rate of 513.7 per 100 000 people. In a recent study, RHD-related deaths were forecasted to remain almost constant until 2040, unlike other high-burden communicable diseases, including HIV and tuberculosis, for which mortality is projected to decrease quite significantly by 2040. It is estimated that Strep A causes 639 000 deaths each year, with RHD-related deaths accounting for approximately 73% of those deaths and invasive disease due to Strep A infection accounting for 25%. People in low- and middle-income countries as well as high-risk populations including pregnant women, the elderly, and Indigenous populations are disproportionately affected by diseases associated with Strep A infection. Strep A disease management involves antibiotic treatment and there is currently no pharmacological option to prevent Strep A infections.

NON-STREPTOCOCCAL BACTERIAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Besides streptococci, there are other bacterial pathogens that cause pharyngitis and many of these are not responsive to conventional GAS antimicrobial therapy. This drives the need for identification of additional bacterial pathogens if GAS is not detected by antigen, culture, or molecular testing modalities. Both commonly and uncommonly encountered bacterial pathogens of pharyngitis are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Etiologic Agents Associated With Acute Pharyngitis a

A less common cause of acute pharyngitis, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a gram-positive bacillus that morphologically resembles coryneform gram-positive rods. Individuals with A. haemolyticum pharyngitis exhibit symptoms that closely mimic streptococcal infection. This pathogen is readily found on comprehensive throat cultures but will not be identified on a culture specifically targeting GAS. A. haemolyticum infection is usually found in teenagers and young adults, and infected individuals may present with a generalized rash like that of scarlet fever. A. haemolyticum, as an agent of asymptomatic colonization, was detected in the pharynx of 1.4% of individuals (n = 217) using PCR; however, it was not detected by culture methods alone. In general, this organism is susceptible to antibiotics typically prescribed for the treatment of GAS pharyngitis. However, due to varied reports of resistance to penicillin and macrolide antibiotics, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended.

### Increased risk for invasive group A Streptococcus disease for household contacts of scarlet fever cases, england, 2011–2016 [^765dfde5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

We used clinical reports of scarlet fever and recognized that a proportion of reported cases might have had other infections, which has the potential to influence the risk estimate in either direction. Although only ≈50% of scarlet fever consultations in primary care in England are formally reported, this finding would not influence the risk estimate because it was based on iGAS cases that occurred in contacts of only the reported cohort. We did not capture the burden of disease associated with severe noninvasive GAS infections (GAS isolated from a nonsterile site), although these infections are estimated to comprise only 1% of all severe GAS infections.

We assessed the risk for secondary iGAS infection for household contacts to be low. However, potential severity is high. The prodrome for iGAS infection can be nonspecific, and the disease can progress rapidly; therefore, increasing the index of suspicion in specific circumstances or groups at increased risk might expedite diagnosis and commencement of life-saving treatment. Offering antimicrobial drug prophylaxis to household contacts to eradicate carriage and treat incipient infection could reduce the risk for iGAS infection. However, the unintended consequences of large-scale increased use of antimicrobial drugs, heightened patient anxiety, the effect on GP workload, and the lack of evidence on effectiveness make this option disproportionate given the low overall risk estimated. Antimicrobial drug prophylaxis could be targeted to high-risk contacts, such as elderly persons and infants. However, there is considerable uncertainty for the risk estimate for these groups because of the small number of secondary iGAS cases. Providing information on signs and symptoms of iGAS infection to patients or parents at the point of scarlet fever diagnosis to accelerate self-referral for medical assessment could be effective but has the potential to increase anxiety for many persons and increase presentations of worried healthy persons to GPs and emergency departments at scale. Increasing awareness among frontline clinicians assessing patients of this increased risk to improve early identification and treatment of cases is perhaps the most proportionate and feasible response on the basis of available data. Information could also be made available to the public through patient-facing websites provided that messages are worded carefully so as not to increase anxiety.

### Pathogenesis, epidemiology and control of group A Streptococcus infection [^7d26f133]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS) is exquisitely adapted to the human host, resulting in asymptomatic infection, pharyngitis, pyoderma, scarlet fever or invasive diseases, with potential for triggering post-infection immune sequelae. GAS deploys a range of virulence determinants to allow colonization, dissemination within the host and transmission, disrupting both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Fluctuating global GAS epidemiology is characterized by the emergence of new GAS clones, often associated with the acquisition of new virulence or antimicrobial determinants that are better adapted to the infection niche or averting host immunity. The recent identification of clinical GAS isolates with reduced penicillin sensitivity and increasing macrolide resistance threatens both frontline and penicillin-adjunctive antibiotic treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a GAS research and technology road map and has outlined preferred vaccine characteristics, stimulating renewed interest in the development of safe and effective GAS vaccines.

### Acute rheumatic fever… [^6027edc5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation. One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes.
- As of July 10, 2025, there is a voluntary recall of Bicillin L-A, a preferred antibiotic to prevent recurrences. Find details in the Prevention section below.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with acute rheumatic fever. Skin Subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum are the two major skin manifestations but occur in < 10% of episodes. Nodules are most commonly present in patients with carditis. Inadequate or lack of antibiotic treatment In approximately one-third of patients, acute rheumatic fever follows subclinical streptococcal infections or infections for which medical attention was not sought.

Treatment Patients with acute rheumatic fever should start on therapy for the management of
- Acute rheumatic fever
- Cardiac failure, if necessary Therapy for acute rheumatic fever includes salicylates and anti-inflammatory medicines to relieve inflammation and decrease fever. Antibiotics These patients should also be started on antibiotics to eliminate any residual group A strep bacteria. Treatment is indicated regardless of the presence or absence of pharyngitis or positive Strep test at the time of diagnosis. Preventing initial illness Diagnosis and adequate treatment of group A strep pharyngitis and skin infections are the primary means of preventing acute rheumatic fever. Preventing recurrent illnesses Acute rheumatic fever frequently recurs with subsequent group A strep pharyngitis infections. Secondary prevention of rheumatic fever requires antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the likelihood of recurrent attacks.

Long-term prophylaxis duration should be individually tailored but is usually indicated at least until age 21 years. Prophylaxis typically involves one of the following:

- An intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin every 3–4 weeks
- Oral penicillin V twice daily Sulfadiazine or oral macrolides can be taken daily by individuals who are allergic to penicillin. The American Heart Association no longer recommends bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis unless the patient with rheumatic heart disease has a prosthetic valve.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^42c50dd8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus. 1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care. 3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: (a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; (b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or (c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered. 5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

Recommendations

If group A streptococcus (Strep) is the cause of the individual's skin infection, refer to Streptococcal infections section.
Restrict individuals from entering the family-centered residential facility with skin and soft tissue infections if they have active drainage from the infection site. After an individual has surgical drainage of an infected abscess (boil), the facility may allow entry if the affected skin can be kept completely covered at all times with a clean and dry dressing.
Allow individuals who have been exposed to someone with a skin infection who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility.
Refer individuals who develop a skin infection while staying at the facility for medical evaluation. Until evaluated, restrict the individual to their private room.
Educate guests and family members about the importance of frequent hand hygiene and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. used bandages, clothing, and linens) with appropriate, prompt cleaning or disposal.

Streptococcal infections (including strep throat)

Background

The most common infection caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) is pharyngitis, commonly called strep throat. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Scarlet fever can occur along with strep throat, and it is characterized by a red, sandpaper-like rash.GAS can cause other infections including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, musculoskeletal infections, bloodstream infection, and sepsis. Sepsis is the body's overactive and toxic response to infection. Sepsis can be life threatening.

GAS can spread through contact with the respiratory secretions of a person who is infected. A person is considered contagious until they have been treated with appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours. The is no vaccine available to prevent GAS infections.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals who have active, untreated GAS infections from entry to the family-centered residential facility.
Allow entry once they have completed at least 24 hours of antibiotic treatment and have been fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication.
Allow individuals who were exposed to someone with a documented case of GAS infection to enter the facility if they do not have symptoms of illness.
Refer for medical evaluation individuals who were exposed to GAS and develop symptoms for testing and treatment if the test is positive. Apply the previous steps to their reentry to the facility.

1.4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Table 2.
Priorities for Data Requirements Describing Burden of Disease Across Vaccine Development and Evaluation Objectives for Acute Group A Streptococcus Diseases

Table 3.
Priorities for Data Requirements Describing Burden of Disease Across Vaccine Development and Evaluation Objectives for Immune-Mediated Sequalae of Group A Streptococcus

In application of this framework to Strep A, we have considered the target population, established by the WHO Preferred Product Characteristics, to be infants and/or young children. Pharyngitis and impetigo have been strategically targeted as initial, feasible clinical endpoints of a Strep A vaccine. Both are associated with considerable health burden and are assumed to be primary intermediates on the causal pathway to immune-mediated diseases, such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and RHD, and a proportion of invasive Strep A diseases. While these efficacy targets have been set irrespective of the strain and serotype coverage of a future Strep A vaccine, we consider the importance of strain-specific data for certain vaccine objectives — in particular, advocacy and regulatory oversight and licensure. This is particularly important as the emm types of Strep A causing disease vary across geographical settings and over time. While some vaccine candidates are not serotype specific, varying multivalent vaccines are also in development and serotype replacement may be an important consideration when collating or evaluating data on Strep A burden of disease.

Acute Diseases

Prioritization of disease burden estimates of acute Strep A clinical syndromes varies by vaccine objective. For advocacy, it is important to focus on clinical endpoints that are most likely to influence decision making, such as invasive Strep A, which is the highest driver of overall Strep A deaths in most HICs. The incidence of invasive Strep A has remained high or is increasing in multiple countries (eg, the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia) but likely to be underrecognized in LMICs, potentially hampering advocacy requirements. Scarlet fever has also recently increased across the United Kingdom. Data to support vaccine acceptability are also critical to support advocacy efforts, given that vaccine hesitancy is a well-recognized global issue.

For the regulatory/licensure objective, burden of disease data need to be pathogen- and, where possible, strain-specific. Active prospective surveillance with laboratory-confirmed clinical endpoints and focused on the early vaccine development targets (pharyngitis and impetigo) will be necessary to generate burden of disease data for this objective. Sites with established active surveillance for pharyngitis or impetigo can transition to become phase II or III vaccine trial sites.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^6d22da7c]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

Secondary outcomes

Table 2 shows the results of bacteriological eradication according to the culture taken at the test of cure evaluation (presence of group A streptococcus or not); frequency of relapses one month after first diagnosis; and frequency of complications or new pharyngotonsillitis during the study period. Twelve of the 15 patients who experienced relapses had bacteriological eradication at test of cure, including six out of eight in the five day group and six out of seven in the 10 day group. Only four patients had complications, all in the 10 day group, which all resolved: three were peritonsillitis and one was psoriasis, probably provoked by streptococci. Two of the three patients with peritonsillitis were referred to a specialist for surgery. According to patient diaries, time to first day of relief of sore throat was significantly shorter in the five day group compared with the 10 day group in the per protocol and modified intention to treat populations (P < 0.001, log rank test; fig 2). The median time to relief of sore throat was four days after randomisation for both intervention groups. There was no difference between the groups for time to relief of fever recorded in patient diaries (P = 0.48, log rank test).

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Most of the adverse events recorded on case report forms (assessed by physicians) were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity: 73% (97/132) and 23% (31/132), respectively, in the five day group and 61% (104/170) and 33% (56/170), respectively, in the 10 day group. The adverse events recorded by physicians were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal discharge or itching. In all three categories, the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events (table 4). Self reported adverse events in the patient diary supported the pattern of events recorded by physicians, but with a slightly higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events in both groups (table 4).
