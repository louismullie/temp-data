## Question

location of a ventral hernia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the location of a ventral hernia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and anatomic boundaries that distinguish ventral hernias from groin hernias. Then, I should verify the major subtypes by location and their relative frequencies. Next, I will examine lateral and atypical locations, including Spigelian, lumbar, and subxiphoid/suprapubic hernias. After that, I need to check how classification systems and imaging nomenclature standardize location descriptors. Finally, I will consider how location influences surgical approach and outcomes, and I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't misclassify anything. Ventral hernias are protrusions through the anterior abdominal wall, excluding groin hernias, which means they occur on the front of the abdomen rather than in the inguinal or femoral regions, and this boundary is consistently reflected in contemporary classifications and reviews.

> I will now examine the most common locations. Midline ventral hernias predominate, with umbilical hernias at the navel and epigastric hernias between the xiphoid and umbilicus being the primary midline defects. Incisional hernias, which arise along prior surgical scars, are also frequently midline but can occur anywhere along the scar trajectory, and their incidence after laparotomy is roughly 10–20% in many series, which explains their clinical prominence [^7900cc37] [^05e9fae4].

> Wait, let me verify the lateral variants so I don't overgeneralize. Spigelian hernias occur at the semilunar line, typically below the umbilicus, and account for about 1–2% of abdominal wall hernias. Lumbar hernias occur in the flank through the superior or inferior lumbar triangles and are uncommon. Parastomal hernias, while technically ventral, cluster around ostomy sites and are best categorized with stomal complications rather than pure lateral wall hernias [^5d5ae4cf] [^e3de0789] [^8ccb32e1].

> Hold on, I should verify atypical anterior locations that change operative planning. Subxiphoid hernias sit just below the xiphoid and complicate fixation near the costal margin and pericardium, where tacks and deep sutures risk cardiac or pulmonary injury. Suprapubic hernias abut the pubis and bladder, requiring bladder mobilization and often pubic fixation. Flank hernias lateral to the rectus sheath and hernias near the costal margin similarly alter port placement and fixation strategy due to proximity to ribs, diaphragm, and neurovascular bundles [^e01bea3a] [^4a0934f8] [^46d4837d].

> Next, I should review how location is codified in classification systems so terminology is consistent. The European Hernia Society classification distinguishes midline from lateral ventral hernias and further separates primary from incisional etiologies, while the International Endohernia Society recommends using the EHS scheme for ventral and incisional hernias. Importantly, there is also an International Classification of Abdominal Wall Planes that standardizes mesh placement terminology, which, while not a location taxonomy per se, clarifies anatomic descriptors used in location-specific repairs [^f3b9db36] [^74938e40].

> I need to ensure imaging descriptors align with surgical anatomy. Preoperative CT is the workhorse for mapping hernia location, measuring defect size, assessing loss of domain, and identifying occult defects or prior mesh, and radiology reports increasingly include location-specific landmarks and relationships to bony and visceral structures to guide operative strategy, especially in complex ventral hernias where clinical exam underestimates extent [^08ea492c] [^8e06a716] [^f1731d9e].

> Let me consider how location influences surgical approach and outcomes, and I should double-check the strength of evidence. Midline hernias are amenable to open retromuscular repairs, laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh, or robotic approaches, whereas lateral and subcostal hernias often require modified port placement and careful fixation to avoid intercostal neurovascular injury. Suprapubic hernias necessitate bladder mobilization and inferior fixation, and parastomal hernias may need dedicated techniques or relocation. Location also correlates with complications: non-midline repairs report more pre- and postoperative pain, and suprapubic repairs have higher complication and recurrence rates in some series, underscoring the need for location-tailored technique and fixation choices [^e01bea3a] [^4a0934f8] [^cce12fbd] [^f10f5a72].

> But wait, what if the hernia is labeled "complex" because of size rather than location alone. I should confirm that "complex ventral hernia" often reflects large defects, loss of domain, and comorbidities rather than a different location taxonomy; indeed, many contemporary series define complex ventral hernia by defect size, loss of domain, and patient factors, with location being one of several morphologic descriptors that shape risk and reconstructive choices, including the need for component separation in large midline defects [^3ac67e55] [^bc41b009] [^37fd9139].

> Synthesis: Ventral hernias occur on the anterior abdominal wall, excluding the groin, and are most often midline at the umbilicus or epigastrium or along prior midline incisions. Lateral variants include Spigelian and lumbar hernias, while atypical anterior sites such as subxiphoid, suprapubic, and flank locations require location-specific operative planning due to adjacent structures. Modern classifications and imaging standards emphasize precise location descriptors to align surgical technique, minimize complications, and improve outcomes [^7900cc37] [^f3b9db36] [^08ea492c].

Ventral hernias occur on the **anterior abdominal wall** [^7900cc37], most often at the midline (umbilical, epigastric, or incisional) [^05e9fae4], but also in lateral locations such as Spigelian, lumbar, or flank hernias [^5d5ae4cf] [^e3de0789]. Incisional hernias arise at prior surgical scars and can occur anywhere on the anterior wall [^7900cc37]. Precise localization is essential for surgical planning and is best achieved with **clinical examination plus CT** [^f1731d9e] [^08ea492c], which defines the defect size, location, and relationship to key structures [^8e06a716].

## Anatomical locations of ventral hernias

Ventral hernias are classified by **location on the anterior abdominal wall**:

| **Location** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Midline | Along the linea alba from xiphoid to pubis | - Umbilical <br/> - Epigastric <br/> - Incisional [^7900cc37] |
| Lateral | Away from the midline, through the lateral abdominal wall | - Spigelian <br/> - Lumbar <br/> - Flank [^5d5ae4cf] [^e3de0789] |
| Special locations | Near bony landmarks or prior surgical sites | - Subxiphoid <br/> - Suprapubic <br/> - Parastomal [^e01bea3a] [^4a0934f8] [^8ccb32e1] |

---

### Midline ventral hernias

Midline hernias are the **most common** and include:

- **Umbilical hernia**: At or near the umbilicus; common in adults and children [^05a9792c].
- **Epigastric hernia**: Between the xiphoid process and umbilicus [^7900cc37].
- **Incisional hernia**: At prior surgical scars; incidence ~10–20% after laparotomy [^7900cc37] [^05e9fae4].

---

### Lateral ventral hernias

Lateral hernias are less common and include:

- **Spigelian hernia**: Through the semilunar line (linea semilunaris); rare (~1–2%) [^5d5ae4cf].
- **Lumbar hernia**: Through the superior or inferior lumbar triangles; rare [^e3de0789].
- **Flank hernia**: Lateral abdominal wall, often postoperative or traumatic [^notfound].

---

### Special locations

Certain hernias occur near **specific anatomical landmarks**:

- **Subxiphoid hernia**: Below the xiphoid process; fixation near pericardium risks cardiac injury [^e01bea3a].
- **Suprapubic hernia**: Near the pubic symphysis; bladder injury risk during repair [^4a0934f8].
- **Parastomal hernia**: Around ostomy sites; common after colostomy or ileostomy [^8ccb32e1].

---

## Clinical significance of hernia location

Location **guides surgical approach**, mesh selection, and fixation strategy:

- **Midline hernias**: Often managed with open or laparoscopic mesh repair; retromuscular or underlay mesh is preferred for low recurrence [^9ad5ef81] [^ef2fc09a].
- **Lateral hernias**: May require specialized techniques due to limited mesh overlap and fixation challenges [^f10f5a72].
- **Special locations**: Subxiphoid and suprapubic hernias need careful fixation to avoid visceral injury [^e01bea3a] [^4a0934f8].

---

## Diagnostic methods for determining hernia location

Accurate localization relies on **clinical examination and imaging**:

- **Clinical examination**: Palpation and cough impulse guide initial localization [^notfound].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for defining defect size, location, contents, and relationship to adjacent structures [^08ea492c] [^8e06a716].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for small or superficial hernias, especially in children or thin patients [^f1731d9e].

---

## Impact of hernia location on surgical outcomes

Location affects **recurrence, complications, and recovery**:

- **Midline hernias**: Higher recurrence risk with onlay or interposition mesh; retromuscular or underlay placement reduces recurrence [^9ad5ef81] [^ef2fc09a].
- **Lateral hernias**: Higher risk of chronic pain and fixation-related complications [^cce12fbd].
- **Special locations**: Subxiphoid and suprapubic hernias have higher complication rates due to proximity to vital structures [^e01bea3a] [^4a0934f8].

---

Ventral hernias occur on the **anterior abdominal wall**, most often at the midline but also in lateral and special locations. Precise localization with clinical examination and CT is essential for planning and optimizing outcomes [^f1731d9e] [^08ea492c].

### What exactly is meant by "Loss of domain" for ventral hernia? Systematic review of definitions [^9eee00ba]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of ventral hernia disease is increasing. This is due to an ageing population, the obesity epidemic, and an increasing number of abdominal operations being performed. The proportion of complex ventral hernia (CVH) has also increased, partly due to the reasons already mentioned but also because of improvements in intensive care medicine. In many patients' following intra-abdominal sepsis and laparostomy, the ventral defect is left open and covered only via skin grafting, culminating in large ventral hernia. These CVH contain a significant proportion of the abdominal viscera outside the abdominopelvic compartment and their repair presents the sternest surgical challenge. "Loss of domain" (LOD) is a term used commonly in the hernia literature to describe the distribution of abdominal content between the hernia and residual abdominopelvic cavity. After repairing hernias with significant LOD (i.e. large hernias with much of the abdominal viscera outside the abdominal compartment), serious physiological complications can arise. The increase in intra-abdominal pressure pushes up on the diaphragm and can cause respiratory failure and pneumonia. The rise in abdominal pressure increases the tension along the laparotomy incision, which can be pulled apart resulting in wound complications and hernia recurrence. Post-operative recurrence is a significant problem and has precipitated interest in discerning pre-operative factors that help to predict success or failure. LOD may have prognostic value, and accordingly a standardised definition is warranted. A standardised definition will allow for comparable pre-operative assessment of hernia patients. Trials in hernia repair will then be able to use this definition, and subsequent trial comparison via meta-analysis will allow researchers to investigate LOD as a predictor.

Whilst reviewing the literature and holding discussions with hernia surgeons, we suspected that LOD was not being utilised in any standardised fashion. Supporting this observation, articles have suggested that written definitions of LOD are inconsistent. Cross-sectional imaging with volumetric analysis is used increasingly to quantify LOD and researchers have noted that volumetric definitions of LOD can differ. If LOD is to be a useful concept, then it is clear that its definition should be standardised and applied consistently. In order to progress this, we used systematic review to identify the frequency with which different definitions of LOD were presented in the literature, and examined what these were.

### Nomenclature in abdominal wall hernias: is It time for consensus? [^b698f964]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall reconstruction is a rapidly evolving area of surgical interest. Due to the increase in prevalence and size of ventral hernias and the high recurrence rates, the academic community has become motivated to find the best reconstruction techniques. Whilst interrogating the abdominal wall reconstruction literature, we discovered an inconsistency in hernia nomenclature that must be addressed. The terms used to describe the anatomical planes of mesh implantation 'inlay', 'sublay' and 'underlay' are misinterpreted throughout. We describe the misinterpretation of these terms and give evidence of where it exists in the literature. We give three critical arguments of why these misinterpretations hinder advances in abdominal wall reconstruction research. The correct definitions of the anatomical planes, and their respective terms, are described and illustrated. Clearly defined nomenclature is required as academic surgeons strive to improve abdominal wall reconstruction outcomes and lower complication rates.

### Ventral hernia repair: does mesh position matter? [^7f5f852c]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Mesh positioning is a commonly discussed detail in ventral hernia repair and is often cited as a major contributor to the outcome of the operation. However, there is a paucity of data that establishes one plane as superior to others. In this article, we will provide an overview of all potential planes to place prosthetic material and review the relevant literature supporting each option and the complications associated with accessing each anatomic plane.

### What exactly is meant by "Loss of domain" for ventral hernia? Systematic review of definitions [^ba9afb70]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Via systematic review, we have demonstrated that definitions of loss of domain are either disparate or omitted altogether. We found four broad concepts within the literature. Some were vague, and even the two volumetric definitions differed. Since loss of domain is a prime descriptor of hernia size and likely to be correlated with operative outcomes, a standardised definition is needed urgently.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^3ac67e55]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Complex ventral hernia (CVH) describes large, anterior, ventral hernias. The incidence of CVH is rising rapidly due to increasing laparotomy rates in ever older, obese and co-morbid patients. Surgeons with a specific interest in CVH repair are now frequently referring these patients for imaging, normally computed tomography scanning. This review describes what information is required from preoperative imaging and the surgical options and techniques used for CVH repair, so that radiologists understand the postoperative appearances specific to CVH and are aware of the common complications following surgery.

Key Points

- Complex ventral hernia (CVH) describes large abdominal wall hernias (e.g. width ≥ 10cm).
- CVH patients are being referred increasingly for preoperative and postoperative imaging.
- Imaging is pivotal to characterise preoperative morphology and quantify loss of domain.
- Postoperative imaging appearances are contingent on the surgical methods used for CVH repair.
- Postoperative complications are depicted easily by imaging.

Methods

Objectives

The primary aim of this systematic review was to investigate the range of written and volumetric definitions for LOD used in the literature and to report the frequency of each definition used.

Reporting and registration

This systematic review was performed and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Ethical permission is not required by our University for systematic reviews of available primary literature.

Inclusion criteria for studies

We aimed to identify indexed studies that used the term "loss of domain" in their methods when describing the morphology of hernia. No date limitation was used for our search. There was no limit to the manuscript type, allowing for the inclusion of both the primary and secondary literature in our review. Only articles written in English were included.

Target condition

The target condition was hernia with LOD. The term LOD is frequently caused to describe large ventral hernias; however, deliberately, our search strategy did not exclude any specific subtypes or aetiologies of hernia (e.g. large inguinal or diaphragmatic hernias) as our aim was to investigate all definitions of LOD, which can be applied to hernia irrespective of hernia aetiology. We wished to encompass definitions used not only by specialist abdominal wall surgeons but also those used by general, trauma, plastic, transplant, bariatric, and paediatric surgeons.

Participants

Participants were defined as those with large hernia with LOD, either as part of a primary study or as part of a secondary narrative review or editorial. We included paediatric patients, as the literature commonly describes the surgical repair of gastroschisis and omphalocele using the term loss of domain.

Search strategy and string

The primary researcher, SGP, searched the PubMed database with no date limitation. Filters were applied limiting the search to "human studies". Our search string used the keywords; "loss of domain", "loss of abdominal domain", and "hernia". These terms were combined as two criteria to identify relevant articles:
"Loss of domain" OR "Loss of abdominal domain" AND
"hernia"

MESH terms were not used as "loss of domain" is indexed under multiple terms. After entering the above keywords, our search strategy was transformed to search for articles indexed under any mesh term containing the keyword "hernia" combining this with the keywords "loss" and "domain" (our search string is shown in " Appendix 1 ").

### Nomenclature in abdominal wall hernias: is It time for consensus? [^d7dd9897]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The repair of complex ventral hernias (CVHs) is a rapidly evolving area of surgical interest. Complex hernias are becoming both increasingly prevalent and challenging, with a consequent need for the academic hernia community to produce robust research to guide best practice. It is clear when reviewing the CVH repair literature that the nomenclature is used with significant variability and often incorrectly. For example, the recto-rectus plane is often referred to as the 'inlay', 'sublay' or 'underlay' plane. The pre-peritoneal layer is often also referred to by all three terms; 'inlay', 'sublay' and 'underlay'. And finally, the intra-abdominal plane is often referred to as 'sublay' or 'underlay'.

Attempts to produce evidence to guide the best surgical management of these CVH repairs is already challenging, given the considerable pre-operative and peri-operative variables in these patients. Therefore, it is imperative for surgeons and researchers to use standardised correct nomenclature to prevent misinterpretation, to reduce data heterogeneity and allow for accurate study comparison.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^c4716833]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernia — defect measurement (Guideline 16) states that surgeons should measure and document the defect size and that the total area encompassing all defects should be measured, with familiarity in internal and external techniques and avoidance of errors (Moderate quality, Strong recommendation). Accurate measurement is a key to ensuring adequate mesh coverage and minimizing recurrence, with two main approaches — externally on the abdominal wall and internally within the peritoneal cavity. For multiple defects, it is important to measure the total area between the rectus muscles, the craniocaudal extent is the distance between the most superior defect and the most inferior defect, and measurement of each defect is not necessary and may lead to underestimating the defect and prosthetic size, thus leading to increased risk of recurrence. External measurement is described by using a (spinal) needle near the edges of the defect under laparoscopic observation, then marking borders with a sterile marking pen and measuring with a sterile ruler; because the outside circumference is larger, this technique will typically overestimate the defect size, and the thicker the abdominal wall the larger the difference from actual size. Factors increasing discrepancy include a fully insufflated abdomen, obesity, and a large hernia sac, the discrepancy will be greatest with obesity and a large sac, and pitfalls include angling the needle through the abdominal wall rather than removing and re-inserting when identifying the borders of the defect.

### What exactly is meant by "Loss of domain" for ventral hernia? Systematic review of definitions [^f647ef09]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Large ventral hernias are a significant surgical challenge. "Loss of domain" (LOD) expresses the relationship between hernia and abdominal volume, and is used to predict operative difficulty and success. This systematic review assessed whether different definitions of LOD are used in the literature. The PubMed database was searched for articles reporting large hernia repairs that explicitly described LOD. Two reviewers screened citations and extracted data from selected articles, focusing on the definitions used for LOD, study demographics, study design, and reporting surgical specialty. One hundred and seven articles were identified, 93 full-texts examined, and 77 were included in the systematic review. Sixty-seven articles were from the primary literature, and 10 articles were from the secondary literature. Twenty-eight articles (36%) gave a written definition for loss of domain. These varied and divided into six broad groupings; four described the loss of the right of domain, six described abdominal strap muscle contraction, five described the "second abdomen", five describing large irreducible hernias. Six gave miscellaneous definitions. Two articles gave multiple definitions. Twenty articles (26%) gave volumetric definitions; eight used the Tanaka method [hernia sac volume (HSV)/abdominal cavity volume] and five used the Sabbagh method [(HSV)/total peritoneal volume]. The definitions used for loss of domain were not dependent on the reporting specialty. Our systematic review revealed that multiple definitions of loss of domain are being used. These vary and are not interchangeable. Expert consensus on this matter is necessary to standardise this important concept for hernia surgeons.

### What exactly is meant by "Loss of domain" for ventral hernia? Systematic review of definitions [^e69df7d5]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Thirty-eight of the articles were written by abdominal wall specialists, 16 articles were written by general surgeons, seven by paediatric surgeons, six by trauma surgeons, six by plastic surgeons, and two, one, and one by Transplant, vascular and bariatric surgeons, respectively. Twenty-eight [36%] of articles presented a written definition for LOD (Online supplementary resource 2), meaning that the remaining 49 [64%] articles used the phase "loss of domain" as a concept without definition. The written definitions reported were inconsistent. Definitions varied but could be categorised into six groups (Table 1). Four out of these six groups used definitions based around four theoretical concepts. Four articles defined LOD by describing a hernia as so large that "the herniated organs have lost their right of domain inside the abdominal cavity". Six articles use the principle of lateral contraction of the abdominal wall muscles leading to a reduced volume of the abdominal cavity and progressive visceral protrusion. Five articles use the concept of the hernia sac being a "second abdomen" and included the argument that restoring the hernia sac back into the abdominal cavity would create physiological disturbances and complications. Lastly, five articles describe LOD as a large irreducible hernia containing abdominal viscera residing outside the abdominal cavity and adherent to the hernial sac. Six of the definitions were miscellaneous, and two of the articles were editorials, which highlighted inconsistencies when defining LOD. Twenty-three of the 28 [82%] definitions were reported in articles written by abdominal wall specialists. After categorising results by reporting specialty, the definitions remained inconsistent and were not dependent on the reporting surgical specialty (Table 1).

### General surgery: management of postoperative complications following ventral hernia repair and inguinal hernia repair [^896ddde4]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Ventral and inguinal hernia repairs are some of the most commonly performed general surgery operations worldwide. This review focuses on the management of postoperative complications, which include surgical site infection, hernia recurrence, postoperative pain, and mesh-related issues. In each section, we aim to discuss classifications, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options for common complications following hernia repair.

### Primary uncomplicated ventral hernia repair: guidelines and practice patterns for routine hernia repairs [^a5be199e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical repair of primary umbilical and epigastric hernias are among the most common abdominal operations in the world. The hernia defects range from small (< 1 cm) to large and complex even in the absence of prior incision or repair. Mesh has generally been shown to decrease recurrence rates, and its use and location of placement should be individualized for each patient. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches provide unique considerations for the technical aspects of primary repair with or without mesh augmentation.

### Does mesh location matter in abdominal wall reconstruction? A systematic review of the literature and a summary of recommendations [^380ffa63]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mesh implantation during abdominal wall reconstruction decreases rates of ventral hernia recurrence and has become the dominant method of repair. The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of surgical outcomes and complications by location of mesh placement following ventral hernia repair with onlay, interposition, retrorectus, or underlay mesh.

Methods

A systematic search of the English literature published from 1996 to 2012 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases was conducted to identify patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction using either prosthetic or biological mesh for ventral hernia repair. Demographic information was obtained from each study.

Results

Sixty-two relevant articles were included with 5824 patients treated with mesh repair of a ventral hernia between 1996 and 2012. Mesh position included onlay (19.6 percent), underlay (60.7 percent), interposition (6.4 percent), and retrorectus (12.4 percent). Prosthetic mesh was used in 80 percent of repairs and biological mesh in 20 percent. The weighted mean incidences of early events were as follows: wound complications, 19 percent; wound infections, 8 percent; seroma or hematoma formation, 11 percent; and reoperation, 10 percent. The weighted mean incidences of late complications included 8 percent for hernia recurrence and 2 percent for mesh explantation. Recurrence rates were highest for onlay (17 percent) or interposition (17 percent) reinforcement. The infection rate was also highest in the interposition cohort (25 percent). Seroma rates were lowest following a retrorectus repair (4 percent).

Conclusions

Mesh reinforcement of a ventral hernia repair is safe and efficacious, but the location of the reinforcement appears to influence outcomes. Underlay or retrorectus mesh placement is associated with lower recurrence rates.

### Ventral hernia management: expert consensus guided by systematic review [^dbe72149]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To achieve consensus on the best practices in the management of ventral hernias (VH).

Background

Management patterns for VH are heterogeneous, often with little supporting evidence or correlation with existing evidence.

Methods

A systematic review identified the highest level of evidence available for each topic. A panel of expert hernia-surgeons was assembled. Email questionnaires, evidence review, panel discussion, and iterative voting was performed. Consensus was when all experts agreed on a management strategy.

Results

Experts agreed that complications with VH repair (VHR) increase in obese patients (grade A), current smokers (grade A), and patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥ 6.5% (grade B). Elective VHR was not recommended for patients with BMI ≥ 50kg/m² (gradeC), current smokers (grade A), or patients with HbA1C ≥ 8.0% (grade B). Patients with BMI = 30-50kg/m² or HbA1C = 6.5–8.0% require individualized interventions to reduce surgical risk (grade C, grade B). Nonoperative management was considered to have a low-risk of short-term morbidity (grade C). Mesh reinforcement was recommended for repair of hernias ≥ 2cm (grade A). There were several areas where high-quality data were limited, and no consensus could be reached, including mesh type, component separation technique, and management of complex patients.

Conclusions

Although there was consensus, supported by grade A-C evidence, on patient selection, the safety of short-term nonoperative management, and mesh reinforcement, among experts; there was limited evidence and broad variability in practice patterns in all other areas of practice. The lack of strong evidence and expert consensus on these topics has identified gaps in knowledge where there is need of further evidence.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^08ea492c]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative imaging

Preoperative imaging aims to define CVH morphology, content, abdominal muscular quality and identify any complication(s) that would compromise repair (since a large proportion will be recurrences). Table 1 describes the items that the authors include routinely in their reports. Imaging these patients is challenging because morbid obesity is the rule rather than the exception. For this reason, CT assumes prominence; the authors too frequently find patients exceed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) bores and/or their defect too extensive for effective sonography. Intravenous contrast is probably unnecessary in most cases.

Table 1
Suggested dataset for the preoperative radiological reporting of complex ventral hernia

Preoperative CT will indicate the precise location of the hernia and provides prognostic information regarding the scale of subsequent surgery; for example, smaller hernias may be closed using mesh alone (Fig. 5) whereas larger defects will need additional component separation (Fig. 6). Clinical examination by the surgeon will usually provide extensive information regarding precise anatomical site but imaging may provide unexpected information. Hernia extent on CT will also help indicate the scale of subsequent abdominal and cardiovascular insult (fluid loss is considerable during extensive CVH repair), so that appropriate preoperative conditioning, intraoperative support and postoperative care can be scheduled. Ultimately, by imaging the true extent of the hernia, CT is able to indicate which can be dealt with by "general" surgeons and which need attention from a CVH specialist.

### CT of complex ventral hernias: a guide to reporting [^8e06a716]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex ventral hernias (CVHs) represent a subset of incisional hernias so large that they can not be reduced by standard operative techniques without an unacceptable risk of recurrence or potentially dangerous complications. They are debilitating to patients, causing pain, sores and immobility and their incidence is increasing worldwide due to rising operation numbers, an ageing population and increased obesity levels. The field of CVH repair has become its own surgical subspeciality, with the development of CVH multidisciplinary team meetings and tertiary hernia repair centres being established across the world. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) has become one of the most important aspects of CVH repair planning, providing information which cannot be clinically assessed. This includes defect measurements, muscle quality evaluation, evidence of previous hernia repair, and metrics such as domain loss calculations and the rectus defect ratio. Together, this information can be combined with the clinical examination to determine the best surgical course. Unfortunately, there is evidence that when confronted with a CVH on CT radiologists provide reports missing important metrics and reporting information of limited value. This imaging review provides a comprehensive summary of all of the features which should be included in a CT report for CVH assessment, together with the methods used to generate metrics, where appropriate. An illustrative overview of the surgical techniques used to approach CVH repair is provided as well as an up-to-date summary of mesh plane position nomenclature.

### Open repair of ventral incisional hernias [^8c88d251]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Despite advances in many fields of surgery, incisional hernias still remain a significant problem. There is a lack of general consensus among surgeons regarding optimal treatment. A surgeon's approach is often based on tradition rather than clinical evidence. The surgeon's treatment plan should be comprehensive, with attention focused not merely on restoration of structural continuity. An understanding of the structural and functional anatomy of the abdominal wall and an appreciation of the importance of restoring dynamic function are necessary for the successful reconstruction of the abdominal wall.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^f1731d9e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

C. Diagnosis — Guideline 4 states that while most ventral hernias are easily diagnosed based on clinical exam, a preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound may be considered for select patients with suspected ventral hernias to confirm the diagnosis or to aid the surgeon with preoperative planning (Moderate quality, strong recommendation). Diagnosis is typically made during the history and physical examination, but imaging can detect occult or recurrent hernias and assist planning: in a retrospective review of 146 consecutive LVHR's, 48% of patients had occult defects not detected on preoperative physical exam; in one study, recurrence diagnosis after mesh repair was correct 88% on physical exam versus 98% on CT; and dynamic abdominal sonography for ventral hernia diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity 98% and specificity 88%, with PPV 91% and NPV 97%, identifying hernias in a few more patients than CT. Preoperative CT is also helpful in defining abdominal wall anatomy in non-midline hernias and identifying posterior abdominal wall defects, and it accurately assesses relationships to adjacent structures and defect size to support surgical planning.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^7c979252]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical problem

While most ventral hernias are repaired easily, CVH poses specific problems. The anatomical defect is large and complex, and surgeons frequently encounter morbid obesity, infection, enterocutaneous fistula and stomas. Accordingly, recurrence is common, reaching 27% at just 1 year for patients whose BMI exceeds 35, versus 8.3% for those under 25. A wide variety of surgical techniques are available, along with a sizeable range of mesh, used to close the defect. Lack of consensus regarding the optimal surgical approach and material complicates the issue further.

Why should we repair CVH if surgery is so risky? CVH causes chronic back pain, abdominal discomfort and poor respiratory function. Patients with large, heavy hernias are unstable and often wheelchair bound. CVH inevitably means poor quality of life. Furthermore, hernia research is neglected: Professor Michael Rosen, Director of the Cleveland Clinic Hernia Centre, has said, "When hernia surgery goes wrong, it results in some of the most despondent, challenged patients with the worst quality of life who are desperate for improvements. This is hard to imagine, because hernia surgery is probably the most common surgery performed by general surgeons". Going on to state, "Hernia disease has been one of the most neglected procedures in the field of general surgery. There has been very little innovation during the past 50 years". Prof. Poulose of Vanderbilt University Medical Centre has stated, "If a patient has colon cancer he can expect virtually the same treatment anywhere in the world but if a patient has an abdominal wall hernia, his treatment can vary significantly between countries, states, hospitals and even within the same practice".

### Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [^873b6cf7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The laparoscopic approach to ventral hernia repair is a safe and effective approach for both elective and emergent repair. The preoperative technical considerations include assessment of incarceration and potential for extensive adhesiolysis, size of defect, and atypical hernia locations. Preoperative considerations include weight loss and lifestyle modification. There are multiple methods of fascial defect closure and mesh fixation that the surgeon may consider via a laparoscopic approach, making it adaptable to varying clinical scenarios and anatomic challenges. Compared with open repair laparoscopic repair is associated with reduced surgical wound site infection, and compared with robotic repair outcomes are similar.

### Expert consensus for key features of operative reports of ventral hernia [^fbdc7d3f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Operative reports are important documents; however, standards for critical elements of operative reports are general and often vague. Hernia surgery is one of the most common procedures performed by general surgeons, so the aim of this project was to develop a Delphi consensus on critical elements of a ventral hernia repair operative report.

Study Design

The Delphi method was used to establish consensus on key features of operative reports for ventral hernia repair. An expert panel was selected and questionnaires were distributed. The first round of voting was open-ended to allow participants to recommend what details should be included. For the second round the questionnaire was distributed with the items that did not have unanimous responses along with free text comments from the first round.

Results

Eighteen surgeons were approached, of which 11 completed both rounds. Twenty items were on the initial questionnaire, of which 11 had 100% agreement. Of the remaining 9 items, after the second questionnaire an additional 7 reached consensus.

Conclusion

Ventral hernia repairs are a common and challenging problem and often require reoperations. Surgeons frequently refer to previous operative notes to guide future procedures, which requires detailed and comprehensive operative reports. This Delphi consensus was able to identify key components needed for an operative report describing ventral hernia repair.

### Risk factors for surgical complications in ventral hernia repair [^b0ee276a]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Incisional hernia is a common complication after abdominal surgery and occurs in approximately 10–25% of patients undergoing laparotomy. There are several factors affecting the risk of incisional hernia development. Age, obesity, infection, immunomodulating therapy, diabetes and smoking are well-known factors. Several choices made by the surgeon can also affect the occurrence of incisional hernia: suture technique (small bites), suture material and location of the incision. Up to 30% of these hernias require repair since incisional hernia is an important cause of morbidity. At present, there is insufficient Grade A data to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding key steps in the treatment algorithm of ventral hernia. This hampers risk–benefit analysis when evaluating the patient prior to ventral hernia repair, and management is largely based on the preference of the surgeon.

For more than a decade now, open mesh hernia repair has become the standard procedure for ventral hernia repair. Many surgeons consider sublay repair to be the gold standard for incisional hernia repair. In a recent meta-analysis of studies comparing sublay to onlay repair, however, only surgical site infection (SSI) rate differed, with a lower frequency in sublay repair. No differences in recurrence rate were seen, though there was a trend towards more recurrences in the onlay group, and seroma formation was equally distributed between the two groups. Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is increasing in popularity, and short-term results of studies comparing SSI rates between LVHR and open techniques are promising. More research comparing ventral hernia repair techniques is required, especially long-term follow-up studies, in view of the risk for material-related complications associated with the intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique (IPOM), where mesh is in close contact with the intestine.

### Laparoscopic versus open ventral hernia repair [^7ff82d0e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Ventral hernia repair remains one of the most common operations performed by general surgeons. Despite the frequency with which this procedure is performed, there is little agreement and extensive controversy as to the cause of most of the hernias, or the ideal approach to repair these complicated problems. This article attempts to identify and provide some clarification of these controversial issues in abdominal wall reconstruction after ventral herniation based on the available literature.

### Epidemiology and disparities in care: the impact of socioeconomic status, gender, and race on the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients undergoing ventral hernia repair [^f010bb3d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

More research is needed with regards to gender, race, and socioeconomic status on ventral hernia presentation, management, and outcomes. The role of culture and geography in hernia-related health care remains unknown. Currently existing nationwide registries have thus far yielded at best a modest overview of disparities in hernia care. The significant variation in care relative to gender, race, and socioeconomic status suggests that there is room for improvement in providing consistent care for patients with hernias.

### What exactly is meant by "Loss of domain" for ventral hernia? Systematic review of definitions [^3c95826f]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, a future volumetric definition of LOD may include subtypes of hernia by incorporating hernia neck width into the classification. Large hernias with narrow necks present a different surgical challenge compared to those with wide necks. In clinical practice, abdominal wall surgeons use hernia morphology to decide upon surgical approach and reconstructive techniques. Similarly, the possible array of post-operative outcomes is likely to be dependent on hernia morphology. As yet a descriptor that distinguishes between subtypes of giant hernia by neck width, or any other parameter, does not exist and future work into this is warranted.

Establishing an internationally accepted classification for LOD is the next step. To facilitate this, we intend to carry out a Delphi consensus study working with academic hernia surgeons. Several of the surgeons on the Delphi panel will be leading members of the American Hernia Society, the British Hernia Society, the European Hernia Society, and the Asian and Pacific Hernia Society. During the rounds of voting, panellists will be presented with the four written definitions and two volumetric definitions discovered by this systematic review and asked to pick their preference. Panellists will be asked to suggest improvements and alterations to their chosen definition. We will challenge panellists to establish a standardised definition that can be applied to all hernia subtypes (i.e.g.iant inguinal, diaphragmatic, and ventral hernias). After publication of our classification, the authors will seek endorsement from the international hernia societies to aid propagation and acceptance of this classification.

### Ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients: a suggested algorithm for operative repair [^93b1afe6]. Obesity Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

With the rise in prevalence of obesity, most general surgeons will have to face the problem of the obese patient with an abdominal wall defect. Treatment of these bariatric patients raises unique challenges, and at this time there is still no consensus on the best treatment option. This study was performed in a high-volume bariatric and minimally invasive surgery center at a tertiary care facility in the USA. Twenty-eight morbidly obese patients treated at our facility between 2003 and 2008 were separated into four groups according to anatomic features and symptoms. Patients with the following characteristics were classified as having a favorable anatomy: body mass index not exceeding 50 kg/m(2), gynecoid body habitus, reducible hernias found in a central location, abdominal wall thickness less than 4 cm, and the defect's largest diameter not exceeding 8 cm. All other patients were classified as having an unfavorable anatomy. In this study, we report a systematic treatment approach for the morbidly obese patient presenting with a ventral hernia based on whether the hernia is symptomatic or asymptomatic, as well as the distinct characteristics of the hernia and body habitus features. We followed up on these patients postoperatively for at least 2 years, with a mean follow-up period of 30 months. Only a total of three hernia recurrences were observed. Successful treatment of ventral hernias in morbidly obese patients should be individualized based on the patient's symptoms and defined hernia characteristics.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^9b8d0b32]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — secondary port placement should be performed under direct vision and placed as lateral from the hernia defect as possible to allow the surgeon to work in an ergonomically favorable position for adhesiolysis and placement/fixation of the prosthetic (Moderate quality, Strong recommendation). Regarding placement location, it is desirable to have the ports as far lateral as possible to expose midline hernias and to be able place a large piece of mesh without interference. The operation is usually accomplished using 3–5 ports, and a larger port (10-12mm) is typically utilized for the insertion of the prosthetic mesh. There are usually three ports placed in the left lateral abdominal wall and 1–2 ports placed on the right. This pattern is often reversed in patients who have had previous left sided abdominal operations such as left colectomy or open splenectomy.

### Mesh location in open ventral hernia repair: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^9ad5ef81]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the ideal location for mesh placement in open ventral hernia repair (OVHR). We aim to identify the mesh location associated with the lowest rate of recurrence following OVHR using a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed for studies comparing at least two of four locations for mesh placement during OVHR (onlay, inlay, sublay, and underlay). Outcomes assessed were hernia recurrence and surgical site infection (SSI). Pairwise meta-analysis was performed to compare all direct treatment of mesh locations. A multiple treatment meta-analysis was performed to compare all mesh locations in the Bayesian framework. Sensitivity analyses were planned for the following: studies with a low risk of bias, incisional hernias, by hernia size, and by mesh type (synthetic or biologic). Twenty-one studies were identified (n = 5,891). Sublay placement of mesh was associated with the lowest risk for recurrence [OR 0.218 (95% CI 0.06–0.47)] and was the best of the four treatment modalities assessed [Prob (best) = 94.2%]. Sublay was also associated with the lowest risk for SSI [OR 0.449 (95% CI 0.12–1.16)] and was the best of the 4 treatment modalities assessed [Prob (best) = 77.3%]. When only assessing studies at low risk of bias, of incisional hernias, and using synthetic mesh, the probability that sublay had the lowest rate of recurrence and SSI was high. Sublay mesh location has lower complication rates than other mesh locations. While additional randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings, this network meta-analysis suggests the probability of sublay being the best location for mesh placement is high.

### Mesh overlap for ventral hernia repair in current practice [^6aba0e1c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sufficient overlap of mesh beyond the borders of a ventral hernia helps prevent hernia recurrence. Guidelines from the European Hernia Society and American Hernia Society recommend ≥ 2 cm overlap for open repair of < 1-cm hernias, ≥ 3-cm overlap for open repair of 1-4-cm hernias, ≥ 5-cm overlap for open repair of > 4-cm hernias, and ≥ 5-cm overlap for all laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs. We evaluated whether current practice reflects this guidance.

Methods

We used the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Hernia Registry to evaluate patients who underwent elective ventral and umbilical hernia repair between 2020 and 2022. Mesh overlap was calculated as [(width of mesh - width of hernia)/2]. The main outcome was "sufficient overlap", defined based on published EHS and AHS guidelines. Explanatory variables included patient, operative, and hernia characteristics. The main analysis was a multivariable logistic regression to evaluate the association between explanatory variables and sufficient mesh overlap.

Results

4178 patients underwent ventral hernia repair with a mean age of 55.2 (13.9) years, 1739 (41.6%) females, mean body mass index (BMI) of 33.1 (7.2) kg/m², and mean hernia width of 3.7 (3.4) cm. Mean mesh overlap was 3.7 (2.5) cm and ranged from - 5.5 to 21.4 cm. Only 1074 (25.7%) ventral hernia repairs had sufficient mesh overlap according to published guidelines. Operative factors associated with increased odds of sufficient overlap included myofascial release (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.35 [95% CI 4.07–7.03]), minimally invasive approach (aOR 1.86 [95% CI 1.60–2.17]), and onlay mesh location (aOR 1.31 [95% CI 1.07–1.59]). Patient factors associated with increased odds of sufficient overlap included prior hernia repair (aOR 1.59 [95% CI 1.32–1.92]).

Conclusion

Although sufficient mesh overlap is recommended to prevent ventral hernia recurrence, only a quarter of ventral hernia repairs in a state-wide cohort of patients had sufficient overlap according to evidence-based guidelines. Factors strongly associated with sufficient overlap included myofascial release, mesh type, and laparoscopic repair.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^578e3145]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Patients with CVH are referred increasingly for cross-sectional imaging and this review has attempted to familiarise radiologists with the pertinent surgical questions and the methods and procedures that are used in these patients. The hope is that radiologists will be better able to provide an informed report in this group of patients. Presently, imaging is most often deployed to determine preoperative hernia morphology and to identify and treat complications. However, it is likely that in the near future imaging will be requested to provide prognostic information regarding the type and extent of surgery needed to treat the hernia, and to predict the risk of its recurrence.

Chapter 14. How much overlap is necessary?

A. De Beaux, S Morales-Conde

Key questions:
Is there an optimal relation between the size/area of the defect and the size/area of the mesh regarding recurrence rate?
Should the overlap always be the same independent on the size of the defect?

Search terms

A Medline search using the previous search terms failed to produce any new papers of relevance to this topic. A Medline search on "laparoscopic repair" and "ventral hernia" identified a meta-analysis published in 2016 on the subject [LeBlanc 2016]. All titles and abstracts of papers published since this meta-analysis were reviewed, and papers of interest identified. The reference list of these papers was also reviewed to identify any further papers relevant to the topic. For the study of the original guidelines, read the publication in "Surg Endosc (2014) 28: page 22–23".

New publications

An updated meta-analysis related to the key question and two further cohort studies were identified.

New statements

New recommendations

Comments

A meta-analysis (1) of mesh overlap following laparoscopic ventral hernia, identified studies, grouped by mesh overlap less than 3 cm, 3–5 cm, and over 5 cm. Only 3 studies (1 published since 2012) were included in the last category. The pooled estimate of risk based on the extent of mesh overlap was 8.6, 4.6, and 1.4%, respectively, for the 3 categories given above. In the studies included for this meta-analysis, there were not enough studies to allow the comparison of hernia defect size to mesh overlap size. However, results from the limited dataset available suggested that the recurrence rate dropped with increasing area of mesh overlap for defects of all sizes. However, the meta-analysis commented that none of the studies were primarily set up to evaluate the extent of mesh overlap as a risk factor for recurrence. Heterogeneity between the studies was high; follow-up time was very short — in some studies less than a month; definition of assessment of recurrence was variable; and 50% of studies were retrospective cohorts. Since this meta-analysis was published, one further cohort study (2) has reported that increasing hernia defect size, and reducing overlap size, among other factors was related to the risk of hernia recurrence. 185 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs with 13 (7%) recurrence rate was reported.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^7900cc37]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Overview of surgical techniques

Broadly defined as "a protrusion of tissues through a defect of the anterior abdominal wall", ventral hernias represent a highly prevalent but heterogeneous problem in general surgery. The European Hernia Society (EHS) categorizes abdominal wall hernias as either primary or incisional. The former group includes midline (epigastric and umbilical) and lateral (spigelian and lumbar) hernias, which are classified according to their size (< 2 cm, > 4 cm, or intermediate). Congenital or acquired umbilical hernias represent the most common primary hernias.

An incisional hernia is defined as "any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging from incisional hernias". Incisional hernias develop after any abdominal surgery, with an incidence approaching 20%, and are increasingly encountered because of increased life expectancy and the high prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. Recurrences after repair of primary hernias fall in the incisional group.

### Mind the gap: imaging spectrum of abdominal ventral hernia repair complications [^5a1bfa6f]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventral hernia repair with or without mesh placement is a commonly done procedure. Laparoscopic approach is more preferred than open in recent surgical practice. Complications occur as like any other abdominal surgeries and are dependent on multiple factors. Complications such as collections, adhesions, and related changes are non-specific. Specific complications related to hernia repair include recurrent hernia, mesh infection, mesh migration, and fistula formation. Post inguinal hernia repair chronic inguinal pain is gaining more attention with increasing use of image-guided nerve interventions for symptomatic management. Imaging plays a vital role in defining and delineating the type and extent of complications. Prior knowledge of the surgical indication and technique helps in better imaging interpretation of complications. This article describes the role of imaging in diagnosis of complications in general ventral hernia surgery setting.

### Imaging complex ventral hernias, their surgical repair, and their complications [^bc41b009]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Surprisingly, there is no generally accepted definition of CVH. Multiple different and overlapping classification systems have been identified. The European Hernia Society classifies CVH by location, defect size, reducibility, symptoms, and recurrence and an expert meeting reached consensus on 22 individual patient and hernia variables that could be used to define CVH. Slater and co-workers stated that CVH could be defined as a "large-sized abdominal wall hernia", defining this as a transverse defect with a diameter of 10 cm or more, while the "abdominal" location could include midline ventral, parastomal, lateral and lumbar locations. In terms of size, they defined CVH as "loss of domain" of 20% or more. Other authors have used a figure of 30%. Loss of domain is increasingly important and describes the ratio of the hernia sac volume to the residual abdominopelvic cavity. A ratio of 20% or more means that one-sixth or more of the abdominopelvic content is within the hernia sac rather than the abdominopelvic cavity. Large hernias decrease abdominal wall elasticity, and cause muscular atrophy and diaphragmatic descent. Forceful return of viscera to the abdominopelvic cavity can precipitate cardiorespiratory impairment or abdominal compartment syndrome.

Surgical techniques

Two innovations have exerted profound influence on CVH repair: the development of prosthetic mesh able to cover large defects and "component separation", popularised by Ramirez and co-workers. Both are usually combined for large CVH.

Ventral/incisional hernia — prosthetic sizing to reduce recurrence risk: Generally, the larger the defect is, the more stress will be placed on the fixation points of the prosthetic, and as the size of the prosthetic increases, the prosthetic area: defect area ratio will increase, and the tension on the prosthetic fixation sites will decrease. Since all defects are of different sizes and shapes and in a variety of locations, it is important that surgeons consider the total area encompassing all defects in a patient, rather than basing their prosthetic calculation on the largest or dominant defect; in patients with an incisional hernia from a previous midline incision with multiple hernia defects, it is more useful for choosing the right sized prosthetic to refer to the entire area as a single defect, encompassing the entire gap between the rectus muscles. Table 3 summarizes factors that are associated with choice of prosthetic size when considering recurrence as the primary outcome measure, but since there are few data available directly comparing the long-term outcomes of different prosthetics in humans, no recommendation can be made about a specific prosthetic, and as the defect becomes larger in size, these parameters will be more important in determining recurrence rates.

### Hernia emergencies [^a6f0726a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hernia emergencies are commonly encountered by the acute care surgeon. Although the location and contents may vary, the basic principles are constant: address the life-threatening problem first, then perform the safest and most durable hernia repair possible. Mesh reinforcement provides the most durable long-term results. Underlay positioning is associated with the best outcomes. Components separation is a useful technique to achieve tension-free primary fascial reapproximation. The choice of mesh is dictated by the degree of contamination. Internal herniation is rare, and preoperative diagnosis remains difficult. In all hernia emergencies, morbidity is high, and postoperative wound complications should be anticipated.

Chapter 5. Is there still a place for open suture repair depending on defect size?

J. Kukleta, S. Morales-Conde

Question:

Up to which defect size suture repair may be justified or should all ventral hernias repaired by a mesh?

Literature search

Search terms were "small hernia" AND "non-mesh repair" AND "suture repair" AND "recurrence" AND "infection", "umbilical hernia", "epigastric hernia", AND mesh repair, "incisional hernia" AND "ventral hernia".

A systematic search was performed in September 2017 using Pubmed, Medline, and reference lists from January 2001 to September 2017 in order to pick up eventually missed articles in the previous search in 2012. Additional separate search was done in Pubmed, Springer link, BJS, and reference lists manually from 2012 till September 2017 using the filters for higher level of evidence.

Of the 5566 titles screened for small hernia (4764 for umbilical hernia and 716 for epigastric hernia), 646 for small hernia (179 for umbilical and 68 for epigastric) were checked. After adding Meta-Analysis, Randomized controlled trial, 5 years, and systematic review as filter 78 articles met the search criteria. Three Meta-analyses and nine RCTs are relevant for this review.

After thorough analysis of previous statements and recommendations ("Surg Endosc (2014) 28: page 12–14"), previous relevant literature and recently published articles of higher level of evidence the statements and recommendations remain valid.

Still several aspects of reporting have changed. The focus on the outcomes of the repair of small hernias (umbilical, epigastric, trocar hernias) has additionally widened from recurrence and infection to, e.g. readmission rate, acute and chronic pain, comparison of different devices, different approaches, or different positions of prosthetic material within the abdominal wall. The existing literature contains several new statements and recommendations.

### Year-over-year ventral hernia recurrence rates and risk factors [^6e34319f]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Recurrence is one of the most challenging adverse events after ventral hernia repair as it impacts quality of life, utilization of resources, and subsequent need for re-repair. Rates of recurrence range from 30% to 80% after ventral hernia repair.

Objective

To determine the contemporary ventral hernia recurrence rate over time in patients with previous hernia repair and to determine risk factors associated with recurrence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, population-based study used the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative registry to evaluate year-over-year recurrence rates in patients with prior ventral hernia repair between January 2012 and August 2022. Patients who underwent at least 1 prior ventral hernia repair were included and categorized into 2 groups based on mesh or no-mesh use. There were 43 960 eligible patients; after exclusion criteria (patients with concurrent inguinal hernias as the primary diagnosis, nonstandard hernia procedure categories, American Society of Anesthesiologists class unassigned, or no follow-up), 29 834 patients were analyzed in the mesh group and 5599 in the no-mesh group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Ventral hernia recurrence rates. Risk factors analyzed include age, body mass index, sex, race, insurance type, medical comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, smoking, indication for surgery, concomitant procedure, hernia procedure type, myofascial release, fascial closure, fixation type, number of prior repairs, hernia width, hernia length, mesh width, mesh length, operative approach, prior mesh placement, prior mesh infection, mesh location, mesh type, postoperative surgical site occurrence, postoperative surgical site infection, postoperative seroma, use of drains, and reoperation.

Results

Among 29 834 patients with mesh, the mean (SD) age was 57.17 (13.36) years, and 14 331 participants (48.0%) were female. Among 5599 patients without mesh, the mean (SD) age was 51.9 (15.31) years, and 2458 participants (43.9%) were female. When comparing year-over-year hernia recurrence rates in patients with and without prior mesh repair, respectively, the Kaplan Meier analysis showed a recurrence rate of 201 cumulative events with 13 872 at risk (2.8%) vs 104 cumulative events with 1707 at risk (4.0%) at 6 months; 411 cumulative events with 4732 at risk (8.0%) vs 184 cumulative events with 427 at risk (32.6%) at 1 year; 640 cumulative events with 1518 at risk (19.7%) vs 243 cumulative events with 146 at risk (52.4%) at 2 years; 731 cumulative events with 670 at risk (29.3%) vs 258 cumulative events with 73 at risk (61.4%) at 3 years; 777 cumulative events with 337 at risk (38.5%) vs 267 cumulative events with 29 at risk (71.2%) at 4 years; and 798 cumulative events with 171 at risk (44.9%) vs 269 cumulative events with 19 at risk (73.7%) at 5 years. Higher body mass index; immunosuppressants; incisional and parastomal hernias; a robotic approach; greater hernia width; use of a biologic or resorbable synthetic mesh; and complications, such as surgical site infections and reoperation, were associated with higher odds of hernia recurrence. Conversely, greater mesh width, myofascial release, and fascial closure had lower odds of recurrence. Hernia type was the most important variable associated with recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, the 5-year recurrence rate after ventral hernia repair was greater than 40% and 70% in patients with and without mesh, respectively. Rates of ventral hernia recurrence increased over time, underscoring the importance of close, long-term follow up in this population.

### Radiographic distribution as a diagnostic clue in pulmonary disease [^6fa68b0c]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Because some disease processes produce radiographic abnormalities that occur in characteristic distributions in the chest, classifying the position and appearance of these suggestive features and the underlying diseases provides a tool by which diagnostic accuracy might be improved. The goal of this review is to offer to the chest clinician a taxonomy of these disease entities that can produce characteristic chest radiographic distributions. These radiographic distributions often reflect anatomic or physiologic conditions that drive the radiographic appearance; for example, foramen of Morgagni diaphragmatic hernias most commonly present in the right ventral chest, consistent with the anatomic location of the diaphragmatic foramen. This taxonomy includes 3 distributional categories: (1) upper versus lower lung zone-predominant processes, (2) central versus peripheral processes, and (3) processes with distinctive focal locations, eg, "photonegative appearance" as in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. It is hoped that this taxonomy aids the chest clinician in generating and streamlining a differential diagnosis and in ascertaining the specific cause of diseases with radiographic abnormalities.

### Mesh fixation techniques in primary ventral or incisional hernia repair [^25d63a5b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of a mesh in primary ventral or incisional hernia repair lowers the recurrence rate and is the accepted standard of care for larger defects. In laparoscopic primary ventral or incisional hernia repair the insertion of a mesh is indispensable. Different mesh fixation techniques have been used and refined over the years. The type of fixation technique is claimed to have a major impact on recurrence rates, chronic pain, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and complication rates.

Objectives

To determine the impact of different mesh fixation techniques for primary and incisional ventral hernia repair on hernia recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications.

Search Methods

On 2 October 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE(R)) Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R)), Ovid Embase, and two trials registries. We also performed handsearches, and contacted experts from the European Hernia Society (EHS).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with primary ventral or incisional hernia that compared different types of mesh fixation techniques (absorbable/nonabsorbable sutures, absorbable/nonabsorbable tacks, fibrin glue, and combinations of these techniques).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in standardised piloted tables, or if necessary, directly into Review Manager 5. We assessed risks of bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently selected the publications, and extracted data on results. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. For pooling we used an inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis or the Peto method in the case of rare events. We prepared GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables. For laparoscopic repair we considered absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks, and nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures as key comparisons.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with a total of 787 participants. The number of randomised participants ranged from 40 to 199 per comparison. Eight studies included participants with both primary and incisional ventral hernia. One study included only participants with umbilical hernia, and another only participants with incisional hernia. Hernia size varied between studies. We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high. Absorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable tacks Recurrence rates in the groups were similar (RR 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.22; 2 studies, 101 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks and nonabsorbable tacks in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to nonabsorbable sutures At six months there was one recurrence in each group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.79; 1 study, 36 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between nonabsorbable tacks and nonabsorbable sutures in recurrence because the certainty of evidence was very low. Evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up and chronic pain is negligible. We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures No recurrence was observed at one year (very low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain was higher in the tacks group (VAS 0–10: MD -2.70, 95% CI -6.67 to 1.27; 1 study, 48 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between absorbable tacks compared to absorbable sutures in early postoperative pain because the certainty of evidence was very low. The MD for late follow-up pain was -0.30 (95% CI -0.74 to 0.14; 1 study, 48 participants). We found no study that assessed HRQOL. Combination of different fixation types (tacks and sutures) or materials (absorbable and nonabsorbable) There were mostly negligible or only small differences between combinations (e.g. tacks plus sutures) compared to a single technique (e.g. sutures only), as well as combinations compared to other combinations (e.g. absorbable sutures combined with nonabsorbable sutures compared to absorbable tacks combined with nonabsorbable tacks) in all outcomes. It is uncertain whether there is an advantage for combining different fixation types or materials for recurrence, chronic pain, HRQOL and complications, because the evidence certainty was very low or low, or we found no study on important outcomes. Nonabsorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant The two studies showed different directions of effects: one showed higher rates for nonabsorbable tacks, and the other showed higher rates for fibrin sealant. Low-certainty evidence suggests that the difference between groups in early postoperative, late follow-up, chronic pain and HRQOL is negligible. Absorbable tacks compared to fibrin sealant One recurrence in the tacks group and none in the fibrin sealant group were noted after one year (low certainty of evidence). Early postoperative pain might be slightly lower using tacks (VAS 0–100; MD -12.40, 95% CI -27.60 to, 2.80;1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). The pattern of pain and HRQOL course over time (up to 1 year) was similar in the groups (low certainty of evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently none of the techniques can be considered superior to any other, because the certainty of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^fa3bc611]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to classify ventral and incisional hernias as well as which classification should be recommended?

Classification systems are necessary to structure the way scientific knowledge is collected and analyzed. Because the documented benefit flowing from the introduction and use of the tumor-node-metastasis tumor classification and the International Classification of Diseases, the value of other classification systems for diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic decision has been confirmed, aside from their benefits in patients counseling.

Classifications for ventral and incisional hernias were first proposed by Chevrel and Rath [52], followed by Korenkov et al. [63], Ammaturo et al. [51], Chowbey et al. [53], Dietz et al. [56], Muysoms et al. [70], and Hadeed et al. [58]. Some agreement exists regarding the basic criteria of morphology and size of the hernia gap, although none has gained widespread acceptance in the literature. The classification proposed by the European Hernia Society (EHS) [70] is the result of a comprehensive discussion of the criteria to be included and also of how to precise and define them. The EHS classification generally is regarded as an improvement on the previous classifications.

Are the classification criteria included in the EHS classification consistent?

The following discussion illustrates the clinical importance of the classification criteria [61, 77]. The scarcity of evidence is illustrated in Fig. 1. Recurrence rating provides important information on the patient's hernia history. The term "recurrence rating" comprises first the distinction between ventral and incisional hernias and second the designation of incisional hernias in the subcategory of recurrent incisional hernias. The number of previous repairs has been demonstrated to increase the risk of postoperative seroma [60]. The incidence of SSI is increased in patients with recurrent incisional hernias [57] and is related to the surgical technique [62]. The incidence of postoperative complications is twice as high among patients with incisional hernias as among those with ventral hernias [57].

### Computed tomography in ventral hernia diagnosis: have we improved? A quality improvement initiative [^51b2948b]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggest that agreement between readers of computed tomography (CT) scans for the diagnosis of a ventral hernia (VH) is poor (32% agreement, κ = 0.21). Recommendations were developed by surgeons and radiologists after determining common reasons for disagreement among CT reviewers; however, the long-term effect of adoption of these recommendations has not been assessed. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to determine whether the incorporation of recommendations developed by surgeons and radiologists improves agreement among reviewers of CT scans in diagnosing a VH.

Methods

A prospective cohort of patients, with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the past 1 y, attending a surgery clinic at a single institution was enrolled. Enrolled subjects underwent a standardized physical examination by a trained hernia surgeon to determine the likelihood of a clinical VH (no, indeterminate, or yes). The QI intervention was the distribution and implementation of previously described recommendations. After a year of intervention, independent radiologists assessed patients' CT scans for the presence or absence of a VH. Percent agreement and kappa were calculated to determine interobserver reliability. In-person discussion on scans with disagreement was held, and the results were used as a "gold standard" to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for CT scan diagnosis of a VH.

Results

A total of 79 patients were included in the study. After QI intervention, seven radiologists agreed on 43% of the scans, and κ was 0.50 (P < 0.001). Agreement was highest among patients with a high clinical likelihood of a VH and lowest among patients with an indeterminate clinical likelihood. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.369 and 0.833, respectively.

Conclusions

After the implementation of recommendations, there is improved agreement among radiologists reading CT scans for the diagnosis of a VH. However, there is substantial room for improvement, and CT scans for the diagnosis of VH is not ready for widespread use.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS))-part a… [^6eb4ee49]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Research:

In our chapter published in the original guidelines it was emphasized that the knowledge of complex systems and increasing complexity impacts our understanding of the variability we see for the patient with a ventral/incisional hernia. Variability that can impact outcomes for ventral/incisional hernia repair may include patient factors, technique variability, surgeon skill, variability in mesh characteristics, and the variability in both the environmental conditions present in the patient's home living conditions, as well as at the facility where treatment occurs. Studies on the variability of ventral/incisional hernias are few, but a comparison of studies of different types of ventral/incisional hernias clearly shows a large variety of outcomes based upon many complex factors.

One variable that currently has been studied is the type of ventral hernia, primary or incisional. Studies have consistently shown that the outcomes of these two types of ventral hernias are different, so it would be inappropriate to combine them when attempting to study ventral hernia repair (1–6). But, the science is more complex than that. It is too simple to just look at primary vs. incisional hernia. Some sub-populations of primary hernias will have more risk/worse outcomes than some sub-populations of incisional/secondary hernias. Because in the real world of complex systems science, we cannot uncouple the many factors that combine to result in many potential outcomes. We know that many factors like BMI, smoking, collagen disease, diabetes, can impact outcomes (and we will need to understand the complex interactions between factors), and we have even discovered that a patient's cognitive/emotional state has a major impact on outcomes, but that is rarely being measured or modified/optimized preoperatively yet [7, 8]. Because of constant change and uncontrollable patient variability, learning to apply the principles of complex systems science will be essential to better understand the optimal treatment for complex disease processes, such as ventral/incisional hernia disease.

### Laparoscopic ventral / incisional hernia repair: updated consensus development conference based guidelines [^fa5af7a6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Executive board of the Italian Society for Endoscopic Surgery (SICE) promoted an update of the first evidence-based Italian Consensus Conference Guidelines 2010 because a large amount of literature has been published in the last 4 years about the topics examined and new relevant issues.

Methods

The scientific committee selected the topics to be addressed: indications to surgical treatment including special conditions (obesity, cirrhosis, diastasis recti abdominis, acute presentation); safety and outcome of intraperitoneal meshes (synthetic and biologic); fixing devices (absorbable/non-absorbable); abdominal border and parastomal hernia; intraoperative and perioperative complications; and recurrent ventral/incisional hernia. All the recommendations are the result of a careful and complete literature review examined with autonomous judgment by the entire panel. The process was supervised by experts in methodology and epidemiology from the most qualified Italian institution. Two external reviewers were designed by the EAES and EHS to guarantee the most objective, transparent, and reliable work. The Oxford hierarchy (OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group*. "The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence") was used by the panel to grade clinical outcomes according to levels of evidence. The recommendations were based on the grading system suggested by the GRADE working group.

Results and Conclusions

The availability of recent level 1 evidence (a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs) allowed to recommend that not only laparoscopic repair is an acceptable alternative to the open repair, but also it is advantageous in terms of shorter hospital stay and wound infection rate. This conclusion appears to be extremely relevant in a clinical setting. Indications about specific conditions could also be issued: laparoscopy is recommended for the treatment of recurrent ventral hernias and obese patients, while it is a potential option for compensated cirrhotic and childbearing-age female patients. Many relevant and controversial topics were thoroughly examined by this consensus conference for the first time. Among them are the issue of safety of the intraperitoneal mesh placement, traditionally considered a major drawback of the laparoscopic technique, the role for the biologic meshes, and various aspects of the laparoscopic approach for particular locations of the defect such as the abdominal border or parastomal hernias.

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and the Study Register, as well as a search of relevant journals and reference lists including publications until 6 June 2012. The following search terms were used in the search strategy: "operation" AND "watchful waiting" AND ("Hernia" [Mesh]) OR "Hernia; Abdominal" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Ventral" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Umbilical" [Mesh] OR ("Abdominal wall hernias") OR ("ventral hernia") OR ("epigastric hernia") OR ("incisional hernia") AND (randomized controlled trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial[pt]). The search produced 462 hits including inguinal hernias. Of the 42 relevant papers found, 28 were selected for this analysis. The only two level 1b trials addressed inguinal hernias and were included with intention to discuss the existing evidence in a related field. Regarding data addressing ventral and incisional hernias, only one level 3 study and 15 level 4 uncontrolled studies were found.

Statements

Recommendations

No precise data on the incidence and prevalence of ventral and incisional hernias are available. An epidemiologic study showed an increasing proportion of midline abdominal wall hernias, with a relative frequency of 19% for umbilical/par umbilical hernias, 8.6% for epigastric hernias, and 4.8% for incisional hernias [78]. The incidence for incisional hernia is 10–20% [79, 80], making it one of the most common surgical complication after laparotomy.

Ventral and incisional hernias are treated with surgery to relieve symptoms (pain and discomfort), to prevent complications (strangulation, respiratory dysfunction, or skin problems), or to resolve acute complications (incarceration and strangulation) [95].

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — patient selection and operative complexity are outlined with reported conversion rates 'between 0–14% in series with over 50 patients', where higher rates may reflect 'poor patient selection, severe adhesions, incarcerated hernia content impossible to reduce and/or inadequate training and expertise'. Decision-making emphasizes that 'surgeons must use their judgment when determining whether to perform a laparoscopic or open ventral hernia repair', and 'it appears prudent to recommend that less experienced surgeons should start with less complex cases'. A study 'analyzing 180 cases of a prospectively collected database found a number of clinical factors that significantly increased operative time (which was used as a surrogate of laparoscopic repair complexity)', with 'adhesiolysis and prior ventral hernia repair(s)' as 'the most significant factors influencing operative time'. Additional factors increasing complexity include 'large defects (> 10cm diameter), hernias in unusual locations (subxiphoid, suprapubic, flank, etc.), incarcerated hernia, hernias with small defect size but large hernia sac, obesity, bowel distention, pregnancy, and presence of ascites'.

### Mind the gap: imaging spectrum of abdominal ventral hernia repair complications [^b064a10b]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventral hernia repair with or without mesh placement is a commonly done procedure either using laparoscopic approach or open techniques with former preferred than latter. Complications occur as like any other abdominal surgeries and are dependent on multiple factors. Complications such as collections, adhesions, and related changes are nonspecific and are common to any abdominal surgery. Specific complications related to hernia repair include recurrent hernia, mesh infection, mesh migration, fistula formation, and infertility. Post inguinal hernia repair chronic inguinal pain is being recognized more frequently with increasing use of image-guided nerve interventions for symptomatic management. Imaging plays a vital role in defining and delineating the type and extent of complications. Prior knowledge of the surgical indication and technique helps in better imaging interpretation of complications.

The various complications that can be encountered in post ventral hernia repair are summarized in Table 1. The overall incidence has a wide range. There are a variety of factors that influence the occurrence of complications in a post hernia repair. Complication rate depends on the type of hernia that is repaired, the surgical technique used including the mesh type, and the patient factors. Factors that influence the complications are summarized in Table 2.

### Multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study identifies novel candidate genes and pleiotropy effects across four abdominal hernia subtypes [^eb5da8fd]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the pleiotropic genes, we also identified shared genetic effects between pairs of hernia subtypes with 11 of 12 of the pairs primarily linked to inguinal hernia and another hernia subtype, except for NOG, a novel gene associated with both umbilical and ventral hernia subtypes. NOG codes for the noggin protein, which plays a role in regulating bone and cartilage development by inhibiting signaling pathways involved in growth, particularly the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Dysregulation of NOG expression could lead to imbalances in BMP signaling, which may alter the formation, maintenance, or repair of tissues involved in abdominal tissue wall hernias. As the majority of pleiotropic genes were mainly associated with inguinal hernia, along with one additional subtype, as well as the positive genetic correlations between the hernia subtypes, our study suggests there are some similarities in transcriptomic mechanisms underlying the different abdominal hernia subtypes. Conversely, as each hernia subtype manifests differently in the body, it is not surprising that most non-pleiotropic loci and genes are unique to each hernia subtype. While abdominal hernias are a common medical condition characterized by the protrusion of tissue or organs through weakened areas of muscle or connective tissue, the inguinal, femoral, umbilical and ventral subtypes differ in their anatomical location, pathophysiology, and risk factors. Specifically, inguinal hernias, the most prevalent, occur in the groin area and are more common in men. Femoral hernias are located in the femoral canal, which is the passage that carries major blood vessels to the leg, and occur more frequently in women. Umbilical hernias occur in the navel area and are often associated with conditions such as obesity, pregnancy, or increased intra-abdominal pressure, while ventral hernias occur in the abdominal wall, commonly at the site of a previous surgical incision. Given these clinical and pathophysiological specificities, separate analyses for each hernia subtype are crucial, as distinct genetic environmental and lifestyle risk factors may contribute to their development. Additionally, future research would benefit from subtype-specific studies that would provide insights into tailored prevention, treatment strategies, and precision medicine, thus improving patient outcomes. TWASs focusing on transcriptomic mechanisms offer an advanced approach to uncovering subtype-specific genomic contributions, further enhancing our understanding of abdominal hernia pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

Abdominal access and trocar placement — Guideline 10 states that the location of initial abdominal access (primary port placement) for LVHR should be as far from the hernia defect and prior laparotomy incisions as possible, with the ideal location for this port possibly the left or right upper quadrant, but location should be modified according to the patient's surgical history and anatomy (Moderate quality, Strong recommendation).

Guideline 27 — recognized intraoperative enterotomy during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair management states: "The laparoscopic repair of a hernia with a permanent synthetic mesh immediately following an enterotomy should be carefully considered in light of a paucity of evidence and the potential for infectious complications". "A tailored approach may include open or laparoscopic techniques, and should be based upon operative findings, degree of contamination, surgeon experience, and patient interests", and "The possibility of enterotomy and management options should be discussed with the patient preoperatively. (low quality, weak recommendation)". Additional context notes that "The incidence of enterotomy in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is reported to occur in up to 6% of patients, with injuries to the small intestine occurring much more commonly than injuries to the colon", and injuries may be managed under "two main categories: 1) enterotomy repair with hernia repair (lap or open; with or without permanent mesh), and 2) enterotomy repair with delayed hernia repair (lap or open; short or long delay; permanent mesh)", where delayed repair is "within the first week, or after 6–8 weeks postoperatively, respectively". Outcomes reported include that "Successful outcomes have been reported following enterotomy repair and concomitant implantation of a permanent synthetic mesh", and that primary closure of the hernia defect after visceral injury repair "will obviously eliminate the risk for mesh-related complications but carries a high risk for hernia recurrence".

### Complex abdominal wall hernias: a new classification system and approach to management based on review of 133 consecutive patients [^22853830]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Plastic surgeons are increasingly involved in the repair of complex ventral hernias. Although this typically involves recurrent incisional hernias, operative strategies can be applied to most abdominal wall defects, including chronic wounds with or without exposed mesh, enterocutaneous fistulas, or hernias associated with significant pannus formation.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of a single institution/single surgeon experience of complex ventral hernia repair performed over a 5-year period. Patients were classified into different hernia types based on their characteristics and underwent hernia repair according to the presented algorithm.

Results

A total of 133 patients underwent a complex ventral hernia repair between January 2005 and September 2009. The separation of components technique was used in the majority of cases. Permanent or biologic mesh was added in select patients. Adjunctive procedures were performed as indicated. The majority of short-term (less than 1 year) recurrences occurred in patients expected to have impaired wound healing due to comorbid conditions. In these patients, the recurrence rate was reduced when autologous repair was reinforced with mesh.

Conclusion

Autologous tissue is the preferred method for reconstruction of complex ventral hernias. In certain instances, such as contamination, use of an acellular dermal matrix mesh is added as a temporizing measure. A subset of patients who will be prone to recurrence remains. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm reliable and reproducible results.

A variety of factors also can be seen as having an impact on the postoperative course of patients undergoing ventral/incisional hernia repair. Studies evaluating factors related to the need for mesh removal showed that postoperative complications, recurrence rates, surgical-site infection (SSI), resource use, patient demographics (e.g. male sex, history of smoking), hernia characteristics (e.g. size of defect, incarceration), and technique factors (e.g. laparoscopic, open) all had the potential to contribute to outcome differences [20–24].

Another complex variable that can have a potential impact on outcomes of ventral/incisional hernia repair is the choice of mesh material. Although most synthetic meshes used currently produce good short-term results, any mesh could contribute to complications in a given subgroup of patients. A partial list of mesh-related complications includes infection requiring mesh removal, mesh mechanical failure, mesh bulging, chronic pain, chronic inflammatory reaction, and mesh erosion into abdominal viscera [25, 26]. With the number and variety of hernia meshes available for ventral/incisional hernia repair, this variable alone is sufficient to demonstrate that traditional research mechanisms (i.e. prospective RCTs) are inadequate to determine the mesh or meshes that have the best value for various patient groups, hernia types, techniques, surgeon skill levels, and so forth.

With an understanding of complexity science, complex systems, continuous learning, and continuous clinical quality improvement, we can begin to understand and improve value for patients who present with a ventral/incisional hernia. The starting point for this endeavor is the best current available evidence, much of which is contained in the remaining chapters of this document.

### ACute treatment of incisional ventral hernia (ACTIVE) [^c6913b58]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Incisional abdominal hernias are a common challenge for general surgeons, as a possible natural consequence of a considerable amount of abdominal wall trauma for laparotomic, laparoscopic, endoscopic, or robotic accesses. In Italy, almost 17. 000 cases per year of primitive and incisional hernias are diagnosed, leading to a wide necessity for surgical repair of abdominal wall defects, with a subsequent growing interest in the technical and technological aspects of this kind of surgery. In the last years, minimally invasive surgery has taken place more and more, due to the evident advantages in terms of surgical outcomes, increasing the technical laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic knowledge worldwide. Under these conditions, with technical and technological development constantly evolving, many centers started and consolidated a valid cure standard for primitive and incisional abdominal hernias with minimally invasive techniques.

The rationale of a minimally invasive approach to abdominal hernias, as for many other surgical fields, resides in consistent advantages in terms of postoperative pain, surgical site infection ratio, minor length of stay, smaller postoperative complications ratio, and therefore, a partial reduction in costs derived from laparoscopic, endoscopic and robotic equipment. Indication of a minimally invasive approach to incisional hernias derives principally from the evaluation of the surgical outcomes for those patients who could resent of laparotomic approach for surgical defect repair, counteracting intraoperative technical difficulties for surgeons.

From clinical practice and literature reviews, a minimally invasive approach to incisional hernias in non-elective settings appears nowadays still limited to stable patients, without an excessive intestinal dilatation upstream of intestinal incarceration, with a small-sized wall defect, but without a clear preoperative predictor of surgical outcomes. The ACTIVE studio aims to analyze and compare surgical outcomes of a non-elective approach to incisional hernias, with a specific focus on short- and long-term results for both laparotomic and laparoscopic techniques.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — initial entry site considerations include that, since many LVHRs are performed for midline hernias, it is recommended to access the abdomen off the midline, to avoid areas with potential adhesions of bowel. One of the largest retrospective series described placement of a Veress needle at least 10 cm away from the prior scar, preferentially 2 cm below the left costal margin in the mid clavicular line (Palmer's point), and the left upper quadrant (LUQ) is the most commonly reported initial entry site with all techniques. Regardless of the technique, the surgeon should have adequate training and/or experience with it in similar clinical situations.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) guideline — preamble, scope, and methodology — states that the goals of ventral hernia repair are relief of patient symptoms and/or cure with minimization of recurrence rates, and the document assists surgeons utilizing a laparoscopic approach in patient selection, operative technique, and postoperative care; it is not intended to debate merits of prosthetic use and specific prosthetic types. The disclaimer notes that guidelines indicate preferable approaches and recommendations are based on existing data or a consensus of expert opinion when little or no data are available; guidelines are intended to be flexible, and the surgeon must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient. Development occurred under the auspices of the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) with systematic research, review, and multidisciplinary input; the guideline was available for public comment for a period of 1 month prior to finalization, recommendations are considered valid at the time of production based on available data, and guidelines are scheduled for periodic review. Methods included a systematic MEDLINE search performed in March 2009 and updated in October 2012 using the terms "Hernia, Ventral/su [Surgery] + Laparoscopy + English + Human"; abstracts were reviewed by SAGES working group members, and duplicates, letters to the editor, articles not involving ventral, incisional or Spigelian hernias without direct correlation, and studies comparing different mesh types were not included.

Challenges of anatomic location of the hernia — costal margins and pericardium: Fixation above the costal margins should not be accomplished with sutures placed between the ribs, and while fixation with tacks may be feasible, it should generally be avoided to prevent lung or cardiac injury or injuries to the neurovascular bundles running along the inferior surface of each rib. There are multiple known cases of cardiac tamponade after ventral and hiatal hernia repair, mostly from tacking devices, but also from sutures near the pericardium, the majority of these cases resulted in mortality, and if fixation is deemed necessary near the pericardium, the diaphragm should be grasped and tented away from the pericardium, and a superficial suture, rather than a tack should be carefully placed.

Correct nomenclature: unified approach based on anatomical accuracy

We recommend that consistent nomenclature is used, based on a detailed appreciation of the abdominal wall anatomy. The correct anatomical description of the mesh planes in the abdominal wall is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. This has been described in the literature but has never been laid out in such detail. This anatomical description is shown with the correct abbreviated anatomical terms. The correct nomenclature or 'colloquial' terminology is also defined.

International Endohernia Society (IEHS) laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — urinary bladder catheter guidance: Placement of a urinary bladder catheter during LVHR should be determined based on the anticipated duration of the procedure and the location of the hernia, and for LVHR near the symphysis that requires dissection and prosthetic fixation to the pubic bone, the placement of a 3-way catheter should be considered to allow drainage and easy instillation of sterile saline solution to distend the bladder, which may help in recognizing and avoiding bladder injuries (Low quality, Weak recommendation). Incisional hernias near the symphysis generally require fixation to the inferior pubic ramus, with extraperitoneal dissection and mobilization of the bladder; placing a urinary bladder catheter before prepping and draping allows continuous drainage and monitoring of urine output, an empty bladder gives additional space in the abdominal cavity, and if a 3-way catheter is used the bladder can be filled with sterile saline while clamping the outflow temporarily to facilitate identification of the bladder and help prevent injury; in the event of a urinary bladder injury, a distended bladder may aid detection and repair.

### Onlay and sublay mesh in treatment of ventral hernia |… [^bf2a6dc4]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Onlay and Sublay Mesh in Treatment of Ventral HerniaClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Hernia is defined as aprotrusion of viscus or part of viscus usually within a peritonial sac through a defect in the abdominal wall. Ventral abdomenal hernias include all the hernias occuring through the anterior abdominal wall excluding groin hernias. Ventral hernia can be categorized according to their characteristic into reducible, irreducible or incarcerated, strangulated and recurrant ventral hernia. The cause of a primary ventral hernia ia s far from completely understood, but it is undoubtedly multifactorial. familial prediposing play a role with increasing evidance of connective tissue disorders, they are considered as a leading cause of abdominal surgery and account for 2–10% of all abdomenal wall hernias.

The repair of ventral hernia varies from primary closure, primary closure with an onlay mesh reinforcement, sublay mesh placement, and intraperitonial mesh placement. Primary closure techniques are usually performed for smal fascial defects less than 5 cm in the greaters diameter An onlay, usually of polyproptlene mesh is sutured to the anterior rectus sheeth after the fascial defect has been closed primary, thes type of repair has the potential advantage of keeping the mesh separeted from the abdomenal content by full abdominal muscle fascial wall thikness. The sublay placement of mesh, became popular in 1990, the recurence rates with this repair have been stated to be less than 10%. Procedure: Onlay Mesh

### Reporting guideline for interventional trials of primary and incisional ventral hernia repair [^b6ec13ff]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary and incisional ventral hernia trials collect unstandardized inconsistent data, limiting data interpretation and comparison. This study aimed to create two minimum data sets for primary and incisional ventral hernia interventional trials to standardize data collection and improve trial comparison. To support these data sets, standardized patient-reported outcome measures and trial methodology criteria were created.

Methods

To construct these data sets, nominal group technique methodology was employed, involving 15 internationally recognized abdominal wall surgeons and two patient representatives. Initially a maximum data set was created from previous systematic and panellist reviews. Thereafter, three stages of voting took place: stage 1, selection of the number of variables for data set inclusion; stage 2, selection of variables to be included; and stage 3, selection of variable definitions and detection methods. A steering committee interpreted and analysed the data.

Results

The maximum data set contained 245 variables. The three stages of voting commenced in October 2019 and had been completed by July 2020. The final primary ventral hernia data set included 32 variables, the incisional ventral hernia data set included 40 variables, the patient-reported outcome measures tool contained 25 questions, and 40 methodological criteria were chosen. The best known variable definitions were selected for accurate variable description. CT was selected as the optimal preoperative descriptor of hernia morphology. Standardized follow-up at 30days, 1year, and 5years was selected.

Conclusion

These minimum data sets, patient-reported outcome measures, and methodological criteria have allowed creation of a manual for investigators aiming to undertake primary ventral hernia or incisional ventral hernia interventional trials. Adopting these data sets will improve trial methods and comparisons.

Summary

The traditional human subjects clinical research approach to generating EBM guidelines alone is unable to produce improved value for patient care that will be significant and sustainable for our increasingly complex health care system. Specifically, the increasing variability in ventral/incisional hernia patients and technique options minimizes the value of applying traditional research methods to improve outcomes. We need to change our thinking and learn how to understand and implement research methods designed to address this increasing complexity so we can fully address health care challenges such as ventral/incisional hernia disease. This includes not only an evolution of traditional/current EBM but also an evolution of evidenced-based management in health care.

Because complex systems research is most often applied in the real world of patient care in the community, hospital, clinic, and even the academic medical center, we need to apply the principles of continuous learning and continuous clinical quality improvement to our regular patient care in addition to using traditional clinical research methods. As we apply these new principles (new to health care, although currently used in other industries) and learn how to use complexity science–driven data analytics, the patient clusters that emerge will guide our treatment options and lead to improved value for our entire system. We should do this by including the patient in a shared decision process as well as the entire medical team caring for the person who is the patient. Our focus on improving value for the patient should be our uncompromising purpose.

Is the routine application of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) recommended for the diagnosis of ventral hernias before laparoscopic ventral hernia repair?

Preoperative considerations — indications and patient selection: Surgeons should base their decision to perform laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) on the anticipated complexity of the operation, the resources available at their institutions, and their experience and training with this operation, and prior hernia repairs, large defect sizes, and incarcerated hernias increase the difficulty and duration of the procedure and should be taken into consideration by surgeons (Moderate quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Another study investigating laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair for hernias in a suprapubic location resulted in increased complication and recurrence rates compared with a large study of laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair that included all locations [15, 16]. Other location variability such as flank, subcostal, parastomal variations and the like also would be expected to have an impact on surgical outcomes, especially if the surgeon has had little experience performing ventral/incisional hernia repair for hernias in these atypical locations.

BMI also can be a variable with an impact on the outcomes of laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair. In one study of more than 1,000 patients by Tsereteli et al. [17], morbidly obese patients had a fourfold increase in recurrence compared with non-morbidly obese patients. In addition to obesity, another patient factor that can have a significant impact on outcomes is the size of the defect and the amount or volume of the herniated contents. Outcomes such as operative time, complications, and recurrence rates for laparoscopic ventral/incisional hernia repair of small defects differ greatly from those for loss-of-domain hernias [18, 19].

Spieghelian hernias

The Spiegelian hernia first escribed anatomically by Adriaan van den Spieghel (1578–1625) is located at the level of the semicircular line where the fascias of the oblique and transversus muscles begin to split into separate layers of the abdominal musculature. Spiegelian hernias (SH) account for 1% to 2% of abdominal wall hernias. Since the advent of minimally invasive surgery laparoscopic methods have become increasingly popular with various techniques being described in the literature. Since 2012 thirtytwo case series with 5 or more patients were included in this review. No randomized-controlled trials on the treatment of SH were identified. One systematic review was published in 2016 [4] which included 237 SHs that were repaired by various techniques. Intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique was the most popular repair method with minimal complications and recurrences reported in all techniques.

Finally, in addition to the EHS classification of ventral and incisional hernias, the EHS proposed a classification for parastomal hernias (PH), taking into account, that frequently parastomal hernia patients have concomitant incisional hernias (cIH): type I (small PH without cIH), type II (small PH with cIH), type III (large PH without cIH), and type IV (large PH with cIH); in addition, the classification grid includes details about whether the hernia recurs after a previous PH repair or whether it is a primary PH. This classification still needs to be validated [16]. The further refinement and implementation of an universally adopted ventral and incisional hernia classification will be of utmost importance, since individualized patient procedures will become more and more important. Last but not the least, register-based outcomes will in future also need to rely on validated classification criteria [17].

Specific caveats should be considered for ventral hernia repair in clean-contaminated cases. Based on current data for ventral hernia repair in wound class II, mesh repair is recommended with uncoated, midweight, macroporous polypropylene mesh, and its placement must be within an extraperitoneal layer of the abdominal wall (typically the retro-rectus plane). While definitive repair with synthetic mesh can be justified with the currently available evidence, it should be understood that there will be a higher risk of infection and wound complication given the wound class. These wounds and mesh-related complications can result in chronic mesh infection, the need for reoperation, mesh removal, and fistula formation, which must be weighed against improved recurrence rates when synthetic mesh is used. In 2022, Rosen et al.demonstrated a fourfold decrease in hernia recurrence at a 2-year follow-up (20.5% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.001) when macroporous polypropylene mesh was used compared with a resorbable biologic mesh. These repairs were done in an elective setting with large hernias, almost all of which were managed with an open transversus abdominis release technique, with operations classified as either wound class II or III included in the study. Rates of infection were similar between the two groups. However, these results have not been consistently reproduced in other prospective studies (although with less uniform surgical technique and mesh utilization), showing similar recurrence rates between mesh types but with worse infectious outcomes with synthetic mesh. When extraperitoneal mesh placement cannot be safely achieved during the index operation, the decision to perform a staged ventral hernia repair should be made.

Discussion

In this account, we have dealt with lumbar and spigelian hernias separately because they are separate entities. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases as well as the Cochrane register using the search terms noted above for publications that appeared from 1960 to 2011. Not unexpectedly, few publications could be used for an evidence-based systematic review on the treatment of both types of hernias. The relevant publications consisted of case series that included at least five cases. We excluded single case reports.

We were also charged to investigate the unusual hernias that were located in other locations. With these we were able to identify 48 articles but all were either single case series or did not really deal with the repair of the hernia. Hence none could be used for the systematic review. The search culled 35 articles under "flank hernia", but these were either case reports or did not address any aspect of hernioplasty. No articles were found that dealt with lateral bulging after a denervation injury after nephrectomy or anterior lumbar disc surgery. Seventy-nine publications were found that described lumbar hernias or their repair. Fourteen were case series of fewer than five cases. Two were solely anatomic descriptive articles, and one was a publication that duplicated already published data. We were able to include in the review 12 papers, which contained five or more patients and one prospective randomized study. No publication had level of evidence 1a, 1b, 2a, 2c, or 3.

### The perfect plane: a systematic review of mesh location and outcomes, update 2018 [^ef2fc09a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The principal approach to abdominal wall reconstruction requires implantation of mesh to decrease ventral hernia recurrence. This study compared current surgical outcomes and complications by location of anatomic mesh placement following ventral hernia repair with onlay, interposition, retromuscular, or underlay mesh reconstruction.

Methods

A systematic search of the PubMed database published from 2013 to 2018 was performed to identify patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction using either biologic or prosthetic mesh for ventral hernia repair. Demographic information and outcomes were obtained from each study.

Results

Fifty-one articles met inclusion criteria, resulting in 6,227 patients who underwent mesh repair of a ventral hernia. Mesh position included onlay in 7.6% of patients, interposition in 13.2%, retromuscular in 35.9%, and underlay placement in 43.4%. Prosthetic mesh was used in 68.5% of repairs and biological mesh in 31.5%. The mean patient age was 53.1 years (range, 18–95 years), and mean BMI was 29.1 kg/m² (range, 15–70.9 kg/m²). The mean follow-up was 37.5 ± 2.3 months. The overall mean recurrence rate was 8.3%, with retromuscular (5.8%) and underlay (10.9%) mesh placement trending toward less recurrence than onlay (12.9%) and interposition (21.6%) mesh placement (P = 0.023). Inferior recurrence rates were identified in the onlay and interposition placement of biologic mesh (28.6% and 29.1%, respectively), and analysis of open approaches yielded significant differences with onlay and interposition repairs having the highest hernia recurrence rates (10.9% and 25.4%, respectively). Laparoscopic interposition mesh location showed highest recurrence (10%) as compared with retromuscular (0.1%) and underlay (4.2%) (P = 0.041).

Conclusions

Mesh reinforcement of a ventral hernia repair continues to be safe and efficacious, and the anatomic location of mesh implantation appears to influence outcomes. Retromuscular or underlay mesh repair is associated with a lower recurrence rate.

### Surgical approach and long-term recurrence after ventral hernia repair [^115f92ee]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

IV Analysis

The rapid uptake of robotic-assisted hernia repair necessitates the use of existing observational data, as opposed to launching a large-scale randomized clinical trial, to assess long-term outcomes after robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open ventral hernia repair. However, due to measured and unmeasured confounding in observational data, causal inference may be limited by selection bias. Standard multivariable logistic regression analysis would not account for this selection bias, as it can only adjust for measured covariates. One known strategy to mitigate this bias is to perform an IV analysis. For additional information, including the reasoning behind and justification for the choice of an IV analysis, please see eMethods 2 in Supplement 1.

The IV used for this analysis was the rate of use of robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair within a hospital referral region (HRR) in the 12 months prior to a patient's initial ventral hernia repair. Using prior-year state-level and regional-level procedural use as an IV is consistent with previous observational studies in surgical patients. We excluded patients located in HRRs with no robotic-assisted hernia repairs during the study period.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^05a9792c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

An UH is a ventral midline hernia located at or near the umbilicus, from 3 cm above to 3 cm below it, according to the classification of the European Hernia Society. In the general population, UH has a prevalence of approximately 2%, and about 175 000 UH repairs are annually performed in the United States. As opposed to the paediatric population, where congenital UH is one of the most common conditions, in adults it is acquired in approximately 90% of the cases. Accounting for 6%–14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults, UH is second only to inguinal hernias for incidence.UHs can contain preperitoneal fat, omentum and small bowel, or a combination of these. The spontaneous rupture of the hernia sac is a sporadic occurrence, and concomitant evisceration is even rarer, especially in non-cirrhotic patients. Complications of untreated UH include bowel incarceration or strangulation, spontaneous rupture with ascitic fluid leakage in cirrhotic patients (the dreadful so-called Flood Syndrome, and evisceration). If such complications arise, the mortality rate is high despite surgical repair. The development of UH is more common in people with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as in pregnancy, obesity, ascites or chronic abdominal distension, all of which contribute to stretching of the abdominal muscle fibres and weakening of the connective tissue (figure 3). Interestingly, one of the two previously reported spontaneous SBE through an UH in a non-cirrhotic patient was an overweight woman in her fifth pregnancy. Cirrhotic patients with persistent ascites will develop UH in approximately 20% of the cases, due to an increase in the abdominal pressure from ascites, dilation of umbilical veins and muscular or connective tissue weakness due to poor nutritional status, or even in up to 40% of the cases in large-volume ascites. Body positioning and patient activity can exert added pressure on the intra-abdominal cavity, potentially compromising the weakened anterior abdominal wall layers. Skin discolouration, ulceration, ascitic leakage and rapid increase in hernia size are indicators of an impending rupture. Straining during bowel movements, coughingand physical exertionare all activities that have been associated with SBE through UH. In our case, the patient complained of skin rupture following a sudden cough. As it has been previously reported twice in the literature, it is important to note that the patient did not exhibit clinical signs of cirrhosis with ascites. Instead, we diagnosed him serologically with a previously unidentified HCV infection that was not associated with cirrhosis or ascites. It is likely that the sustained increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, his probable malnutrition along with his injection drug addiction, together with the sudden increase due to coughing, caused the hernia sac rupture and evisceration in our patient. Surgery is the only definitive treatment for UH, with an expected 1%–5% recurrence and complication rates, especially in patients with obesity or uncontrolled refractory ascites. A recent systematic review reports a recurrence between 2.7% and 27% in mesh repair and non-mesh repair, respectively. Usually, the neck of such umbilical defects is narrower than their herniated sacs, increasing the likelihood of incarceration and strangulation of their contents. These occurrences may require emergency repairs, thereby increasing the morbidity and mortality of UHs compared with inguinal hernias. Although in the past some advocated for a 'watchful waiting' approach considering the approximately 1% risk of strangulation per year of UH, due to the severity of its potential complications, each case must be carefully evaluated. Indeed, only asymptomatic UH with no aesthetic compromise should be non-operatively treated. According to D'Orazio et al, in cases where the skin above an UH ruptures without evisceration, a conservative approach using glue injection may provide a beneficial temporary alternative to surgery. This approach can serve as a bridge therapy, affording more time to optimise the patient's clinical condition. Nevertheless, it is always advisable to undertake early elective repair of UH, because a conservative approach could necessitate emergency surgery for ensuing complications, which would ultimately increase the patient's risk. In urgent and emergent settings, the safest approach is primary closure with sutures, as the use of a mesh would increase the risk of infection and potential serious and life-threatening complications despite decreasing the rate of recurrence. Several authors, reporting their experience managing similar patients, highlight that inserting a prosthesis, when feasible, lowers the incidence of hernia recurrence, and it is widely accepted in today's literature that a mesh repair carries a lower risk of recurrence. Shankar et al advocate for elective UH repair with mesh to be always considered also in patients with multiple comorbidities as it offers partial protection from recurrence without significant morbidity. The sublay technique can be used in the elective situation, when feasible, showing a lower rate of infection and recurrence. In our case though, we opted for direct repair of the defect due to the significant contamination of the operative field following intestinal resection. Regarding the size of the defect, Kaufmann et al have concluded that even in defects of less than 4 cm, there is a higher rate of recurrence with primary repair. Therefore, the use of a mesh should always be considered. Primary risk factors for postoperative complications and recurrences are obesity, liver disease and ascites, diabetes, primary suture repair without mesh and smoking. Factors such as obesity, which is often associated with diabetes, as well as persistent ascites in advanced cirrhosis, contribute to an elevated intra-abdominal pressure that keeps suboptimal tissues under tension. Therefore, strict and proper control of ascites in cirrhotic patients, as well as general attention to weight management and smoking cessation, are crucial to reduce the rate of recurrence and complications after UH repair.

Chapter 3. Component separation techniques

Frederik Berrevoet, Lars Nannestad Jorgensen

Background

Large ventral and incisional hernias, sometimes with loss of domain, remain a surgical challenge. Due to their relative rarity there is no exact estimate of their incidence. In 1951 Albanese et al. designed a first model of component separation of the abdominal wall, later elegantly refined by Ramirez in 1990 as a part of a study on human cadavers [1, 2]. The latter's initial results showed the possibility of translating the abdominal midline on average 10 cm per side at the umbilical level when releasing the external oblique muscle. Component separation has been applied increasingly and modifications trying to tackle the main issues of the technique have been made. Described limitations of this technique are complications involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most likely caused by surgical interruption of perforating vessels during exposure of the oblique muscle [3]. To date, most commonly used techniques for releasing the various fascial components of the abdominal wall are the 'open anterior approach', the 'transversus abdominis release' (TAR), the 'endoscopic anterior release', and the 'open anterior perforator preserving approach' with their original description in the noted references [2, 4–6].

As the component separation techniques (CST) were not included in the former IEHS guidelines, a full literature search was performed.

Key question
When is any type of component separation indicated?

Search terms

The following search terms were used: ((component* separation) OR (separation of components) OR (myofascial release)) AND (hernia OR (abdominal wall) OR ("Hernia, Ventral"[Mesh])) AND (indication OR use).

Search machines

PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library as well as Google scholar were searched for relevant studies.

Abstracts of resulted articles were reviewed for their relevance to component separation techniques and indications. In total 475 papers were analyzed, of which none specifically studied indications for CST.

In a nationwide cohort study including 3578 female patients of reproductive age registered in the Danish Ventral Hernia Database with ventral hernia repair between 2007 and 2013, 267 (7.5%) of them subsequently became pregnant during follow-up [1]. Median follow-up was 3.1 years (range 0–8.4 years). Pregnancy was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.09–2.25, p = 0.016).

In open surgery, the size of the defect may play a minor role [223], whereas in laparoscopic repair, its accurate measurement seems to be essential for estimating the proper size of the mesh to be used [96, 224]. Laparoscopic procedure is performed for patients with larger defects (i.e. > 15 cm) [158], but this will not work without sufficient overlapping. The more overlapping the surgeon achieves, the lower the recurrence rate will be [225]. Precise measurement of defect size and the correspondingly choice of an appropriate mesh size are indispensable preconditions for the success of the repair.

To determine the size of the hernia defect, a transverse and vertical dimension of 6 to 10 cm is added, and a prosthesis slightly larger than these measurements is used to ensure at least a 3- to 5-cm overlap [226].

Currently, no standard and accurate method exists for measuring the size of the hernia defect. Most commonly, measurement of the hernia defect size is estimated by physical examination, which lacks accuracy [42]. Other methods include extracorporeal palpation of the hernia defect, with it marked in the distended abdominal cavity and then measured after deflation [226]. Intracorporeal measurement is possible by placing spinal needles through the abdominal wall or by placing an intraperitoneal ruler after adhesiolysis. In addition, the size of the hernia can be reported as the largest diameter of the hernia defect when measured directly intraperitoneally by a laparoscope [42, 226].

Intracorporeal methods are more accurate and advantageous than extracorporeal methods. The laparoscopic approach defines the margins of the hernia defect clearly and helps in identifying additional defects that may not have been apparent preoperatively. In addition, it prevents distortion of abdominal wall contour and the hernia sac [42, 226, 227].

Defect size, mesh use, and special populations — laparoscopic approach: It is important to consider the size of the hernia defect when contemplating a laparoscopic approach, with a published guideline recommending caution for defects greater than 10cm but not as an absolute contraindication; another recommendation stated that hernias with a defect size < 3cm should not be approached laparoscopically, based on expert opinion and a survey showing that less than 10% of surgeons used prosthetics in defects less than 3cm, and the present MEDLINE search did not reveal any evidence in support of this recommendation; best available evidence suggests prosthetics should be used even for small (umbilical) hernia defects as recurrence rates are minimized compared with primary repair, and recent guidelines recommend the use of mesh for all abdominal wall hernias independent of defect size; expert opinion suggests the laparoscopic approach may be beneficial in the morbidly obese patient and in recurrent cases compared to open; additional evidence is needed before a minimum size for laparoscopic repair can be defined.

AMA Arch Surg. 1957; 75: 197–201. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1957.01280140035007 The two common types of ventral hernia in the adult are the umbilical and the incisional. The umbilical hernia as an acquired lesion is a defect in the linea alba at the level of the umbilicus, starting at the weakest point of the umbilicus — the superior portion of the original ring. It is associated with obesity and conditions that cause increased intra-abdominal pressure. The fascial defect varies in size but is usually disproportionately small as compared with the size of the sac. Even when the sac is small, as a rule, the defect is smaller. The sac may be so huge as to accommodate a large amount of intra-abdominal contents which manage to enter through a relatively narrow defect. Incisional hernia is the consequence of a surgical procedure. The anatomic defect varies with the location.

Introduction

It is well established that surgical injury can lead to chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as pain lasting for 3 months or more [89]. The components and risk factors for postoperative pain can be classified as patient factors, intraoperative factors (tissue damage, mesh type, type of anesthesia), and postoperative factors (type of analgesia. Patient factors [90, 91] contribute to postoperative pain perception but were not investigated in the studies available for review.

The studies on this topic included in the review showed substantial heterogeneity, with varying definitions of pain. The definition of chronic/prolonged pain was often vague, ranging from longer than 24 h to longer than 6 months. Furthermore, the trial designs and reporting were not uniform, further limiting the comparability of the outcomes. This also was noted in the reported metaanalyses of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair [2, 17, 92].

Specific studies examining chronic pain in patients with ventral hernia repair are infrequent. We may be able to extrapolate some findings from other studies relevant to the assessment of pain syndromes and chronic pain. In inguinal hernia repair, e.g. other preoperative chronic pain conditions not related to the groin [122–124] as well as severe early postoperative pain [124–128] after groin hernia repair are significant risk factors for chronic pain. Ventral hernia recurrence was reported as a risk factor for chronic pain in a large Veteran's Affairs Medical Centers survey [94]. A nonmidline (e.g. lumbar) location is accompanied by both more pre- and postoperative pain [97].

Attempts at prevention of chronic pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair have involved mainly different mesh fixation techniques. Unfortunately, the results of these studies often are contradictory [93, 96, 98, 101, 102, 118–121]. Local anesthetic infiltration is reported to be of benefit [103, 104]. However, one report on infusion of local anesthetic showed no benefit [95]. Regrettably, the treatment of chronic pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is described in small case series that address local and systemic pain treatment as well as removal of fixation or mesh components or excision of neuroma [102, 120].

Baucom et al. [7] analyzed in a retrospective study the prognostic differences between EHS classification medial and lateral incisional hernias regarding surgical site occurrence (SSO). The authors concluded that the rate of SSO by location (morphology) was 39% (n = 183) for midline, 23% (n = 11) for lateral, and 74% (n = 17) for hernias with midline and lateral components (p = < 0.001). Patients whose midline hernia spanned more than one EHS category also had a higher rate of SSOs (p = 0.001). If hernia localization is an independent risk factor, SSO needs to be further evaluated in a respectively powered prospective study, since morphology was not found to be a risk factor in another study [6]. Nevertheless, the localization of the hernia (morphology) is important in planning the procedure, as Raakow et al. also showed regarding subxiphoideal incisional hernias [8].

While the EHS classification seems to be known and accepted by the surgeons, its impact on tailoring procedures has still to be demonstrated. Almost 10 years after publication of the EHS classification, there is a paradoxical gap in several studies between the use of the classification and its clinical impact on patients' treatment: the classification is used to describe demography of the population but has also not been used to tailor the surgical procedure [9, 10]. Other casuistic classifications have not been used [examples: 11, 12, 13, 14]. Recently there was described an approach to stage incisional hernias for tailoring treatment: Stage I (< 10 cm/clean and associated with low SSO and recurrence risk), stage II (10–20 cm/clean or < 10 cm contaminated and carry an intermediate risk of SSO and recurrence), or stage III (≥ 10/contaminated or any hernia ≥ 20 cm, and these are associated with high SSO and recurrence risk) [15]. The future will show if a staging system will be more accepted by the surgical community as classification tools in tailoring procedures.

Currently, a number of studies [40–47] describe the use of CT scans after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). Gutierrez de la Pena et al. [40] reported on 50 patients with LVHR who underwent clinical investigations 1 year after surgery, including a CT scan and diagnostic laparoscopy. Recurrences were correctly diagnosed in 98% of the cases by CT and in 88% of the cases by clinical investigation. Wagenblast et al. [41], in a prospective study of 35 patients with LVHR, reported four patients with subsequent swelling for whom CT scan was able to differentiate between a seroma and a recurrence. Currently, reports of MRI describe only the diagnosis of adhesions after LVHR by cine MRI [40–50]. The CT scan is the method of choice for the postoperative differential diagnosis of recurrences, seroma, and bulging or residual hernias. An ultrasound investigation can be helpful in detecting seromas but does not yield the necessary anatomic details as does the CT scan to enable a firm diagnosis of recurrence [47].

The following search terms were used: "incisional_hernia" AND "classification"; "ventral_hernia" AND "classification"; "incisional_hernia"; "randomized_controlled_trial". A systematic search of the available literature was performed in January 2012 using Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library, as well as a manual search of relevant references using the listed search terms. The first search detected 70 articles in Embase, 112 articles in Pubmed, and 14 articles by manual search relating to classification criteria. After excluding duplicates and articles not relevant to the key questions, 30 articles were included in the review.

### Nomenclature in abdominal wall hernias: is It time for consensus? [^ace29daf]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The repair of CVH is a challenging area in both surgical practice and surgical research. Inconsistencies in the understanding of the nomenclature and the anatomy are leading to flaws in the data. This has the potential to be misleading and generate spurious evidence. We recommend that a consistent nomenclature based on an appreciation of the anatomy is used. This will aim to ensure that not only is the clinical management consistent, but allows for a transparent and unified evidence base for these complex surgical cases.

It also seems that we have to widen the scope of scientific experiments to understand the changes in the prosthesis properties caused by tissue ingrowth and scar remodeling in long-term observation. Such studies together with clinical trials could answer the question on permanent or absorbable fixation. The ingrowth of the mesh and tissue also reveals the issue of abdominal wall preparation before the mesh will be placed and fixed (the so-called landing zone).

All of the above factors will aid in the future design of individual meshes for different hernia locations, its dimensions, fascial structure combined with anterior abdominal wall imaging (3D computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging models) and perhaps biological products used for mesh construction. We will perhaps realize the development of 3D printing and the use of this equipment for creation of "personal" mesh. The future exploration of our field should encompass the identification of the specific mesh types and methods to implant them on the basis of the clinical comorbidities of the patient who is being treated. For mesh repairs, we need to define the appropriate size of pores as well as determine the strongest product with the least risk of infection while providing a very low rate of recurrence; these await identification.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and early postoperative complications after current techniques for ventral hernia repair [^af30bee7]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Multidetector CT allows comprehensive assessment of the operated anterior abdominal wall and is, therefore, recommended to elucidate suspected postoperative complications after VHR. CT findings consistently allow diagnosis of abdominal wall abscesses and fistulas, haematomas with or without active bleeding, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and recurrent hernias. Familiarity with early post-surgical CT studies is warranted to avoid misinterpretation of the expected postoperative appearance.

### International classification of abdominal wall planes (ICAP) to describe mesh insertion for ventral hernia repair [^74938e40]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nomenclature for mesh insertion during ventral hernia repair is inconsistent and confusing. Several terms, including 'inlay', 'sublay' and 'underlay', can refer to the same anatomical planes in the indexed literature. This frustrates comparisons of surgical practice and may invalidate meta-analyses comparing surgical outcomes. The aim of this study was to establish an international classification of abdominal wall planes.

Methods

A Delphi study was conducted involving 20 internationally recognized abdominal wall surgeons. Different terms describing anterior abdominal wall planes were identified via literature review and expert consensus. The initial list comprised 59 possible terms. Panellists completed a questionnaire that suggested a list of options for individual abdominal wall planes. Consensus on a term was predefined as occurring if selected by at least 80 per cent of panellists. Terms scoring less than 20 per cent were removed.

Results

Voting started August 2018 and was completed by January 2019. In round 1, 43 terms (73 per cent) were selected by less than 20 per cent of panellists and 37 new terms were suggested, leaving 53 terms for round 2. Four planes reached consensus in round 2, with the terms 'onlay', 'inlay', 'preperitoneal' and 'intraperitoneal' Thirty-five terms (66 per cent) were selected by less than 20 per cent of panellists and were removed. After round 3, consensus was achieved for 'anterectus', 'interoblique', 'retro-oblique' and 'retromuscular'. Default consensus was achieved for the 'retrorectus' and 'transversalis fascial' planes.

Conclusion

Consensus concerning abdominal wall planes was agreed by 20 internationally recognized surgeons. Adoption should improve communication and comparison among surgeons and research studies.

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^14b366a2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Fixation of the mesh in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR): Fixation of a hernia prosthetic to the abdominal wall is required as part of LVHR, although controversy exists regarding the amount, strength, and type (absorbable or permanent) of fixation required. Currently, there are two main categories of fixation methods available for use in the operating room – tacks and sutures, both of which are available in absorbable or permanent varieties; sutures are commonly anchored to the mesh with conventional instruments in combination with a suture-passing device, whereas tacks are usually deployed via a mechanical device typically referred to as a "tacker". There are human and laboratory reports utilizing fibrin-based sealant for fixation during LVHR, but the available evidence is limited. Proponents of tacks-only fixation have cited the shorter operating time, fewer skin incisions, improved cosmesis, and less acute and chronic pain as advantages, while proponents of suture-only fixation cite the lower cost and stronger attachment of the prosthetic to the abdominal wall, which may minimize recurrences; proponents of a combination of tack and suture fixation argue that the combination method affords maximum fixation strength and reduced operative time compared to suture or tack fixation only.
