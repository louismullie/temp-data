## Question

Methotrexate for cns prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including who should receive it, which regimen to choose, how to time it, and what the evidence shows about benefit and toxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why CNS prophylaxis is controversial. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence base. Next, I will examine guideline positions and reconcile them with the data. After that, I need to define high-risk phenotypes and practical selection criteria. Then, I should compare intrathecal versus high-dose intravenous methotrexate strategies and their timing. Finally, I will outline safety, monitoring, and a cautious, individualized recommendation with explicit uncertainties and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the magnitude of the problem. CNS relapse in DLBCL occurs in roughly 2–5% overall, but the risk is substantially higher in defined high-risk subgroups, and median survival after CNS relapse remains poor at approximately 2–5 months, which explains the persistent interest in prophylaxis despite weak evidence [^144c9ab8] [^9debe88a] [^3e06e8c5].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of the evidence before drawing conclusions. There are no randomized controlled trials of CNS prophylaxis in DLBCL; the literature consists of retrospective cohorts and meta-analyses, many with substantial heterogeneity and risk of confounding, so any apparent benefit must be interpreted cautiously and may reflect selection bias rather than true efficacy [^0aa757e6] [^d95f63af] [^e3567de8].

> I will now examine the highest-quality syntheses. A 2024 Haematologica meta-analysis of 1,661 patients found a non-significant reduction in CNS relapse with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) versus controls (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.27–1.07), with no survival benefit, and rated the evidence quality as low due to serious risk of bias; sensitivity analyses restricting to CNS-IPI–defined high-risk cohorts further attenuated any signal, reinforcing uncertainty [^0aa757e6] [^e3567de8]. Hold on, I should double-check consistency: multiple large retrospective series similarly show no significant reduction in CNS relapse with HD-MTX, including Canadian and international cohorts of 906 and 2,418 patients, respectively, again with concerns about selection and immortal time bias [^26463a0a] [^ecd4b4e7].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them with the data. NCCN recommends considering CNS prophylaxis for patients with high-risk features and allows either intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) or HD-MTX 3–3.5 g/m² for 2–4 cycles, reflecting a category 2A recommendation that acknowledges controversy and the absence of definitive trials [^97dd631c] [^217aabbd]. By contrast, the British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2020 guideline prefers HD-MTX when prophylaxis is indicated, emphasizing early integration without compromising R-CHOP delivery, while advising against adding IT therapy if HD-MTX is successfully delivered; this preference is based on mechanistic rationale and retrospective signals rather than randomized data, so I need to be transparent about that limitation [^22960668] [^362bf56d] [^d5d6079c]. ESMO guidance similarly allows consideration of HD-MTX or IT therapy in high-risk patients, again reflecting a consensus rather than trial-proven benefit [^02b550ff].

> Let me consider who actually merits prophylaxis, and I should confirm the risk models. The CNS-IPI stratifies patients into low, intermediate, and high risk with approximate 2-year CNS relapse risks of 0.6%, 3.4%, and 10.2%, respectively; however, the model lacks specificity and misses entity-specific risks such as testicular, primary cutaneous leg-type, breast, kidney/adrenal, and craniofacial involvement, which many guidelines still treat as high-risk indications for prophylaxis despite evolving evidence [^8c78e7e1] [^217aabbd]. I should also verify biological risk: double-hit/triple-hit lymphomas and MYC/BCL2 co-expression carry increased CNS risk, though even here, prospective prophylaxis data are limited and selection for prophylaxis must be individualized [^9a4d62ee].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about regimen choice; I need to compare IT-MTX versus HD-MTX. IT-MTX has poor parenchymal penetration and has repeatedly failed to show benefit in rituximab-era cohorts, with some studies even associating IT prophylaxis with more infections and no reduction in CNS relapse, so routine IT-MTX alone is hard to justify outside of specific contexts like testicular DLBCL where it has been historically used with scrotal RT and may contribute to low CNS relapse rates in prospective series [^9debe88a] [^e040834c] [^87f03a9e]. HD-MTX, in contrast, achieves CNS parenchymal levels and is mechanistically attractive, but retrospective comparative data show no consistent superiority over IT-MTX in preventing CNS relapse, and some studies suggest HD-MTX merely delays rather than prevents CNS events, with similar long-term relapse rates [^c8cc25f3] [^e45cec6c].

> I should confirm timing and delivery logistics because toxicity and treatment delays matter. Intercalating HD-MTX during R-CHOP increases the risk of delays in subsequent chemotherapy by roughly 19–20% and adds mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and longer inpatient stays; end-of-therapy HD-MTX avoids these delays without increasing CNS relapse risk in large retrospective comparisons, so if HD-MTX is used, end-of-R-CHOP scheduling is reasonable to preserve systemic therapy intensity [^fd00a2b8] [^362bf56d]. But wait, what if early CNS disease is present? Early integration could theoretically eradicate occult disease, yet the balance of evidence does not show improved CNS control with intercalated HD-MTX and does show more toxicity, so I should caution against routine intercalation outside of trials or carefully selected scenarios [^fd00a2b8] [^362bf56d].

> Next, I should review safety and patient selection, and I need to ensure I am precise. HD-MTX requires adequate renal function, typically creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min, good performance status, and careful hydration, alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue with methotrexate level monitoring; effusions can act as drug reservoirs and increase toxicity, so these must be considered before dosing [^dff931b4] [^2cf38007]. Neurotoxicity from methotrexate, while less common in DLBCL prophylaxis than in ALL, remains a concern and can manifest as acute encephalopathy or leukoencephalopathy, reinforcing the need to individualize use in older or comorbid patients [^c2422978] [^9b7611d9].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach, but I should double-check that it aligns with guidelines and the evidence. For low-risk patients, I would avoid CNS prophylaxis altogether given the low event rate and potential harms. For intermediate-risk patients, I would consider prophylaxis selectively based on extranodal sites, LDH, stage, and patient preference, recognizing that benefit is uncertain. For high-risk patients, I would discuss HD-MTX as a reasonable option with uncertain benefit, favor end-of-therapy scheduling to avoid R-CHOP delays, and avoid adding IT therapy if HD-MTX is successfully delivered; if HD-MTX is contraindicated, IT-MTX can be considered, but I should counsel that evidence for IT alone is weak and that testicular DLBCL is a scenario where IT plus scrotal RT has supportive prospective data [^97dd631c] [^7558c785] [^d5d6079c] [^87f03a9e].

> I should confirm that I am not overstating certainty. The bottom line is that no strategy has proven definitive benefit in RCTs, HD-MTX may confer a small, non-significant reduction in CNS relapse at the cost of meaningful toxicity, and IT-MTX has repeatedly failed to show benefit in modern cohorts; therefore, shared decision-making is essential, and enrollment in clinical trials or prospective registries should be encouraged to advance the field [^0aa757e6] [^e3567de8] [^9debe88a].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive care details are explicit if HD-MTX is used. Typical dosing is 3–3.5 g/m² IV over 2–4 hours with leucovorin rescue starting 24 hours after infusion and continuing every 6 hours until methotrexate levels fall below a safe threshold, with aggressive hydration, urinary alkalinization, and close monitoring of renal function and methotrexate levels; delays to R-CHOP should be minimized by scheduling HD-MTX early in the cycle or at the end of therapy, and patients should be counseled on early signs of neurotoxicity and infection risk [^2cf38007] [^fd00a2b8].

Methotrexate is used for CNS prophylaxis in high-risk lymphomas, especially **DLBCL** [^97dd631c] and **testicular lymphoma** [^2de5e2f1], to reduce CNS relapse. High-dose IV methotrexate (3–3.5 g/m²) [^97dd631c] is the **preferred method** [^22960668] because it penetrates the brain parenchyma, whereas intrathecal methotrexate is reserved for patients who cannot receive IV therapy [^08f79357]. Evidence is limited to retrospective studies [^0aa757e6]; some show a modest reduction in CNS relapse [^b0065848], but **no survival benefit** has been proven [^0aa757e6]. Toxicity is significant [^fd00a2b8], including renal impairment, mucositis, and delays in systemic therapy, so patient selection and renal function monitoring are essential [^dff931b4].

---

## Indications for methotrexate CNS prophylaxis

Methotrexate CNS prophylaxis is primarily indicated for patients with **high-risk lymphomas**, including:

- **Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)**: Particularly with high CNS-IPI scores (4–6) [^8c78e7e1], involvement of kidney or adrenal glands [^8c78e7e1], testicular lymphoma [^2de5e2f1], primary cutaneous DLBCL leg type, or stage IE DLBCL of the breast [^217aabbd].

- **Testicular lymphoma**: High risk of CNS relapse; prophylaxis is recommended [^2de5e2f1].

- **Double-hit or triple-hit lymphomas**: High CNS risk, though evidence for prophylaxis is limited [^9a4d62ee].

---

## Methotrexate regimens for CNS prophylaxis

Two primary methotrexate-based regimens are used for **CNS prophylaxis**:

| **Regimen** | **Dose and administration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| High-dose intravenous methotrexate (HD-MTX) | 3–3.5 g/m² IV every 2–3 weeks for 2–4 cycles, either intercalated with R-CHOP or at the end of systemic therapy [^97dd631c] [^2cf38007] | Retrospective studies; moderate evidence [^0aa757e6] |
| Intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) | 12–15 mg IT every 3 weeks for 4–8 doses, typically combined with cytarabine [^97dd631c] | Retrospective studies; low evidence [^e040834c] |

---

HD-MTX is preferred due to its **parenchymal penetration** [^13083252]; IT-MTX is reserved for patients who cannot receive HD-MTX because of renal impairment or other contraindications [^08f79357].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting methotrexate CNS prophylaxis

Evidence for methotrexate CNS prophylaxis is largely retrospective, with **no randomized controlled trials** [^0aa757e6]. Key findings include:

- **HD-MTX benefit**: Some studies suggest HD-MTX reduces isolated CNS relapse in high-risk DLBCL [^b0065848], but overall CNS relapse rates remain similar when considering both isolated and systemic relapses [^b0065848].

- **No survival benefit**: HD-MTX prophylaxis has not demonstrated improved overall survival in meta-analyses [^0aa757e6].

- **IT-MTX limitations**: IT-MTX alone has poor parenchymal penetration and has not consistently reduced CNS relapse rates [^9debe88a].

---

## Toxicity and safety considerations

Methotrexate CNS prophylaxis carries **significant toxicity risks**, including:

- **Renal impairment**: Requires careful monitoring and hydration [^2cf38007].

- **Mucositis and myelosuppression**: Common and may delay systemic therapy [^fd00a2b8].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Rare but serious, including leukoencephalopathy [^c2422978].

Patient selection and supportive care are critical to minimize toxicity [^dff931b4].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines provide cautious recommendations:

- **NCCN**: Recommends HD-MTX (3–3.5 g/m²) for 2–4 cycles or IT-MTX (4–8 doses) for high-risk patients [^97dd631c].

- **BSH**: Prefers HD-MTX when feasible; IT-MTX if HD-MTX is contraindicated [^22960668].

- **ESMO**: Suggests considering HD-MTX for high-risk patients, acknowledging limited evidence [^02b550ff].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing research focuses on **identifying biomarkers** to better select patients for prophylaxis [^10d344fa] and on evaluating novel agents with improved CNS penetration [^5bf15d1d]. Randomized trials are needed to definitively establish the efficacy and optimal timing of methotrexate prophylaxis [^d95f63af].

---

Methotrexate CNS prophylaxis is used in high-risk lymphomas, with HD-MTX preferred when feasible. Evidence is limited and retrospective, showing a modest reduction in isolated CNS relapse but **no proven survival benefit** [^0aa757e6]. Toxicity is significant, requiring careful patient selection and monitoring [^fd00a2b8].

### CNS prophylaxis in aggressive B-cell lymphoma [^10d344fa]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevention of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) continues to be one of the most contentious areas of lymphoma management. Outcomes for patients with secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) have historically been very poor. However, in recent years improved responses have been reported with intensive immunochemotherapy approaches, and there is a growing interest in potential novel/cellular therapies. Traditional methods for selecting patients for CNS prophylaxis, including the CNS International Prognostic Index, are hampered by a lack of specificity, and there is accumulating evidence to question the efficacy of widely employed prophylactic interventions, including intrathecal and high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). Given the potential toxicity of HD-MTX in particular and the ongoing need to prioritize systemic disease control in high-risk patients, there is an urgent need to develop more robust methods for identifying patients at highest risk of CNS relapse, as well as investigating prophylactic interventions with greater efficacy. Here we review new evidence in this field from the last 5 years, focusing on the potential use of molecular diagnostics to improve the identification of high-risk patients, recent large data sets questioning the efficacy of HD-MTX, and the current approach to management of patients with SCNSL. We provide a suggested algorithm for approaching this very challenging clinical scenario.

### Central nervous system prophylaxis for aggressive B-cell lymphoma: who, what, and when? [^47dd106c]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse of aggressive B-cell lymphoma is a rare but serious complication with poor survival. Different approaches have been used to define risks factors for CNS relapse and establish prophylactic measures. Although patients with low or intermediate risk of CNS relapse should not undergo special diagnostic or therapeutic measures, CNS MRI as well as cytology and flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid are suggested for high-risk patients (and patients with testicular involvement) at diagnosis, and prophylactic high-dose methotrexate in patients without proven CNS involvement. Future risk and treatment models may include molecular features and new treatment options.

### Central nervous system prophylaxis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a race to the bottom [^1e63367f]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica, Bobillo et al. address the controversial topic of chemotherapy as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis during front-line management of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the fact that CNS spread is a feared and often terminal complication of DLBCL treatment, there is no broad consensus regarding which patients should receive CNS prophylaxis or which is the most effective delivery method. Overall, the incidence of CNS relapse across all DLBCL subsets is only approximately 5%, but clinical risk factors, including the involvement of specific anatomic sites, are associated with a significantly higher rate of CNS spread. Further, we are beginning to uncover the biological basis for DLBCL involving the CNS, as specific genetic subtypes demonstrate an inherently higher rate of CNS tropism. The CNS International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) is a commonly used risk model that stratifies patients into risk categories, and combining this model with the cell-of-origin phenotype may improve patient selection. However, even the most robust predictive models cannot overcome the fundamental problem that the chemotherapy agents most effective for the cure of systemic DLBCL do not reliably penetrate the bloodbrain barrier (Figure 1). Conversely, methotrexate (MTX), which reliably penetrates the CNS, is not highly effective for DLBCL. The most commonly used prophylactic strategy is repeated intrathecal (IT) injections of chemotherapy such as MTX during front-line therapy, but since brain parenchymal sites are the commonest site of CNS relapse, some advocate the use of deeply penetrant drugs such as high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX). No randomized prospective study has directly addressed this specific question, and, as a result, practice patterns rely on consensus guidelines and vary widely across institutions and individual providers. In essence, the debate about optimal delivery methods is essentially a 'race to the bottom' that compares two strategies that do not adequately address the clinical problem.

### Central nervous system prophylaxis: it's time to start from scratch [^d95f63af]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica, Tolley and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the use of prophylactic high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) with front-line therapy for systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to reduce the incidence of secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL). Consistent with other similar meta-analyses and the current body of literature, which is primarily composed of retrospective studies, HDMTX prophylaxis provides minimal to no benefit in high-risk DLBCL.

Despite the authors' rigorous methodology aimed at reducing data duplication and residual bias, and notwithstanding significant heterogeneity across the various cohorts included in this and other studies, the clinical benefit from prophylactic HDMTX is significantly lower than previously anticipated. For over a decade now, HDMTX prophylaxis has been regarded as standard of care for patients with high-risk systemic DLBCL. This situation generates a disconnect between expectations and reality, prompting several follow-up questions.

First, how did this situation arise? The concept of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis emerged in the 1990s when lymphoid malignancies were classified based on morphology and limited immunophenotyping, and when classic cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy were the only treatment options available. Regimens for distinct entities with frequent SCNSL involvement, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma, incorporated intrathecal and/or intravenous HDMTX with varying success. This practice was extended to a broader range of aggressive lymphomas with lower SCNSL risk. For example, intrathecal prophylaxis was mandatory in selected high-risk patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas (approximately 20% would not be classified as DLBCL today) in the RICOVER-60 trial, which began accrual in 2001.

HDMTX became widely available for the treatment of primary and secondary CNS lymphomas in the early 2000s, and as clinicians became comfortable with its delivery and toxicity, its use was extended as an alternative and/or adjunct to intrathecal prophylaxis. Retrospective series of prophylactic HDMTX with rituximab-containing chemotherapy in high-risk DLBCL observed numerically lower rates of SCNSL than previously documented. This level of evidence was deemed sufficient to adopt HDMTX prophylaxis globally, despite the absence of dedicated confirmatory phase II or III studies. As early as 2010, experts recommended HDMTX prophylaxis for high-risk patients, and by 2012, it was already integrated into international clinical practice guidelines.

### Advances in risk assessment and prophylaxis for central nervous system relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^2cf38007]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal timing of CNS prophylaxis, particularly with high-dose intravenous methotrexate, remains incompletely elucidated. CNS relapse typically occurs during or within 5–6 months of induction treatment. The incidence of early CNS events forms the rationale for introduction of CNS-directed therapy concurrently with systemic induction treatment, but this must be balanced with risks of toxicity due to concomitant therapy. For high-risk DLBCL patients who are appropriate candidates for high-dose systemic methotrexate, we favor inclusion at a dose of 3500 mg/m² on day 15 of the 21-day R-CHOP cycle for up to a total of three doses, usually administered in alternating R-CHOP cycles. An alternative schedule is to administer three or four doses of intravenous methotrexate immediately following completion of R-CHOP, although this risks earlier CNS progression. Methotrexate can be administered at 10- to 14-day intervals when given as monotherapy following completion of R-CHOP. A recommended algorithm for risk stratification and prophylaxis is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.
Suggested approach to central nervous system risk stratification and prophylaxis in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. DLBCL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; CNS-IPI: Central Nervous System International Prognostic Index; DHL: double-hit lymphoma; COO: cell of origin; ABC: activated B-cell; DEL: double-expressing lymphoma; THL: triple-hit lymphoma; LP: lumbar puncture; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; CNS: central nervous system; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; MTX: methotrexate; CrCl: creatine clearance; HD-MTX: high-dose methotrexate; IT-MTX: intrathecal methotrexate.

Safe administration of high-dose systemic methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis relies upon careful attention to the selection and supportive care of patients. This treatment should be avoided in patients with a poor performance status, and those with impaired renal function or significant effusions or ascites which may serve as reservoirs for methotrexate and prolong toxicity. In order to minimize risk of toxicity, patients are pre-treated with hydration and alkalinization, which continues after methotrexate infusion to accelerate clearance. Methotrexate at a dose of 3000–3500 mg/m² is typically administered over 2–4 h, with leucovorin rescue commencing 24 h after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion, and continuing every 6 h for 12–16 doses as the methotrexate clears. It is essential to monitor methotrexate levels along with electrolytes and renal function in order to ensure that the drug is cleared rapidly, which helps to avoid toxicity.

### High-dose methotrexate is effective for prevention of isolated CNS relapse in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [^563b8c03]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse occurs in 1–14% of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and carries a dismal prognosis with survival of 2–5 months. With concerns around the effectiveness of intrathecal (IT) prophylaxis which may not reach measurable concentrations in the brain parenchyma, systemic high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) has been recommended by some guidelines for patients at high risk of CNS relapse. However, evidence supporting this practice is limited to small retrospective studies, and recent studies demonstrate no benefit of HDMTX in preventing CNS relapse. Given the potential for HDMTX to be associated with significant toxicity and delays of RCHOP chemotherapy which may compromise systemic control, further evaluation of the role of HDMTX in mitigating the risk of CNS recurrence is warranted.

There is ongoing debate on the utility of HDMTX in preventing CNS relapse in view of heterogeneity of existing literature without definitive randomized controlled trials to base practice. Importantly, current studies assessing the utility of HDMTX do not differentiate isolated CNS relapse from concomitant CNS and systemic relapse when evaluating the prophylactic effect of HDMTX. While isolated CNS relapse may be prevented by effective CNS prophylaxis, concomitant systemic and CNS relapse likely represents failure of systemic treatment with subsequent acquisition of CNS-penetrating subtypes of malignant clones. Puckrin et al. recently showed lack of efficacy of HDMTX after adjusting for confounding factors using propensity score matching analysis, but the majority (59%) of patients with CNS relapse had concurrent systemic disease. Ideally a randomized controlled trial will be best suited to answer the question about efficacy of prophylaxis, but the rarity of CNS relapse is a major barrier to conducting adequately powered clinical trials. In addition, several retrospective studies suggest that HDMTX may be beneficial for systemic disease, based on improved PFS and OS without improvement in CNS relapse rates, but did not differentiate between isolated versus concurrent CNS relapse.

Given these questions about efficacy of HDMTX for CNS versus systemic relapse, we sought to determine if HDMTX reduced rates of isolated CNS relapse, concomitant CNS-systemic relapse, or systemic relapse in a group of patients at high risk for CNS relapse from three tertiary institutions in Singapore, compared to a closely matched historical cohort, including a propensity score matching analysis to assure comparability. We also determined the rate of toxicities involved in prophylaxis.

### High-dose methotrexate is effective for prevention of isolated CNS relapse in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [^b0065848]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in DLBCL is controversial. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic HDMTX on isolated CNS relapse, concomitant CNS and systemic relapse, systemic relapse, and survival outcomes in 226 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and high-risk CNS International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) score treated with RCHOP. The three-year risk of isolated CNS relapse was significantly lower in patients who received HDMTX, at 3.1% compared to 14.6% (P = 0.032) in those who did not. However, neither concomitant CNS-systemic relapse rates, systemic relapse rates, nor three-year PFS and OS were significantly different between treatment groups in multivariable analysis. Among propensity score-matched patients (N = 102), HDMTX was also associated with significantly lower isolated CNS relapse rates (HR 0.06, 95% CI 0.004–0.946, P = 0.046). HDMTX was well tolerated with manageable toxicities when given at a dose of 3 g/m² by day 3 of RCHOP chemotherapy. Using propensity score matching and multivariable regression to yield treatment groups with well-balanced covariates, we showed that prophylactic HDMTX improved isolated CNS relapse rates but did not decrease concomitant CNS-systemic relapse rates, systemic relapse rates, or improve survival outcomes.

### Efficacy of intravenous high-dose methotrexate in preventing relapse to the central nervous system in R-CHOP (-like)-treated, high-risk, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and its effect on mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0aa757e6]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) carries a dismal prognosis and most clinical guidelines recommend CNS prophylaxis to patients deemed at high risk of CNS relapse. However, results from observational studies investigating the effect of CNS prophylaxis have yielded conflicting results. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (i) whether addition of prophylactic intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) reduces the risk of CNS relapse in high-risk DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP or similar, and (ii) whether HD-MTX prophylaxis confers an overall survival benefit, irrespective of CNS relapse. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE for data on DLBCL patients at high risk of CNS relapse treated with R-CHOP or similar who received HD-MTX as an intervention and a comparator arm of patients who did not receive prophylaxis and/or intrathecal prophylaxis. A risk of bias was estimated using the ROBINS-I tool and the quality of the evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Finally, a meta-analysis based on the systematic review was conducted. A total of 1,812 studies were screened. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Seven observational studies comprising 1,661 patients met the inclusion criteria. We found a statistically non-significant relative risk of 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.27–1.07) of CNS relapse for patients receiving HD-MTX versus controls. The meta-analysis investigating mortality demonstrated a relative risk of death of 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.44–1.11) for patients treated with HD-MTX versus controls. The overall risk of bias was adjudged as "serious" and the quality of the evidence was rated as "low". In conclusion, our data indicate that HD-MTX does not prevent or, at best, only slightly reduces the risk of CNS relapse and confers no survival benefit.

### Preventing central nervous system spread in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-novel approaches needed [^c4634e69]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Anumber of retrospective datasets have addressed the controversial topic of chemotherapy as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis during frontline management of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the fact that CNS spread is a feared and often terminal complication of DLBCL, there is not a broad consensus regarding which patients should receive CNS prophylaxis or the most effective method of delivery. Overall, the incidence of CNS relapse across all subsets of DLBCL is only about 5%, but some clinical risk factors, including the involvement of specific anatomic sites, are associated with a significantly higher rate of CNS spread. Furthermore, we are beginning to uncover the biological basis for DLBCL involving the CNS as specific genetic subtypes demonstrate an inherently higher rate of CNS tropism. The CNS International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) is a commonly used risk model that stratifies patients into risk categories; combining this model with the cell-of-origin phenotype may improve selection of patients. However, even the most robust predictive models cannot overcome the fundamental problem that the chemotherapy agents most effective for the cure of systemic DLBCL do not reliably penetrate the blood-brain barrier (Figure 1). Conversely, methotrexate, which reliably penetrates the CNS, is not highly effective for DLBCL. The most commonly used prophylactic strategy is repeated intrathecal injections of chemotherapy such as methotrexate during frontline therapy, but since brain parenchymal sites are the commonest site of CNS relapse, some advocate the use of deeply penetrant drugs such as high-dose methotrexate. No randomized prospective study has directly addressed this specific issue and, as a result, practice patterns rely on consensus guidelines and vary widely across institutions and individual providers. In essence, the debate about optimal delivery methods is a "race to the bottom" that compares two strategies that do not adequately address the clinical problem.

### Central nervous system prophylaxis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: who, what, and when? [^8a046cfc]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Secondary central nervous system (CNS) progression in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. In this review, we summarize and critically evaluate the current literature to guide the practicing clinician in estimating CNS relapse risk in order to select individual patients who may benefit from CNS prophylaxis, covering histologic subtype, anatomic location, and molecular and clinical factors. We summarize the data regarding different prophylaxis strategies used and provide our recommendation regarding who should receive it, what they should receive, and when it should be administered.

Conclusion

The addition of high-dose IV MTX, either at the completion of R-CHOP or as part of dose-intensive chemotherapy strategies, is associated with a reduction in CNS relapse risk in DLBCL. This finding should ideally be tested in prospective, randomised studies.

Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare, but serious, event in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In the post-rituximab era, CNS relapse has been reported in 3–5% of DLBCL patients following first-line treatment. In the majority, the relapse is diagnosed within the first year, suggesting that some patients harbor subclinical CNS disease at diagnosis. The prognosis is extremely poor with a median overall survival after CNS relapse of only a few months. Thus, improvement in prediction of CNS relapse and subsequent administration of effective CNS prophylaxis are critical.

In an effort to reduce the risk of CNS relapse, clinical guidelines have recommended CNS prophylaxis to high-risk patients. Historically, intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy has been employed. However, increasing evidence has challenged the benefit of IT prophylaxis. In recent years, intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) has been the most commonly recommended prophylactic strategy, both in clinical studies and treatment guidelines.9, The toxicity of HD-MTX is considerable and may be a limiting factor for administration to patients of advanced age or with comorbidities, especially impaired renal function. Furthermore, administration of prophylaxis may derail primary treatment, thereby risking a worse outcome.

No randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of CNS prophylaxis in addition to standard treatment has ever been performed. Thus, current recommendations are based on retrospective studies reporting a potential benefit of HD-MTX in the prevention of CNS relapse. However, several studies have found diverging results and in recent years, large retrospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significantly lower rate of CNS relapse after HD-MTX prophylaxis. Retrospective studies are hampered by numerous limitations. The definitions of patients at high risk of CNS relapse differ and the delivery of HD-MTX (timing, dose, and number of cycles) and combination with IT prophylaxis also vary between studies. The chemo-immunotherapy regimens employed as the antilymphoma treatment backbone also differ; some of these regimens may inherently reduce the risk of CNS relapseand thereby obscure the efficacy of HD-MTX alone. Finally, there is likely treatment selection bias, since younger patients with good performance status are more likely to receive CNS prophylaxis than are older or unfit patients.

High-dose methotrexate

Over recent years, HD-MTX (≥ 3 g/m) has been proposed as a potentially better prophylactic strategy in patients with high-risk DLBCL since the majority of relapses in the rituximab era occur in the brain parenchyma. Initial retrospective series suggested a potential benefit of HD-MTX in the prevention of CNS disease; however, in recent years, several large retrospective studies have failed to demonstrate a reduction in CNS relapse (Table 3). A recent multicenter study including 906 patients, of whom 326 were at high risk, showed a CNS relapse risk of 12.2% for patients receiving HD-MTX compared with 11.2% for patients with no prophylaxis. Orellana-Noia et al. suggested no benefit of HD-MTX over IT MTX in a series of 1,162 patients from 21 US academic institutions who received CNS prophylaxis (IT MTX n = 894, HD-MTX = 236), with a CNS relapse rate of 5.4% versus 6.8%, respectively. Preliminary results from the largest retrospective series published, including 2,300 high-risk patients, also documented a lack of efficacy of HD-MTX with a 5-year incidence of CNS relapse of 9.1% for patients who received HD-MTX versus 8.4% for those who did not. A major limitation of these retrospective reports is that the definition of patients with a high risk of CNS relapse differs greatly between the studies, and the distribution of risk subgroups (i.e. involvement of extranodal sites) varies between the subgroups compared. Patients frequently receive variable numbers of HD-MTX cycles, with or without IT MTX. Finally, there is likely treatment selection bias since younger patients with good performance status are usually more likely to receive CNS prophylaxis than older or unfit patients.

There has been no consensus on the optimal dose or timing of HD-MTX. Wilson et al. conducted a multicenter retrospective study of 1,384 patients treated with R-CHOP-like regimens and HD-MTX prophylaxis, either intercalated or at the end of treatment, and concluded that there was no difference in CNS relapse risk between patients treated with either of the two strategies. Furthermore, intercalated HDMTX was associated with increased toxicity resulting in a delay of subsequent R-CHOP in 19.3% of patients. These results suggest that, when administrated, HD-MTX should be given at the end of R-CHOP treatment.

### Secondary lymphomas of the central nervous system: risk, prophylaxis and treatment [^7e0291bf]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

The recurrence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the central nervous system (CNS) is rapidly fatal in most cases. Highly aggressive lymphomas, such as lymphoblastic and Burkitt lymphomas, carry a high risk of CNS relapse. CNS relapse in intermediately aggressive subtypes, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, is uncommon, but not rare. The risk of CNS relapse in indolent lymphomas is low. Prognostic markers of CNS relapse include elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, the presence of B symptoms, and extranodal involvement at more than one site. Most centers give prophylactic CNS chemotherapy to patients considered at high risk of CNS recurrence. However, definitions of risk factors vary, and there is a lack of consensus regarding prophylaxis indications. More research is needed to define which patients might benefit from CNS prophylaxis at initial treatment and to find the optimal regimen for prophylaxis. A variety of treatments have been used to treat CNS relapse, but current regimens have had little success in extending survival after CNS relapse. Although long-term survival has been reported in a minority of patients with isolated CNS recurrence after treatment with methotrexate, more effective regimens are needed if survival times after relapse are to be prolonged.

### Efficacy of central nervous system prophylaxis with stand-alone intrathecal chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the rituximab era: a systematic review [^e040834c]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Although none of these papers show any evidence of a benefit in giving CNS IT prophylaxis in either univariable analyses or multivariable analyses, they are also all unable to convincingly rule one out due to small numbers of events and the confounding caused by the indications for CNS prophylaxis.

Subsequent to the completion of the systematic review, we have recently published outcomes of 690 elderly patients (≥ 70 years) treated with R-CHOP (full or dose attenuated). Our results are consistent with those presented within the systematic review but suffer from similar issues of small event number and the risk of confounding factors. We also showed no clear benefit for stand-alone IT prophylaxis although we found that IT prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of infection-related hospital admission during R-CHOP (odds ratio vs. no prophylaxis) 2.20 (95% CI: 1.31–3.67; P = 0.01).

The only real method to formally answer this question is with a randomised clinical trial of IT CNS prophylaxis vs no IT CNS prophylaxis in patients deemed unsuitable for high dose MTX. Unfortunately, due to the low event rate this would need to be a very large study. Even if we assume a relatively high risk patient group (e.g. CNS-IPI 4–6) with a 4–6% risk of CNS relapse and aim to detect a large effect size (i.e. a halving of this rate), to achieve 80% power we would require 1,432 (6–3%), 1,722 (5–2.5%) or 2,368 (4–2%) patients. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence of its benefit, it may be difficult to persuade many clinicians to randomise patients with multiple baseline risk factors to potentially receive no CNS directed therapy. A trial performed in patients considered unsuitable for high dose methotrexate due to age, renal impairment, performance status or comorbidities would prove particularly challenging to perform.

CASP analysis

For the 14 studies included within the systematic review, a CASP analysis was performed. Cohort studies were scored as moderate in three studies. These included 2 of the 3 post hoc analyses performed from large prospective randomised clinical trials, and scored moderate to low in the remaining 11 studies. The key reasons for the low quality rating scores included: a) retrospective, single centre data; b) low event numbers with unadjusted analyses; c) variable indications and IT prophylaxis regimens used; d) variable histologies included.

### Preventing central nervous system spread in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-novel approaches needed [^5bf15d1d]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
A subset of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are at high-risk of disease spread to the central nervous system and are often treated with chemotherapy prophylaxis. A critical barrier to effective central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is the blood-brain barrier (1) which limits the entry of the chemotherapy agents that are most effective for systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (2). Current therapeutic options for CNS chemotherapy prophylaxis are systemic chemotherapy (3) or intrathecal chemotherapy (4) which are both limited in efficacy and increase toxicity. Novel small molecule inhibitors that effectively penetrate the blood-brain barrier are being tested in DLBCL involving the CNS and may improve treatment options.

Although retrospective series are effective at generating hypotheses or identifying specific issues that warrant further study, it is nearly impossible to control for all the permutations of approaches to CNS prophylaxis as there is truly no standard approach. The best available data suggest that the most common approach to CNS prophylaxis involves repeated intrathecal injections of methotrexate or cytarabine during frontline therapy, while only a significant minority of patients receive high-dose methotrexate at a median dose of 3.5 g/meither during frontline therapy or immediately following. Notably, patients who receive high-dose methotrexate may also receive concomitant intrathecal chemotherapy which blurs this arbitrary distinction. Furthermore, most datasets demonstrate that nearly half of patients considered high-risk receive no form of CNS prophylaxis. This observation highlights that patient-related factors, such as age and perceived ability to tolerate treatment-related toxicity, greatly influence treatment decisions beyond prognostic scores and/or involvement of extranodal sites. Since all forms of CNS prophylaxis have clinically meaningful toxicities, this underscores the fact that an important limitation of all available datasets is selection bias. Finally, no form of CNS prophylaxis is universally effective and the rate of CNS relapse in patients who receive prophylaxis is typically about 5% after 2 to 3 years of follow- up. In recognition that CNS relapses may be late events, the actual risk reduction of any form of CNS prophylaxis with chemotherapy is likely modest at best and currently employed strategies may simply delay the timing of CNS recurrence.

### Efficacy of intravenous high-dose methotrexate in preventing relapse to the central nervous system in R-CHOP (-like)-treated, high-risk, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and its effect on mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e3567de8]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

A sensitivity analysis (Figure 4A) on studies using the CNS-IPI for high-risk classification reduced the calculated RR from 0.54 to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.38–1.56; P = 0.46). While we expected a larger reduction in heterogeneity when stringently defining the criteria for administration of CNS prophylaxis, the RR from the sensitivity analysis is in line with data from the largest retrospective study conducted on 2,418 high-risk patients (CNS-IPI 4–6) receiving CNS prophylaxis. A sub-analysis of 1,616 patients achieving complete remission found no difference in CNS relapse rates between the patients who received high-dose prophylaxis (5%) and those who did not (6.5%) (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.4–1.3; P = 0.30). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding studies in which controls exclusively received IT prophylaxis (Figure 4B). Although this reduced the heterogeneity from 61% to 54%, it had no effect on the risk of CNS relapse. This indicates that the choice of control group (± IT prophylaxis or no prophylaxis) does not alter the direction of the outcome. Results from recent meta-analyses, and a network meta-analysishave been contrasting. Ho et al.examined patients at intermediate to high risk of CNS relapse and found no statistically significant benefit of CNS prophylaxis in their cohort of 3,770 patients from ten studies, of which three studies employed IT prophylaxis and seven HD-MTX ± IT prophylaxis. A sub-analysis comparing studies using HD-MTX (n = 1,826 patients) against studies using IT prophylaxis (n = 1,944 patients) found no difference between the subgroups (P = 0.67). In contrast, Zhang et al.found a protective effect of CNS prophylaxis. They analyzed the risk of CNS relapse in patients given CNS prophylaxis with HD-MTX ± IT (n = 1,124) versus no prophylaxis or only IT (n = 3,856) showing a RR of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55–0.88; P = 0.002). The network meta-analysisincluded 6,614 patients from 24 studies receiving five different interventions. None of the listed regimens was shown to reduce CNS relapse rate compared with no prophylaxis.

CNS prophylaxis methods and dosing in DLBCL: CNS prophylaxis should be considered for patients with risk factors for CNS disease, but the optimal method is controversial. Intrathecal methotrexate given once per systemic treatment cycle has been used for many years, and more recent retrospective studies have suggested that high-dose IV methotrexate-based prophylaxis may be associated with a lower incidence of CNS relapses. Systemic methotrexate with leucovorin rescue has been safely incorporated into R-CHOP-21, with methotrexate administered on day 15 of the 21-day R-CHOP cycle. The NCCN Guidelines currently recommend CNS prophylaxis with 4 to 8 doses of intrathecal methotrexate and/or cytarabine, or systemic methotrexate (3–3.5 g/m²).

### CNS prophylaxis is (mostly) futile in DLBCL [^3e06e8c5]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with a poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of approximately five months [1]. The risk for CNS disease has been estimated to be about 5% overall [2], but it is significantly higher in certain high-risk groups [3]. CNS prophylaxis is often administered to patients felt to be at high risk for CNS recurrence. Options for CNS prophylaxis include high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy with methotrexate and/or cytarabine. However, a number of recent retrospective analyses have called into question the efficacy of prophylaxis. Here, we aim to review the literature regarding CNS prophylaxis with HD-MTX or IT chemotherapy in DLBCL. Our review and discussion exclude Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, for which standard treatment protocols include CNS prophylaxis. We also exclude double and triple hit lymphoma (DHL, THL) as it is generally accepted that these patients are at a high risk of CNS relapse. Based on the results of several recent studies, we recommend consideration of IT chemotherapy instead of HD-MTX if prophylaxis is desired due to better tolerability. If HD-MTX is desired, it should be done after systemic therapy is completed to avoid treatment delays. We provide an algorithm to guide decision making. However, our review of the literature suggests that CNS prophylaxis by either means has no clear benefit.

### Secondary CNS relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: defining high-risk patients and optimization of prophylaxis strategies [^8c6c42f2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvement in survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with the introduction of rituximab, central nervous system (CNS) relapse continues to represent a clinical challenge. A number of studies have evaluated clinical risk factors in an attempt to identify high-risk patients to direct CNS staging investigations and consider prophylaxis strategies. The CNS International Prognostic Index is a robust and reproducible risk model that can identity patients at high risk of CNS relapse, but its specificity remains limited. Studies are emerging of biomarkers that predict CNS relapse that can be integrated with clinical risk models to better identify high-risk patients for CNS-directed prophylaxis strategies. Because CNS parenchymal disease is the predominant compartment, prophylaxis should include deeply penetrant drugs such as high-dose methotrexate. However, this has been associated with toxicity and has limited use in older patients. Novel therapies are being tested in primary CNS lymphoma with encouraging results and may represent rational strategies to be further explored in the prophylaxis setting.

CNS prophylaxis and treatment — goals, modalities, and scope are stated as follows: The goal of CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment is to prevent CNS disease or relapse by clearing leukemic cells within sites that cannot be readily accessed with systemic chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier. CNS-directed therapy may include cranial irradiation, IT chemotherapy (eg, methotrexate, cytarabine, corticosteroids), and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, high-dose methotrexate, intermediate-/high-dose cytarabine, L-asparaginase). CNS prophylaxis is typically given to all patients throughout the entire course of ALL therapy, from induction, to consolidation, to the maintenance phases of treatment, and CNS prophylaxis should be considered for relapsed/refractory disease as well.

### Advances in risk assessment and prophylaxis for central nervous system relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^9a4d62ee]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Central nervous sytem recurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an uncommon but devastating event, making identification of patients at high risk for relapse within the central nervous system essential for clinicians. Modern risk stratification includes both clinical and biological features. A validated clinical risk model employing the five traditional International Prognostic Index risk factors plus renal or adrenal involvement can identify a high-risk patient population with a central nervous system recurrence risk of greater than 10%. Lymphoma involvement of certain discrete extranodal sites such as the testis also confers increased risk, even in stage I disease. Adverse biological risk factors for central nervous system relapse include presence of translocations of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6, in so-called double- or triple-hit lymphoma. Immunohistochemically detectable co-expression of MYC and BCL2 in the absence of translocations also portends an increased risk of relapse within the central nervous system, particularly in the setting of the activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The role, method, and timing of prophylactic therapy remain controversial based on the available data. We review both intrathecal and systemic strategies for prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Our preference is for systemic methotrexate in concert with standard chemoimmunotherapy in the majority of cases. Several novel agents have also demonstrated clinical activity in primary and secondary central nervous system lymphoma and warrant future investigation in the prophylactic setting.

### A multicentre retrospective comparison of central nervous system prophylaxis strategies among patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^e0b8f0a3]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background:

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a devastating complication; the optimal prophylactic strategy remains unclear.

Methods:

We performed a multicentre, retrospective analysis of patients with DLBCL with high risk for CNS relapse as defined by two or more of: multiple extranodal sites, elevated serum LDH and B symptoms or involvement of specific high-risk anatomical sites. We compared three different strategies of CNS-directed therapy: intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) with (R)-CHOP 'group 1' R-CHOP with IT MTX and two cycles of high-dose intravenous (IV) MTX 'group 2' dose-intensive systemic antimetabolite-containing chemotherapy (Hyper-CVAD or CODOXM/IVAC) with IT/IV MTX 'group 3'.

Results:

Overall, 217 patients were identified (49, 125 and 43 in groups 1–3, respectively). With median follow-up of 3.4 (range 0.2–18.6) years, 23 CNS relapses occurred (12, 10 and 1 in groups 1–3 respectively). The 3-year actuarial rates (95% CI) of CNS relapse were 18.4% (9.5–33.1%), 6.9% (3.5–13.4%) and 2.3% (0.4–15.4%) in groups 1–3, respectively (P = 0.009).

Conclusions:

The addition of high-dose IV MTX and/or cytarabine was associated with lower incidence of CNS relapse compared with IT chemotherapy alone. However, these data are limited by their retrospective nature and warrant confirmation in prospective randomised studies.

### Timing of high-dose methotrexate CNS prophylaxis in DLBCL: a multicenter international analysis of 1384 patients [^362bf56d]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is often used for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients at high risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse, despite limited evidence demonstrating efficacy or the optimal delivery method. We conducted a retrospective, international analysis of 1384 patients receiving HD-MTX CNS prophylaxis either intercalated (i-HD-MTX) (n = 749) or at the end (n = 635) of R-CHOP/R-CHOP-like therapy (EOT). There were 78 CNS relapses (3-year rate 5.7%), with no difference between i-HD-MTX and EOT: 5.7% vs 5.8%, P = 0.98; 3-year difference: 0.04% (-2.0% to 3.1%). Conclusions were unchanged on adjusting for baseline prognostic factors or on 6-month landmark analysis (n = 1253). In patients with a high CNS international prognostic index (n = 600), the 3-year CNS relapse rate was 9.1%, with no difference between i-HD-MTX and EOT. On multivariable analysis, increasing age and renal/adrenal involvement were the only independent risk factors for CNS relapse. Concurrent intrathecal prophylaxis was not associated with a reduction in CNS relapse. R-CHOP delays of ≥ 7 days were significantly increased with i-HD-MTX vs EOT, with 308 of 1573 (19.6%) i-HD-MTX treatments resulting in a delay to subsequent R-CHOP (median 8 days). Increased risk of delay occurred in older patients when delivery was later than day 10 in the R-CHOP cycle. In summary, we found no evidence that EOT delivery increases CNS relapse risk vs i-HD-MTX. Findings in high-risk subgroups were unchanged. Rates of CNS relapse in this HD-MTX-treated cohort were similar to comparable cohorts receiving infrequent CNS prophylaxis. If HD-MTX is still considered for certain high-risk patients, delivery could be deferred until R-CHOP completion.

Strategies for prophylaxis of central nervous system disease

Intrathecal chemotherapy

Prophylaxis with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) and/or cytarabine, often combined with steroids, has been used historically in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. However, in the rituximab era, the majority of retrospective studies and post-hoc analyses from prospective trials showed lack of efficacy of IT prophylaxis (Table 2). Recent retrospective series including older patients and high-risk DLBCL have shown similar results with no apparent benefit of IT prophylaxis.

Testicular DLBCL represents a particular scenario in which IT prophylaxis might have a role in the prevention of CNS disease according to data from two prospective single-arm studies conducted by the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG). The IELSG10 study (n = 53) showed a low risk of CNS relapse for patients treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) plus contralateral testicular irradiation and four doses of IT MTX (5-year cumulative risk of 6%) compared to patients in previous retrospective series. Moreover, after a median follow-up of 5 years, no CNS relapses occurred in the IELSG30 trial analyzing 54 patients treated with R-CHOP, contralateral radiotherapy and intensified CNS prophylaxis with two doses of end-of-treatment high-dose (HD)-MTX (1.5 g/m) plus four doses of IT liposomal cytarabine. These trials have informed clinical practice and as a result many centers have incorporated IT MTX and end-of-treatment HD-MTX as CNS prophylaxis in this particular lymphoma.

Results of synthesis

Central nervous system relapse

HD-MTX (± IT prophylaxis) was administered to a total of 452 patients. The control group consisted of 1,209 patients either given no prophylaxis or given IT prophylaxis alone (Figure 2). A total of 38 (8.4%) relapses occurred in the HD-MTX group versus 125 (10.3%) in the control group. The meta-analysis found a non-significant RR of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.27–1.07; P = 0.08) for CNS relapse for patients receiving HD-MTX compared to controls.

Mortality

Survival data were available for 379 patients in the intervention group and 567 patients in the control group (Figure 3). Among the patients in the HD-MTX group, 107 (28.2%) died during follow-up compared to 225 (39.7%) in the control group.

### A multicentre retrospective comparison of central nervous system prophylaxis strategies among patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^f7d7b06b]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

There are several potential explanations for the suboptimal efficacy of IT methotrexate (MTX) alone. IT chemotherapy has poor penetration into brain parenchyma, the site of the majority of CNS relapses. Intravenous (IV) MTX achieves more even drug distribution within the neuroaxis than IT administration. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown continuous infusion of IV MTX results in a 'therapeutic' serum level longer than bolus administration. Hence, there is conceptual appeal to treating patients with doses of MTX and cytarabine capable of penetrating brain parenchyma.

Based on the report by) showing that the application of CNS prophylaxis with four doses of IT MTX and two courses of IV MTX at 3 g/m² reduced CNS relapse in patients with intermediate grade lymphoma, the CNS prophylaxis strategy for DLBCL at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC) was altered to include high-dose MTX either at the completion of R-CHOP therapy or in combination with cytarabine as part of the Hyper-CVAD regimen. Other Australian institutions subsequently adopted this policy and herein we evaluate the outcome of patients so treated.

### A multicentre retrospective comparison of central nervous system prophylaxis strategies among patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^38daa9f0]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The major limitation of this study lies in the retrospective nature, and heterogeneity in baseline risk and treatment factors (particularly rituximab) among the three groups, leading to potential bias. Nonetheless, this finding adds to the growing body of nonrandomised data suggesting that incorporation of high-dose IV MTX ± cytarabine into treatment protocols may lower the risk of CNS relapse in patients with DLBCL at high risk of the complication. Ideally, this hypothesis would be tested in an adequately powered, prospective study randomising patients to R-CHOP+IT MTX ± high-dose IV MTX and/or cytarabine, with the primary end point 2-year rate of CNS relapse. There are, however, several practical difficulties with performing such a study. Many clinicians believe sufficient evidence exists to support the efficacy of high-dose IV MTX ± cytarabine for CNS-directed prophylaxis and may be uncomfortable enrolling patients to a protocol with a chance of not receiving it. Second, because CNS relapse remains a rare complication, adequately powering a study is costly and difficult. Limiting the study to only high-risk patients (with estimated CNS relapse risk of ∼15%) would reduce the sample size needed, but such patients comprise < 10% of DLBCL overall. This probably explains why a prospective study addressing this question has yet to be completed to our knowledge.

### Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy in primary CNS lymphoma [^72f60724]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy in the treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma remains controversial. We report a retrospective single center study of a cohort of 69 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma who had been treated with a regimen that combined high intravenous doses of Methotrexate, CCNU, procarbazine and methylprednisolone. Before 2000, patients systematically received intrathecal prophylaxis including Methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone delivered either by intraventricular or lumbar injection along with the systemic chemotherapy (group A, n = 39). After this date, the procedure was changed and intrathecal chemotherapy was withdrawn from the protocol (group B, n = 30). The median age and Karnofsky index were comparable in both groups. At the time of analysis, we found no significant difference between patients with and without intrathecal prophylaxis in terms of objective response rate, patterns of relapse, progression-free survival or overall survival. In our study, intrathecal prophylaxis withdrawal from a high dose intravenous Methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimen did not influence disease control and outcome of primary central nervous system lymphoma. Further studies prospectively investigating the role of intrathecal chemoprophylaxis are warranted for this disease.

Challenge 2 – What is the most effective CNS-directed therapy regimen for newly diagnosed patients?

Overview

All modern ALL protocols employ a combination of systemic therapy and intrathecal (IT) therapy against CNS leukemia, with some trial groups also using radiotherapy for selected high-risk groups. This upfront CNS therapy is sometimes called "CNS prophylaxis", which reflects the aim to prevent CNS relapse. However, it can be wrongly misconstrued as meaning it is preventing dissemination of leukemia to the CNS, although CNS leukemia is likely to be present at the time of diagnosis. Thus, "CNS-directed therapy" is a more appropriate term than "CNS prophylaxis". The current CNS-directed therapy approaches taken by selected study groups are summarized in Table 3.

The main agents with significant CNS activity are intrathecal and systemic glucocorticoids (not least dexamethasone), intrathecal or intravenous (high-dose) methotrexate and cytarabine, and asparaginase. When choosing therapy, it is also important to consider potential neurotoxicity. Interested readers are referred to comprehensive reviews on this topic. Briefly, 4–12% of children suffer a neurotoxic serious adverse event (SAE) such as seizures, stroke-like syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and/or long-term neurocognitive deficits. ALL patients score 6–8 IQ points lower than controls and 15–35% of children have significantly impaired working memory, attention span and/or executive functioning. In addition, there are concerns that CNS-directed therapy may result in reduced cognitive reserve, thus risking early-onset dementia. The major culprit is thought to be methotrexate, although other agents may also contribute. Table 4 outlines the common agents used for ALL treatment, along with their CNS penetration and any known neurotoxic side-effects.

Two other retrospective studies evaluated high-dose methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis in DLBCL. In one Italian center, high-dose methotrexate (with or without intrathecal liposomal cytarabine at the discretion of the treating physician) was administered after completion of all cycles of R-CHOP for three or four cycles in patients deemed at high risk of CNS recurrence. These patients were then retrospectively compared to patients with high-risk features treated with no CNS prophylaxis. At a median of 60 months, 12% of patients who did not receive prophylaxis had had a CNS relapse versus 2.5% of those who received prophylaxis (P = 0.03), suggesting that CNS prophylaxis was beneficial. Of note, there were differences in risk factors between the two populations with more patients being defined as having high-risk disease due to advanced stage and elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration in the group that received no prophylaxis, while high-risk anatomic locations including testis, kidney and orbit were enriched in the prophylaxed population. Such differences in patient selection complicate the interpretation of all retrospective analyses, so that conclusions can be considered suggestive but not definitive. That said, a third retrospective analysis reported concordant results with lower rates of CNS relapse in patients treated with a combination of high-dose intravenous methotrexate and intrathecal methotrexate compared to intrathecal methotrexate alone with a hazard ratio for CNS relapse at 3 years of 0.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.08–0.81) based on multivariate analysis.

The use of methotrexate in clinical practice has expanded significantly in recent years, as an effective chemotherapeutic agent as well as disease-modifying treatment for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. It is also used as a steroid-sparing agent for a range of inflammatory diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Clinical neurologists must, therefore, know how to start and uptitrate methotrexate, its monitoring requirements and its potential toxicities. This review aims first to explore the evidence base for using methotrexate in various neurological diseases and second to discuss important practicalities around its use, ensuring its safe application and appropriate monitoring.

Systemic chemotherapy

Effective systemic therapy which crosses the blood-brain barrier may overcome the liabilities of intrathecal therapy and achieve even and predictable concentrations throughout the entire neuroaxis, including both the leptomeningeal and parenchymal compartments.

Consideration of systemic CNS prophylaxis is derived largely from experience in primary CNS DLBCL, in which high-dose systemic methotrexate improves progression-free and overall survival and remains the standard backbone of first-line treatment. The efficacy of systemic methotrexate as prophylactic therapy for the CNS has also been validated in acute lymphoblastic leukemiaand Burkitt lymphoma, in which it remains an accepted standard of care.

These results have been corroborated in DLBCL with the phase III GELA trial comparing CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone at 21-day intervals) against the intensive ACVBP regimen (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, prednisone induction followed by sequential consolidation therapy) in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma and IPI > 1. The ACVBP arm included four doses of intrathecal methotrexate, plus two infusions of high-dose systemic methotrexate at 3000 mg/m². Results of the trial were notable for significantly fewer CNS recurrences in the ACVBP arm compared to the CHOP arm (2.7% versus 8%; P = 0.004), as well as an overall survival benefit. Greater systemic disease control with the more intensive ACVBP regimen may well account for some of the observed benefit over CHOP, but the lower rate of isolated CNS relapse suggests that CNS prophylaxis may also have played an important role. Given the lack of appreciable benefit in numerous prior studies evaluating intrathecal methotrexate alone, it is reasonable to consider that the intravenous methotrexate contributed to the reduction in the rate of CNS recurrence.

Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Exploration of heterogeneity

The clinical heterogeneity is present most noticeably in the differential approach to high-risk classification (Table 1) and pre-diagnostic work-up (Table 2). As for methodological heterogeneity, the studies are estimated to be comparable with regard to both design (retrospective study design) and execution (chart review conducted by a small group of researchers) but divergent in regard to follow-up time (Table 4). As the calculated statistical heterogeneity of 61% among studies investigating the risk of CNS relapse may represent substantial heterogeneity, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for our primary endpoint including the studies by Ong, Bobillo, and Jeongthat had applied CNS-IPI risk stratification to the full cohort and the study by Puckrinthat had done so partially (Figure 4A). This did not alter the direction of the results but reduced the efficacy of CNS prophylaxis to prevent CNS relapse from a RR of 0.54 to 0.77 (95% CI: 0.38–1.56; P = 0.46) while statistical heterogeneity decreased from 61% to 55%.

To test our hypothesis that IT prophylaxis and no prophylaxis can be equated, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the studies by Cheahand Eyrein which the controls only received IT prophylaxis (Figure 4B). This reduced the heterogeneity from 61% to 54% and altered the RR of CNS relapse from 0.54 to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.33–1.42; P = 0.31).

Although methotrexate (MTX) is the most widely used therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the optimal regimen remains unclear. We examined the efficacy of different prophylactic regimens in 585 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL and high-risk for CNS relapse, treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like regimens from 2001 to 2017, of whom 295 (50%) received prophylaxis. Intrathecal (IT) MTX was given to 253 (86%) and high-dose MTX (HD-MTX) to 42 (14%). After a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 36 of 585 patients relapsed in the CNS, of whom 14 had received prophylaxis. The CNS relapse risk at 1 year was lower for patients who received prophylaxis than patients who did not: 2% vs. 7.1%. However, the difference became less significant over time (5-year risk 5.6% vs. 7.5%), indicating prophylaxis tended to delay CNS relapse rather than prevent it. Furthermore, the CNS relapse risk was similar in patients who received IT and HD-MTX (5-year risk 5.6% vs. 5.2%). Collectively, our data indicate the benefit of MTX for CNS prophylaxis is transient, highlighting the need for more effective prophylactic regimens. In addition, our results failed to demonstrate a clinical advantage for the HD-MTX regimen.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis and intrathecal (IT) therapy — CNS involvement should be evaluated (by lumbar puncture [LP]) at the appropriate timing, and timing of LP should be consistent with the chosen treatment regimen; pediatric‑inspired regimens typically include LP at the time of diagnostic workup, and the Panel recommends that IT therapy be administered with initial LP. All patients with ALL should receive CNS prophylaxis; although the presence of CNS involvement at diagnosis is uncommon (about 3%–7%), a substantial proportion of patients (> 50%) will eventually develop CNS leukemia in the absence of CNS‑directed therapy. CNS‑directed therapy may include cranial irradiation, IT therapy (eg, methotrexate, cytarabine, corticosteroid), and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, high‑dose methotrexate, intermediate or high‑dose cytarabine, pegaspargase [PEG]), and generally, IT therapy should start during the induction phase. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Efficacy of central nervous system prophylaxis with stand-alone intrathecal chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the rituximab era: a systematic review [^9debe88a]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) within the central nervous system (CNS) following front line anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy is relatively uncommon (typically 2–5%). – It typically occurs within the first year of follow up post-treatment and has devastating consequences. The median overall survival following recurrence within the CNS is approximately 2–5 months, with few patients achieving long term survival. As a result, attempts over many years have been made to reduce the risk of this complication of DLBCL. Although risk factors, for CNS relapse have been clearly described over recent years and the CNS international prognostic index (CNS-IPI) has been established and validated, the optimal and widely applicable CNS prophylactic strategy remains somewhat controversial.

High dose, systemic anti-metabolite therapy, typically in the form of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), is the most commonly employed systemic prophylactic therapy. The evidence base for the efficacy of HDMTX in the rituximab era is relatively weak but has been demonstrated in retrospective single or multicentre series. – No randomised prospective studies have been performed. HDMTX is given either followingor in an intercalated fashion alongside rituximab-based immunochemotherapy.HDMTX prophylaxis is widely administered for this purpose; however its toxicity profile typically limits its use to patients under 70 years of age, without serous effusions and with adequate renal function.

Intrathecal (IT) anti-metabolites, typically methotrexate (MTX) and/or cytarabine (ara-c), have also been employed either as stand-alone therapy in patients deemed at high risk of CNS relapse, or as adjunctive therapy to high dose intravenous anti-metabolites. The theoretical basis for IT prophylaxis has historically been extrapolated from the management of other lymphoid cancers such as Burkitt lymphomaand acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although not a universally applied practice, many centres continue to employ stand-alone IT prophylaxis in DLBCL patients at higher risk of CNS relapse who are otherwise being treated with curative intent but who are considered unsuitable candidates for HDMTX due to, for example, age, inadequate renal function, or patient/physician preference. Historical studies have demonstrated that IT methotrexate does not achieve therapeutic concentrations within the brain parenchymaand IT chemotherapy administration has the potential for well described morbidityas well as resource and administrative burden.

### Risk reduction of CNS relapse in diffuse large B cell lymphoma with intrathecal methotrexate prophylaxis: a single institution retrospective study… [^55dbad39]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract e19531 Background: Central nervous system relapse is an infrequent but serious and challenging complication in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that carries a dismal prognosis. While several risk factors have been identified to stratify the risk for CNS relapse including the 2015 CNS internal Prognostic index, controversy still remains regarding the indication, timing, and method of CNS prophylaxis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IT-MTX reduced the risk of CNS relapse, as well as treatment related and financial toxicity of CNS prophylaxis. Methods: We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis on a cohort of 192 patients with DLBCL who had received treatment between January 2010- August 2022. Patients were identified by using ICD10 code diagnosis in the electronic medical records system.

We included patients of all stages of disease and CNS-IPI scores along with patients with testis, breast, sinus, and bone marrow extranodal involvement. Patients with primary CNS disease and primary mediastinal disease were excluded from the study. Clinical data collected by chart review included age at time of diagnosis, sex, performance status, LDH level, disease stage, number and type of therapies administered including IT-MTX, extranodal involvement, MYC/BCL2/BCL6 translocation status, HIV status, cell of origin, treatment response. Toxicities and complications thought to be associated with IT-MTX prophylaxis were also documented in addition to total costs of treatment for each patient. Patient characteristics were compared using Fisher exact test or Pearson's chi-square test. Results: In patients with intermediate to high CNS relapse risk IT-MTX did not reduce the 1 year risk of CNS relapse.

Conclusions: In conclusion, our study highlights the necessity to develop improved standardized guidelines for use of CNS prophylaxis in patients with DLBCL. The results from our retrospective study add to the growing body of literature showing IT-MTX has limited and potentially transient effectiveness in preventing CNS relapse. Given the high rate of side effects and significant cost of IT-MTX, we recommend that clinicians carefully consider the risks and benefits of prophylaxis before prescribing IT-MTX for CNS-prophylaxis.

Method

Search strategy

The review was conducted systematically in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines, and was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42019121174). A comprehensive search was conducted following a systematic search strategy using the electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE ®, Ovid EMBASE® and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Boolean operators 'AND' and 'OR' were employed, as well as truncation (*).

Searches included the title and abstract where possible and were restricted to English language only. The search strategy was date restricted from 2002 until January 2019 as the pivotal trial establishing the benefit of rituximab in combination with CHOP was published in January of the year 2002. Search strategy comprised three main components, using relevant Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms where possible. Disease component(s) were searched for using the following search terms: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL, central nervous system relapse, CNS relapse, central nervous system recurrence, CNS recurrence, central nervous system progression, CNS progression. Prior therapies component(s) were searched for using the following search terms: rituximab, doxorubicin, anthracycline, R-CHOP, EPOCH and R-CHOEP. Intervention component(s) were searched for using the following search terms: central nervous system prophylaxis, CNS prophylaxis, intrathecal, intrathecal prophylaxis, intrathecal chemotherapy, intrathecal methotrexate, intrathecal cytarabine.

Full search strategies are summarised in the Online Supplementary Tables S1-3. The search was expanded using retrospective snowballing from the reference lists of initial studies included to ensure a sensitive and comprehensive search.

Screening search results

Search results were independently double-screened by the research team both at abstract and full text screening stages using eligibility criteria displayed in Table 1. Disagreements between any two researchers were referred to a third researcher to reach a consensus.

Similarly, a randomized controlled trial comparing R-CHOP-14 versus R-CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone plus rituximab at 21-day intervals) included 984 patients, of whom 177 received CNS prophylaxis with the vast majority (92%) receiving intrathecal methotrexate. When stratified based on CNS-IPI, patients treated with intrathecal methotrexate had similar rates of CNS relapse, progression-free and overall survival compared with those not given prophylaxis. Several additional retrospective analyses involving large numbers of patients treated with rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy in the modern era have likewise failed to demonstrate an association between intrathecal methotrexate use and reduction in CNS relapse rates.–

The lack of clinical benefit observed with intrathecal methotrexate may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of this drug. Historic experiments found that methotrexate concentrations within the neuroaxis varied widely between different patients when the drug was administered via lumbar puncture. In one study, two of nine patients given intrathecal methotrexate did not meet the target therapeutic concentration at any time, and five of the nine did not sustain therapeutic concentrations for 24 hours. Another study monitoring the distribution of radionuclide Indium showed that it could take up to 24 hours for intrathecal injections of Indium to appear in the ventricles, suggesting that intrathecal therapy injected at the lumbar sac may fail to protect the cerebral leptomeninges due to uneven distribution. Furthermore, intrathecal methotrexate fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations within the brain parenchyma, which could lead to reduced efficacy in this site where the majority of CNS relapses occur in the rituximab era.,

It is important to note the significant limitations of studies evaluating the efficacy of intrathecal methotrexate. While available data including non-randomized prospective and retrospective studies have not reliably demonstrated lower CNS relapse rates in patients receiving intrathecal therapy, these data are heterogeneous and cannot be considered definitive in their conclusions. Only appropriately powered randomized trials can truly exclude the possibility that intrathecal methotrexate reduces the risk of CNS relapse, although such trials would be extremely difficult to conduct. In cases in which alternative therapies, such as high-dose intravenous methotrexate, cannot be administered, intrathecal methotrexate remains a reasonable option.

One scenario in which intrathecal methotrexate remains an appropriate standard therapy is when administered with the dose-adjusted EPOCH-R regimen in patients with Burkitt lymphoma or high grade B-cell lymphoma (including double-hit and triple-hit lymphoma), in which it has been the exclusively studied method of CNS protection. Intrathecal methotrexate has been demonstrated to improve the clinical outcome in these histological types of lymphoma which frequently relapse in the CSF.

Identification of patients with a high risk of central nervous system disease

Our approach to CNS prophylaxis is summarized in Figure 1.

Clinical risk factors

The CNS prognostic model (CNS-IPI), including the five standard International Prognostic Index factors (age > 60 years, stage III/IV, ≥ 2 extranodal sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and performance status ≥ 2) and kidney or adrenal gland involvement, stratifies patients into three categories: low (0–2 risk factors), intermediate (2–3 risk factors) and high risk (4–6 risk factors) with 2-year rates of CNS relapse of 0.6%, 3.4% and 10.2%, respectively. This is a robust model, but it underestimates the risk of CNS relapse of specific extranodal lymphomas associated with a high risk of CNS recurrence (i.e. testicular, breast), that usually present with limited-stage disease, and therefore fall into the low or intermediate categories. The risk of CNS relapse following disease in other extranodal sites, such as the uterus, bone marrow or epidural space, is controversialand craniofacial structures may no longer be high-risk sites since the introduction of rituximab. The involvement of ≥ 3 extranodal sites determined by PET/CT was also shown to confer a high risk of CNS relapse in a retrospective analysis of 1,532 patients, with a 3-year cumulative risk of CNS relapse of 15% compared to 2.6% among patients with ≤ 2 extranodal sites of disease. The CNS-IPI model does not include biological risk factors recently associated with higher risk of CNS relapse.

### Prophylaxis with intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and high risk of CNS relapse [^07e1d43e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In high-risk patients, CNS prophylaxis is usually recommended, although the optimal regimen remains unclear. Some prospective and retrospective studies conducted in the rituximab era have demonstrated the lack of efficacy of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) in patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or similar regimens. High-dose intravenous methotrexate (HD-MTX) has been postulated as a possibly better option since the majority of relapses in the rituximab era occur in the brain parenchyma. However, different retrospective studies have shown conflicting results regarding its efficacy. Finally, preliminary results from a multicenter retrospective study showed similar effectiveness of prophylactic HD-MTX and IT MTX in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different CNS prophylaxis regimens in preventing CNS relapse in DLBCL patients with risk factors for CNS recurrence who were treated with rituximab and chemotherapy in a single institution.

Route of administration — IV vs. IT

Intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate or cytarabine has also been used as CNS prophylaxis, although IT chemotherapy has poor penetration into the brain parenchyma. Previous studies were small but found that HD-MTX was associated with a lower incidence of relapse compared to IT chemotherapy. More recently, several analyses found no differences between HD-MTX and IT chemotherapy.

In a large retrospective study of 1162 patients comparing CNS prophylaxis with IT and systemic methotrexate (MTX), there was no difference in the relapse rates or survival. Approximately four-fifths of the patients received IT prophylaxis, while 20% received HD-MTX. Thirty percent of the patients had high-risk disease according to the CNS-IPI and approximately half were considered moderate risk. However, there was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates between the IT and HD-MTX patients (5.4% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.40), even after propensity score matching. The predicted CNS relapse rate, weighted by CNS-IPI score, was nearly identical to the observed relapse rate (5.8% vs. 5.7%).

Systemic and IT prophylaxis were also compared in a prospective, multicenter, phase III trial involving 142 patients. There was no statistical difference in the 2-year cumulative incidence of CNS relapse between the IT MTX (5.5%, 95% CI 0.6–19.1) and HD-MTX arms (4.9%, 95% CI 0.2–23.9; p = 0.749). Interestingly, the median time to CNS relapse was 4.4 months in the IT MTX arm and 12.0 in the HD-MTX arm, suggesting that perhaps HD-MTX delays rather than prevents CNS recurrence. The 2-year PFS was also similar between the two groups (70.4% vs 66.4%; p = 0.571). HD-MTX was also associated with significant treatment delays of over 7 days in 59% of patients.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) — central nervous system (CNS) relapse risk and prophylaxis: Stage IE primary DLBCL of the breast and primary testicular DLBCL are linked to CNS risk, and inclusion of methotrexate for CNS prophylaxis as well as scrotal RT (25–30 Gy) after completion of chemoimmunotherapy is therefore recommended. The role of CNS prophylaxis remains controversial, but it can be considered for patients with high-risk disease (4–6 risk factors according to CNS-IPI; kidney or adrenal gland involvement; testicular lymphoma; primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type or stage IE DLBCL of the breast). The following options are included if CNS prophylaxis is used: systemic high-dose methotrexate (3–3.5 g/m² for 2–4 cycles) and/or intrathecal methotrexate and/or cytarabine (4–8 doses) during or after treatment. Lumbar puncture should be considered for these patients, particularly if neurologic symptoms are present, and the diagnostic yield is improved if flow cytometric analysis of cerebrospinal fluid is undertaken.

### Reduction in central nervous system leukemia with a pharmacokinetically derived intrathecal methotrexate dosage regimen… [^52185acc]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract During the period 1976–1981, 3241 children were enrolled on three major studies of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by participating institutions of the Children's Cancer Study Group. Each study included a different method of central nervous system prophylaxis: standard therapy with cranial irradiation, 2400 rads, and intrathecal methotrexate at 12 mg/m² six times during consolidation; a modification of CCG. -141 in which the intrathecal methotrexate was initiated during induction; and a reduced cranial irradiation dose of 1800 rads with intrathecal methotrexate given at the same frequency as a CCG-141A, with or without maintenance intrathecal methotrexate, but with a dosage regimen derived from CNS volume considerations rather than based on body surface area. Strategy 3, a change in the intrathecal methotrexate dosage, has resulted in the lowest incidence of CNS leukemia to date.

The cumulative 3-yr CNS relapse rate has decreased from 8%-10% to 2%-5% in average-risk patients and from 23%-27% to 6% in high-risk patients, despite a reduction in the cranial irradiation dose from 2400 to 1800 rads. Maintenance intrathecal chemotherapy has had a marginal effect among patients randomized to receive this additional therapy. The overall outcome has been an increase in the continuous complete remission rate but not in the estimated 3-yr continuous hematologic remission or survival rates.

### High-dose methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis in high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma [^ecd4b4e7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

CNS progression or relapse is an uncommon but devastating complication of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. There is no consensus regarding the optimal approach to CNS prophylaxis. This study was designed to determine whether high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is effective at preventing CNS progression in patients at high risk of this complication.

Patients and Methods

Patients age 18–80 years with aggressive B-cell lymphoma and high risk of CNS progression, treated with curative-intent anti-CD20-based chemoimmunotherapy, were included in this international, retrospective, observational study. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and cumulative risks of CNS progression were calculated according to use of HD-MTX, with time to CNS progression calculated from diagnosis for all patients (all-pts) and from completion of frontline systemic lymphoma induction therapy, for patients in complete response at completion of chemoimmunotherapy (CR-pts).

Results

Two thousand four hundred eighteen all-pts (HD-MTX; n = 425) and 1,616 CR-pts (HD-MTX; n = 356) were included. CNS International Prognostic Index was 4–6 in 83.4% all-pts. Patients treated with HD-MTX had a lower risk of CNS progression (adjusted HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90]; P = 0.014), but significance was not retained when confined to CR-pts (adjusted HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.42 to 1.30]; P = 0.29), with 5-year adjusted risk difference of 1.6% (95% CI, -1.5 to 4.4; all-pts) and 1.4% (95% CI, -1.5 to 4.1; CR-pts). Subgroups were underpowered to draw definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of HD-MTX in individual high-risk clinical scenarios; however, there was no clear reduction in CNS progression risk with HD-MTX in any high-risk subgroup.

Conclusion

In this large study, high-risk patients receiving HD-MTX had a 7.2% 2-year risk of CNS progression, consistent with the progression risk in previously reported high-risk cohorts. Use of HD-MTX was not associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in risk of CNS progression.

CNS relapse and the effect of prophylaxis on CNS relapse

After a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 36 out of 585 patients considered HR-CNS, relapsed in the CNS with a 5-year risk of 6.5%. Fourteen (39%) patients had received prophylaxis: 12 IT and 2 HD-MTX. The risk of CNS relapse at 5 years for patients who received IT, HD-MTX, or no prophylaxis was 5.5%; 5% and 7.5% (p = 0.34), respectively (Fig. 2). The risk of CNS relapse by prophylaxis was similar when excluding patients who received concomitant HD-MTX and IT (Supplementary Fig. 1). CNS relapse risk was similar among patients who received R-CHOP, R-EPOCH, and R-CHOP/RICE (p = 0.12) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The 5-year CNS relapse risk for patients considered low-risk CNS and not included in the study was 1.1%.

The median time to relapse since first diagnosis was 9 months (range 6–110 months). Patients who received prophylaxis, either IT or HD-MTX, relapsed later than patients who did not receive prophylaxis, with a median time to relapse of 19 months (range 7–55 months) vs. 8 months (range 6–110 months), respectively. The risk of relapse at 1 year was lower for patients who received prophylaxis compared to patients who did not receive prophylaxis 2% vs. 7.1%, RR 0.29 (95% CI; 0.08,0.66). However, over time, the risk of CNS relapse became closer among prophylaxis and no-prophylaxis groups, with a 3-year risk of 3.8% vs. 7.5% (RR 0.51, CI 95%; 0.22, 1.04) and a 5-year risk of 5.6% vs. 7.5% (RR 0.76, CI 95%; 0.35,1.50), respectively (Fig. 3).

### Prevention of CNS relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^144c9ab8]. The Lancet: Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

CNS relapse occurs in about 5% of patients during the course of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and entails a dismal prognosis. This consideration has led to the adoption of CNS prophylaxis, although known risk factors do not allow for an accurate prediction of CNS recurrences because they have insufficient sensitivity and specificity. Here, we review the reports of CNS events in major studies of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma before and after the introduction of rituximab, and probe the evidence that underlies prophylactic strategies such as intrathecal or high-dose intravenous chemotherapy. Now that rituximab is available, CNS prophylaxis relies on little-if any-evidence and should not be routinely administered. Nonetheless, several patient subgroups probably have a high risk of systemic and CNS relapses, and how to manage their treatment is a challenge. These subgroups include patients with testicular lymphoma or those who have more than one extranodal site involved plus at least one additional risk factor. For such patients, we recommend against prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy because of the rare occurrence of isolated leptomeningeal relapses, the absence of evidence-based efficacy, and the potential harmful side-effects that are associated with this procedure. Because many CNS events are a result of primary resistance to treatment or accompany systemic relapses, high-dose intravenous methotrexate has been suggested as an alternative approach that needs to be validated in prospective controlled trials.

### Impact of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis on the incidence and risk factors for CNS relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated in the rituximab era: a single centre experience and review of the literature [^be212506]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is controversial with even less evidence in the era of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy. We reviewed the impact of CNS prophylaxis in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP at a tertiary care centre over a 7-year period. CNS prophylaxis was recommended for 'higher risk' patients and consisted of intrathecal methotrexate and/or high-dose methotrexate. Of 214 patients 12.6% received CNS prophylaxis. With a median follow-up of 27 months, eight patients (3.7%) developed CNS relapse (75% isolated to the CNS and 62.5% as parenchymal brain disease) at a median time of 17 months. Patients who did not receive CNS prophylaxis had lower events (2.7%) than those who did (11.1%). Half of the CNS relapses occurred in testicular lymphoma patients, 75% of whom had received CNS prophylaxis. In multivariate analysis, testicular involvement was the only significant prognostic factor for CNS relapse (hazard ratio 33.5, P < 0.001). In conclusion, CNS relapse in DLBCL appears to present as a later, more isolated parenchymal event and at a lower rate in the rituximab era compared with historical data. R-CHOP may negate the need for CNS prophylaxis with the exception of testicular lymphoma.

### Ineffectiveness of high-dose methotrexate for prevention of CNS relapse in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^26463a0a]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse affects 5% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and portends a poor prognosis. Prophylactic intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is frequently employed to reduce this risk, but there is limited evidence supporting this practice. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study to determine the CNS relapse risk with HD-MTX in DLBCL patients aged 18-70years treated in Alberta, Canada between 2012 and 2019. Provincial guidelines recommended HD-MTX for patients at high-risk of CNS relapse based upon CNS-IPI score, double-hit lymphoma, or testicular involvement. Among 906 patients with median follow-up 35.3months (range 0.29–105.7), CNS relapse occurred in 1.9% with CNS-IPI 0–1, 4.9% with CNS-IPI 2–3, and 12.2% with CNS-IPI 4–6 (p < .001). HD-MTX was administered to 115/326 (35.3%) high-risk patients, of whom 96 (83.5%) had CNS-IPI score 4–6, 45 (39.1%) had double-hit lymphoma, and four (3.5%) had testicular lymphoma. The median number of HD-MTX doses was two (range 1–3). Central nervous system relapse risk was similar with versus without HD-MTX (11.2% vs. 12.2%, p = .82) and comparable to previous reports of high-risk patients who did not receive CNS prophylaxis (10–12%). In multivariate and propensity score analyses, HD-MTX demonstrated no association with CNS relapse, progression-free survival, or overall survival. This study did not demonstrate a benefit of prophylactic HD-MTX in this high-risk patient population. Further study is required to determine the optimal strategy to prevent CNS relapse in DLBCL.

### Timing of high-dose methotrexate CNS prophylaxis in DLBCL: an analysis of toxicity and impact on R-CHOP delivery [^fd00a2b8]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is increasingly used as prophylaxis for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at high risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. However, there is limited evidence to guide whether to intercalate HD-MTX (i-HD-MTX) between R-CHOP-21 (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone given at 21-day intervals) or to give it at the end of treatment (EOT) with R-CHOP-21. We conducted a retrospective, multicenter analysis of 334 patients with DLBCL who received CNS prophylaxis with i-HD-MTX (n = 204) or EOT HD-MTX (n = 130). Primary end points were R-CHOP delay rates and HD-MTX toxicity. Secondary end points were CNS relapse rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The EOT group had more patients with a high CNS international prognostic index (58% vs 39%; P < .001) and more concurrent intrathecal prophylaxis (56% vs 34%; P < .001). Of the 409 cycles of i-HD-MTX given, 82 (20%) were associated with a delay of next R-CHOP (median, 7 days). Delays were significantly increased when i-HD-MTX was given after day 9 post-R-CHOP (26% vs 16%; P = 0.01). On multivariable analysis, i-HD-MTX was independently associated with increased R-CHOP delays. Increased mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and longer median inpatient stay were recorded with i-HD-MTX delivery. Three-year cumulative CNS relapse incidence was 5.9%, with no differences between groups. There was no difference in survival between groups. We report increased toxicity and R-CHOP delay with i-HD-MTX compared with EOT delivery but no difference in CNS relapse or survival. Decisions on HD-MTX timing should be individualized and, where i-HD-MTX is favored, we recommend scheduling before day 10 of R-CHOP cycles.

### Managing CNS disease in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^70ed6231]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

The central nervous system (CNS) is an important site of involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults. The prevalence is sufficiently high that prophylactic treatment is routinely given to this sanctuary site in order to eradicate occult disease that might otherwise lead to a relapse. A lumbar puncture should be routinely performed in all newly diagnosed patients with ALL. The risks of CNS leukemia vary by phenotype and genotype. Preventive treatment of the CNS during post-remission therapy has become an integral part of all current ALL treatment protocols. Most treatment regimens combine multiple doses of intrathecal chemotherapy with high-dose systemic methotrexate and/or cytarabine. Cranial irradiation is less commonly used for prophylaxis but is still the most effective treatment for overt CNS leukemia. Recurrences within the CNS usually coincide with or predict soon afterwards for systemic relapse in the marrow and blood.

CNS prophylaxis

There is no data guiding the indication and/or utility of CNS prophylaxis in limited-stage disease. When evaluating the CNS-IPI, features most associated with the risk of CNS relapse that is pertinent in limited-stage disease are extranodal involvement or involvement at a site considered "high risk" such as nasal sinuses. Studies evaluating the CNS relapse risk in limited-stage disease suggest a higher risk of relapse if there was an MYC rearrangement; there was no impact of primary disease site. Among relapses, one-third had a CNS relapse. A recent retrospective review of CNS prophylaxis and relapses in all stages of DLBCL found an increased risk of testicular CNS relapse, but no difference in CNS relapse rates between routes of prophylaxis — either systemic high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) or intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX). With this lack of evidence of a difference in relapse rates, IT-MTX is often a preferable option for prophylaxis given lower rates of toxicity and delay in systemic therapy.

National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) guidelines for CNS prophylaxis, although not specific to limited stage disease, include high-risk disease sites as an indication for prophylaxis, including kidney, adrenal, testicular, and breast. Other retrospective work has suggested that involvement of sites such as paranasal sinuses, breasts, and testes should also receive CNS prophylaxis. Overall, there is insufficient data to definitively guide decision-making regarding CNS prophylaxis, and more data is needed.

### Prophylaxis with intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and high risk of CNS relapse [^4d2815f2]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Although in our series the risk of CNS relapse was similar regardless the use of prophylaxis, we found that within the first year from diagnosis the risk was higher in patients who did not receive prophylaxis compared to patients who received IT or HD-MTX with a risk of 7.1% vs. 2% vs. 2.4%, respectively. However, over time, the risk became similar between groups, raising up to 5.6% and 5.2% at 5 years in the HD-MTX and IT groups, respectively. These findings were not observed in previous studies analyzing the role of CNS prophylaxis. However, the median follow-up in these studies was around 2.5 years, so late relapses might have been underestimated. Our evidence suggests CNS prophylaxis might help to partially control undetected CNS disease present at diagnosis delaying the occurrence of CNS relapse, rather than preventing it. Furthermore, the use of CNS prophylaxis might not prevent from late CNS relapse in the HR-CNS population.

Finally, we noticed that the presence of non-GCB phenotype determined by immunohistochemistry confers an increased risk of CNS relapse in the HR-CNS population. These results are in accordance with a recent publication analyzing the impact of COO by GEP in 1418 patients from the GOYA phase 3 trial. In this study, the authors found that ABC or unclassified phenotype was an independent risk factor for CNS relapse, and patients with high-CNS-IPI together with an ABC phenotype had a 2-year CNS relapse rate of 15%. Interestingly, although we used immunohistochemistry techniques to determine the COO phenotype, we observed similar results, suggesting that in the absence of molecular analysis, COO assessed by immunohistochemistry along with other risk factors could be useful to identify high-risk patients.

In conclusion, our study highlights the need for developing more effective CNS prophylaxis regimens than MTX. Furthermore, our data in addition to emerging data from other centers, did not demonstrate clinical advantage for using intravenous HD-MTX over traditional IT MTX. Since HD-MTX is associated with higher incidence of adverse events resulting in more delays in the administration of R-CHOP cycles, we recommend that benefit/risk assessment should be carefully considered before adopting HD-MTX for CNS prophylaxis.

### Central nervous system chemoprophylaxis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma: current practice in the UK [^28407226]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a well-recognised complication. There is no consensus regarding indications for prophylaxis or a standard CNS chemoprophylaxis regimen. Current UK practice was evaluated using a questionnaire. A total of 223 questionnaires were sent to clinicians who administered chemotherapy to patients with NHL; 158 (71%) evaluable questionnaires were returned. The overwhelming majority of respondents used prophylaxis in all cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma (97%) and Burkitt lymphoma (96%). Ninety-six per cent of respondents required risk factors to be present before prophylaxis was initiated in cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The commonest risk factor was site of involvement (paranasal sinus 88%, testicular 85%, orbital cavity 78%, bone marrow 65% and bone 28%). Other risk factors included stage IV, high International Prognostic Index score, > 1 extranodal site and raised lactate dehydrogenase levels (34%, 21%, 16% and 10%). A total of 82% did not give prophylaxis in follicular lymphoma and 90% used intrathecal chemotherapy as their preferred method of prophylaxis. The most popular regimen was 12.5 mg methotrexate with each cycle of chemotherapy for six courses. Thirty-nine per cent used systemic chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis either alone (4%) or as an adjunct to intrathecal prophylaxis (35%). These variations in the indications and methods of prophylaxis indicate that this subject deserves further review.

### Risk-tailored CNS prophylaxis in a mono-institutional series of 200 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated in the rituximab era [^3070826f]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The most effective strategy to prevent central nervous system (CNS) dissemination in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains an important, unmet clinical need. Herein, we report a retrospective analysis of risk-tailored CNS prophylaxis in 200 human immunodeficiency virus-negative adults with DLBCL treated with rituximab-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or similar. High risk of CNS relapse was defined by involvement of specific extranodal organs, or simultaneous presence of advanced stage and high serum lactate dehydrogenase level; CNS prophylaxis with high-dose methotrexate ± intrathecal chemotherapy (IT) was routinely used in high-risk patients diagnosed after 2007. CNS relapse risk was low in 93 patients and high in 107; 40 high-risk patients received prophylaxis, which consisted of IT alone in 7. At a median follow-up of 60 months, one low-risk and nine high-risk patients (1% vs. 8%; P = 0.01) experienced CNS relapse. In the high-risk group, CNS relapses occurred in 8/67 (12%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 1/40 (2.5%) patients who did; the latter occurred in a patient managed with IT alone. CNS relapse rate was 12% (9/74) for patients treated with "inadequate" prophylaxis (none or IT only) and 0% (0/33) for patients managed with intravenous prophylaxis (P = 0.03). In conclusion, high-dose methotrexate-based prophylaxis significantly reduces CNS failures in high-risk patients stratified by involvement of specific extranodal sites and International Prognostic Index.

### Intrathecal chemotherapy alone is inadequate central nervous system prophylaxis in patients with intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^249f3281]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) relapse of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is usually fatal despite therapy and effective prophylaxis is desirable. Patients at high-risk usually receive intrathecal (i.t.) prophylaxis, although its efficacy is unproven. We therefore analyzed the outcome of all patients with newly diagnosed "intermediate-grade" NHL receiving i.t. prophylaxis from 1991 to 1999. Twenty-six patients were identified and analyzed. All were free of CNS involvement at diagnosis with negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. Disease stage was IE in 7, and IV in 19, with a median of two extranodal sites involved. Serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 65%, and the median International Prognostic Factors Index score was 3 (range 0–5). Anthracycline-based chemotherapy was used in all cases and included high-dose methotrexate ± ara-C in six patients. The median number of i.t. treatments was 5 (range 1–12) and comprised methotrexate ± steroid in 15, together with ara-C in 11. The actuarial 3-year CNS-relapse rate was 26 ± 10%. Six CNS-relapses were observed and involved the spinal cord or brain parenchyma in two cases each, and the leptomeninges in four patients. Treatment-related variables associated with higher CNS-relapse rates (34–50%) were: delay of ≥ 14 days from diagnosis to first i.t. injection, < 5 i.t. treatments, delay of i.t. prophylaxis until after attaining CR and systemic treatment lacking high-dose methotrexate ± ara-C (each P ≤ 0.17). I.t. CNS prophylaxis, as used here, was inadequate. Alternative approaches should be pursued.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon subtype of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with less than 1500 cases annually. Incidence of PCNSL has remained stable in the post-highly active antiretroviral therapy era, owing to increasing incidence in elderly, immunocompetent patients. Most PCNSL is diffuse large B cell in origin, with less frequent involvement of T-cell and Burkitt lymphoma. Secondary central nervous system lymphoma is more likely to occur in the relapsed setting of a systemic NHL. Methotrexate forms the backbone of management for prophylaxis and treatment of disease. Treatments are currently under investigation for both disease entities.

Regarding medical management for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, more specifically with respect to CNS prophylaxis, BSH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer high-dose IV methotrexate as early as possible as part of first-line therapy without compromising the dose and time intensity of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone-like treatment. Individualize the decisions on whether to intercalate or deliver at the end of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone based on a careful analysis of competing risks.

### Prediction of methotrexate neurotoxicity using clinical, sociodemographic, and area-based information in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^9b7611d9]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in children, with a global annual age-adjusted incidence rate of 49 cases per 1 000 000 children. Due to improvements in risk-adapted therapy and supportive care, nearly 90% of children diagnosed with ALL in high-income countries are expected to survive at least 5 years after diagnosis. Methotrexate is a critical component of most contemporary pediatric ALL treatment protocols and plays an important role in the treatment and prevention of central nervous system (CNS) disease. However, intrathecal (IT) and intravenous (IV) methotrexate therapy results in acute neurotoxicity in 3% to 14% of children. Clinical manifestations of acute neurotoxicity can range from altered mental status to seizures, stroke-like symptoms, or encephalopathy. Although acute symptoms typically resolve within weeks, neurotoxicity often results in methotrexate treatment modifications and has been linked to an increased risk of ALL relapse. Despite being a significant source of morbidity and potentially compromising ALL treatment efficacy, risk factors for methotrexate-related neurotoxicity remain poorly defined.

### CNS prophylaxis is (mostly) futile in DLBCL [^5a979f1f]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of HD-MTX

Although earlier reports suggested that HD-MTX had better penetration of the brain parenchyma and was associated with a lower incidence of relapse compared to IT, several larger studies have generally found no significant benefit with prophylaxis with HD-MTX, particularly in patients with complete response to R-CHOP or similar chemoimmunotherapy given with curative intent. One large retrospective evaluated 2418 DLBCL patients, including 1616 patients with a complete response (CR) to therapy. Most of the patients were high risk, with 83.4% of patients having CNS-IPI scores of 4–6. Approximately one-fourth of the patients had received HD-MTX. Patients who received CNS prophylaxis with HD-MTX did not demonstrate an improvement in CNS relapse rates, with a 5-year adjusted risk difference of 1.6% (95% CI, –1.5 to 4.4) in all patients, and 1.4% (95% CI, –1.5 to 4.1) in CR patients.

Another review of patients with a high risk of CNS disease also showed no difference in relapse or survival with the addition of HD-MTX. In the CNS-IPI high-risk group, 115/326 (35.3%) of patients received HD-MTX. There was no difference in relapse risk between the patients who received HD-MTX and those who did not (11.2% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.82). Multivariate and propensity score analyses did not demonstrate improvement in relapse, progression-free survival, or overall survival.

Extramedullary disease prophylaxis and treatment — The goal of CNS prophylaxis and/or treatment is to prevent CNS disease or relapse by clearing leukemic cells within sites that cannot be readily accessed with systemic chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier. CNS3 disease is associated with worse outcomes compared with CNS1 or CNS2 disease, and patients with CNS2 also have worse outcome than those with CNS1 in B-ALL. CNS-directed therapy may include IT therapy (eg, IT MTX with or without cytarabine and corticosteroid), cranial irradiation, and/or systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, HD-MTX, intermediate-/high-dose cytarabine, asparaginase). Cranial irradiation is often avoided in favor of IT therapy and systemic chemotherapy when possible due to concern for late adverse effects, particularly in patients with CNS1 or CNS2 status. CNS prophylaxis is typically given to all patients throughout the entire course of ALL therapy, from induction, to consolidation, to the maintenance phases of treatment.

### IELSG30 phase 2 trial: intravenous and intrathecal CNS prophylaxis in primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^17b9dfc7]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

At this dose the concentration of MTX in the leptomeningeal compartment is relatively low, thus, the contribution of the concomitant IT prophylaxis to the outcome may be relevant. Moreover, in comparison with the standard IT MTX used in the prior IELSG10 study, the use of the liposomal formulation may have ensured higher and more prolonged cytarabine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Indeed, controlled clinical trials have shown that liposomal cytarabine have a better clinical profile than the classical treatments of neoplastic meningitiswith, in lymphomatous meningitis, superior response rates, improved quality of life, and a prolongation of the time to neurological progression. More recent literature also provided some evidence of its safety and activity in different prophylaxis settings.

Although liposomal cytarabine may optimize the IT chemotherapy, the compound was permanently withdrawn from the market because of persistent manufacturing process problems. This withdrawal has made it challenging to further elucidate its role in controlling disease spread into the CNS, as suggested by our results. Nevertheless, the IELSG30 study also indicates potential benefit of IV HD-MTX in a patient population at very high risk of CNS recurrence. Notably, the administration IV HD-MTX was planned at the end of chemoimmunotherapy to prevent an adverse impact of MTX toxicity on the regular and complete delivery of the R-CHOP program. Our results are in line, in terms of safety and tolerability, with recent data from an international survey demonstrating that the administration of HD-MTX during R-CHOP program significantly increases the risk of R-CHOP delay and that the administration of HD-MTX at the end of treatment with R-CHOP is not inferior to early administration with regards to CNS relapse risk. The single-arm study design does not allow to define the relative role of the IT and IV components of our prophylaxis program in determining the treatment outcome. However, the experience gained in this study suggests that the administration of IV HD-MTX at the dose of ≥ 1.5 g/m² per 2 courses, in combination with IT chemotherapy, may reduce the risk of CNS relapse, or that the addition of IV HD-MTX may have contributed to an overall improved outcome with a more effective systemic treatment. Only a randomized trial could draw definitive conclusion in this setting, but this is not feasible in a rare disease as PTL. Finally, this trial confirms our previous observations, and provides further evidence of the efficacy of RT to prevent the risk of contralateral relapse; moreover, the lack of isolated retroperitoneal relapses in patients with stage II disease suggests that irradiation of retroperitoneal lymph nodes may be omitted in stage II disease without impairing the outcome.

### Prophylaxis with intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and high risk of CNS relapse [^24138631]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with recently published studies in the rituximab era, we observed a risk of CNS relapse of 6.5% at 5 years in the HR-CNS group. Furthermore, our results are similar to a recent real-world study from Sweden including 4205 patients with DLBCL, that reported a 2-year CNS risk of 8% in the high-risk patients. Other investigators reported a slightly higher incidence of CNS relapse, with a 2-year risk of 10.2%. The lower incidence of our study is likely due to the fact that we frequently perform brain magnetic resonance imaging in addition to a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Therefore, patients with active CNS involvement at diagnosis are promptly identified and excluded from the prophylactic strategy.

Whether CNS prophylaxis is useful in preventing CNS relapse has been addressed in several studies over the past years, including the most widely used strategy IT MTX and more recently intravenous methotrexate. The majority of the retrospective studies and post hoc analysis from prospective trials showed the lack of efficacy of IT prophylaxis in the rituximab era. In this regard, Kumar et al. using the prospectively collected National Comprehensive Cancer Network database, analyzed the risk of CNS relapse in 989 newly diagnosed DLBCL, 117 (11.8%) of whom had received prophylaxis, mostly IT MTX. They described no benefit from prophylaxis in the whole population and also in high-risk patients, though patients with involvement of kidney or adrenal glands or patients with double-hit lymphomas were not included in the high-risk group. More recently, a large retrospective study including 690 patients older than 70 years of whom 271 had high-risk CNS-IPI, also described a similar rate of CNS relapse regardless the use of IT MTX prophylaxis [HR 1.34 (95% CI, 0.46–3.86)]. Our series included only high-risk patients from all ages who received mostly IT MTX as prophylaxis (43%). In line with previously reported, we did not observe a clear benefit from IT MTX on preventing CNS relapse, especially after the first year of immunochemotherapy.

### The role of intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^d1e8f9ba]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) following initial treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an uncommon but serious complication. This single centre retrospective study investigated the rate of CNS relapse in patients with DLBCL who received standardised intrathecal (IT) chemoprophylaxis.

Patients and Methods

A total of 259 patients were newly diagnosed and treated for DLBCL from October 1996 to May 2005 and retrospectively analysed for incidence of CNS relapse. Our institutional policy for patients at risk for CNS relapse was for IT chemoprophylaxis to be administered concurrently with systemic treatment. Defined at-risk patients were those with lymphoma involvement at the following sites: bone marrow, testis, nasal/paranasal sinuses, orbits, bone/vertebrae and peripheral blood.

Results

Of 259 patients with DLBCL, a total of 51 patients (19.7%) received IT chemoprophylaxis. Forty-four patients received single agent IT methotrexate (MTX) 12.5 mg (median 3 doses, range 1–7); 27 patients (53%) received 1–3 doses and 17 patients (33.3%) 4–7 doses of MTX. Seven patients (13.7%) received a combination of IT MTX plus cytarabine. Three patients (1.1%) subsequently developed CNS relapse. One of these patients had IT chemoprophylaxis, the other two did not meet the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) criteria for IT chemoprophylaxis. The median time from diagnosis of DLBCL to CNS relapse was 31.8 months (range 27.3–34.1 months).

Conclusion

The CNS relapse rate in this cohort of patients with primary DLBCL was low at 1.1%. This retrospective analysis demonstrates in a homogeneous group of DLBCL patients that a relatively low-intensity IT chemoprophylaxis regimen given according to site-based risk can be associated with a low risk of CNS relapse.

### High-dose methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis in high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma… [^6794a957]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose CNS progression or relapse is an uncommon but devastating complication of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. There is no consensus regarding the optimal approach to CNS prophylaxis. This study was designed to determine whether high-dose methotrexate is effective at preventing CNS progression in patients at high risk of this complication. Results Two thousand four hundred eighteen all-pts and 1, 616 CR-pts were included. CNS International Prognostic Index was 4–6 in 83. 4% all-pts. Patients treated with HD-MTX had a lower risk of CNS progression not otherwise specified.

Analyses were performed with clock-start at initial aggressive B-cell lymphoma diagnosis for all patients and patients in complete response at completion of chemoimmunotherapy to reduce immortal time bias since intention-to-treat analyses could not be performed. Immortal time bias is relevant because among all-pts, the HD-MTX treated cohort is selected for patients who have survived and with favorable systemic lymphoma treatment response, such that CNS prophylaxis was considered. 10, 40or intravenous and/or intrathecal methotrexate administered concurrently or after completion of standard systemic lymphoma therapy. International guidelines recommend consideration of HD-MTX prophylaxis to mitigate CNS progression in high-risk patients, 29-31and it is widely used despite limited data supporting this practice. 23-28Many patients experience toxicity, 41which may affect deliverability of systemic lymphoma therapy and quality of life.

In conclusion, we observed a minor absolute reduction in CNS progression when HD-MTX was administered as CNS prophylaxis in the context of R-CHOP–like or DA-EPOCH-R–like systemic therapy, but with loss of the effect when considering CR-pts. In the absence of an adequately powered randomized study, these data provide additional evidence that HD-MTX may have limited impact on CNS progression in the majority of patients with high-risk aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and questions the role of HD-MTX as CNS prophylaxis.

### Real-world data (RWD) on the 3-year follow-up outcomes of different CNS prophylaxis strategies across CNS-IPI risk groups in patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^ef2a5c28]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

CNS relapse in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with poor prognosis with a median survival of about 2.5 months. Data demonstrating best prophylactic strategy remain controversial and need further definition.

Patients and Methods

We present data of 110 patients with DLBCL treated with standard systemic therapy divided into four groups based on primary CNS prophylaxis strategy and CNS International Prognostic Index (IPI) risk categories. We compared their 3-year CNS relapse rate and overall survival in each group.

Results

The CNS prophylaxis strategy consisted of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) in group 1, high-dose (HD) MTX in group 2, combination IT and HD MTX in group 3, and IT and/or HD MTX with intensive chemotherapy in group 4. At 3 years, CNS relapse rate was 8.6% (4/46), 8.3% (1/12), 4.8% (2/42), and 18% (2/11) in groups 1–4 (P = 0.64), respectively. According to CNS IPI, the CNS relapse rate was 16.6%, 10.1%, and 0% in high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups, respectively. The 3-year overall survival rate was 69%, 75%, 80%, and 45% in groups 1–4 (P = 0.71), respectively.

Conclusion

Our study while did not find statistical significance did indicate a lower incidence of CNS relapse with the addition of systemic HD MTX to IT MTX in the high-risk DLBCL population.

### Impact of central nervous system involvement in adult patients with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a GRAALL-2005 study [^e2f81558]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, despite improved outcome in adults with ALL included in pediatric-inspired protocols, CNS involvement is still associated with reduced survival, mainly due to excessive toxicity. The historical use of allogeneic SCT did not improve outcome. Because of the rarity of CNS involvement, it is unlikely that different treatment approaches will be tested in these patients in prospective controlled trials. However, it will be important to evaluate the outcome of these patients in the GRAALL-2014 protocol that no longer retains CNS involvement as an indication for allogeneic SCT. Whereas the treatment strategy has remained unchanged for CNS-positive patients, including cranial radiation, our approach to prophylaxis has been modified in CNS-negative patients, with higher doses of systemic methotrexate during consolidation for patients under the age of 45 and an additional seven triple intrathecal injections during therapy, while cranial radiation is only recommended for patients undergoing allogeneic SCT.

### Methotrexate infusions as central nervous system prophylaxis in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia: the Norwegian experience [^17feb99c]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

This study included all 690 children in Norway diagnosed as having acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) from July 1975 till the end of 1997. Relapses and deaths were monitored until the end of 2000. Neuroleukemia prophylaxis was intravenous methotrexate (MTX) infusions as intermediate-dose methotrexate (IDM) or high-dose methotrexate (HDM) combined with intrathecal MTX. From 1992, systemic therapy was considerably intensified, and, in addition, patients in a subgroup of the high-risk and very high-risk groups were given prophylactic cranial irradiation. The overall findings showed that MTX significantly reduced central nervous system (CNS)-related relapses, and, in general, reinforced systemic therapy reduced significantly non-CNS relapses and deaths. The overall crude survival was 75%. During the study period, the crude survival improved for patients on standard protocols from initially 65 to 90%. Forty patients (6%) developed isolated CNS relapse, 27 (4%) had combined CNS relapse, whereas 180 (26%) had non-CNS relapse. When IDM and HDM were compared, the cumulative risk for isolated CNS relapse was significantly lower with HDM, 12 and 5%, respectively. For any relapses that involved the CNS, the risk remained significantly lower for HDM, 8 versus 18%. Of the 40 patients with isolated CNS relapse, 23 survived (58%).

### A multicentre retrospective comparison of central nervous system prophylaxis strategies among patients with high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^48adc08b]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

It should be noted that flow cytometric analysis of CSF was not uniformly performed at baseline at all centres; this policy was adopted from 2007 at PMCC. Seven patients developed CNS relapse within 6 months of diagnosis. We acknowledge that occult CNS involvement at baseline in these patients may not have been detected; however, the distribution of cases with missing baseline CSF cytology did not differ between treatment groups. Recently, many groups have incorporated both more rigorous baseline CNS staging (with mandatory CSF flow cytometric analysis) and earlier CNS-directed therapies (both systemic and IT) into future treatment protocols.

The optimal timing of systemic high-dose chemotherapy as CNS prophylaxis is a critical unresolved question. Studies have consistently shown that CNS relapse is most frequent in the first 12 months from completion of primary therapy. This pattern of early CNS failures suggests occult CNS disease present at diagnosis and has led some groups, such as the German High Grade Lymphoma Study Group, to incorporate the first dose of systemic high-dose MTX before the commencement of chemoimmunotherapy, during steroid prephase (M Pfreundschuh, personal communication). Although providing early CNS prophylaxis, such scheduling risks delaying chemoimmunotherapy if toxicity occurs. Given the paucity of comparative data evaluating the efficacy of differing doses and timing of administration of systemic antimetabolite therapy for CNS prophylaxis, it is clear that these remain contentious issues.
