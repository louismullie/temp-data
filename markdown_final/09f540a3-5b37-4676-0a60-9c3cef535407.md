## Question

rapid intubation sequence pediatric

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pediatric RSI and its core objectives. Then, I should verify the evidence base and how it differs from adult practice. Next, I will examine preoxygenation strategies, induction and neuromuscular blocker choices, dosing, and special populations. After that, I need to review technique modifications, monitoring, and rescue strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight key controversies and knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition and indications. Pediatric RSI is the near-simultaneous administration of a sedative-hypnotic and a neuromuscular blocking agent with immediate endotracheal intubation before assisted ventilation, primarily to reduce aspiration risk and optimize intubating conditions; it is indicated in children with full stomach, altered mental status, severe respiratory failure, or when rapid airway control is needed, mirroring adult principles but adapted for pediatric physiology and anatomy [^1142Q8rG] [^111PcaPz].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base before drawing conclusions. Much of the highest-quality guidance derives from adult critical care guidelines, and pediatric-specific data are largely observational or retrospective; nonetheless, pediatric ED registries and single-center studies consistently show RSI is the most common method and is associated with high success and low serious adverse events, though video review reveals higher rates of desaturation and adverse effects than chart review alone, underscoring the need for rigorous process metrics and quality improvement [^111UU3en] [^111gfNHP] [^116vL37D].

> I will now examine preoxygenation, since desaturation is a major pediatric risk. Let me consider age-specific physiology: infants and young children have higher oxygen consumption and lower functional residual capacity, so safe apnea time is shorter; thus, effective preoxygenation is critical. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) during apneic periods may extend safe apnea time, though pediatric data are mixed, with one observational study showing no reduction in desaturation and others suggesting benefit; in severe hypoxemia, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is reasonable, and semi-Fowler positioning is suggested to improve lung volumes and intubation conditions, albeit based on low-quality evidence [^116sMYoT] [^1158GoK9] [^114iBePg] [^111zsHuB].

> Hold on, I should verify medication selection for induction. Ketamine is favored in hemodynamically unstable children due to its sympathomimetic properties, while etomidate remains widely used in stable children; propofol is common in the OR setting but carries hypotension risk in critical illness. Importantly, adult SCCM guidance suggests no mortality difference between etomidate and other induction agents, though pediatric-specific comparative mortality data are limited, so agent choice should be individualized to hemodynamics and comorbidities [^113Qusbx] [^113NNG8B] [^114Re42D].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular blockade. Succinylcholine provides rapid onset and short duration but carries risks including hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and malignant hyperthermia; rocuronium at 1.2 mg/kg achieves comparable onset to succinylcholine and offers the advantage of sugammadex reversal, though some labels state rocuronium is not recommended for pediatric RSI, reflecting regulatory conservatism rather than absence of clinical utility; cisatracurium is not recommended for RSI due to slower onset, and remifentanil can facilitate intubation when NMBAs are contraindicated, albeit with careful hemodynamic monitoring [^116vSwBF] [^11622SS7] [^115HdSt6] [^115SxrCs].

> Let me think about dosing and timing. Standard pediatric dosing includes ketamine 1–2 mg/kg IV, etomidate 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV, propofol 1–2 mg/kg IV, succinylcholine 1–2 mg/kg IV, and rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV; these ranges align with emergency drug references and adult RSI guidance adapted to pediatrics. I should double-check that dosing is weight-based and use length-based tapes or cards to reduce errors in emergencies [^111Ae7on] [^111qi1za] [^111UU3en].

> But wait, what if the child is in shock or has a difficult airway. In hemodynamically unstable children, ketamine is preferred to mitigate induction-related hypotension; in suspected difficult airways, consider awake techniques or modified RSI with gentle, pressure-limited mask ventilation to preserve oxygenation while minimizing aspiration risk; controlled RSI with limited inspiratory pressures has been associated with low rates of hypoxemia and aspiration in large pediatric cohorts, supporting a tailored approach rather than rigid avoidance of ventilation [^113Qusbx] [^113zsPke] [^111U1ZPn].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In infants and children ≤ 24 months, desaturation risk is highest, so limiting attempt duration and using video laryngoscopy can improve first-pass success; in neonates and infants, first-attempt success is lower and protocols emphasizing pre-sedation and standardized teams improve outcomes; in trauma, particularly TBI, prioritize perfusion and consider the hemodynamic consequences of RSI; in sepsis, anticipate vasodilation and consider preemptive fluids or vasopressors per institutional protocols [^116sMYoT] [^113dRMZ2] [^114APx8L] [^112mQTvh].

> Next, I should review technique modifications and monitoring. Semi-Fowler positioning is reasonable, cricoid pressure is variably used and not mandated, and apneic oxygenation with HFNO can be considered when available; video laryngoscopy improves glottic visualization and first-pass success in children; continuous capnography is essential to confirm tube position; and I should confirm that post-intubation sedation is administered promptly to avoid awareness, as delays are common when long-acting paralytics are used [^114iBePg] [^113dRMZ2] [^112RvkTZ].

> Hold on, I should verify rescue strategies for failed intubation. In cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate scenarios, pediatric front-of-neck access protocols with explicit time limits and readiness for ECMO are recommended; supraglottic airways are valuable rescue devices and can serve as conduits for fiberoptic intubation; and teams should rehearse these pathways to reduce time-to-airway and hypoxic injury [^114qrMF9] [^116aBsAA].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while acknowledging controversies. Preoxygenate adequately using face mask, HFNO, or NIPPV as tolerated; induce with ketamine or etomidate based on hemodynamics; paralyze with rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg or succinylcholine 1–2 mg/kg if no contraindications; position semi-Fowler if feasible; intubate with video laryngoscopy; confirm with capnography; provide immediate post-intubation sedation and analgesia; and if the airway is not secured within acceptable attempts, escalate to supraglottic rescue and front-of-neck access per protocol. I should emphasize that some labels discourage rocuronium for pediatric RSI, yet contemporary practice and guidelines widely use it, so shared decision-making and local policy alignment are key [^111UU3en] [^11622SS7] [^116vSwBF].

> Finally, I should double-check key knowledge gaps and quality considerations. There is a need for pediatric-specific RCTs comparing induction agents, NMBAs, and preoxygenation modalities; video review consistently reveals higher adverse event rates than chart review, so systems should adopt video-based quality assurance; and standardized protocols, team training, and equipment standardization improve first-pass success and safety, as shown in transport and ED pediatric programs [^116vL37D] [^113dRMZ2] [^114RCAkk].

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in pediatrics is a **standardized, time-critical** approach to secure the airway in children with full stomachs or critical illness, using a sedative and a fast-acting neuromuscular blocker to minimize aspiration and maximize first-pass success [^1142Q8rG] [^111gfNHP]. Key steps include **preoxygenation, rapid induction, paralysis, and prompt intubation** with cuffed ETTs; ketamine or etomidate are preferred induction agents, and rocuronium or succinylcholine are used for paralysis, with rocuronium favored when sugammadex is available [^113Qusbx] [^116vSwBF]. Preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen or NIPPV reduces desaturation, and apneic oxygenation can be added in high-risk cases [^114iBePg] [^114f2LWW]. RSI is highly effective in pediatric EDs, with first-pass success around 78–91% and low serious complication rates, but requires vigilance for hypoxemia, hypotension, and bradycardia, especially in infants and unstable patients [^111gfNHP] [^113EgKGM] [^116sMYoT].

---

## Indications and contraindications

### Indications

Indications include **full stomach or aspiration risk** (recent eating, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, pregnancy) [^1142Q8rG], **respiratory failure** (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, altered mental status), and **trauma** — especially with suspected cervical spine injury — where RSI facilitates inline stabilization and rapid airway control [^notfound].

---

### Contraindications

Contraindications include **absolute** — known difficult airway where mask ventilation or intubation is unlikely to succeed — and **relative** — severe hemodynamic instability, severe electrolyte disturbances (e.g. hyperkalemia with succinylcholine), and known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility [^113L4fnt].

---

## Pediatric-specific physiological considerations

Children have distinct anatomical and physiological differences that influence RSI:

- **Oxygen consumption**: Higher than adults, shortening safe apnea time and increasing desaturation risk [^116sMYoT].
- **Airway anatomy**: Larger occiput, relatively larger tongue, and a more anterior larynx complicate alignment and visualization [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular response**: Greater vagal tone increases bradycardia risk, especially with succinylcholine or hypoxemia [^1158wyME].

---

## Medications and dosing

| **Medication** | **Dose** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ketamine | 1–2 mg/kg IV | Induction agent | Hemodynamically stable; bronchodilator; avoid in severe TBI [^notfound] |
| Etomidate | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV | Induction agent | Hemodynamically stable; transient adrenal suppression [^113NNG8B] |
| Propofol | 1–2 mg/kg IV | Induction agent | Avoid in hemodynamic instability [^notfound] |
| Rocuronium | 1.2 mg/kg IV | Paralytic | Fast onset; reversible with sugammadex [^116vSwBF] |
| Succinylcholine | 1–2 mg/kg IV | Paralytic | Rapid onset/offset; avoid in hyperkalemia, MH, muscular dystrophy [^113L4fnt] |
| Atropine | 0.02 mg/kg IV (min 0.1 mg) | Premedication | Consider in children < 1 year or with bradycardia risk [^notfound] |

---

## Preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation

Preoxygenation is essential to **extend safe apnea time**. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) at 1–2 L/kg/min or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) improves oxygenation and reduces desaturation, especially in severe hypoxemia or difficult airways [^114iBePg] [^112mcFQ4]. Apneic oxygenation with HFNO during laryngoscopy can be added in high-risk cases, though pediatric evidence is mixed and not universally beneficial [^1158GoK9] [^114f2LWW].

---

## Technique and equipment

- **Positioning**: Sniffing position with shoulder roll; consider ramping in obese or older children.
- **Equipment**: Age-appropriate cuffed ETT (cuff pressure ≤ 20 cm H2O), video laryngoscope, bougie, stylet, suction, and bag-valve mask [^112nWKnk].
- **Sellick maneuver**: Controversial; not routinely recommended in pediatrics due to limited benefit and potential harm [^notfound].

---

## Complications and safety considerations

- **Hypoxemia**: Common, especially in infants and with prolonged laryngoscopy; limit attempts to ≤ 30 seconds [^116sMYoT].
- **Bradycardia**: Monitor heart rate continuously; treat with atropine and oxygen [^1158wyME].
- **Hypotension**: Anticipate and treat with fluids and vasopressors as needed [^112mQTvh].
- **Aspiration**: Rare but serious; minimize with proper technique and rapid airway securing [^113zsPke].

---

## Success rates and outcomes

Pediatric RSI in the ED achieves **high success**, with first-pass success rates of 78–91% and overall success exceeding 95% [^111gfNHP] [^116hv5Qf]. Serious complications are uncommon, but adverse events such as desaturation, bradycardia, and hypotension occur in 20–60% and are more frequent in infants and unstable patients [^113EgKGM] [^116sMYoT].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and neonates**: Higher desaturation risk; prioritize preoxygenation, limit attempts, and consider awake techniques if feasible [^116sMYoT].
- **Trauma**: Inline stabilization, consider ketamine for induction, and anticipate hemodynamic changes [^notfound].
- **Difficult airway**: Have a clear plan, including supraglottic devices, video laryngoscopy, and front-of-neck access [^114hZrNG].

---

RSI is a **cornerstone of pediatric emergency airway management**, balancing speed and safety. Success depends on meticulous preparation, appropriate medication selection, and vigilant monitoring for complications.

Society of Critical Care Medicine rapid sequence intubation (RSI) guideline — an interdisciplinary effort addressing "Controversies and practice variations" in airway management — aimed "to develop evidence-based recommendations on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic topics related to RSI". A guideline panel of 20 Society of Critical Care Medicine members met virtually at least monthly from 2018 through 2020 and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework with recommendations of "strong" or "conditional" based on evidence and consensus; panelists created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) questions and reviewed evidence using predetermined search terms, with recommendations provided when evidence was actionable, suggestions when evidence was equivocal, and best practice statements when benefits outweighed risks but direct evidence did not exist. From the original 35 proposed PICO questions, 10 were selected, and the panel issued one recommendation (strong, low-quality evidence), seven suggestions (all conditional recommendations with moderate-, low-, or very low-quality evidence), and two best practice statements; the panel made two suggestions for a single PICO question and did not make any suggestions for one PICO question due to lack of evidence. Using GRADE principles, the panel found substantial agreement regarding evidence supporting RSI recommendations and identified literature gaps for future research.

### Controlled rapid sequence induction and intubation-an analysis of 1001 children [^113zsPke]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Classic rapid sequence induction puts pediatric patients at risk of cardiorespiratory deterioration and traumatic intubation due to their reduced apnea tolerance and related shortened intubation time. A 'controlled' rapid sequence induction and intubation technique (cRSII) with gentle facemask ventilation prior to intubation may be a safer and more appropriate approach in pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the benefits and complications of cRSII in a large cohort.

Methods

Retrospective cohort analysis of all patients undergoing cRSII according to a standardized institutional protocol between 2007 and 2011 in a tertiary pediatric hospital. By means of an electronic patient data management system, vital sign data were reviewed for cardiorespiratory parameters, intubation conditions, general adverse respiratory events, and general anesthesia parameters.

Results

A total of 1001 patients with cRSII were analyzed. Moderate hypoxemia (SpO2 80–89%) during cRSII occurred in 0.5% (n = 5) and severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 80%) in 0.3% of patients (n = 3). None of these patients developed bradycardia or hypotension. Overall, one single gastric regurgitation was observed (0.1%), but no pulmonary aspiration could be detected. Intubation was documented as 'difficult' in two patients with expected (0.2%) and in three patients with unexpected difficult intubation (0.3%). The further course of anesthesia as well as respiratory conditions after extubation did not reveal evidence of 'silent aspiration' during cRSII.

Conclusion

Controlled RSII with gentle facemask ventilation prior to intubation supports stable cardiorespiratory conditions for securing the airway in children with an expected or suspected full stomach. Pulmonary aspiration does not seem to be significantly increased.

### The optimal dose of succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114g6F3z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a quantitative systematic review following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and according to Cochrane methodology. A PRISMA checklist is available as a supplement (Table S1).

Systematic search and study selection

Two authors (MG, AP) searched three electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE) from inception to 15 February 2019 using a variety of high-sensitivity and low-specificity search strategies. Details of the search strategy for PubMed are available as a supplement (Methods S1). There was no language restriction. Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked for further potentially relevant publications (backward snowballing). Retrieved articles were screened by three authors (CC, AP, MG). Discrepancies and queries for inclusion were resolved through consensus. If agreement could not be reached, discrepancies were discussed with the fourth author (MRT).

Inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

We included full reports of RCTs performed in adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing surgery that compared any experimental regimen of succinylcholine with the standard regimen, 1.0 mg kg − 1, for RSI. We included studies that tested a 'true' or a 'modified' RSI procedure. A true procedure involves intravenous induction with a hypnotic, intravenous administration of succinylcholine immediately (i.e. without any delay) after loss of consciousness, an apnoea period of no more than 60 s followed by orotracheal intubation. A modified RSI procedure is different in that the delay between loss of consciousness and the administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent is longer and allows, for instance, the additional recording of electromyographic baseline measures. During this time period, the patient is usually ventilated and oxygenated through a facemask. However, as with true RSI, after administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent, the apnoea period before orotracheal intubation is lasting no longer than 60 s.

Eligible trials had to report on intubating conditions using a validated score that evaluated ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord position and movement, airway reaction, and movement of limbs. We did not consider studies including obese patients for two reasons. Firstly, obesity is an independent risk factor of difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Secondly, the best succinylcholine regimen in obese patients remains controversial. Data from non-randomized trials, paediatric studies, abstracts, and trials that lacked a succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg − 1 group were also not taken into account.

### Rapid sequence induction has no use in pediatric anesthesia [^114VSms5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

(Classic) rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) has been considered fundamental to the provision of safe anesthesia. This technique consists of a combination of drugs and techniques and is intended to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric content with catastrophic outcomes to the patient. This review investigates aspects of this technique and highlights dangers and frauds if this technique is transferred directly into pediatric anesthesia practice. The author recommends a controlled anesthesia induction by trained pediatric anesthesiologist with suitable equipment for the children considered at risk of pulmonary aspiration. RSSI is a dangerous technique if adopted without modification into pediatric anesthesia and has in its 'classic' form no use.

### Predicting adverse outcomes in a diagnosis-based protocol system for rapid sequence intubation [^117LMAms]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Our ED at Louisiana State University developed a unique approach to airway management by having four diagnosis-based protocols for rapid sequence intubation (RSI). This study examines protocol use and outcome from RSI in an academic ED. The study objective was to identify variables that are predictive of adverse outcomes in patients requiring RSI. This was a 4-year prospective, observational, data-gathering study of all intubations in an academic ED setting with > 250,000 patient visits per year. Four protocols were established for 1) children < 10 years of age, 2) adults with increased intracranial pressure, 3) adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and 4) other adults not fitting B or C. A special continuing quality improvement (CQI) committee was established to examine each case of RSI. Prospective data were collected, including age, race, gender, protocol, diagnostic group, intubation indication, and preintubation oxygen saturation. Diagnostic group was categorized as medical, blunt trauma, or penetrating trauma. Adverse outcome was defined as any case with hemodynamic changes, those requiring surgical or bronchoscopic intervention, and those requiring more than three attempts at intubation. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis, logistic regression, and a binomial regression tree analysis with SPSS 9.0 (Chicago, IL) and Answer Tree (SPSS). A total of 1,320 consecutive intubated patients were included. Protocol A was used in 4%, B in 43%, C in 15%, and D in 38%. Significant differences in number of cases with adverse outcome were based on protocol (P = 0.03) and final diagnosis (P < .03). Protocol C was less likely to be associated with adverse outcome than protocol D (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1–0.7). Penetrating trauma was more likely to be associated with adverse outcome (OR = 1.8, 95%, CI = 1.1–3.2) than blunt trauma. A regression tree analysis yielded the following, all cases using protocol A or C or medical cases using B had an adverse event in 11 of 458 (2.4%), whereas nonmedical cases using protocols B or D and medical cases using D had adverse outcomes in 73 of 862 cases (8.5%). The decision rules lead to a better classification of cases with adverse outcomes (2.4 vs 8.5%, of = 6.1%, 95% CI = 3.7–8.4). Adult trauma patients who fit the protocols B or D or adult medical patients who fit protocol B were at higher risk for adverse outcomes with RSI. This could alert the physician to a population at higher risk for adverse outcomes. Variables available in a diagnosis-based protocol RSI system can be used to predict adverse outcome among patients requiring RSI.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^116owGrm]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a set of actions during induction of anaesthesia in unfasted patients or patients at risk of aspiration/regurgitation of gastric contents. The purpose of RSI is to secure the airway quickly and safely while actively reducing the risk of aspiration. RSI was first described in 1970. Although its safety and efficiency were not (and still are not) based on high-quality evidence-based data, RSI has gradually been implemented into anaesthesiology clinical practice'. lassical RSI' consists of several steps, such as: monitoring of vital signs, intravenous line insertion, position of the patient before anaesthesia induction, functional and switched on suction with a wide bore suction catheter in place, preoxygenation, intravenous anaesthetic induction, an intravenous muscle relaxant drug with a rapid onset, the Sellick manoeuvre, intubation with the cuffed tracheal tube. Although there is an empiric recommendation for the use of RSI in high-risk patients, there are currently no clear recommendations as to whether RSI can be considered effective and well tolerated. 'Classical RSI' is associated with risks of hypoxaemia and cardiovascular complications, raising concerns about the efficiency and safety of the current method of RSI.

Another problem is the heterogeneity of RSI techniques in the published data. – Such a variation in clinical practice can be dangerous for both patients (safety aspects) and physicians (legal consequences). The lack of internationally accepted RSI guidelines stimulated us to create an electronic survey with the aim of evaluating the actual RSI clinical practice internationally. The survey was designed to capture the clinical practice of RSI in both adult and paediatric patients.

### Drugs used to treat pediatric emergencies [^111Ae7on]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric emergency drug dosing principles and guideline resources — individualization and recommended references — are as follows: Dosing should be individualized, taking into account the patient's weight in kilograms, medical illness, age, concurrently administered drugs, and drug hypersensitivity history, and dosages are generally provided as milligrams per kilogram. The committees recommend the use of current Advanced Pediatric Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support textbooks, updated American Heart Association guidelines, and additional references for more detailed information on pediatric resuscitation algorithms, rapid-sequence intubation (RSI), procedural sedation, and medical management in disasters. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program is focused on care of the newborn infant, and there is no clear evidence to guide when it is appropriate to use Advanced Pediatric Life Support guidelines in the care of an infant. General recommendations are currently to decide which drug to use on the basis of the likely etiology of the problem, and the use of preprinted weight-based medication cards and/or length-based resuscitation tapes is recommended when treating an emergency regardless of location.

### Rapid sequence intubation of critically ill patients… [^111sMrAP]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Positioning patients in a semi-Fowler position with the head and trunk raised may increase intubation success and decrease aspiration risk.
- Preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen is effective and can be used throughout intubation. With severe hypoxemia, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is recommended for preoxygenation.
- Before rapid sequence intubation, paralysis with a neuromuscular blocking agent is recommended to increase intubation success and reduce vomiting risk. From the AFP Editors. Emergency airway management is high-risk and involves multiple decisions. Rapid sequence intubation, which usually occurs after administration of a sedative-hypnotic agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent in rapid succession, should optimize the chance of successful intubation while reducing peri-intubation risks such as aspiration or hypotension.

The Society of Critical Care Medicine developed guidelines to optimize rapid sequence intubation. POSITIONING Simulation studies suggest that sitting a patient up from the traditional supine position to a semi-Fowler position before intubation decreases aspiration risk, increases lung volumes, and improves intubation success through better views. The guideline suggests semi-Fowler positioning based on very low-quality evidence from conflicting studies. Although simulation and observational studies clearly demonstrate improved first-pass intubation success with semi-Fowler positioning compared with the supine position, the few randomized trials demonstrated no difference between the two positions.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^114E4qQ9]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for rapid sequence induction and intubation, more specifically with respect to induction agents, SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no difference between etomidate and other induction agents administered for rapid sequence intubation with respect to mortality or the incidence of hypotension or vasopressor use during the peri-intubation period and through hospital discharge.

### Newer agents for rapid sequence intubation: etomidate and rocuronium [^112BkxjZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

The emergency airway management of children and adolescents with critical illnesses may necessitate rapid sequence intubation with a sedating and a neuromuscular blocking agent. Etomidate and rocuronium have become increasingly popular for the sedation and paralysis, respectively, of pediatric patients in rapid sequence intubation, and there are many advantages to the use of both agents. Both etomidate and rocuronium have a rapid onset of action, and both agents are relatively free of hemodynamic adverse effects. Etomidate does, however, suppress adrenal function, and consequently, its use in patients with septic shock is controversial. Rocuronium can produce optimal intubating conditions without the serious complications that can accompany succinylcholine. The available evidence supports the safety of etomidate and rocuronium in rapid sequence intubation but also suggests that more prospective studies are needed in pediatric patients.

### Fentanyl versus placebo with ketamine and rocuronium for patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department: the FAKT study – A randomized clinical trial [^112WSVBg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design

We conducted a multicenter, randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial comparing fentanyl versus placebo, in addition to ketamine and rocuronium, according to a weight‐based dosing schedule for RSI in adult ED patients. The protocol was approved by the South West Sydney Local Health District Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC/17/LPOOL/450) with a waiver of informed consent. The protocol and analysis plan were published prior to completion of recruitment. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616001570471).

Study setting and participants

Study sites were the EDs of five hospitals in New South Wales, Australia: Liverpool Hospital (adult and pediatric academic center, annual ED census of 100,000 patients); Campbelltown Hospital (adult and pediatric community hospital, annual ED census 85,000 patients); Northern Beaches Hospital (adult and pediatric community hospital, annual census 70,000 patients); Orange Health Service (adult and pediatric rural community hospital, annual census 31,000); and Royal North Shore Hospital (adult and pediatric academic center, annual ED census 95,000 patients). Adult patients (≥ 18 years) who required RSI were screened for eligibility. Exclusion occurred due to allergy to study medication, the need for a "paralysis‐only" or no‐drug intubation, an alternative induction regime being necessary, the ED being overwhelmed (both in the opinion of the treating emergency physician) or because no specialist trained in the protocol was available.

### Rocuronium [^115iL3kc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rocuronium bromide is not recommended for rapid sequence intubation in pediatric patients. Recommendations for use in pediatric patients are discussed in other sections [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Rocuronium bromide was administered to 140 geriatric patients (65 years or greater) in U.S. clinical trials and 128 geriatric patients in European clinical trials. The observed pharmacokinetic profile for geriatric patients (n = 20) was similar to that for other adult surgical patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Onset time and duration of action were slightly longer for geriatric patients (n = 43) in clinical trials. Clinical experiences and recommendations for use in geriatric patients are discussed in other sections [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Since rocuronium bromide is primarily excreted by the liver, it should be used with caution in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment. Rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg has been studied in a limited number of patients (n = 9) with clinically significant hepatic impairment under steady-state isoflurane anesthesia. After rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg, the median (range) clinical duration of 60 (35 to 166) minutes was moderately prolonged compared to 42 minutes in patients with normal hepatic function. The median recovery time of 53 minutes was also prolonged in patients with cirrhosis compared to 20 minutes in patients with normal hepatic function. Four of 8 patients with cirrhosis, who received rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia, did not achieve complete block. These findings are consistent with the increase in volume of distribution at steady state observed in patients with significant hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If used for rapid sequence induction in patients with ascites, an increased initial dosage may be necessary to assure complete block. Duration will be prolonged in these cases. The use of doses higher than 0.6 mg/kg has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Rapid sequence intubation for pediatric emergency airway management [^111gfNHP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize current practice with respect to pediatric emergency airway management using a multicenter data set.

Methods

A multicenter collaboration was undertaken to gather data prospectively regarding emergency intubation. Analysis of data on adult emergency department (ED) intubations clearly demonstrated that rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was the method used most often. We then conducted an observational study of the prospectively collected database of pediatric ED intubations (EDIs) using the National Emergency Airway Registry Phase One data, gathered in 11 participating EDs over a 16-month time period. A data form completed at the time of EDI enabled analysis of patients' ages, weights, and indications for EDI; personnel; methods employed to facilitate EDI; success rates; and adverse events. Data forms were analyzed regarding the methods of intubation employed, and frequencies, success rates, and adverse event rates among various intubation modalities were compared.

Results

Of 1288 EDIs, there were 156 documented pediatric patients. Initial intubation attempts were all oral, including rapid sequence intubation in 81%, without medications (NOM) in 13%, and sedation without neuromuscular blockade (SED) in 6%. Older children and trauma patients were more likely to be intubated with RSI compared to younger children and patients presenting with medical illnesses. Intubation using RSI was more successful on the first attempt (78%) compared with either NOM (47%, < 0.01) or SED (44%, < 0.05), though this finding is likely explainable by the age differences among groups. Intubation was successfully performed by the initial intubator in 85% of RSI, 75% of NOM, and 89% of SED attempts (= NS for both comparisons vs RSI). Overall, successful intubation occurred in 99% of RSI and 97% of non-RSI intubation attempts (= NS). Only one of 156 patients required surgical airway management. True complications occurred in 1%, 5%, and 0% of RSI, NOM, and SED attempts, respectively (= NS for both comparisons vs RSI). The majority of initial intubation attempts were by emergency medicine residents (59%), pediatric emergency medicine fellows (17%), and pediatrics residents (10%). These groups were 77%, 77%, and 50% successful, respectively, on the first laryngoscopy attempt, and 89%, 89%, and 69% successful overall.

Conclusions

A large, prospective, multicenter observational study of pediatric EDIs was conducted at university-affiliated EDs. RSI is the method of choice for the majority of pediatric emergency intubations; it is associated with a high success rate and a low rate of serious adverse events. Pediatric intubation as practiced in academic EDs, with most initial attempts by emergency and pediatrics residents and fellows under attending physician supervision, is safe and highly successful.

### Effect of the combination of remifentanil and neuromuscular blockers in pediatric endotracheal intubation: a prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial [^116c28oa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Compared with conventional general anesthesia induction drugs, the combined use of low-dose remifentanil in children is effective at improving the success rate of first tracheal intubation without adverse events (87.5% vs. 60.0%, p < 0.001).

The type and dosage of sedatives and muscle relaxants are the key factors to be considered for successful tracheal intubation. As liver and kidney metabolism in children is inferior to that in adults, cisatracurium is used relatively more frequently because of its short onset of action and Hofmann elimination and its low dependence on liver and kidney function. Propofol is also the most commonly used drug for intravenous anesthesia induction in children because of its rapid onset, rapid elimination and low likelihood of accumulation. However, as previously noted, anesthetics employed in rapid sequence intubation (RSI) vary significantly in their onset times to achieve adequate neuromuscular blockade depth for safe airway management. The accelerated induction protocol carries inherent risks of physiological responses, including patient movement and activation of airway reflexes such as coughing or laryngospasm. While these adverse events can be mitigated through transitional assisted ventilation, this requirement introduces a trade-off that undermines the primary advantage of RSI — the immediate establishment of definitive airway control. The consequent delay in securing the airway creates a paradoxical clinical scenario where the intervention intended to expedite protection instead prolongs the at-risk period for pulmonary aspiration. Therefore, this study aimed to explore combinations of other drugs to avoid the occurrence of related adverse events. Previous studies have shown that the use of remifentanil during the induction of anesthesia facilitates the rapid achievement of optimal intubation conditions The most commonly recommended dose for acceptable intubating conditions without a neuromuscular blocker is remifentanil (3–4 µg/kg) However, increases in the dosage of remifentanil increase the risks of hypotension and bradycardia. The dose of remifentanil can be reduced when neuromuscular blocking agents are used. Under these conditions, the recommended dose of remifentanil is mostly 0.5–2 µg/kg. Considering its safety and efficacy, we chose a dose of 1 µg/kg. As expected, we found that remifentanil (1 µg/kg) combined with other anesthetic drugs can reduce the occurrence of related adverse events during intubation (group R: group C = 87.5%:60.0%, p < 0.001), which ensures better conditions for intubation.

### Circulation first-the time has come to question the sequencing of care in the ABCs of trauma; an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter trial [^114APx8L]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting the systematic Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABC) approach to injured patients is based on expert consensus with little literature to support the clinical application of the order in which this sequence should be applied. Early intubation can result in deleterious effects in adult and pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. There are many physiological explanations why intubation in hypovolemic shock might result in worse perfusion. After rapid sequence intubation (RSI), there is a vasodilatory response placing the hypovolemic patient at very high risk for more pronounced hypotension and decreased perfusion. Shafi et al. previously published an analysis of the national trauma data bank showing how pre-hospital intubations resulted in further hypotension in hypovolemic patients. In addition to the vasodilation following RSI, positive pressure ventilation decreases venous return and therefore cardiac output resulting in further decreased perfusion. This event is critical in hypovolemic patients that are dependent on venous return and adrenergic response to maintain perfusion.

In the medical literature, while treating patients with cardiorespiratory arrest, the focus of the protocols have moved from acquiring an airway first, to prioritizing perfusion by initiating chest compressions expeditiously. This has resulted in better outcomes. This practice has not been previously investigated in the trauma population.

The objective of this study is to investigate if there are differences in outcome when following the traditional sequence of ABC versus starting transfusion and resuscitation first (CAB). We hypothesized that patients in hypovolemic shock would have at least comparable outcomes with initiation of bleeding treatment (transfusion) prior to intubation, compared to those patients treated with the traditional ABC sequence.

### Apneic oxygenation to prevent oxyhemoglobin desaturation during rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric emergency department [^1158GoK9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Apneic oxygenation is the delivery of oxygen to the nasopharynx during intubation. It may mitigate the risk of oxyhemoglobin desaturation but has not been well-studied in children.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, observational study of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in a pediatric emergency department. We compared patients who received apneic oxygenation, delivered via simple nasal cannula at age-specific flow rates, to patients who did not receive apneic oxygenation. The main outcome was occurrence of oxyhemoglobin desaturation during RSI, defined as oxyhemoglobin saturation dropping to < 90% at any time after the administration of paralytic medication and before the endotracheal tube was secured. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, with groups as a fixed effect and patients' age and number of attempts as covariates.

Results

Data were collected for 305 of 323 patients who underwent RSI over a 49 month period. Oxyhemoglobin desaturation occurred for 50 patients when apneic oxygenation was used (22%, 95% CI 17% to 28%) and 11 patients without apneic oxygenation (14%, 95% CI 7% to 24%; p > 0.05). There was no difference in the median duration of desaturation or depth of desaturation for the apneic oxygenation group (52 s, 71%) compared to the group without apneic oxygenation (65 s, 79%; p > 0.05). Controlling for covariates, apneic oxygenation was not associated with a lower risk of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, time to desaturation, or depth/duration of desaturation episodes.

Conclusions

In an observational, video-based study of pediatric patients, apneic oxygenation was not associated with a lower risk of oxyhemoglobin desaturation during RSI.

### Don't hold your breath – A video-based study of procedural intervals during pediatric rapid sequence intubation [^1142w8Wz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Develop a framework for data collection to determine the contributions of both laryngoscopy and tube delivery intervals to the apneic period in unsuccessful and successful attempts among patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in a pediatric emergency department (PED).

Design

This was a retrospective, observational study of RSI.

Setting

An academic PED.

Patients

A consecutive sample of all intubations attempts of first provider physicians performing RSI in the shock trauma suite over a 10-month period in 2018–2019.

Measurement and Main Results

Data were collected by structured video review. The main outcome was the duration of the laryngoscopy and tube delivery intervals per attempt. We compared interval duration between successful and unsuccessful attempts, adjusting for age, accounting for repeated measures, and clustering by provider. There were 69 patients with 89 total intubation attempts. Sixty-three patients were successfully intubated by the first provider (91%). Pediatric emergency medicine fellows performed 54% of the attempts. The median duration of the apneic period per attempt was longer in unsuccessful attempts (57 vs 44 seconds; median of difference, -10.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] -17.0 to -4.0). The duration of laryngoscopy was similar (18 vs 13 seconds; median of difference, -3.5; 95% CI, -8.0 to 1.0), but tube delivery was longer in unsuccessful attempts (25.5 vs. 11 seconds; median of difference, -12.5; 95% CI, -17.0 to -4.0). These results did not change when adjusting for age or clustering by provider.

Conclusions

We successfully developed a specific, time-based framework for the contributors to prolonged apnea in RSI. Prolonged tube delivery accounted for more of the apneic period. Future studies and improvement should focus on problems during tube delivery in the PED.

### Drugs for pediatric emergencies: report updates list, indications, dosages… [^111qi1za]. publications.aap.org (2019). Medium credibility.

An infant presents to a rural hospital emergency department in respiratory failure. The physician must perform rapid sequence intubation but has difficulty determining which medications and doses to use. An updated AAP clinical report aims to educate health care professionals on medications used to treat pediatric emergencies in the ED as well as in prehospital, clinic and disaster settings. The report. Medical emergencies also may occur as often as once or more a week in pediatricians' offices. Given that pediatric emergencies span the prehospital, ambulatory, emergency and critical care settings, health providers across this spectrum have an important role in stabilizing and treating critically ill and injured children. Tables list drugs by indication. Pharmacotherapy is a key component of emergency management. In a medical emergency, providers need to access clinically relevant drug information rapidly.

The report consists of 16 tables that list the drugs used to treat pediatric emergencies based on organ system or clinical context. Drugs may appear more than once if they have multiple indications. Though the list is not inclusive, it is a useful resource to treat the vast majority of pediatric emergencies. The drug information includes its formulation, dosage based on mode of delivery, side effect profile and safety considerations. The indications, dosage recommendations and supporting information are consistent with emergency references such as The Advanced Pediatric Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support textbooks and American Heart Association resuscitation guidelines. Information also has been added from consensus guidelines, technical reports, clinical reports and standard pediatric reference textbooks. The format for dosages is consistent with AAP recommendations for reducing medication errors.

Dosing of drugs based on newer modes of drug delivery such as intranasal and intra-buccal routes also has been added. The provider is urged to base all drug dosing on the patient's weight in kilograms. The use of weight-based medication cards or length-based resuscitation tapes also is recommended. The choice and selection of drug will depend on patient characteristics, coexisting problems, drug hypersensitivity history, concurrently administered medications and drug availability. In the case described above, the emergency physician used a length-based resuscitation tape to calculate the metric doses of medications needed for the rapid sequence intubation using an up-to-date resource on pediatric emergencies. The tracheal intubation was successful, and the child made a rapid recovery.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^112nWKnk]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The standard care for patients at risk of aspiration is to secure the airway for general anaesthesia with a cuffed tracheal tube. Historically, in children under 8 years of age, an uncuffed tube has been used because of the fear of post-extubation stridor. However, the modern paediatric cuffed tracheal tubes (e.g. MicroCuff) are considered well tolerated and they can significantly reduce the need for tube exchange. In addition, the ideal seal reduces the risk of regurgitation/aspiration. By improving the airway seal, cuffed tubes facilitate measurement of end-tidal CO 2 and enable positive pressure ventilation with higher inspiratory pressures. The new cuffed tracheal tubes can be used safely in all paediatric patients, including in the intensive care setting. The only safety prerequisite is the need to measure and limit the intracuff pressure to 20 cmH 2 O or less; this will minimise the risk of mucosal damage and postextubation airway-related complications. The majority of respondents (40.8%) in our survey used cuffed tracheal tubes for paediatric RSI, although 30.6% did not use cuffed tubes in neonates. This latter practice could be explained by a lack of supportive data and the low internal diameter of the cuffed tubes for neonates.

Several surveys in recent decades have evaluated the practice of RSI, revealing a wide variation in clinical practice. However, only a minority of these surveys compared adult and paediatric RSI practice, and none of them was followed by the formation of any guidelines. The results of our survey confirmed the continuation of a wide variation in clinical practice when performing RSI, revealing several potentially dangerous aspects.

A possible limitation of the survey is the low response rate, with only 21% of the ESA members responding to the survey, thus the practice of the remaining 79% is unknown. Another possible limitation is the composition of respondents, with 26.9% of respondents from five European countries). On the other hand, we consider the data obtained from 56 countries around the world as a strong point of the survey.

In conclusion, the results of the survey confirmed wide variations of RSI in clinical practice. After 50 years of RSI with no evidence-based proven benefit (or harm, there is an urgent need for international RSI guideline formation to improve the safety of our patients).

### A standardized rapid sequence intubation protocol facilitates airway management in critically injured patients [^114WJmbk]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED) of a teaching hospital, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is performed by physicians with a wide range of experience. A variety of medications have been used for RSI, with potential for inadequate or excessive dosing as well as complications including hypotension and the need for redosing. We hypothesized that the use of a standardized RSI medication protocol has facilitated endotracheal intubation requiring less medication redosing and less medication-related hypotension.

Methods

An RSI medication protocol (ketamine 2 mg/kg intravenously administered and rocuronium 1 mg/kg intravenously administered, or succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg intravenously administered) was implemented for all trauma patients undergoing ED intubation at a Level I trauma center. We retrospectively reviewed patients for the 1-year period before (PRE) and after (KET) the protocol was instituted. Data collected included age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of the head/face, AIS score of the chest, RSI drugs, need for redosing, time to intubation, indication for RSI, and number of RSI attempts.

Results

During the study period, 439 patients met inclusion criteria; 266 without protocol (PRE) and 173 with protocol (KET). Patients were severely injured with a mean ISS of 24 and median AIS score of the head/face of 3. Dosing in the KET group was appropriate with a mean dose of 1.9-mg/kg ketamine administered. Compliance after KET introduction approached 90%. Fifteen patients in the PRE group required redosing of medication versus three in the KET group (p < 0.05, χ). For patients younger than 14 years, (26 in PRE and 10 in KET), 2 patients in the PRE group required redosing and none in the KET group (not significant). In all patients, mean time from drug administration to intubation decreased from 4 minutes to 3 minutes.

Conclusion

A standardized medication protocol simplifies RSI and allows efficient airway management of critically injured trauma patients in the ED of a teaching hospital. Incorporation of ketamine avoids potential complications of other commonly used RSI medications.

### Management of the difficult airway [^114hZrNG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Airway management is a fundamental component of care during resuscitation of critically ill and injured children. In addition to predicted anatomic and physiologic differences in children compared with adults, certain conditions can predict potential difficulty during pediatric airway management. This review presents approaches to identifying pediatric patients in whom airway management is more likely to be difficult, and discusses strategies to address such challenges. These strategies include optimization of effective bag-mask ventilation, alternative approaches to laryngoscopy, use of adjunct airway devices, modifications to rapid sequence intubation, and performance of surgical airways in children. The importance of considering systems of care in preparing for potentially difficult pediatric airways is also discussed.

Induction agent selection — critically ill adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI): We suggest there is no difference between etomidate and other induction agents administered for RSI with respect to mortality or the incidence of hypotension or vasopressor use in the peri-intubation period and through hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Supporting evidence includes a Cochrane review that analyzed six studies (n = 772 patients) and did not show increased mortality with etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) when used as a single dose for RSI compared with other agents, OR 1.17 (95% CI, 0.86–1.60). Observational trauma data found no mortality difference between regimens, with 19% mortality in each group (OR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51–1.87), and an institutional before-and-after change from etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) to ketamine (1–2 mg/kg) showed no difference in hospital mortality (20% vs 17%; OR 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.16). A meta-analysis of 29 studies reported an increased overall mortality rate with etomidate (rr = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29), although only 5 were RCTs, and overall, these data are limited by selection bias, which may affect both mortality and the severity of illness correlation.

### Incidence of bradycardia and the use of atropine in pediatric rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department [^1158wyME]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bradycardia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is an uncommon but serious adverse effect encountered in pediatric intubations. Atropine has historically been used in the pediatric population as RSI premedication to prevent bradycardia, especially when using succinylcholine as an induction agent. The objective of this analysis was to identify the incidence of bradycardia with or without atropine use.

Methods

This single-center, retrospective, observational case series reviewed pediatric patients up to 18 years old requiring intubation from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Bradycardia was determined by analyzing heart rates associated with time during and up to 5 minutes after intubation.

Results

A total of 62 patients were included. Three (4.8%) patients experienced a bradycardic event during intubation. A total of 15 (24.2%) patients received atropine for pretreatment of RSI. Incidence of bradycardia was similar between those who received atropine and those who did not. An increasing trend in atropine use was shown throughout the assessment period, yet only 18 (29%) patients met criteria for atropine pretreatment based on the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support guideline recommendations for RSI.

Conclusion

Bradycardia incidence was low in pediatric patients undergoing RSI in our emergency department. Use of atropine or succinylcholine did not affect the incidence of bradycardia during pediatric intubation over this study period. Our results show a low incidence of bradycardia and support the 2015 Pediatric Advanced Life Support Guideline recommendation of limiting the use of atropine premedication in pediatric intubations.

The trial conducted by Davis showed that suboptimal performance of rapid sequence intubation and subsequent ventilation efforts by less skilled personnel increased mortality in adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Pre‐hospital airway management in children delivered by inexperienced personnel showed an unacceptable intubation failure rate of more than 50%. One reason for the disappointing results of airway procedures might be changes in education and training. In contrast, pre‐hospital interventions by anaesthetists have demonstrated lower mortality and better neurological outcomes. The aforementioned findings have given rise to the discussion as to whether paramedics should continue to perform tracheal intubations.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — evidence gaps on NMBA choice and dosing: Future studies are needed to compare these two agents in the subset of patients with TBI, and although one single-center observational study showed that mortality may be increased in patients with severe TBI who receive succinylcholine, this finding needs to be further evaluated in larger multicenter observational studies or RCTs; the RCT with the most consequential results was out-of-hospital, so the findings may not be extrapolated to RSI in the critically ill population in the ED or ICU, and therefore future trials should compare these agents in an ED or ICU setting; the effects of the NMBA on outcomes, such as FPS, may be dependent on the dose used for RSI, similar FPS should be considered in the context of the doses used, pharmacokinetic alterations with poor perfusion or obesity may affect neuromuscular blockade, and the optimal dose in these circumstances requires additional investigation.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) awareness and rocuronium — "RCTs have not shown differences in the incidence of awareness", the evidence highlights that "rocuronium may delay the provision of postintubation analgosedation", and "institutions should consider the implementation of protocolized care for RSI and incorporate personnel, such as clinical pharmacists, to help improve the timeliness of analgosedation"; additionally, "if postintubation analgosedation provision is optimized with rocuronium, then we would not anticipate differences inpatient awareness after RSI".

### A stepwise approach to improved intubation success rates during neonatal and pediatric interfacility transport… [^113dRMZ2]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A rapid sequence medication protocol for non-emergent neonatal intubations was introduced in May, 2018. We hypothesized that the use of these interventions would improve first attempt intubation success rates. Objective: Improve ACH transport team first attempt intubation success. Design/Methods: The transport team intubation database was reviewed from January 2008 through May 18, 2021. Success rates were defined as the number of successful first attempt intubations divided by the total number of patients requiring intubation in each cohort. Patients were divided into 3 categories: Neonates weighing < 1kg, neonates weighing > 1kg, and non-neonatal patients, neonates being defined as patients. Results: Overall first attempt intubation success rates were statistically higher for pediatric patients and neonatal patients > 1kg when compared to neonatal patients < 1kg: PP vs NP < 1, 22. 79%diff, p < 0.

01; NP > 1kg vs. NP < 1kg, 15. 04%diff, p < 0. 01; PP vs. NP > 1, 7. 75%diff. Introduction of video laryngoscopy led to increased first attempt success in pediatric patients and neonatal patients > 1kg: PP; 58. 33% vs. Introduction of a rapid sequence medication protocol for neonatal patients > 1kg also led to improved first attempt intubation success: NP > 1; 51. 92% vs.

01. Video laryngoscopy and the rapid sequence medication protocol were not used in neonatal patients < 1kg. Conclusion/Discussion: The introduction of video laryngoscopy and use of a rapid sequence medication protocol resulted in a significant increase in first attempt intubation success for neonates > 1kg and pediatric patients. First attempt success in neonates < 1kg was lower than the other groups and did not improve over the study period.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^112mcFQ4]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Preoxygenation in severe hypoxemia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — heterogeneous evidence signals potential benefit of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for desaturation prevention. None of the published studies directly evaluated FPS rate as an outcome, and there was significant heterogeneity in how success was reported. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the patient population that was included in the studies and in the severity of hypoxemia, making a global assessment difficult. The strongest evidence suggests that, in patients with the most severe hypoxemia that needs to be escalated to a noninvasive support modality for preoxygenation, NIPPV appears to decrease the incidence of critical desaturation during RSI.

### Fraction of expired oxygen as a measure of preoxygenation prior to rapid sequence intubation in the pediatric emergency department [^115sGidk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulse oximetry (SpO 2) is a flawed measure of adequacy of preoxygenation prior to intubation. The fraction of expired oxygen (FeO 2) is a promising but understudied alternative.

Objective

To investigate FeO 2 as a measure of preoxygenation prior to intubation in a pediatric emergency department.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients 18 and younger. We collected data using video review, and FeO 2 was measured via inline sampling. The main outcomes were FeO 2 and SpO 2 at the start of preoxygenation, end of preoxygenation/start of intubation attempt, and the end of intubation attempt. We compared FeO 2 and SpO 2 at the end of preoxygenation for patients with and without oxyhemoglobin desaturation.

Results

We enrolled 85 of 88 eligible patients during the 14-month study period. FeO 2 data were available at the start of preoxygenation for 53 of 85 patients (62%), and for the end of preoxygenation for 59 of 85 patients (69%). Median FeO 2 at the start and end of preoxygenation was 90% (interquartile range [IQR] 88, 92) and 90% (IQR 88, 92). Median SpO 2 at the start and end of preoxygenation was 100% (IQR 100, 100). There were 11 episodes of desaturation, with median FeO 2 at the start of intubation attempt of 89.5 (IQR 54.5, 91.5) and median SpO 2 of 100 (IQR 99, 100). Patients who did not have a desaturation event had a median FeO 2 of 90.0 (IQR 88.0, 92.0).

Conclusions

Measuring FeO 2 during rapid sequence intubation is challenging with feasibility limitations, but may be a more discriminatory metric of adequate preoxygenation.

### Rapid sequence intubation standardization and improvement process in the pediatric emergency department… [^114RCAkk]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

Background: Rapid Sequence Intubation is the standard definitive airway management in the pediatric emergency department. There are limited data describing time to intubation, adverse events, and process variation for RSI in the PED. Prior studies demonstrate the first pass intubation success rate is between 26–85% and, the RSI-associated AE rate is between 20–61% in this setting. We report a low cost, multidisciplinary initiative to improve the safety of RSI in the PED. Methods: We conducted a single center quality improvement initiative at a tertiary care academic PED from 12/31/2015–1/31/2017. After reviewing charts to obtain baseline data on TTI, AE, and FPISR, we simultaneously tested: a color-coded standard equipment chart, a visual airway equipment schematic, a standard RSI medication ordering/dosing sheet, an RSI safety checklist, and standard documentation of AE in the electronic medical records.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^1165QMQb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a standard procedure, which should be implemented in all patients with a risk of aspiration/regurgitation during anaesthesia induction.

OBJECTIVE

The primary aim was to evaluate clinical practice in RSI, both in adult and paediatric populations.

DESIGN

Online survey.

SETTINGS

A total of 56 countries.

PARTICIPANTS

Members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

The aim was to identify and describe the actual clinical practice of RSI related to general anaesthesia.

RESULTS

From the 1921 respondents, 76.5% (n = 1469) were qualified anaesthesiologists. When anaesthetising adults, the majority (61.7%, n = 1081) of the respondents preoxygenated patients with 100% O 2 for 3 min and 65.9% (n = 1155) administered opioids during RSI. The Sellick manoeuvre was used by 38.5% (n = 675) and was not used by 37.4% (n = 656) of respondents. First-line medications for a haemodynamically stable adult patient were propofol (90.6%, n = 1571) and suxamethonium (56.0%, n = 932). Manual ventilation (inspiratory pressure < 12 cmH 2 O) was used in 35.5% (n = 622) of respondents. In the majority of paediatric patients, 3 min of preoxygenation (56.6%, n = 817) and opioids (54.9%, n = 797) were administered. The Sellick manoeuvre and manual ventilation (inspiratory pressure < 12 cmH 2 O) in children were used by 23.5% (n = 340) and 35.9% (n = 517) of respondents, respectively. First-line induction drugs for a haemodynamically stable child were propofol (82.8%, n = 1153) and rocuronium (54.7%, n = 741).

CONCLUSION

We found significant heterogeneity in the daily clinical practice of RSI. For patient safety, our findings emphasise the need for international RSI guidelines.

### The who, where, and what of rapid sequence intubation: prospective observational study of emergency RSI outside the operating theatre [^1143SCCh]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency rapid sequence intubation (RSI) performed outside the operating room on emergency patients is the cornerstone of emergency airway management. Complication rates are unknown for this procedure in the United Kingdom and the factors contributing to immediate complications have not been identified.

Aims

To quantify the immediate complications of RSI and to assess the contribution made by environmental, patient, and physician factors to overall complication rates.

Methods

Prospective observational study of 208 consecutive adult and paediatric patients undergoing RSI over a six month period.

Results

Patients were successfully intubated by RSI in all cases. There were no deaths during the procedure and no patient required a surgical airway. Patient diagnostic groups requiring RSI are described. Immediate complications were hypoxaemia 19.2%, hypotension 17.8%, and arrhythmia 3.4%. Hypoxaemia was more common in patients with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions than in patients with other diagnoses (p < 0.01). Emergency department intubations were associated with a significantly lower complication rate than other locations (16.9%; p = 0.004). This can be explained by the difference in diagnostic case mix. Intubating teams comprised anaesthetists, non-anaesthetists, or both. There were no significant differences in complication rates between these groups.

Conclusions

RSI has a significant immediate complication rate, although the clinical significance of transient events is unknown. The likelihood of immediate complications depends on the patient's underlying condition, and relevant diagnoses should be emphasised in airway management training. Complication rates are comparable between anaesthetists and non-anaesthetists. The significantly lower complication rates in emergency department RSI can be explained by a larger proportion of patients with comparatively stable cardiorespiratory function.

### Rapid sequence intubation for pediatric emergency patients: higher frequency of failed attempts and adverse effects found by video review [^113EgKGM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Using video review, we seek to determine the frequencies of first-attempt success and adverse effects during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in a large, tertiary care, pediatric emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of children undergoing RSI in the ED of a pediatric institution. Data were collected from preexisting video and written records of care provided. The primary outcome was successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt at laryngoscopy. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of any adverse effect during RSI, including episodes of physiologic deterioration. We collected time data from the RSI process by using video review. We explored the association between physician type and first-attempt success.

Results

We obtained complete records for 114 of 123 (93%) children who underwent RSI in the ED during 12 months. Median age was 2.4 years, and 89 (78%) were medical resuscitations. Of the 114 subjects, 59 (52%) were tracheally intubated on the first attempt. Seventy subjects (61%) had 1 or more adverse effects during RSI; 38 (33%) experienced oxyhemoglobin desaturation and 2 required cardiopulmonary resuscitation after physiologic deterioration. Fewer adverse effects were documented in the written records than were observed on video review. The median time from induction through final endotracheal tube placement was 3 minutes. After adjusting for patient characteristics and illness severity, attending-level providers were 10 times more likely to be successful on the first attempt than all trainees combined.

Conclusion

Video review of RSI revealed that first-attempt failure and adverse effects were much more common than previously reported for children in an ED.

### Use of etomidate as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric emergency department [^113GFsft]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although etomidate is widely used for rapid sequence intubation (RSI), there is no consensus on the optimal induction agent and no prospective pediatric emergency department (ED) study exists. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of etomidate as an induction agent for RSI in the pediatric ED.

Methods

Data on RSI conditions and complications were collected prospectively on patients undergoing RSI in a tertiary pediatric ED from January 2003 to December 2003. ED hemodynamic data and inpatient data were collected retrospectively via chart review.

Results

Seventy-seven of 101 patients requiring intubation underwent RSI with etomidate. The mean (± SD) age was 8.2 (± 6.2) years. All 77 patients were successfully intubated. Intubation condition data were available for 69 of 77 patients (89.6%). Conditions were good in 68 of 69 (99%; 95% confidence interval = 92.2% to 99.9%). The mean (± SD) maximal percent decrease in systolic blood pressure was 10% (± 13.6%). A greater than 20% maximal percent decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in 12 of 69 patients (17.4%; 95% confidence interval = 9.3% to 28.4%). There was no relationship between seizures after etomidate administration and prior seizure history (p = 0.25). Corticosteroids were given to 29 of 77 patients post-RSI for varying diagnoses. All eight patients given corticosteroids for shock were in shock at the time of intubation.

Conclusions

In the pediatric ED setting, etomidate as an induction agent provided successful RSI conditions and resulted in varied hemodynamic changes that were especially favorable in those patients presenting in decompensated shock. Hypotension and seizures were uncommon and occurred in patients with confounding diagnoses. Until the significance of a single dose of etomidate on adrenal dysfunction is further clarified, caution should be used in those patients at risk for adrenal insufficiency.

### Two hundred sixty pediatric emergency airway encounters by air transport personnel: a report of the air transport emergency airway management (NEAR VI: "A-TEAM") project [^116hv5Qf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Effective airway management is the cornerstone of resuscitative efforts for any critically ill or injured patient. The role and safety of pediatric prehospital intubation is controversial, particularly after prior research has shown varying degrees of intubation success. We report a series of consecutive prehospital pediatric intubations performed by air-transport providers.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed intubation flight records from an 89-rotorcraft, multistate emergency flight service during the time period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009. All patients younger than 15 years were included in our analysis. We characterized patient, flight, and operator demographics; intubation methods; success rates; rescue techniques; and adverse events with descriptive statistics. We report proportions with 95% confidence intervals and differences between groups with Fisher exact and χ tests; P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Two hundred sixty pediatric intubations were performed consisting of 88 medical (33.8%) and 172 trauma (66.2%) cases; 98.8% (n = 257) underwent an orotracheal intubation attempt as the first method. First-pass intubation success was 78.6% (n = 202), and intubation was ultimately successful in 95.7% (n = 246) of cases. Medical and trauma intubations had similar success rates (98% vs 95%, Fisher exact test P = 0.3412). There was no difference in intubation success between age groups (χ = 0.26, P = 0.88). Three patients were managed primarily with an extraglottic device. Rescue techniques were used in 11 encounters (4.2%), all of which were successful. Cricothyrotomy was performed twice, both successful.

Conclusions

Prehospital pediatric intubation performed by air-transport providers, using rapid sequence intubation protocols, is highly successful. This effect on patient outcome requires further study.

### The paediatric airway: basic principles and current developments [^116s9Kdy]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Perioperative airway problems frequently result in significant morbidity and mortality in children. Therefore, proficiency in airway management is one of the most important key elements in the safe conduct of paediatric anaesthesia. This review includes important anatomical and physiological aspects of the paediatric airway, challenges encountered, and their management with commonly available resources. The importance of early recognition and treatment of anatomical or functional airway obstruction using locally adapted algorithms is highlighted. Children deemed at risk of aspiration require a controlled rapid sequence induction with sufficiently deep anaesthesia, confirmed complete muscle paralysis and intermittent ventilation prior to tracheal intubation. The benefits of a supraglottic airway device and a cuffed tracheal tube in paediatric airway management are discussed. The primary goal of mastering the paediatric airway is to ensure oxygenation and ventilation. This requires intricate knowledge, regular practice and experience.

### Rocuronium [^1131wJhY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional information for administration to pediatric patients of all age groups is presented elsewhere in the label

[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

The infusion of rocuronium bromide must be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's twitch response as monitored with the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator. Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of rocuronium bromide infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following similar total exposure to single bolus doses [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Rocuronium bromide is not recommended for rapid sequence intubation in pediatric patients.

Geriatric Patients

Geriatric patients (65 years or older) exhibited a slightly prolonged median (range) clinical duration of 46 (22 to 73), 62

(49 to 75), and 94 (64 to 138) minutes under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia following doses of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. No differences in duration of neuromuscular blockade following maintenance doses of rocuronium bromide were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Challenges and advances in intubation: rapid sequence intubation [^116eJe99]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation is the process involving administration of a sedative (eg, induction agent) followed almost immediately by a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation The purpose of emergency RSI is to make emergent intubation easier and safer, thereby increasing the success rate of intubation while decreasing the complications. Possible disadvantages are complications from the additional drugs, prolonged intubation with hypoxia, and precipitating an emergent or crash airway. Controversy has arisen regarding various steps in RSI; however, RSI remains the standard of care in emergency medicine airway management.

Most children are treated at general Emergency Departments (EDs) and not specialized pediatric EDs. Therefore, it is crucial for emergency medicine physicians to be aware of recent developments in pediatric emergency medicine. Often impactful articles on pediatric emergency medicine are not published in the journals regularly studied by general emergency medicine physicians. We selected ten studies that we found impactful, robust, and relevant for practicing general emergency physicians. This review includes studies of status epilepticus, cardiac arrest, asthma, infant fever, wound care, rapid sequence intubation, coronavirus, and trauma.

### Studying the safety and performance of rapid sequence intubation: data collection method matters [^116vL37D]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe and compare chart and video review as data collection sources for the study of emergency department (ED) rapid sequence intubation (RSI).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study compares the availability and content of key RSI outcome and process data from two sources: chart and video data from 12 months of pediatric ED RSI. Key outcomes included adverse effects (oxyhemoglobin desaturation, physiologic changes, inadequate paralysis, vomiting), process components (number of laryngoscopy attempts, end-tidal CO 2 detection), and timing data (duration of preoxygenation and laryngoscopy attempts).

Results

We reviewed 566 documents from 114 cases with video data. Video review detected higher rates of adverse effects (67%) than did chart review (46%, p < 0.0001), identifying almost twice the rate of desaturation noted in the chart (34% vs. 18%, p = 0.0002). The performance and timing of key RSI processes were significantly more reliably available via video review (timing and duration of preoxygenation, as well as timing, duration, and number of laryngoscopy attempts, all p < 0.05). Video review identified 221 laryngoscopy attempts, whereas chart review only identified 187.

Conclusions

When compared with video review for retrospective study of RSI in a pediatric ED, chart review significantly underestimated adverse effects, inconsistently contained data on important RSI process elements, rarely provided time data, and often conflicted with observations made on video review. Interpretation of and design of future studies of RSI should take into consideration the quality of the data source.

### Success and complications of the ketamine-only intubation method in the emergency department [^112DSc8g]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI), defined as near-simultaneous administration of a sedative and neuromuscular blocking agent, is the most common and successful method of tracheal intubation in the emergency department. However, RSI is sometimes avoided when the physician believes there is a risk of a can't intubate/can't oxygenate scenario or critical hypoxemia because of distorted anatomy or apnea intolerance. Traditionally, topical anesthesia alone or in combination with low-dose sedation are used when physicians deem RSI too risky. Recently, a ketamine-only strategy has been suggested as an alternative approach.

Objective

We compared first attempt success and complications between ketamine-only, topical anesthesia alone or with low-dose sedation, and RSI approaches.

Methods

We analyzed registry data from the National Emergency Airway Registry, comprising emergency department intubation data from 25 centers from January 2016 to December 2018. We excluded pediatric patients (< 14 years of age), those in cardiac and respiratory arrest, or those with an alternate pharmacologic approach (i.e., neuromuscular blocking agent only or nonketamine sedative alone). We analyzed first attempt intubation success and adverse events across the 3 intubation approaches. We calculated differences in outcomes between the ketamine-only and topical anesthesia groups.

Results

During the study period, 12,511 of 19,071 intubation encounters met inclusion criteria, including 102 (0.8%) intubated with ketamine alone, 80 (0.6%) who had intubation facilitated by topical anesthesia, and 12,329 (98.5%) who underwent RSI. Unadjusted first attempt success was 61%, 85%, and 90% for the 3 groups, respectively. Hypoxemia (defined as oxygen saturation < 90%) occurred in 16%, 13%, and 8% of patients during the first attempt, respectively. At least 1 adverse event occurred in 32%, 19%, and 14% of the courses of intubation for the 3 groups, respectively. In comparing the ketamine-only and topical anesthesia groups, the difference in first pass success was -24% (95% confidence interval -37% to -12%), and the difference in number of cases with ≥ 1 adverse event was 13% (95% confidence interval 0–25%), both favoring the topical anesthesia group.

Conclusion

Although sometimes advocated, the ketamine-only intubation approach is uncommon and is associated with lower success and higher complications compared with topical anesthesia and RSI approaches.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is compared across studies, noting that "continuous oxygen flow of 40–60 L throughout the respiratory cycle may lead to gastric insufflation, which may increase the risk of regurgitation and aspiration". A prospective before-and-after study reported a 14% incidence of desaturation in the face-mask group and 2% in the HFNO group, with HFNO independently preventing desaturation less than 80% (adjusted odds ratio: 0.17; 95% CI, 0.01–0.90; p = 0.04). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with more severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150), desaturation incidence was 25.8% for HFNO and 22.3% for face-mask oxygenation. A retrospective analysis reported a 23% incidence for HFNO versus 2.5% for NIPPV; none of the patients who received HFNO desaturated to less than 70%, compared with 13% of those who received NIPPV. Another trial showed desaturation rates of 27% with HFNO and 23% with NIPPV; among patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200, desaturation rates were 35% with HFNO and 24% with NIPPV. In one study of lowest saturation, 12% desaturated to less than 93% in the facemask group, whereas all patients in the HFNO group maintained an oxygen saturation of greater than 93%. Synthesis on aspiration risk indicates seven studies reporting gastric insufflation or aspiration, and "based on very low-quality evidence, it appears as though HFNO does not affect aspiration risk". For severe complications, eight studies reported cardiac arrest or severe cardiovascular collapse and "all are very low quality of evidence; therefore, no conclusions could be drawn". Overall, "in patients with severe hypoxemia, NIPPV appears to have the strongest evidence for decreasing the incidence of critical desaturation during RSI", while "HFNO provides the added benefit of continued oxygen flow into the nasopharynx during laryngoscopy", and "HFNO seemed to reduce the occurrence rate of desaturation, prolonged safe apnea times, and overall limited the degree of desaturation compared with studies of preoxygenation with a face mask, but not necessarily when compared with studies in which NIPPV was used". Implementation varies because "many rural hospitals and essentially all prehospital and interfacility transport services cannot provide HFNO due to oxygen-capacity limitations". Evidence gaps are noted: "Definitive research is not feasible to determine the optimal method of preoxygenation in patients with difficult airways, prolonged laryngoscopy".

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^113L4fnt]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Neuromuscular-blocking agent selection — For critically ill adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI), the panel states: We suggest administering either rocuronium or succinylcholine for RSI when there are no known contraindications to succinylcholine (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). As rationale, succinylcholine is noted as a short-acting depolarizing NMBA traditionally used for RSI, and adverse events, such as hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and malignant hyperthermia, may occur with succinylcholine.

### Factors associated with oxyhemoglobin desaturation during rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric emergency department: findings from multivariable analyses of video review data [^116sMYoT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In a video-based study of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in a pediatric emergency department (PED), 33% of children experienced oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 < 90%). To inform targeted improvement interventions, we planned multivariable analyses to identify patient and process variables (including time-based data around performance of key RSI process elements uniquely available from video review) associated with desaturation during pediatric RSI.

Methods

These were planned analyses of data collected during a retrospective, video-based study of RSI in a high-volume, academic PED. For variables with plausible associations with desaturation, multiple logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to identify those characteristics independently associated with desaturation at both the patient and the attempt levels.

Results

The authors analyzed video data from 114 patients undergoing RSI over 12 months. Desaturation was more common in patients 24 months of age and younger (59%) than in patients older than 24 months of age (10%). Variables associated with desaturation in patients 24 months of age and younger were duration of attempts (both individual and cumulative), the occurrence of esophageal intubation, a respiratory indication for intubation, and young age. The receiver operating characteristics curve for the model had an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67 to 0.92). Forty-six percent of desaturations occurred after 45 seconds of laryngoscopy, and 82% after 30 seconds. The odds ratio for desaturation on individual attempts lasting longer than 30 seconds (vs. those 30 seconds or less) was 5.7 (95% CI = 2.26 to 14.36).

Conclusions

For children 24 months of age or younger undergoing RSI in a PED, respiratory indication for intubation, esophageal intubation, and duration of laryngoscopy (both individual and cumulative) were associated with desaturation; the number of attempts was not. Interventions to limit attempt duration in the youngest children may improve the safety of RSI.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^111U1ZPn]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Suxamethonium is a part of the classical RSI technique but rocuronium (1.2 mg kg −1)provides comparable intubation conditions. Worldwide, suxamethonium remains the first-choice drug for neuromuscular blockade induction during RSI. However, the availability of suggamadex, a selective antidote for rocuronium, has increased the use of rocuronium for RSI over the past few years. In our survey, suxamethonium remained the drug of choice for RSI in adults, with 56% of respondents favouring it compared with 49.3% using rocuronium. This situation was reversed in paediatric patients, where 54.7% of respondents used rocuronium and 48.3% used suxamethonium. This could be explained by the fear of malignant hyperthermia in children, or by the availability of sugammadex for rapid reversal of rocuronium and the additional possibility of minimising the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade postoperatively. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a warning regarding serious adverse effects and fatal cases of malignant hyperthermia after suxamethonium administration. Suxamethonium in children should be reserved for the treatment of laryngospasm and for RSI. Considering the serious side effects, the role of suxamethonium in paediatric RSI is debatable. Only a minority of respondents monitored the onset of neuromuscular blockade (adult/paediatric, sometimes 32.9%/28.6%, always 14.0%/11.2%). This could be a possible area for improvement. The majority of aspiration episodes during RSI have been linked to attempts to intubate the trachea during light anaesthesia before the onset of neuromuscular blockade.

The basic principle of the classical RSI is the avoidance of manual ventilation, thus minimising the risk of air insufflation into the stomach and reducing the risk of aspiration/regurgitation. However, this practice is associated with a risk of hypoxaemia and cardiovascular complications. Manual or mechanical controlled ventilation with a limited inspiratory pressure (≤ 12–15 cmH 2 O) can lead to effective ventilation and oxygenation without insufflating the stomach, and according to the published data, it can be considered well tolerated. – The inclusion of such pressure limited ventilation in the RSI algorithm is described as 'controlled RSI' or 'modified RSI'. Such 'controlled RSI' has been used by 67 to 85% of physicians (mainly in patients with respiratory insufficiency and in paediatric patients).

### Emergency front-of-neck access in the pediatric intensive care unit: development of an institutional protocol [^114qrMF9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

"Cannot Intubate, Cannot Oxygenate" is a rare but life-threatening situation that requires immediate recognition, advanced airway management, and ultimately emergency front-of-neck access. All airway practitioners caring for children should be prepared to face these situations. The aim of this review was to provide a concise summary of the latest evidence and to propose a streamlined protocol for pediatric emergency front-of-neck access in the intensive care setting. The strength of our protocol is that we have set explicit time limits for front-of-neck access attempts and incorporated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to achieve the best possible survival and neurological outcomes. No evidence-based consensus exists on the best practice, although organization of local protocols and equipment, as well as regular and comprehensive training, is crucial to bolster clinician confidence and improve patient outcomes.

### Variation in prehospital protocols for pediatric respiratory distress management in the United States [^114zDtyz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare statewide emergency medical services protocols for the management of pediatric respiratory distress.

Methods

We performed a descriptive study of emergency medical services protocols for the management of pediatric respiratory distress in the United States, excluding those without model or mandatory protocols. We compared medication recommendations for specific disease processes, including asthma, croup, epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, generalized respiratory distress, intubation, and drug assisted intubation.

Results

Thirty-four state protocols were included. All had protocols to address the management of pediatric respiratory distress. There was high agreement in albuterol use for bronchospasm and epinephrine use in anaphylaxis. Epinephrine was recommended in all anaphylaxis protocols, 27 croup protocols (79%), and 3 epiglottitis protocols (9%). Six states (18%) called for albuterol in patients with generalized respiratory distress. Steroid recommendations and indications had variance among states; 26 states (76%) allowed steroid use in patients with asthma, 19 states (56%) recommended steroid use in anaphylaxis, and 11 (32%) recommended steroid use in croup protocols. The route for steroid administration also varied among protocols. Five states (15%) allowed continuous positive airway pressure application in pediatric patients, whereas endotracheal intubation and rapid sequence intubations had varying requirements as well as recommendations for use. Twelve (35%) listed impending or current respiratory failure as an indication, whereas other states had specific markers, such as Glasgow Coma Scale or oxygen saturation, as indications.

Conclusions

All included states had specific recommendations for the management of pediatric respiratory distress. There was consistency in recommendations for albuterol use for wheezing and epinephrine use for anaphylaxis. However, there was wide variability in other uses for epinephrine, steroid administration, continuous positive airway pressure use, and specific treatments for croup and epiglottitis. The findings of this study provide a base for important future evidence-based protocol developments and changes in prehospital pediatric respiratory distress treatment.

### The administration of postintubation sedation in the pediatric emergency department [^112RvkTZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The administration of postintubation sedation (PIS) is an essential component of postintubation care. Recent studies in the adult emergency medicine literature have highlighted both delays in time to administration of PIS and subtherapeutic dosing of sedative agents in the emergency department. We aimed to investigate the administration of PIS in the pediatric population as this has not been adequately reviewed to date.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of pediatric emergency department patients who received PIS within an adequate time frame. We also investigated the relationship between this primary outcome and the rapid sequence intubation (RSI) agents used, the reason for intubation, and individual patient characteristics.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of all pediatric patients who underwent RSI at a tertiary care pediatric emergency department from July 2007 to January 2016. The primary outcome of "sedation in an adequate time frame" was defined as a time to post-RSI sedative administration that was shorter than the duration of action of the RSI sedative agent used. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of adequate sedation.

Results

A total of 240 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 28% (95% confidence interval, 22.7%-34.1%) met the primary outcome of sedation within an adequate time frame; 72.8% (95% confidence interval, 66.8%-78.1%) of patients received some form of PIS during their emergency department stay. Patients receiving long-acting paralytic agents were much less likely to receive PIS with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.16 for meeting the primary outcome (P < 0.001, adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.13, P < 0.001). Children with higher systolic blood pressure were more likely to receive appropriate PIS with an OR of 1.02 for every mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.006, AOR = 1.02, P = 0.021). Finally, patients who were ultimately admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (vs the operating room, transfer, or neonatal intensive care unit) were less likely to receive PIS as evidenced by an OR of 0.37 (P = 0.009, AOR = 0.27, P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Most pediatric patients do not receive PIS within an adequate time frame. Patients who receive long-acting paralytic agents are much less likely to be adequately sedated after RSI compared with those receiving succinylcholine.

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury, third edition: update of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines [^116dryaS]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Analgesics, sedatives, and neuromuscular blocking agents — introduction for ICU management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — emphasizes supportive indications and physiologic rationale: analgesics and sedatives are needed for comfort and tolerance; neuromuscular blocking agents are not needed routinely except at rapid sequence intubation or when severe acute lung injury mechanics complicate ventilation; appropriate analgesia and sedation mitigate pain or distress and patient–ventilator dyssynchrony that may result in episodic rise in CBV and raise ICP, and routine care while the patient is awake or aware may lead to unanticipated rises in ICP; pediatric practice is limited by the small number of sedative/analgesics and differs from adult practice, particularly given the frequent adult use of propofol, which in pediatrics has a U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^114iBePg]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — positioning and preoxygenation recommendations state: We suggest use of the head and torso inclined (semi-Fowler) position during RSI. We suggest preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) when laryngoscopy is expected to be challenging. We suggest preoxygenation with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in patients with severe hypoxemia Pao2/FiO2 < 150. We suggest using medication-assisted preoxygenation to improve preoxygenation in patients undergoing RSI who are not able to tolerate a face mask, NIPPV, or HFNO because of agitation, delirium, or combative behavior.

### Propofol and remifentanil for rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric patient at risk for aspiration with elevated intracranial pressure [^115SxrCs]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Aspiration is a significant cause of anesthetic morbidity, occurring most commonly during the induction of anesthesia. For patients with a high likelihood of aspiration, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) techniques may minimize this risk by reducing the time between the loss of protective airway reflexes and the placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube. Although RSI frequently involves the administration of a neuromuscular-blocking agent (NMBA) such as succinylcholine or rocuronium, there are times when the administration of an NMBA is contraindicated or undesirable. We present an 11-year-old boy who presented with vomiting, papilledema, and a history concerning for an undiagnosed neuromuscular disorder. Deep sedation or anesthesia was required during an emergent lumbar puncture to evaluate his symptoms. Rapid sequence intubation was successfully performed with propofol and remifentanil without the use of an NMBA. We highlight the anesthetic considerations in such a clinical scenario and review the literature regarding the combination of remifentanil and propofol for RSI.

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation [^115zTooz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients requiring emergent endotracheal intubation often require a rapid sequence induction intubation (RSI) technique to protect against gastric aspiration, to facilitate intubation, or to protect against increased intracranial pressure. Succinylcholine is the most common muscle relaxant used because it has a fast onset and a short duration. Unfortunately it can have serious side effects as a result of it's membrane depolarizing effect and release of potassium. Rocuronium has been suggested to create intubating conditions similar to succinylcholine. Previous studies have been underpowered to determine equivalence and there has been no previous meta-analysis performed.

Objectives

To determine if rocuronium creates comparable intubating conditions to succinylcholine during RSI intubation. Comparisons were made with succinylcholine based on the dose of rocuronium, use of a narcotic, emergent versus elective intubation, age group and the induction agent used. The primary outcome was excellent intubation conditions. A secondary outcome of clinically acceptable conditions was also performed. These were all dichotomous outcomes using cutpoints from a four point scale by Goldberg to evaluate intubation conditions.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966-March 2000), EMBASE (1988-March 2000) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENRAL) (March 2000) for randomized controlled trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. Foreign language journals were included. References of identified studies were hand-searched for citations missed by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

All trials meeting the inclusion criteria (comparison of rocuronium and succinylcholine, one of study's main outcomes was scoring of intubation conditions) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers for allocation concealment. The outcomes were combined using MetaView 4.1 with risk differences for all categories and RR for the excellent outcomes with a random effects model.

Main Results

40 studies were identified; 26 were combined for analysis. Overall, rocuronium was inferior to succinylcholine, with a RR = 0.87 (95%CI = 0.81 to 0.94) (N = 1606). In the group that used propofol for induction of anaesthesia, the intubation conditions were similar, with a RR = 0.96 (95%CI = 0.87 to 1.06) (N = 640). No major adverse events were reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Succinylcholine created superior intubation conditions to rocuronium when comparing excellent intubation conditions. Using the less stringent outcome, clinically acceptable intubation conditions, the two agents were not statistically different. Intubation conditions were not statistically different between succinylcholine and rocuronium when propofol was used.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^114Re42D]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) induction agents — etomidate versus ketamine and others — are compared in critically ill adults for hypotension, vasopressor use, and mortality. A prospective randomized single-center study assessed etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) versus ketamine (1–2 mg/kg) and reported that Seven-day survival but not 28-day survival was higher with ketamine without differences in ventilation, ICU stay, vasopressor use, SOFA score, or new adrenal insufficiency. In a sepsis propensity score–matched cohort, clinical hypotension defined as MAP decrease > 40% from baseline, MAP < 60 mm Hg, initiation of a vasopressor, or an increase of > 30% of a vasopressor infusion occurred in 51% with ketamine (1.3–2.2 mg/kg) versus 73% with etomidate (0.2–0.4 mg/kg) (OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22–0.67), and at 6–12 hours and 12–24 hours after RSI the etomidate group had significantly lower MAPs. In sepsis intubations, ketamine (median dose: 100 mg [interquartile range {IQR} 72.2–150 mg]) versus etomidate (median dose: 20 mg [IQR 15–20 mg]) had higher post-RSI hypotension with ketamine even after propensity adjustment (OR 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1–6.7), and in ED RSI, hypotension was 18.3% with ketamine (n = 738) versus 12.4% with etomidate (n = 6,068), with a higher risk for hypotension in the ketamine group (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2–1.7). Less-rigorous trials of combinations, including dose varied based on the study 0.2 mg/kg ± 0.1, mean: 21 mg ± 6, and comparators such as propofol (mean: 127 mg ± 5mg) and methohexital (mean: 1 mg/kg ± 0.2), did not show a higher rate of hypotension in critically ill or acutely injured patients. For vasopressor outcomes, across 469 patients in one study and a small RCT of 79 receiving ketamine/propofol (0.5 mg/kg of each) versus 73 receiving etomidate (0.15 mg/kg), there was no difference in duration or in immediate or delayed vasopressor use. A secondary analysis of the INTUBE trial found propofol for RSI was associated with significantly higher adjusted odds of cardiovascular collapse and increased odds of mortality. Taken together, there was no significant difference between etomidate and other induction agents in mortality, most studies demonstrated favorable peri-intubation hemodynamics with etomidate, and because it is often available, familiar, and low cost, it is a reasonable RSI induction agent for critically ill patients.

### Rapid sequence induction: an international survey [^113Qusbx]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In paediatric practice, RSI was chosen for the majority of high-risk patients: acute abdomen 88.6% (n = 1304), a risk of regurgitation or aspiration (91.0%, n = 1339), trauma (less than 6 h between last meal and trauma) 88.7% (n = 1305). The majority of respondents used RSI in older children only (44.1%, n = 630), with 9.7% (n = 138) never using RSI at all in children. The preferred position was supine (50.9%, n = 736). A cuffed endotracheal tube was used for all children by 40.8% (n = 585) of respondents, and by 30.6% (n = 438) of respondents for all children except neonates. The majority of respondents used preoxygenation for 3 min (56.6%, n = 817) and opioids (54.3%, n = 797) without the Sellick manoeuvre (54.2%, n = 784) during RSI in paediatric patients. The drugs of choice for RSI induction in haemodynamically stable paediatric patients were propofol (82.8%, n = 1153) and rocuronium (54.7%, n = 741). In the case of haemodynamic instability, the preferred drugs were ketamine (58.4%, n = 748) and propofol (29.7%, n = 348). Monitoring the onset of neuromuscular blockade was considered unnecessary by 37.2% (n = 536) of respondents. Manual ventilation via face mask before anaesthesia induction was not performed by 41.4% of respondents in paediatric RSI, but in high-risk patients, manual ventilation with limited inspiratory pressure (< 12 cmH 2 O) was used by 35.9% (n = 517) of respondents.

### An emergency surgical airway establishment following rapid sequence induction: a rare case of laryngeal stenosis associated with tuberculosis [^1169Wzzg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Difficult airway remains a leading cause of cardiac arrest, brain injury, and mortality in pediatric anesthesia practice. Intraoperatively, when RSI encounters unexpected difficult airway leading to intubation failure, the team should focus on rescue oxygenation. This would involve mask ventilation or placement of a supraglottic airway device. Gastric insufflation during facemask ventilation can be minimized by ensuring a clear airway, utilizing airway adjuncts, and employing a two-handed technique when necessary. Additionally, limiting peak inspiratory pressures to 15 cmH 2 O or lower during positive pressure ventilation can further reduce the risk of gastric insufflation. In the event of a "cannot ventilate, cannot intubate" (CICO) scenario, the risks associated with invasive rescue techniques must continuously be weighed against the risks of hypoxic brain injury or death. Although multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial in the management of difficult airways (e.g. Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialists can quickly establish a surgical airway to resolve the issue, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) teams can improve oxygenation in extreme cases), in this unexpected difficult airway scenario, despite our immediate call for assistance, the ENT specialist could not arrive within minutes. The rapid development of severe hypoxemia, particularly with a significant drop in HR, prompted the anesthesiologist, who had received formal training in invasive airway management, to assess the urgent need for invasive techniques. Consequently, preparations for establishing an invasive airway were immediately initiated. During the preparation, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest. Due to timely assistance being called earlier, other medical staff in the operating room immediately began CPR. After the anesthesiologist successfully established an invasive airway, oxygenation was restored, and the resuscitation was ultimately successful, allowing the surgery to proceed smoothly. The decision to prioritize surgical cricothyrotomy for front-of-neck access (FONA) aligns with evidence-based protocols in CICO scenarios during concurrent cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As demonstrated by Onrubia et al. surgical cricothyrotomy achieves 100% success rates in CICO emergencies (compared to percutaneous methods' suboptimal performance) while maintaining uninterrupted chest compressions — critical to mitigate the survival decline associated with inadequate cerebral oxygenation. Alternative airway management strategies beyond surgical cricothyroidotomy include retrograde wire-guided intubation, percutaneous cricothyroidotomy, surgical tracheostomy, jet ventilation, and ECMO. Supraglottic jet oxygenation has demonstrated oxygenation improvement in CICO scenarios. The novel Ventrain ® device facilitates efficient ventilation through small-bore catheters, theoretically minimizing barotrauma risks. For older pediatric patients, the large-bore cricothyrotomy device Quicktrach ® provides a practical solution by enabling rapid airway access in emergencies without reliance on the Seldinger technique.

### Intubation during pediatric cardiac arrest in the emergency department is associated with reduced first-pass success [^1144YzD7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway compromise and respiratory failure are leading causes of pediatric cardiac arrest making advanced airway management central to pediatric resuscitation. Previous literature has demonstrated that achieving first-pass success (FPS) is associated with fewer adverse events. In cardiac arrest for adult patients, increasing number of intubation attempts is associated with lower likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable neurologic outcome. There is limited evidence regarding advanced airway management for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this study was to compare FPS in pediatric OHCA and non-cardiac arrest patients in the ED.

Methods

This is an analysis of pediatric intubations prospectively recorded into a continuous quality improvement database in an academic pediatric ED over a 12-year period. Between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2019, physicians recorded all intubations performed in the pediatric ED. The database included patient demographics and detailed information about each intubation such as age of the patient, reason for intubation, number of intubation attempts, and outcome of each attempt. All patients younger than 18 years who underwent intubation in the ED were eligible for inclusion in the study. The primary outcome was FPS for pediatric patients in cardiac arrest compared with those not in cardiac arrest. A logistic regressions analysis was performed to identify characteristics associated with FPS in OHCA patients.

Results

Six hundred eight pediatric patients were intubated during the study period. One hundred three pediatric patients had OHCA compared with 459 non-cardiac arrest patients who underwent rapid sequence intubation. In patients with OHCA, 47.6% had FPS (95% confidence interval [CI] 38.2%-57.1%), 33% required 2 attempts (95% CI, 24.7%-42.6%), and 19.4% required 3 or more attempts (95% CI, 12.9%-28.2%). In patients without OHCA, 75.4% had FPS (95% CI, 75.4%-79.1%), 15% required 2 attempts (95% CI, 12.0%-18.6%), and 9.6% required 3 or more attempts (95% CI, 7.2%-12.6%). Cardiac arrest was associated with a reduction in FPS adjusted odds ratio 0.44 (95% CI, 0.26–0.77).

Conclusions

In this study, we found that pediatric OHCA is associated with reduced FPS in the ED. Although additional studies are needed, rescuers should prioritize restoring effective oxygenation and ventilation and optimizing intubation conditions before an advanced airway attempt.

### Developing an extubation strategy for the difficult pediatric airway-who, when, why, where, and how? [^115ph9Bf]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive airway management of the pediatric patient with a difficult airway requires a plan for the transition back to a patent and protected airway. Multiple techniques are available to manage the periextubation period. Equally important is performing a comprehensive risk assessment and developing a strategy that optimizes the likelihood of safe extubation. This includes team-focused communication of the desired goals, critical steps in the process, and potential responses in the case of failed extubation. This review summarizes extubation of pediatric patients with difficult airways along with one suggested framework to manage this challenging period.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — patient awareness and postintubation analgesosedation: Three RCTs measured patient awareness in the periintubation period and none of the patients reported awareness during the procedure when questioned at a postoperative interview; an ED observational study noted that Seven of the 10 patients reporting postintubation awareness during neuromuscular blockade had received a longer-acting NMBA for RSI; across one RCT and 10 observational studies, most studies reported that postintubation analgesosedation was provided more rapidly or to a greater extent when succinylcholine was administered as the NMBA for RSI, and some studies have shown that patient awareness may be mitigated when a clinical pharmacist is involved in the management of RSI.

### Airway management of the critically ill patient: rapid-sequence intubation [^116h3nCt]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Advances in emergency airway management have allowed intensivists to use intubation techniques that were once the province of anesthesiology and were confined to the operating room. Appropriate rapid-sequence intubation (RSI) with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, induction drugs, and adjunctive medications in a standardized approach improves clinical outcomes for select patients who require intubation. However, many physicians who work in the ICU have insufficient experience with these techniques to adopt them for routine use. The purpose of this article is to review airway management in the critically ill adult with an emphasis on airway assessment, algorithmic approaches, and RSI.

### Developing an extubation strategy for the difficult pediatric airway-who, when, why, where, and how? [^116GtPRi]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Comprehensive airway management of the pediatric patient with a difficult airway requires a plan for the transition back to a patent and protected airway. Multiple techniques are available to manage the periextubation period. Equally important is performing a comprehensive risk assessment and developing a strategy that optimizes the likelihood of safe extubation. This includes team‐focused communication of the desired goals, critical steps in the process, and potential responses in the case of failed extubation. This review summarizes extubation of pediatric patients with difficult airways along with one suggested framework to manage this challenging period.

Neonatal resuscitation priorities and sequencing — ventilation emphasis: the neonatal guidelines state that the most important priority for newborn survival is the establishment of adequate lung inflation and ventilation after birth, and they do not include specific language on the sequence of resuscitation efforts or make any explicit recommendations for an A-B-C approach; however, according to the neonatal guidelines, ventilation should be optimized with endotracheal intubation, if possible, before starting chest compressions.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^111p6WYC]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

During emergent intubations in the operating theatre, succinylcholine allowed for a 35 sec earlier completion of the intubation sequence than rocuronium. In the present study involving critically ill patients, this favorable effect of succinylcholine was reduced to 14 sec, that is, to approximately 15% of the total length of the intubation sequence with rocuronium. In almost 40% of our patients visible fasciculations had not occurred or had not ceased within 45 sec after the injection of succinylcholine, and, according to study protocol, laryngoscopy was started in these patients at the same time as in the rocuronium group. To the best of our knowledge, a delayed onset of succinylcholine-induced fasciculations in critically ill patients has not been reported so far. As severe illness may have a profound effect on the neuromuscular system it is tempting to speculate that the severity of underlying illness is responsible for the difference in the onset of fasciculations and, hence, the reduced advantage of succinylcholine with regard to rapid completion of the intubation sequence between patients in the operating theatre and patients in intensive care.

A limitation of this trial is the lack of a double-blind design. However, masking the effects of drugs like succinylcholine that have visible effects (fasciculations) is inherently difficult. A RSI in critically ill patients is a high-risk procedure requiring the full attention of an appropriately trained physician. Since in our settings the simultaneous achievement of perfect blinding and optimal patient safety was not feasible, we opted for a single-blind study design. Using experienced operators and a checklist (containing all relevant aspects recently found to decrease complications related to intubation in intensive care), every effort was made to protect the patients' safety. Thus, our results are not necessarily generalisible to settings with less stringent procedural guidelines and/or less experienced operators. Our findings were obtained with an induction sequence of fentanyl and propofol or etomidate and cannot be extrapolated to other drugs and/or doses.

### Implementation of a neonatal RSI pre-sedation protocol and effect on first attempt endotracheal intubation attempts for neonatal transport team members… [^111WV6FG]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

Implementation of a Neonatal RSI Pre-sedation Protocol and Effect on First Attempt Endotracheal Intubation Attempts for Neonatal Transport Team Members PURPOSE In pediatric and adult transport environments, strong evidence demonstrates that Rapid Sequence Intubation Protocols improve first attempt endotracheal intubation success rates. While RSI Protocols are used in hospital-based Neonatal lntensive Care Units, their use during neonatal transport is just emerging. Using Quality Improvement methodology, a Neonatal Transport RSI Protocol was implemented. The protocol's impact on first attempt intubation success rates performed by experienced neonatal transport members was evaluated.

METHOD A retrospective 12-month chart review revealed that, 1) 40% of neonates received pre-sedation prior to endotracheal intubation; 2) procedure attempts, when measured for time from pre-sedation administration, did not allow for effect 3) pre-medication use varied; and 4) 54% of neonates were successfully intubated on the first attempt.

### Pediatric airway management in COVID-19 patients: consensus guidelines from the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia's pediatric difficult intubation collaborative and the Canadian pediatric anesthesia society [^113xFE8E]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic has challenged medical systems and clinicians globally to unforeseen levels. Rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines. Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from 6 countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease. PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect health care workers. Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room. Importantly, PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19. Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available. Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases. Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Until further information is available, PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^116q9yGL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does a combination of magnesium sulfate pretreatment followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1) produce superior intubation conditions to succinylcholine?
Findings: For rapid sequence induction, a combination of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate followed by a standard intubating dose of rocuronium does not provide superior intubating conditions compared with succinylcholine but has fewer adverse effects.
Meaning: In view of our findings, we hypothesize that for rapid sequence induction, a combination of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate and a standard intubating dose of rocuronium might be an alternative to succinylcholine in circumstances where succinylcholine administration is not warranted.

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a frequently used procedure for endotracheal intubation in the emergency setting or in unfasted patients who are at risk of regurgitation. Succinylcholine remains the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI, but it has many adverse effects. There are alternatives that may be used instead of succinylcholine. For instance, with a high dose of rocuronium bromide, 1.0–1.2 mg·kg –1, the same intubating conditions with a similar onset time as with succinylcholine may be achieved. Also, pretreatment with intravenous (IV) magnesium may accelerate onset time of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. – The main problem with high dose nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents is prolonged recovery time. Today, this might not be perceived as a major problem as even deep, rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block can be antagonized with sugammadex. But in many countries, sugammadex is not available or its use is restricted due to its high costs and strategies to reduce its usage are welcomed. On the contrary, the role of magnesium in perioperative medicine is constantly increasing due to its analgesic and morphine sparing properties, neuroprotective features, and its potency to decrease overall anesthetic requirements. This begs the question as to whether a standard intubating dose of, for instance, rocuronium, combined with magnesium, differs with regard to onset times and intubation conditions compared with succinylcholine. With a 15-minute IV infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg·kg –1 before a standard dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg·kg –1), the onset time of the neuromuscular block was reduced by about 35% (from 120 to 72 seconds), but recovery was only prolonged by 25%. In addition, the interindividual variability in the onset of the neuromuscular blockade was lessened with this magnesium-rocuronium regimen, suggesting that the predictability of adequate intubating conditions was improved. We designed a randomized controlled trial to compare a combination of magnesium with a standard intubating dose of rocuronium with succinylcholine in patients undergoing RSI. We chose a superiority trial design.

### An expiration date for etomidate? [^112mQTvh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, mitigation of hemodynamic instability following endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients should involve a suite of interventions, with the induction agent (and dose) being just one component. Other key interventions include the proactive use of vasopressors and appropriate fluid loading to counterbalance the anticipated decrease in preload associated with positive-pressure ventilation. For example, the Montpellier intubation protocol employs a bundle of interventions intended to reduce the risk of periintubation complications. In a pre-versus-post study, implementation of the Montpellier intubation protocol was associated with reduced rates of life-threatening (21% vs. 34%; P = 0.03) and other (9% vs. 21%) complications.

Fourth, the popularity of etomidate as an induction agent in critically ill patients is closely related to its use as a component of rapid sequence intubation (RSI). RSI involves administration of precalculated doses of an induction agent and paralytic drug in rapid succession, followed by immediate placement of an endotracheal tube before assisted ventilation. Although the predetermined dosing of an induction agent without titration can easily lead to hemodynamic instability, the stated benefit of RSI is to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Recent data bring this assumption into question. The PreVent (Preventing Hypoxemia with Manual Ventilation during Endotracheal Intubation) trial randomized 401 critically ill patients to receive mask ventilation or no ventilation during the period between induction and intubation. Patients receiving mask ventilation experienced a lower incidence of severe hypoxemia, whereas the rates of pulmonary aspiration did not differ significantly between the no-ventilation (2.5%) and ventilation (4%) arms. Although the trial was not designed to precisely detect between-group differences in the secondary outcome of pulmonary aspiration, these data offer support for avoiding RSI when intubating a critically ill patient.

Has etomidate reached its "best before" date when it comes to its routine use in endotracheal intubation? Wunsch and colleagues provide convincing findings that require attention and consideration. As we outline above, safer alternatives to etomidate exist, and airway management of critically ill patients should be considered to constitute a suite of interventions, with the induction agent (and dose) being just one component. While we await the results of other RCTs (NCT06179485, NCT05277896), we recommend careful consideration of the choice of induction drug when proceeding with endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.
