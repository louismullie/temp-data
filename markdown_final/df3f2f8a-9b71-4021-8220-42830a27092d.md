## Question

What recent developments have emerged in ARDS treatment and management protocols?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most recent developments in ARDS treatment and management protocols. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines are most current and authoritative. Then, I should verify the key intervention domains: pharmacologic therapies, ventilatory strategies, advanced support, fluid management, and adjunctive measures. Next, I will assess evidence strength and nuances by GRADE, consider COVID-19-specific integration, and finally synthesize pragmatic implementation considerations and takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the source hierarchy and scope so I don't overstate anything: the 2024 ATS update focuses on four PICO questions (corticosteroids, VV-ECMO, NMBAs, PEEP/LRMs) and explicitly builds on and complements the 2017 ventilatory guidelines that still anchor low tidal volume and prone positioning, while the 2024 SCCM focused update addresses corticosteroids in ARDS and the 2023 ESICM guideline concentrates on respiratory support and phenotyping, with some areas of divergence from ATS due to different evidence appraisals [^1116v4vi] [^116p3RQh] [^111U6Xw6] [^112ebKE5].

> I need to ensure the pharmacologic updates are accurate, starting with corticosteroids: ATS 2024 suggests steroids for adult ARDS with moderate certainty based on pooled RCTs showing probable mortality reduction, but cautions about heterogeneity in dose, agent, and timing and incomplete safety data; SCCM 2024 also recommends considering steroids in ARDS, reinforcing the shift toward conditional use that requires individualized risk–benefit appraisal [^116w6byw] [^113crMig] [^111U6Xw6].

> Hold on, I should verify the neuromuscular blocker signal carefully: ATS 2024 suggests early NMBAs in severe ARDS with low certainty, noting mortality benefit primarily when compared with deep sedation and not when compared with light sedation; benefits likely include reduced barotrauma but with a trade-off of probable ICU-acquired weakness, and ESICM takes a more cautious stance against routine NMBA use, underscoring practice differences that hinge on sedation targets and trial heterogeneity [^111VZ4DD] [^111tfpLK] [^113uMcQN] [^112ebKE5].

> Let me now examine advanced support: ATS 2024 suggests VV-ECMO for selected severe ARDS based on two RCTs with a pooled mortality benefit, but I need to emphasize feasibility constraints — this is resource intensive, should follow optimal conventional management including proning, and is best centralized in experienced centers, a point echoed in pandemic planning literature [^111PHjKp] [^11765EBy] [^113b6L3C].

> Next, I should review the enduring ventilatory cornerstones so I don't miss the forest for the trees: low tidal volume ventilation at 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O remains a strong recommendation, and prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day in severe ARDS remains a strong standard — these are also highlighted by ATS as suitable performance measures due to their underuse and strong evidence [^116p3RQh] [^111gnWmM] [^113wiDYs].

> Wait, let me verify the refined PEEP and recruitment guidance because there's nuance here: ATS 2024 suggests higher PEEP without recruitment maneuvers for moderate-to-severe ARDS, but strongly recommends against prolonged LRMs (e.g. PEEP ≥ 35 cm H2O for > 60 seconds) due to probable hemodynamic harm; ESICM 2023 found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine higher versus lower PEEP strategies, reflecting ongoing uncertainty and the heterogeneity of approaches [^11439Z94] [^1174TiLC] [^112MrF8X].

> I will now examine fluid strategy and make sure I'm aligning with current living guidance: WHO 2023 explicitly recommends a conservative fluid management approach in ARDS patients without tissue hypoperfusion or fluid responsiveness, building on FACTT-era principles; but wait, I should note that precision analyses suggest heterogeneity of response by ARDS subphenotype, with possible differential mortality effects, so fluid strategy should be reassessed dynamically rather than fixed [^116zGogc] [^1175MqSJ].

> Let me consider adjunctive therapies and ensure I don't overgeneralize: prone positioning remains an established standard and a target for quality metrics due to under-implementation, whereas inhaled nitric oxide continues to be discouraged for routine use in ARDS, including in COVID-19 contexts, consistent with BTS 2019 and SCCM COVID-19 ICU guidance [^113wiDYs] [^113dtsLT] [^1165Gb6U].

> But wait, what about COVID-19-associated ARDS — do we manage it differently? The prevailing consensus is to apply standard ARDS best practices, including low tidal volume and judicious use of higher PEEP in moderate-to-severe disease, with ESICM 2023 explicitly recommending the same tidal volume strategy and RAND analyses supporting adherence to existing ARDS guidelines rather than creating parallel protocols [^114HNg8G] [^112Rhmun].

> I need to check cross-cutting paradigm shifts so the synthesis reflects where the field is going: ESICM emphasizes ARDS phenotyping and treatable traits to tailor interventions, while the Lancet perspective underscores that the future lies in precision medicine; implementation science is now front-and-center in ATS, highlighting that evidence-based modalities are underused and that QI infrastructure is essential to close practice gaps [^112ebKE5] [^115vRXwx] [^112dDD7E].

> Next, I should review certainty and strength of recommendations using GRADE so the conditional nature is transparent: many 2024 ATS recommendations are conditional due to heterogeneity, limited long-term outcomes, and trade-offs (moderate certainty for steroids, low–moderate for PEEP without LRMs, low for NMBAs, moderate for VV-ECMO mortality signal), with the strongest new statement being against prolonged LRMs [^1116v4vi] [^112CEtUu].

> Let me synthesize implementation considerations pragmatically: steroids are broadly accessible but require regimen selection by etiology and vigilance for adverse effects; NMBAs necessitate sedation protocols, monitoring for weakness, and careful patient selection; VV-ECMO requires regionalization and stepwise escalation after proning; and across all domains, bedside titration based on gas exchange, hemodynamics, and patient characteristics is critical, supported by QI, benchmarking, and training [^113crMig] [^111VZ4DD] [^111PHjKp] [^113wiDYs].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure they are balanced and clinically actionable: ARDS care in 2023–2024 matures the supportive foundation — low tidal volume, prone in severe disease, conservative fluids — while adding conditional recommendations for corticosteroids, early NMBAs in severe ARDS, higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate–severe ARDS, and earlier consideration of VV-ECMO in selected patients; COVID-19 ARDS follows these same principles, and the major challenge now is precise patient selection and reliable implementation at scale [^116p3RQh] [^1116v4vi] [^111U6Xw6] [^111PHjKp] [^114HNg8G].

The latest advancements in ARDS management include **conditional use of corticosteroids** [^111U6Xw6] to reduce mortality and ventilator days [^116w6byw], **higher PEEP without prolonged recruitment maneuvers** [^11439Z94] for moderate-to-severe ARDS, and **early neuromuscular blockade** [^111VZ4DD] in severe cases [^1116v4vi]. Prone positioning remains standard for severe ARDS [^1116v4vi] [^111gnWmM], and **VV-ECMO** is recommended for selected refractory patients [^111PHjKp] [^11765EBy]. Conservative fluid management is advised [^116zGogc], and inhaled nitric oxide is not recommended [^113dtsLT] [^1165Gb6U]. Emerging areas include personalized ventilation [^115vRXwx], subphenotype-guided therapy [^113fsQWA], and novel pharmacologics [^112qpXUj].

This document updates previously published clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

- **Methods**: We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: We suggest the use of:
	1. Corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)
	2. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
	3. Neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
	4. Higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty)
	5. We recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

- **Conclusions**: We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111vePBY]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) care pathways evolve slowly as new evidence emerges. We report the sixth version of "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS", developed by a panel of experienced European neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician based on available literature up to the end of 2022. Optimizing outcomes for babies with RDS includes predicting the risk of preterm delivery, ensuring appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal center, and the appropriate and timely use of antenatal steroids. Evidence-based lung-protective management includes the initiation of non-invasive respiratory support from birth, judicious use of oxygen, early surfactant administration, caffeine therapy, and avoidance of intubation and mechanical ventilation where possible.

Methods of ongoing non-invasive respiratory support have been further refined and may help reduce chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease. However, minimizing time spent on mechanical ventilation by the targeted use of postnatal corticosteroids remains essential.

The general care of infants with RDS is also reviewed, emphasizing appropriate cardiovascular support and the judicious use of antibiotics as important determinants of the best outcome. These updated guidelines contain evidence from recent Cochrane reviews and medical literature since 2019. The strength of evidence supporting recommendations has been evaluated.

We dedicate this guideline to the memory of Professor Henry Halliday, who passed away on November 12, 2022.

### Early treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1136oW3Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury invoked by a variety of systemic or pulmonary insults. Despite medical progress in management, mortality remains between 27% and 45%. Patients with ARDS should be managed with low tidal volume ventilation. Permissive hypercapnia is well tolerated. A conservative fluid strategy can reduce ventilator and hospital days in patients without shock. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers reduce mortality in some patients. Early management of ARDS is relevant to emergency medicine. Identifying ARDS patients who should be transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center is an important task for emergency providers.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^112ebKE5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

After reviewing the results of the literature search and meta-analyses, members of each domain formulated statements (recommendations) related to each PICO/narrative question. Recommendations were based on the integration of three main criteria: (1) certainty of evidence (as provided by the methodological assessment); (2) GRADE methodology; and (3) expert opinion.

- **Proposed recommendations**: Along with corresponding summaries of evidence, were presented and discussed in four online panel-wide meetings, which included patient representatives. These meetings were recorded for members who were unable to attend and for accurate reporting of the panel discussion. Following each panel-wide meeting, recommendations were revised based on the feedback received. The finalized recommendations were then sent to each panel member for anonymous online voting.

- **Strong recommendations**: Were phrased as "recommendations", while weak recommendations were phrased as "suggestions". Approval of a recommendation required at least 80% of the panel to be in agreement. Recommendations with less than 80% agreement were reformulated and re-voted until greater than 80% approval was achieved for all.

A detailed description of the methodology is reported in the Supplementary Materials.

- **Recommendations**:
	1. Treatment of hypotension is recommended when there is evidence of poor tissue perfusion such as oliguria, acidosis, and poor capillary refill [C2]. Treatment will depend on the cause.
	2. When a decision is made to attempt pharmacologic closure of hemodynamically significant PDA, indomethacin, ibuprofen, or paracetamol can be used with similar efficacy [A2]. Paracetamol is preferred when there is thrombocytopaenia or concerns about renal function [B2].
	3. Thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in infants can be set at 12 g/dL (HCT 36%) for those with severe cardiorespiratory disease, 11 g/dL (HCT 30%) for those who are oxygen dependent, and 7 g/dL (HCT 25%) for stable infants beyond 2 weeks of age [A2].

- **Miscellaneous**:
	- Therapy-resistant severe respiratory distress due to malformations, alveolar-capillary dysplasia, damaging mutations including SP-B, ABCA3, or TTF-1, or due to extreme structural immaturity is beyond the scope of these guidelines. On the other hand, surfactant therapy is reported to be useful in other serious situations where secondary surfactant inactivation occurs such as in pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or meconium aspiration syndrome. Surfactant has also been trialed in preterm infants with evolving BPD who remain on MV at 2 weeks of age. Although there was no reduction in BPD at 36 weeks, surfactant-treated infants had fewer episodes of rehospitalization over the first year of life. Routine surfactant therapy is not recommended in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

- **Recommendations**:
	- Surfactant can be used for RDS.

Surfactant Administration Methods

Surfactant must be delivered directly to the trachea, and in most of the early trials, it was given as a bolus through an endotracheal tube, distributed by IPPV, followed by a period of weaning ventilation. The IN-SUR-E technique, involving surfactant bolus administration followed by brief bag ventilation and rapid extubation without ongoing ventilation, seemed to reduce lung injury.

- **Best method**: The accepted best method is to use a thin catheter for surfactant administration and avoid "bagging" completely, allowing the infant to maintain spontaneous breathing on CPAP while surfactant is gradually instilled in small aliquots. This method, known as less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) or minimally invasive surfactant administration, results in less need for MV and a reduction in the combined outcome of death or BPD, as well as a reduction in IVH in head-to-head comparisons with IN-SUR-E at identical treatment thresholds.

However, meta-analyses of multiple, individually small, non-blinded, underpowered studies may lead to over-estimating the benefits of LISA. The largest study (OPTIMIST) randomized 485 babies of 25–28 weeks with blinding of the intervention: LISA surfactant versus sham procedure at FiO2 threshold 30%. Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death or BPD, there was a significant reduction in BPD in survivors favoring the treated infants (37% vs. 45%). However, it is unclear if any differences can be attributed solely to the LISA method, as earlier compared to later surfactant in RDS is already known.

### Potential reevaluation needed for the meta-analysis of high-pressure recruitment maneuvers in the 2023 ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116PUmB2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) were published a year ago. We appreciate the outstanding contributions made by the experts in the guidelines. We offer the following insights regarding the prolonged high-pressure recruitment maneuvers (RMs) and brief high-pressure RMs mentioned in the guidelines.

- **Meta-analysis review**: After reviewing the meta-analysis on prolonged and brief high-pressure RMs in the supplementary materials of the guidelines, we found that according to Kacmarek et al, their article might be categorized under prolonged high-pressure RMs. Prolonged high-pressure RMs are defined as maintaining airway pressure above 35 cmH₂O for over 1 minute. However, further review of other literature and guidelines suggests that this classification may be unfounded.

- **Lack of significant distinction**: No clinical or animal studies indicate a significant difference between prolonged and brief high-pressure RMs in ARDS, especially using 1 minute as the cutoff. Strictly distinguishing them may be meaningless, as they essentially both belong to open lung ventilation (OLV). We believe it may be more reasonable to consider them collectively when analyzing the impact of OLV on ARDS patients.

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement). As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, patient preferences and values, resource use, implications for health equity, acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders, and clinical feasibility.

Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions. For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient, and no recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional" and was presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: Definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^112MrF8X]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, specifically concerning mechanical ventilation and PEEP targets, the ESICM 2023 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against routine PEEP titration with a higher PEEP/FiO2 strategy versus a lower PEEP/FiO2 strategy to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS, including those with conditions related to COVID-19.

VV-ECMO facilitates oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal in patients with ARDS by draining blood from the venous system, allowing it to pass through a gas-exchange device, and then returning it to the venous system. It is an invasive, resource-intensive technology available at specialized centers that incurs significant cost and requires a considerable amount of human health resources. The use of VV-ECMO has increased substantially during the past several years, with notable increases seen after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and subsequently during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 ATS guidelines addressed VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS but found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for, or against its use. Since that time, a multicenter RCT evaluating the effect of early initiation of VV-ECMO on patients with severe ARDS was published, prompting an updated recommendation.

- **Evidence summary**: VV-ECMO was evaluated in two RCTs that included 429 patients. In the first trial, 180 patients were randomized to conventional ARDS management or referral for consideration of VV-ECMO, with follow-up at 6 months; a specific management protocol was not mandated in the control arm. In the second trial, 249 patients were randomized to VV-ECMO or conventional management and followed for 60 days. Ventilator management was protocolized in the control arm, and the use of neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning was encouraged. Pooled analysis demonstrated that VV-ECMO probably decreased mortality at the latest follow-up (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; moderate certainty).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115yNSow]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

- **Recommendations**:

	1. CPAP or (s)NIPPV should be started from birth in all babies at risk of RDS, such as those < 30 weeks of gestation who do not need intubation for stabilization (A1).

	2. NIV with early rescue surfactant by LISA technique is considered optimal management for babies with RDS (A1).

	3. The system delivering CPAP is of little importance; however, the interface should be short binasal prongs or mask with a starting pressure of about 6–8 cm H2O (A2). The ability to escalate to NIPPV will reduce the need for invasive MV in some infants (A1).

	4. BIPAP devices confer no advantage over CPAP alone (A2). However, synchronized NIPPV, if delivered through a ventilator, can reduce the need for ventilation or re-ventilation following extubation and may reduce BPD (A2).

	5. HFNC can be used as an alternative to CPAP for some babies, with the advantage of less nasal trauma, provided centers have access to CPAP or NIPPV for those failing this mode (B2).

- **MV strategies**:

	Despite best efforts to maintain as many preterm babies as possible on NIV, around half of babies < 28 weeks will require MV, and those that do have worse outcomes. In addition, around half of infants < 28 weeks will also fail their first attempt at extubation, and they too have worse outcomes. It is important that those managing infants with RDS understand the principles of MV to minimize the risk of iatrogenic lung injury. The aim of MV is to provide "acceptable" blood gases by ventilating at optimal lung volumes (open lung concept) while avoiding over-distension and atelectasis. Pulmonary over-distension in…

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American thoracic society clinical practice guideline [^11439Z94]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Justification and implementation considerations**: Although higher PEEP was consistently associated with lower mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the panel issued a conditional recommendation because of a high level of heterogeneity among higher PEEP strategies in the included RCTs. For patients with mild ARDS, there were insufficient data to make a recommendation on the PEEP strategy because these patients were excluded from the network meta-analysis, but there appears to be no benefit of high PEEP versus low PEEP, and there is a potential trend toward harm.

With regard to prolonged LRMs, the panel issued a strong recommendation against their use in combination with high PEEP strategies based on the network meta-analysis demonstrating a high posterior probability of harm, presumably due to serious adverse hemodynamic effects. Although shorter LRMs may be better tolerated, we do not know the safe upper limit for LRM pressure or duration, which may vary between individual patients. Finally, there was a lack of consensus among the panel on brief LRMs and the use of esophageal pressures to set PEEP as a result of high levels of uncertainty of the true effect of these strategies.

A reasonable implementation approach for patients with moderate to severe ARDS would be to use a higher PEEP strategy previously implemented in the RCTs included in the aforementioned meta-analyses. Techniques that have been described included oxygenation-based titration (i.e. using a PEEP/FO2 table), increasing PEEP to a maximal safe plateau pressure, and titration to maximal…

### Official ERS/ATS clinical practice guidelines: Noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure [^1178GF6h]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to noninvasive ventilation, the ERS 2017 guidelines suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend noninvasive ventilation for de novo acute respiratory failure, including instances due to pandemic viral illness.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome - 2016 update [^116jNFtu]. Neonatology (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ensure that clinicians must continue to revise practice. We report the third update of the European guidelines for the management of RDS by a European panel of expert neonatologists, including input from an expert perinatal obstetrician, based on available literature up to the beginning of 2016. Optimizing the outcome for babies with RDS includes the consideration of when to use antenatal steroids. Good obstetric practice involves methods of predicting the risk of preterm delivery and consideration of whether transfer to a perinatal center is necessary and safe.

Methods for optimal delivery room management have become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection, including the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure and titration of oxygen, should be implemented soon after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of the management of RDS, and newer protocols for surfactant administration are aimed at avoiding exposure to mechanical ventilation. There is more evidence of differences among various surfactants in clinical use.

Newer methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been developed and offer potential for greater comfort and less chronic lung disease. As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease. Minimizing the time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^113crMig]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

- **Implementation considerations**: There are several factors to consider for implementation. Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials might be considered.

Regarding medical management for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically concerning initial stabilization, the ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend using a blender to control oxygen for resuscitation. An initial FiO2 of 0.30 should be used for infants achieving a heart rate of 100/min within 5 minutes.

### Current and evolving standards of care for patients with ARDS [^112qpXUj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has changed considerably over the 50 years since its original description. Indeed, standards of care continue to evolve, as does how this clinical entity is defined and how patients are grouped and treated in clinical practice. In this narrative review, we discuss standards: treatments that have a solid evidence base and are well established as targets for usual care, and also evolving standards: treatments that have promise and may become widely adopted in the future.

We focus on three broad domains:

- **Ventilatory management**: Standards in this area include limitation of tidal volume and airway pressure, and standard approaches to setting PEEP, while evolving standards might focus on limitation of driving pressure or mechanical power, individual titration of PEEP, and monitoring efforts during spontaneous breathing.

- **Ventilation adjuncts**: Standards include prone positioning in moderate-severe ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal life support after prone positioning in patients with severe hypoxemia or who are difficult to ventilate.

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Standards include corticosteroids for patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and employing a conservative fluid strategy for patients not in shock. Evolving standards may include steroids for ARDS not related to COVID-19, or specific biological agents being tested in appropriate sub-phenotypes of ARDS.

While much progress has been made, significant work certainly remains to be done.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114LTwuy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The update was proposed by the chairs (E.F. and A.W.) and co-chairs (L.M. N.Q. S.S., and C.S.) to the ATS Critical Care Assembly and was approved by the ATS Board of Directors. The chairs and co-chairs identified a diverse group of panelists with expertise in ARDS epidemiology, clinical trials, methodology, pharmacology, and physiology. Four groups were formed to address individual interventions, each led by a co-chair with an assigned methodologist with expertise in Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Panel members were assigned to groups based on their expressed interest and expertise. All guideline meetings were held via video conference.

- **Conflict of interest policy**: All committee members disclosed potential conflicts of interest and financial relationships in accordance with ATS policy. New or updated conflicts of interest were solicited annually by the chair (E.F.).

- **Formulating clinical questions**: The panel co-chairs developed an initial set of four PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome) questions centered around ARDS management that were not addressed in the initial guideline (corticosteroids, NMBAs) or for which substantial and potentially practice-changing new evidence had emerged since the last iteration (VV-ECMO, PEEP, LRMs). Each question was assigned to a subcommittee. Subcommittee members finalized the specific elements of the four questions after detailed discussion and consideration of importance, availability of evidence, and perceived patient preferences.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115SyK9u]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

- **When to treat with surfactant**: If intubation is deemed necessary as part of stabilization for preterm infants, then surfactant should be given to promote early extubation. Most preterm infants will transition successfully on CPAP, but those with RDS will develop progressively worsening lung disease. This clinically presents as increased work of breathing, sternal recession, and increasing oxygen requirements to maintain normal saturations.

	- Following the natural course of RDS, spontaneous recovery usually begins after 48–72 hours. Infants with milder disease may manage without surfactant, thereby avoiding the discomfort of laryngoscopy and potential deleterious effects of intubation. Early trials showed that surfactant given earlier in the course of the disease works better than later in terms of reducing air leaks in babies ventilated for RDS and avoiding MV if the IN-SUR-E technique is used.

	- This creates a dilemma for neonatologists, as at present, RDS severity is determined clinically. This determination uses a combination of FiO₂ requirements, judgment of work of breathing, and other signs of respiratory distress alongside the degree of lung aeration on chest radiograph (or ultrasound), all of which can be influenced by CPAP. Ideally, predicting surfactant deficiency before the infant has deteriorated would enable earlier surfactant therapy of infants on CPAP and is likely to result in a lessened need for MV and improved outcomes. Our previous recommendation to use FiO₂ > 0.30 as the threshold for surfactant treatment was based on observations of CPAP failure rates according to early pos.

### An official American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: Mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116p3RQh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the use of mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: For all patients with ARDS, the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (high confidence in effect estimates) and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure (moderate confidence in effect estimates) and recruitment maneuvers (low confidence in effect estimates). Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for, or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected ventilatory interventions for adult patients with ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations.

### What is the legacy of the National Institutes of Health Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network [^112EN9eX]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

It has been almost 15 years since the National Institutes of Health created the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Trials Network (ARDS Network) and nearly a decade since the completion of the landmark low-tidal volume (V(T)) trial. In retrospect, the ARDS Network had a profound impact on the design and conduct of clinical trials in critical care. It represented the first time the federal government funded a clinical trials network devoted to Phase-III testing of important, non-pharmacologic therapies. The ARDS Network also introduced factorial design into critical-care research, which allowed Phase-II testing of promising therapies. Other important contributions from the ARDS Network may not become apparent for many years. These include the ongoing mentoring of a new generation of critical-care researchers, as well as continued testing on an enormous store of biological samples that inevitably will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS. Perhaps someday, this may lead to another therapeutic breakthrough.

Part of the ARDS Network's legacy surely will have been the opening of a dialogue regarding the design of clinical trials in critical care, as well as a concerted effort to improve the protection of subjects enrolled in those trials. Finally, the respiratory care profession itself has benefited, owing both to its critical role in the successful implementation of complicated therapist-driven protocols and to the ARDS Network's novel practice of utilizing respiratory therapists as clinical coordinators.

### Nonventilatory treatments for acute lung injury and ARDS [^114hxYYb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, advances in the ventilatory management of acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS have improved outcomes; however, until recently, the search for other therapies has been less fruitful. Recently, the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial reported that a conservative fluid management strategy, compared to a fluid liberal strategy, increased the mean (± SE) number of ventilator-free days in patients with ALI (14.6 ± 0.5 vs. 12.1 ± 0.5 days, respectively; p < 0.001). In addition to this beneficial effect on outcomes, the study found that the conservative fluid strategy did not increase the incidence of renal failure or the development of shock.

Other studies have demonstrated that albumin and furosemide therapy may be beneficial in hypoproteinemic patients with lung injury, though data on outcomes is still lacking. Although several pharmacologic therapies, such as corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide, have been demonstrated to be ineffective in improving outcomes, several promising new treatments are being investigated in ongoing or upcoming clinical trials. This article reviews these developments and other recent research on the optimal nonventilatory management of patients with ALI.

### Ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome: A consensus of two [^114FjMdE]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this work is to synthesize the emerging body of experimental, observational, and clinical trial data into a practical guideline for safe and effective ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

- **Data sources**: Relevant, peer-reviewed scientific literature and personal observations from clinical practice.

- **Study selection**: Relevant experimental studies and high-impact observational and clinical trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome management.

- **Data extraction**: Detailed review of information contained in published scientific work.

- **Data synthesis**: Interactive discussions between the authors that culminated in our consensus view of appropriate management.

Prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury while accomplishing the essential life-supporting roles of mechanical ventilation is a complex undertaking that requires the application of principles founded on a broad experimental and clinical database and on the results of well-executed clinical trials. At the bedside, execution of an effective lung-protective ventilation strategy remains an empirical process best guided by integrated physiology and a readiness to revise the management approach depending on the individual's response.

### Covid-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: Is a different approach to management warranted [^1142FyTw]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units across the globe. As experience in managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimizing ventilatory management. Personalized lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112dDD7E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS.

Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes.

To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1165S9xh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to 10% of patients with respiratory failure admitted through the emergency department. The use of noninvasive respiratory support has proliferated in recent years; clinicians must understand the relative merits and risks of these technologies and know how to recognize signs of failure. The cornerstone of ARDS care for mechanically ventilated patients is low-tidal volume ventilation based on ideal body weight. Adjunctive therapies, such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may have a role in the emergency department management of ARDS, depending on patient and department characteristics.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^116ZBDsA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **PEEP and recruitment maneuvers**: In patients with ARDS undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, does routine PEEP titration using a higher PEEP/FiO2 strategy compared to a lower PEEP/FiO2 strategy reduce mortality?

In patients with ARDS, surfactant dysfunction, effects of gravity on the edematous lung, and heterogeneous injury predispose to regional lung derecruitment with alveolar collapse and small airways closure. The resulting mechanical heterogeneity of the lung, with regional differences in alveolar compliance and distension, is thought to be an important driver of ventilation-induced lung injury in ARDS. Positive end-expiratory pressure may offset these forces, promoting lung recruitment and attenuating mechanical heterogeneity. PEEP is also routinely applied to facilitate adequate oxygenation. Yet, excessive PEEP can exacerbate over-distension, potentially predisposing to hyperinflation lung injury and hemodynamic compromise. The following analyses evaluate randomized clinical trials for effects of various PEEP strategies on mortality, ventilator-free days, barotrauma, and hemodynamic compromise.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115q8p1p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

This guideline updates and adds to recommendations for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). New recommendations in this guideline include:

- **Corticosteroids**: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

- **Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)**: We suggest using VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

- **Neuromuscular blockers**: We suggest using neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

- **Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**:
	- We suggest using higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty).
	- We recommend against using prolonged LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Recommendations from the 2017 guideline that remain in place include additional practices as per the American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of ARDS.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^115YqN98]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of these guidelines is to update the 2017 clinical practice guideline (CPG) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). The scope of this CPG is limited to adult patients and to non-pharmacological respiratory support strategies across different aspects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including ARDS due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines were formulated by an international panel of clinical experts, one methodologist, and patients' representatives on behalf of the ESICM. The review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement recommendations. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade recommendations, as well as the quality of reporting of each study based on the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) network guidelines.

- **Questions and recommendations**: The CPG addressed 21 questions and formulates 21 recommendations on the following domains:
	1. Definition
	2. Phenotyping, and respiratory support strategies including:
		- High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNO)
		- Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
		- Tidal volume setting
		- Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers (RM)
		- Prone positioning
		- Neuromuscular blockade
		- Extracorporeal life support (ECLS)

In addition, the CPG includes expert opinion on clinical practice and identifies areas for future research.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^113oAzaz]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, particularly concerning surfactant therapy, the ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend administering rescue surfactant early in the course of the disease. Surfactant should be administered to infants with worsening respiratory distress syndrome who have FiO2 requirements greater than 0.30 on CPAP ≥ 6 cmH₂O, or if lung ultrasound suggests a need for surfactant.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113wiDYs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The evidence base for supportive modalities for ARDS continues to evolve. As part of this guideline, we provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. Implementation of these recommendations should take into account individual patient and illness characteristics. These guidelines update and build on those developed in 2017 and will be revisited as new information is available.

- **ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee**: The committee reviewed the guideline and determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable for performance measure development. However, two recommendations that remain in place from the 2017 guidelines are suitable for performance measure development: 1) the use of mechanical ventilation strategies that limit tidal volume (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) and 2) prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day in patients with severe ARDS.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome subphenotypes respond differently to randomized fluid management strategy [^1175MqSJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We previously identified two acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) subphenotypes in two separate randomized controlled trials with differential responses to positive end-expiratory pressure.

- **Objectives**: To identify these subphenotypes in a third ARDS cohort, to test whether subphenotypes respond differently to fluid management strategy, and to develop a practical model for subphenotype identification.

- **Methods**: We used latent class analysis of baseline clinical and plasma biomarker data to identify subphenotypes in FACTT (Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial; n = 1,000). Logistic regression was used to test for an interaction between subphenotype and treatment for mortality. We employed stepwise modeling to generate a model for subphenotype identification in FACTT and validated its accuracy in the two cohorts where we previously identified ARDS subphenotypes.

- **Measurements and main results**: We confirmed that a two-class (two-subphenotype) model best described the study population. Subphenotype 2 was characterized by higher inflammatory biomarkers and hypotension. Fluid management strategy had significantly different effects on 90-day mortality in the two subphenotypes (P = 0.0039 for interaction); mortality in subphenotype 1 was 26% with a fluid-liberal strategy versus 18% with a fluid-conservative approach, whereas mortality in subphenotype 2 was 40% with a fluid-liberal strategy versus 50% in fluid-conservative. A three-variable model of IL-8, bicarbonate, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 accurately classified the subphenotypes.

### Rand appropriateness panel to determine the applicability of UK guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [^112Rhmun]. Thorax (2022). Low credibility.

COVID-19 has become the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) worldwide. Features of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation partially distinguish it from 'classical' ARDS. A Research and Development (RAND) analysis gauged the opinion of an expert panel about the management of ARDS with and without COVID-19 as the precipitating cause, using recent UK guidelines as a template.

- **Methods**: An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1–9 (where 1–3 is inappropriate, 4–6 is uncertain, and 7–9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymized results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7), and anticoagulation (7), was completed again.

- **Results**: Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: Diagnosis, outcomes, long-term sequelae, and management [^115vRXwx]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this series paper, the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition, along with evidence that could inform future revisions, are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome - 2019 update [^1129Diws]. Neonatology (2019). Low credibility.

As management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) advances, clinicians must continually revise their practice. We report the fourth update of the "European Guidelines for the Management of RDS" by a European panel of experienced neonatologists and an expert perinatal obstetrician, based on available literature up to the end of 2018. Optimizing outcomes for babies with RDS includes predicting the risk of preterm delivery, ensuring appropriate maternal transfer to a perinatal center, and timely use of antenatal steroids.

Delivery room management has become more evidence-based, and protocols for lung protection, including the initiation of CPAP and titration of oxygen, should be implemented immediately after birth. Surfactant replacement therapy is a crucial part of RDS management, with newer protocols recommending early administration and avoidance of mechanical ventilation. Methods of maintaining babies on non-invasive respiratory support have been further developed, potentially reducing distress and chronic lung disease.

As technology for delivering mechanical ventilation improves, the risk of causing lung injury should decrease. However, minimizing time spent on mechanical ventilation using caffeine and, if necessary, postnatal steroids are also important considerations. Protocols for optimizing the general care of infants with RDS are essential. Good temperature control, careful fluid and nutritional management, maintenance of perfusion, and judicious use of antibiotics are all important determinants of the best outcomes.

### Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: Which management [^112WeLYB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increases in lung edema, which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stays, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings.

Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge, or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e. early vs. late period).

The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient, hence respiratory detrimental, fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111PCbCH]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Survival of preterm infants continues to improve, with those at 22–23 weeks of gestation now having reasonable chances of making it home to their families. There is a growing trend towards offering initial life support to infants born at lower perceived levels of viability, which in some countries is now defined as low as 22 weeks of gestation. However, we caution that recommendations given in these guidelines are based on evidence from studies, which almost without exception, have been generated in times where the resuscitation of the most preterm infants was not often attempted, and until very recently, infants of the lowest gestations were not included in clinical trials. We therefore recommend caution when applying recommendations to the most preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Until more evidence is available, these guidelines apply mainly to the management of RDS in infants with gestational ages of greater than 24 weeks. Managing RDS remains a key component of neonatal intensive care. European data from 2014 to 2016 show that around 50% of all babies born between 22 +0 and 32 +6 weeks receive surfactant; therefore, relevant skills for surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain important.

RDS is caused by pulmonary immaturity and surfactant deficiency, resulting in respiratory insufficiency from soon after birth. There is now less emphasis on radiographic diagnosis and grading of RDS, such as "ground glass with air bronchograms". Definitions based on blood gas analyses are also redundant, as management has.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111VZ4DD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) was evaluated in seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,598 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that NMBAs may decrease mortality for patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with those who did not receive NMBAs (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98), although the certainty of this evidence is considered low due to concerns about inconsistency and individual study bias.

- **Subgroup analyses**: These analyses demonstrated a reduction in mortality for patients receiving NMBAs compared with deep sedation (n = 3 studies, 431 patients; RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.91). This effect was not observed in the single RCT that compared NMBAs with light sedation (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15).

- **Barotrauma and ventilator-free days**: The use of NMBAs was probably associated with a reduced incidence of barotrauma (n = 4 studies, 1,437 patients; RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85; moderate certainty) and a possible increase in ventilator-free days (n = 5 studies; MD, 0.89 days more; 95% CI, 0.38 fewer to 2.18 more; low certainty).

- **ICU-acquired weakness**: However, NMBA use also probably increased the rates of ICU-acquired weakness (n = 4 studies, 885 patients; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98–1.37; moderate certainty).

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112P29t6]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

The understanding of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has evolved greatly since it was first described in a 1967 case series, with several subsequent updates to the definition of the syndrome. Advances in basic science and clinical trials have provided insight into the mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS and have led to reduced mortality through comprehensive critical care interventions. This review summarizes the understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of ARDS. Key highlights include a recommended new global definition of ARDS and updated guidelines for managing ARDS, with a foundation of established interventions such as low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a conservative fluid strategy. Future priorities for investigation of ARDS are also highlighted.

Does it matter that ARDS exists in resource-constrained settings but is rarely recognized? Yes, it matters because recognition is necessary to improve outcomes. Recognition allows for the implementation of interventions that are clearly feasible in resource-constrained settings, such as conservative fluid management for both prevention and supportive care.

Recognition also facilitates research into the risks and benefits of applying interventions that are known to be effective in resource-rich settings but could be less safe in settings with fewer trained staff. For example, proning for severe ARDS is theoretically possible since it requires no particular technology; however, the ability to perform it safely with limited staff may be a barrier. A trial in Bangladesh found possible harm from early enteral feeding in cerebral malaria, exemplifying the need to test interventions in both resource-rich and resource-constrained environments, where the risks and benefits may differ significantly.

Finally, recognition allows research into ARDS triggers and lung injury pathways that may differ across various contexts and populations. ARDS associated with malaria, HIV, or tuberculosis in Africa may involve different molecular pathways compared to ARDS associated with community-acquired pneumonia in Europe. Just as research in sepsis requires pursuing targeted molecular therapies that include resource-limited settings, the heterogeneity of ARDS triggers and presentations underscores the need for trials in settings beyond resource-rich contexts.

Recommendations for specific treatment questions

- **Should patients with ARDS receive systemic corticosteroids?** We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

	- **Background**: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators present in ARDS. They are widely administered to patients with ARDS specifically for conditions such as septic shock or pneumonia. More recently, corticosteroids have been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, several multicenter RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with ARDS have been published, prompting a recommendation for this intervention.

	- **Evidence summary**: Corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 9 studies; mean difference [MD], 4 days less; 95% CI, −5.5 to −2.5; low certainty) and the length of hospital stay (n = 4 studies; MD, 8 days shorter; 95% CI, −13 to −3; low certainty), although the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain (n = 4 studies; MD, 0.8 days shorter; 95% CI, −4.1 to +5.7; very low certainty).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111FeznM]. Neonatology (2023). High credibility.

Modern ventilators are equipped with flow sensors that measure the volume of gas entering and leaving the endotracheal tube to help synchronize mechanical ventilation (MV) with the infant's own breathing efforts. These sensors may be used to limit the support provided and prevent lung over-distension. Volume-targeted ventilation (VTV) allows real-time weaning of pressure as lung compliance improves, resulting in less time on ventilation, fewer air leaks, and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

Setting an initial tidal volume of around 5 mL/kg with a maximum peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at a safe level, around 25–30 cm H2O, is usually straightforward. Adjustments in initial tidal volumes should be made according to the judgment of work of breathing and blood gas assessment, but may fail if the endotracheal tube leak is high. Adjusting positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain an open lung is judged by finding a point where fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is at its lowest with hemodynamic stability and acceptable blood gases.

Required tidal volumes typically vary around 5–7 mL/kg, with the range tending to increase with increasing postnatal age. Ventilation modes supporting every spontaneous breath, rather than synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), are preferred. However, if volume targeting is not possible, it may be safer to use synchronized IMV where the ventilation rate is clinician-controlled. Volume targeting can reduce hypocarbia even in the smallest infants.

Supporting the infants' own respiratory efforts with modes where both inspiration and expiration are synchronized, such as pressure support or neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), can improve patient comfort and facilitate weaning. However, as of the time of writing, no differences have been shown in longer-term clinical outcomes. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is another ventilation strategy.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning mechanical ventilation, the SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering a higher PEEP strategy over a lower PEEP strategy in mechanically ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe ARDS. It is important to monitor patients for barotrauma if using a higher PEEP strategy (> 10 cmH₂O).

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111tfpLK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although the largest and most recent RCT comparing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) versus a strategy targeting light sedation did not demonstrate a mortality benefit, pooled data from seven RCTs indicated a possible reduction in mortality and an increase in ventilator-free days, prompting the recommendation in favor of NMBA use. Nevertheless, several concerns led to a conditional recommendation, and there are several caveats to consider before using NMBAs.

First, due to the use of variable sedation strategies in different RCTs, the certainty of evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias and inconsistency. Additionally, a reduction in mortality was observed only when NMBAs were compared with deep sedation, whereas clinical practice guidelines recommend using lighter rather than deeper sedation targets. The panel identified ongoing uncertainty surrounding the harms of the concomitant sedation required with NMBA and discussed qualifying the recommendation to apply to patients who were already deeply sedated yet experiencing ventilator dyssynchrony. However, this approach was abandoned because clear thresholds for the degree of dyssynchrony and sedation depth at which to implement this recommendation could not be identified. Finally, concerns were raised regarding the potential increased risk for ICU-acquired weakness and the lack of data addressing long-term outcomes.

### Designing an ARDS trial for 2020 and beyond: Focus on enrichment strategies [^113fsQWA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

With the exception of a few successes in trials of supportive care, the majority of interventional clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have not led to new therapies. To improve the likelihood of benefit from clinical trial interventions in ARDS, clinical trial design must be improved. To optimize trial design, many factors need to be considered, including the type of therapy to be tested, the type of trial (phase 2 or 3), how patients will be selected, primary and secondary endpoints, and the strategy for the conduct of the trial, including potential newer trial designs such as platform or adaptive trials. Of these, optimization of patient selection is central to the likelihood of success and is particularly relevant in ARDS, which is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, not a homogeneous disease.

Recent advances, including an improved understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms and better tools for outcome prediction in ARDS, should facilitate both predictive and prognostic enrichment. This commentary focuses on new information and novel methods for prognostic and predictive enrichment that may be useful to optimize patient selection and increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials in ARDS.

### Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [^113b6L3C]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown. Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.

The need for ECMO is relatively low, and its use is mostly restricted to specialized centers globally. Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases presents unique challenges.

- **Careful planning**: Judicious resource allocation and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.

ECMO can be initiated in specialist centers, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a center that is not specialized for this procedure to an expert ECMO center. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access. ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113uMcQN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Our recommendations are largely consistent with recent guidelines published by the ESICM, although differences in methodology and the specific elements of clinical questions addressed account for some areas of divergence. With regard to PEEP, the ESICM guideline makes no recommendation for, or against the routine use of higher versus lower PEEP strategies in ARDS, whereas we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients. However, it is important to note that our recommendation is narrower with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers). Recommendations on NMBAs are also notably different: the ESICM guideline recommends against routine NMBA use in moderate to severe ARDS, whereas we suggest its use in early severe ARDS. This contrast reflects differences in studies and outcomes included in the evidence syntheses and, as with PEEP, our recommendations focus on a more limited patient population (severe ARDS only) and more specific intervention (early use of NMBAs).

### European consensus guidelines on the management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants — 2013 update [^111MKKNm]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the perinatal management of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), controversies still exist. We report updated recommendations of a European panel of expert neonatologists who developed consensus guidelines following a critical examination of the most up-to-date evidence in 2007 and 2010. This second update of the guidelines is based upon published evidence up to the end of 2012.

Strong evidence exists for the role of antenatal steroids in RDS prevention, but it is still not clear if the benefits of repeated courses on respiratory outcomes outweigh the risks of adverse outcomes in the short and long term. Many practices involved in preterm neonatal stabilization at birth are not evidence-based, including oxygen administration and positive pressure lung inflation, and may at times be harmful.

Surfactant replacement therapy is crucial in the management of RDS; however, the best preparation, optimal dose, and timing of administration at different gestations are not completely clear. Additionally, the use of very early continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has altered the indications for prophylactic surfactant administration. Respiratory support in the form of mechanical ventilation may be lifesaving but can cause lung injury. Protocols should be directed at avoiding mechanical ventilation where possible by using non-invasive respiratory support such as CPAP.

For babies with RDS to have the best outcomes, it is essential that they receive optimal supportive care, including maintenance of normal body temperature, proper fluid management, and good nutrition.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^114NVMYF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In the critically ill with COVID-19, the most common reason for ICU admission is ARDS. The relevant therapies for COVID-19 ARDS are supportive ARDS care; anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating, and antiviral therapies; and therapies targeting extrapulmonary complications.

Early in the pandemic, two controversies raged about the treatment of patients with COVID-19 ARDS:

- **Use of HFNC or NIV vs. IMV**: One question was whether to use a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when indicated or to immediately initiate invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The avoidance of HFNC use and NIV was based on a combination of fear of infection in healthcare workers because of aerosol generation and concern that patients may decompensate quickly and require emergent intubation, creating a situation in which healthcare team members lacked time to don adequate personal protective equipment (PPE).

- **Potential risk of viral dissemination associated with extracorporeal organ support**: The significant need for intensive care in severe COVID-19 prompted further investigation into these risks, including continuous renal replacement therapy and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Reassuringly, viral RNA was not detectable in the dialysis fluid of patients on continuous renal replacement therapy, even if their plasma was positive for viral RNA; in patients receiving ECMO, viral RNA was not even detectable in the gas condensate of the membrane oxygenator.

As clinical experience and data emerged, HFNC use became standard practice, as at least half of patients needing an HFNC do not progress to intubation.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112M1ecQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

There are several unanswered questions about neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although their presumed mechanism of action is through the reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing ventilator dyssynchrony, it remains unknown whether NMBAs might also benefit sedated patients who are already fully passively ventilated. It is unclear if there is a dose–response relationship across the spectrum of passive breathing to strong or dyssynchronous efforts. Some level of spontaneous breathing may be important to prevent diaphragmatic atrophy, whereas too much respiratory effort may cause lung and diaphragm injury; accordingly, NMBAs may have a variable impact on patients. Further research efforts should also focus on answering questions about NMBA agent selection, as well as the impact of the timing of initiation (i.e. early vs. late, immediately after meeting criteria vs. following a period of stabilization), dosing (i.e. partial blockade vs. full blockade, intermittent vs. continuous dosing), and duration. Finally, longitudinal data are needed to understand the impact of NMBAs on long-term outcomes.

- **Recommendation**: We suggest using higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) without lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low-moderate certainty). We recommend against using prolonged (PEEP ⩾35 cm H₂O for > 60 s) LRMs in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).
